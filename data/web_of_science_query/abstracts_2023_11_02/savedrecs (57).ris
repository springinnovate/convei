TI  - Characterization of the development stages and roles of nutrients and other environmental factors in green tides in the Southern Yellow Sea, China
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale floating green tides in the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) caused by the macroalgal species Ulva prolifera have been recurring for 13 years and have become one of the greatest marine ecological disasters in the world. In this study, we attempt to explore the development pattern of green tides and find its key environmental influencing factors. The satellite remote sensing data of the development process of green tides fit the logistic growth curve (R-2 = 0.93, P < 0.01) well, showing three distinct growth phases (lag, exponential growth, and short plateau phases). Correspondingly, the green tide-drifting area from the coast of Jiangsu to the nearshore waters of the Shandong Peninsula was divided into three sections: the lag phase zone (A), the exponential growth phase zone (B), and the plateau phase zone (C). Zone A in the south of Jiangsu coastal waters had abundant inorganic nutrients that were indispensable to the green tide initiation. Zone B was mainly located out of Haizhou Bay, south of 34.5 degrees N and north of 35.5 degrees N, where approximately 80% of the green tide biomass was generated. The rich bioavailable nutrient sources, suitable temperature, and irradiance in this area were the main promotion factors for the rapid growth and scale expansion of green tides. Wet precipitation in zone B in May and June also played an important role in the final scale of green tides. Zone C had poor nutrients, increasing temperature, and irradiance (high transparency), which limited the continued expansion of green tides, and organic nutrients might be an important support to green tides development in this region. The study based on the growth phases of green tides could help us further understand the eutrophication mechanism in the green tide outbreaks in SYS.

TI  - Accessing the temporal and spectral features in crop type mapping using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery: A case study of Yi'an County, Heilongjiang province, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping visualizes the spatial distribution patterns and proportions of the cultivated areas with different crop types, and is the basis for subsequent agricultural applications. Understanding the effectiveness of different temporal and spectral features in detailed crop classification can help users optimize temporal window selection and spectral feature space construction in crop type mapping applications. Therefore, in this study, we used time-series Sentinel-2 image data from Yi'an County, Heilongjiang province, China, to analyze the effectiveness of the temporal and spectral features used in three common machine learning classification methods: classification and regression tree (CART) decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). For CART and SVM classifiers, the relative importance of the features was reflected by the order and frequency of attributes selected as the node and the square of the model weight. In RF, the change in prediction error as calculated by out of bag data is taken as the measure of feature importance. The standard deviation of the average value of all labeled pixels was used to evaluate the correctness of the unanimous conclusions drawn by these three methodologies. The quantitative evaluation results given by the confusion matrix show that random forest achieved the best overall accuracy, while support vector machine ranked second, and the decision tree algorithm yielded the least accurate classification results. From the perspective of feature importance, making full use of the discriminative information between different crops, and constructing a rational feature space, can help to improve classification accuracy significantly. In detail, the discriminative information between the different crop types is as follows: 1) images at the peak of the crop growth period are crucial in the classification of different crops; 2) the short-wave infrared bands are particularly suitable for fine crop classification; and 3) the red edge bands can effectively assist classification. Finally, our study achieved crop type mapping in the study area with an overall accuracy of 97.85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.95.

TI  - Radiation and aerosol measurements over the Tibetan Plateau during the Asian summer monsoon period
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation and aerosols are essential to climate change but are not well reported or understood over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to the scarcity of observational data from this unique geographical location. This study analyzed the characteristics of radiation and aerosols and evaluated satellite products over the TP by using ground-based measurements from an atmospheric campaign at Qaidam during the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) period in 2019. Clouds decreased the surface downward solar irradiance (SSI) by a maximum of 295.8 W m(-2) at 14:00 and increased the downward longwave radiation by 47.6 W m(-2) at 7:00 when the lowest surface temperature (6.1 degrees C) occurred. The surface albedo was approximately 0.25 at Qaidam. The accuracies of the surface SSI products from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager onboard the Fengyun-4 satellite and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite were better under clear-sky conditions than cloudy conditions. The AHI tended to systematically overestimate surface UV radiation relative to ground-based measurements. The aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD440) was < 0.20 in most cases. A decreasing pattern of single scattering albedo with increasing wavelengths was revealed at Qaidam, which was 0.87 +/- 0.04, 0.81 +/- 0.07, 0.77 +/- 0.09 and 0.76 +/- 0.11 at 440, 675, 870 and 1020 nm, respectively. The average instantaneous aerosol direct radiative forcing at the bottom of the atmosphere was - 41.6 +/- 16.8 W m(-2). A dust event with an AOD440 of 1.20 was recorded and analyzed with the aid of satellite aerosol measurements and backward-trajectory analysis.

TI  - The changing PM2.5 dynamics of global megacities based on long-term remotely sensed observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show that the rapid urbanization and emergence of megacities with 10 million or more residents have raised PM2.5 concentrations across the globe during the past few decades. This study examines PM2.5 dynamics for the 33 cities included on the UN list of megacities published in 2018. These megacities were classified into densely (> 1500 residents per km(2)), moderately (300-1500 residents per km(2)) and sparsely (< 300 residents per km(2)) populated areas to examine the effect of human population density on PM2.5 concentrations in these areas during the period 1998-2016. We found that: (1) the higher population density areas experienced higher PM2.5 concentrations; and (2) the megacities with high PM2.5 concentrations in these areas had higher concentrations than those in the moderately and sparsely populated areas of other megacities as well. The numbers of residents experiencing poor air quality is substantial: approximately 452 and 163 million experienced average annual PM2.5 levels exceeding 10 and 35 mu g/m(3), respectively in 2016. We also examined PM2.5 trends during the past 18 years and predict that high PM2.5 levels will likely continue in many of these megacities in the future without substantial changes in their economies and/or pollution abatement practices. There will be more megacities in the highest PM2.5 pollution class and the number of megacities in the lowest PM2.5 pollution class will likely not change. Finally, we analyzed how the PM2.5 pollution burden varies geographically and ranked the 33 megacities in terms of PM2.5 pollution in 2016. The most polluted regions are China, India, and South Asia and the least polluted regions are Europe and Japan. None of the 33 megacities currently fall in the WHO's PM2.5 attainment class (< 10 mu g/m(3)) while 9 megacities fall into the PM2.5 non-attainment class (> 35 mu g/m(3)). In 2016, the least polluted megacity was New York and most polluted megacity was Delhi whose average annual PM2.5 concentration of 110 mu g/m(3) is nearly three times the WHO's non-attainment threshold.

TI  - Attenuation of UVR and PAR in a clear and deep lake: Spatial distribution and affecting factors
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Light attenuation is considered as a sentinel for environmental change in lakes and has a profound influence on aquatic ecosystems. However, the spatial distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) attenuation, and the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. We carried out a field investigation with 60 sampling sites covering the entire Lake Qiandaohu from November 29 to December 1, 2013, during the weak stratification period to elucidate the spatial pattern and driving mechanisms. The diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVB (K d (313)), UVA (K-d(340)) and PAR (K-d(PAR)) varied from 1.48 to 4.63 m(-1), 1.09 to 3.43 m(-1), and 0.26 to 0.94 m(-1), respectively. The corresponding ranges for the 1% attenuation depths were from 0.10 to 3.11 m, 1.34-4.21 m and 4.87-17.58 m, respectively. Total suspended matter (TSM) concentration was highly significantly correlated with K-d(313), K-d(340) and K-d (PAR) indicating that TSM was the main driver of UVR and PAR attenuation in Lake Qiandaohu in the late autumn and early winter. TSM concentration, K-d(313), K-d(340) and K-d(PAR) had obvious horizontal spatial heterogeneity presenting a decreasing trend from the estuary area to the center area in the lake. These results suggested that the spatial distribution of TSM from the inflow drived the spatial distribution of UVR and PAR attenuation. Significantly positive correlations were also observed between the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient and K-d(313). TSM and CDOM absorption spectra showed that in the UVR waveband (350-400 nm), the mean relative contribution rates of CDOM (a(g)(lambda)) , non-algal particles (a(nap)(lambda)), phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) and pure water (a(w)(lambda)) to the total absorption were 67.5 %, 24.0 %, 5.0 % and 3.5 %, respectively. In the PAR waveband, the mean relative contribution rates of a(g)(lambda), a(nap)(lambda), a(ph)(lambda) and a(w)(lambda) to the total absorption were 25.4 %, 18.6 %, 9.4 % and 46.6 %, respectively. Our findings could provide support for ecological environment protection in Lake Qiandaohu considering the importance of UVR and PAR attenuation in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - HyperLi-Net: A hyper-light deep learning network for high-accurate and high-speed ship detection from synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is attracting increasing attention due to its great value in ocean. However, existing most studies are frequently improving detection accuracy at the expense of detection speed. Thus, to solve this problem, this paper proposes HyperLi-Net for high-accurate and high-speed SAR ship detection. We propose five external modules to achieve high-accuracy, i.e., Multi-Receptive-Field Module (MRF-Module), Dilated Convolution Module (DC-Module), Channel and Spatial Attention Module (CSA-Module), Feature Fusion Module (FF-Module) and Feature Pyramid Module (FP-Module). We also adopt five internal mechanisms to achieve high-speed, i.e., Region-Free Model (RF-Model), Small Kernel (S-Kernel), Narrow Channel (N-Channel), Separable Convolution (Separa-Conv) and Batch Normalization Fusion (BN-Fusion). Experimental results on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), Gaofen-SSDD and Sentinel-SSDD show that HyperLi-Net's accuracy and speed are both superior to the other nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the satisfactory detection results on two Sentinel-1 SAR images can reveal HyperLi-Net's good migration capability. HyperLi-Net is build from scratch with fewer parameters, lower computation costs and lighter model that can be efficiently trained on CPUs and is helpful for future hardware transplantation, e.g. FPGAs, DSPs, etc.

TI  - LS-SSDD-v1.0: A Deep Learning Dataset Dedicated to Small Ship Detection from Large-Scale Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is becoming a research hotspot. In recent years, as the rise of artificial intelligence, deep learning has almost dominated SAR ship detection community for its higher accuracy, faster speed, less human intervention, etc. However, today, there is still a lack of a reliable deep learning SAR ship detection dataset that can meet the practical migration application of ship detection in large-scene space-borne SAR images. Thus, to solve this problem, this paper releases a Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) from Sentinel-1, for small ship detection under large-scale backgrounds. LS-SSDD-v1.0 contains 15 large-scale SAR images whose ground truths are correctly labeled by SAR experts by drawing support from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Google Earth. To facilitate network training, the large-scale images are directly cut into 9000 sub-images without bells and whistles, providing convenience for subsequent detection result presentation in large-scale SAR images. Notably, LS-SSDD-v1.0 has five advantages: (1) large-scale backgrounds, (2) small ship detection, (3) abundant pure backgrounds, (4) fully automatic detection flow, and (5) numerous and standardized research baselines. Last but not least, combined with the advantage of abundant pure backgrounds, we also propose a Pure Background Hybrid Training mechanism (PBHT-mechanism) to suppress false alarms of land in large-scale SAR images. Experimental results of ablation study can verify the effectiveness of the PBHT-mechanism. LS-SSDD-v1.0 can inspire related scholars to make extensive research into SAR ship detection methods with engineering application value, which is conducive to the progress of SAR intelligent interpretation technology.

TI  - An Algorithm for Sea Ice Drift Retrieval Based on Trend of Ice Drift Constraints from Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Realizing high-resolution (sub-kilometer scale) automatic detection of sea ice drift from massive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is an important requirement for mastering polar sea ice dynamics and better understanding global climate change. A fully automatic SAR sea ice drift detection method has been developed in this paper, which is based on the idea of multi-scale observation. First, ice cracks or lead structures was detected from down-sampled sequential SAR images. Because the ice cracks or leads have scattering intensities and shape features which differ significantly from the surrounding ice regions, these structures can help to detect the overall drift of the sea ice region which we called the trend of ice drift (TID). Then, a modified feature tracking (FT) method was used to extract sea ice drift vectors from the original SAR imagery by considering the constraints of TID. The aims of the proposed algorithm are to improve the accuracy of sea ice drift retrieval and the spatial density of ice drift vectors, as well as reducing execution time. Three pairs of dual-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR images of the Arctic were used for experimental validation. The experimental results show that the proposed method takes the least time, and the extracted sea ice drift vector is far more than the classical Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF) method and Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method in both spatial density and area coverage. In terms of the accuracy of sea ice drift speed and direction detection, for HH polarization, the sea ice drift speed retrieved by the proposed method has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.158 cm/s and a relative error (RE) of 1.838 %; and the RMSE of retrieved sea ice drift direction is 0.112 degrees and the RE is 0.267 %. For HV polarization, the RMSE of sea ice drift velocity inversion is 0.138 cmis and RE is 1.504 %; the RMSE of sea ice drift direction inversion is 0.123 degrees and RE is 0.753 %. For the dual-polarization SAR data, compared with SURF and NCC methods, the proposed algorithm performs better.

TI  - Estimation of 1-km all-weather remotely sensed land surface temperature based on reconstructed spatial-seamless satellite passive microwave brightness temperature and thermal infrared data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - All-weather remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) with a 1-km resolution from combined satellite passive microwave (MW) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data has been urgently needed during the past decades. However, due to considerable temporal gap between AMSR-E and AMSR2 observation from November 2011 to May 2012, current MODIS-AMSR-E/2 integrated LST is not really all-weather available. Therefore, an AMSR-E/2-like brightness temperature (BT) without the temporal gap for 2011-2012 is highly desirable. Despite the Chinese Fengyun-3B MWRI BT is qualified to reconstruct such a BT, the swath gap in its BT has to be effectively filled as the gap not only greatly decreases the spatiotemporal coverage of the TIR-MW integrated LST but also limits the application of satellite MW BT data. However, the gap issue has not been effectively addressed by previous research. In this context, this study proposes an novel method to (i) reconstruct a spatial-seamless (i.e. without the two gaps) AMSR-E/2-like MW BT based on MWRI data for 2011-2012 over the Tibetan Plateau and (ii) estimate a realistic 1-km all-weather LST by integrating reconstructed MW BT with Aqua-MODIS data. Results show that the reconstructed MW BT is spatiotemporally continuous and has a high accuracy with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.89-2.61 K compared to original AMSR-E/2 BT. This exhibits the method's potential to greatly extend the spatiotemporal coverage of currently available MW BT-based remote sensing data. In addition, the estimated LST has an RMSE of 1.45-3.36 K when validated against the ground measurements, which outperforms current TIR-MW integrated LST products. Therefore, this study would be valuable for facilitating satellite MW data and generating a realistic and reliable 1-km all-weather remotely sensed LST at large scales.

TI  - Effects of climate change on the growing season of alpine grassland in Northern Tibet, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing season of alpine grassland is regarded as the vital indictors reflecting the vegetation growth, and is sensitive to regional climatic change in Northern Tibet. However, limited studies have identified the growing season variability across alpine grassland in Northern Tibet during 2001-2018. We investigated spatial-temporal variations in the growing season of alpine grassland in Northern Tibet, as determined by TIMESAT model employing MODIS NDVI data. Results indicate that, the start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS) and growing season length (GSL) for alpine grassland experienced delaying, advancing and shortening trends at a rate of 1.32, -2.06 and -3.38 days/10a, respectively, in the Northern Tibet. The variation of growing season in different alpine grassland types showed different changing tendencies. The SOS for alpine grassland was significantly positively correlated with the mean temperature and negatively correlated with the cumulative precipitation from January to May. The EOS for alpine grassland was positively correlated with temperature and precipitation in September. These results could contribute to the research on plant phenology and climate change from a different perspective. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characteristics and generations of internal wave in the Sulu Sea inferred from optical satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Characteristics and generation of internal waves (IWs) in the Sulu Sea are studied using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images taken from October 2016 to September 2019. Satellite observations show that IWs in the Sulu Sea mainly located in the shallower western areas with occasional observations in the deeper eastern regions. The dominant length of wave crest (LWC) of IWs is between 50 and 150 km with the largest LWC reaching over 300 km. The analysis of temporal distributions of IWs shows that March has the most IWs and July has the least. Further analysis shows that the seasonal variation is mainly due to the cloud contamination of optical satellite images. New generation sites of IWs are analyzed using satellite images. Six possible generation sites for IWs in the western Sulu Sea and one generation site for IWs in the eastern Sulu Sea are found using the ray-tracing method. Multi IW sources in the same strait are found, which may be due to the seawater fl ow over the strait in diff erent directions. The analysis shows that IWs with long wave crest in the Sulu Sea is a combined eff ort of all straits between small islands in the Sulu Archipelago. Remote generated IWs with long wave crest in the eastern Sulu Sea are studied, which are generated at the straits around (121.5 degrees E, 6 degrees N) by the nonlinear evolution of internal tide originated from the Sulu Archipelago.

TI  - Mapping of Intrusive Complex on a Small Scale Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-stage intrusive complex mapping plays an important role in regional mineralization research. The similarity of lithology characteristics between different stages of intrusions necessitates the use of richer spectral bands, while higher spatial resolution is also essential in small-scale research. In this paper, a multi-source remote sensing data application method was proposed. This method includes a spectral synergy process based on statistical regression and a fusion process using Gram-Schmidt (GS) spectral sharpening. We applied the method with Gaofen-2 (GF2), Sentinel-2, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data to the mapping of the Mountain Sanfeng intrusive complex in northwest China in which Carboniferous intrusions have been proven to be directly related to the formation of Au deposits in the area. The band ratio (BR) and relative absorption band depth (RBD) were employed to enhance the spectral differences between two stage intrusions, and the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) false colour of the BR and RBD enhancement images performed well in the west and centre. Excellent enhancement results were obtained by making full use of all bands of the synergistic image and using the Band Ratio Matrix (BRM)-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method in the northeast part of the study area. A crucial improvement in enhancement performance by the GS fusion process and spectral synergy process was thus shown. An accurate mapping result was obtained at the Mountain Sanfeng intrusive complex. This method could support small-scale regional geological survey and mineralization research in this region.

TI  - A polarized reflectance model for remote sensing of densely vegetated surfaces
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a modified model which takes the variation of leaf orientation in zenithal space into consideration. It is special because of the linkage between the parameterization of leaf inclination angle and polarized reflectance modelling. The modified model is compared to the Rondeaux-Herman model, the Nadal-Breon model and a one-parametric linear model using remotely sensed polarized data which was obtained by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) over Oklahoma on 16 September 2005. The comparison suggests the modified model accurately captures the polarized reflectance of dense vegetation and works more precisely than the other models.

TI  - Classification of Airborne Laser Point Clouds and Optical Images Based on Fuzzy Evidence Theory
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of ground object texture, the classification of ground object has always been a hotspot and difficulty in the study of remote sensing. Airborne laser technology can directly obtain three-dimensional point cloud information of ground objects, and the image data can provide rich spectral information. Therefore, in this paper, the features arc combined with the airborne laser point cloud and the active and passive remote sensing data of aerial images to classify the features. First, the three-dimensional point cloud data needs to be converted into grid data, and the top hat transform morphology method is used to remove the noise points. Then, the grid data is segmented and the watershed algorithm with vegetation area restriction is introduced to generate the clustering region. Finally, fuzzy evidence theory is used to identify the features of different clustering areas. Using the airborne laser point cloud and aerial image data on the ISPRS dataset as the experimental data, the accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated. The results show that the classification effect of this method is better than that of the single point based evidence classification method.

TI  - Cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection via a multi-level attention domain adaptation network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing an accurate evaluation of palm tree plantation in a large region can bring meaningful impacts in both economic and ecological aspects. However, the enormous spatial scale and the variety of geological features across regions has made it a grand challenge with limited solutions based on manual human monitoring efforts. Although deep learning based algorithms have demonstrated potential in forming an automated approach in recent years, the labelling efforts needed for covering different features in different regions largely constrain its effectiveness in large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptive oil palm tree detection method, i.e., a Multi-level Attention Domain Adaptation Network (MADAN) to reap cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection. MADAN consists of 4 procedures: First, we adopted a batch-instance normalization network (BIN) based feature extractor for improving the generalization ability of the model, integrating batch normalization and instance normalization. Second, we embedded a multi-level attention mechanism (MLA) into our architecture for enhancing the transferability, including a feature level attention and an entropy level attention. Then we designed a minimum entropy regularization (MER) to increase the confidence of the classifier predictions through assigning the entropy level attention value to the entropy penalty. Finally, we employed a sliding window-based prediction and an IOU based post-processing approach to attain the final detection results. We conducted comprehensive ablation experiments using three different satellite images of large-scale oil palm plantation area with six transfer tasks. MADAN improves the detection accuracy by 14.98% in terms of average Fl-score compared with the Baseline method (without DA), and performs 3.55-14.49% better than existing domain adaptation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the great potential of our MADAN for large-scale and cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection, guaranteeing a high detection accuracy as well as saving the manual annotation efforts.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment and Driving Force Analysis of Mangrove Forest Changes in China from 1985 to 2018 by Integrating Optical and Radar Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are valuable, yet vulnerable, and therefore they have been an important subject of protection and restoration in China. Reliable information on long-term China mangrove dynamics is lacking but vital to analyze the driving forces and evaluate the efforts of mangrove conversation. This study aims to quantify the conversions among mangroves and other land covers with high accuracy. The updated mangrove base map for 2018 was produced by integrating Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR-2) yearly mosaics and Landsat imagery with an overall accuracy of 95.23 +/- 6.02%. Then, a novel approach combining map-to-image and image-to-image methods was proposed to detect the changed pixels in mangrove forests from 1985 to 2018. The mangrove base map was adopted to mask the images from other years. To determine the changed pixels, the differencing values in the masked area between two images were calculated and compared with the corresponding thresholds. Based on the changed pixels, the possible driving forces were analyzed and associated with socioeconomic development. The resultant mangrove dynamics demonstrated that mangrove forests in China experienced a tendency of loss first and recovery later during the past 30 years. Most mangrove gains came from aquaculture and mudflat, whilst losses were due to the built-up construction and aquaculture reclamation. These conversions indicated that mangrove deforestations were mainly due to human-induced destruction, while the recoveries were strongly associated with conservation and restoration actions.

TI  - Long-term remote tracking the dynamics of surface water turbidity using a density peaks -based classification: A case study in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water turbidity (SWT), as a low-cost proxy of surface suspended sediment, is important for characterizing the hydro-ecological process and light availability in the lake or reservoir ecosystem. In this study, we proposed the combined use of HJ-1 charge-coupled device imaging and field observation to track the long-term SWT dynamics with environmental changes in Lakes Gaoyang, Hanfeng, and Changshou of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. In situ remote sensing reflectance spectra were utilized to develop the characteristic spectral indexes for the SWT estimation in different water optical classes separated by a density peaks-based classification. Significant correlations were found between the red-, four-band, band ratio spectral indexes and SWT (determination coefficient >0.71 and root-mean-square error <8.32 nephelometric turbidity unit), suggesting a crucial role of the class-specific retrieval models for the SWT estimation in optically complex waters. The proposed method was further used to monitor the spatio-temporal SWT dynamics over the three lakes from 2008 to 2019, demonstrating that the significant SWT decline in Lakes Gaoyang and Hanfeng and the relatively stable trend in Lake Changshou during the 11-year period. Specifically, the SWT decreasing trends may be attributed to the water level linkage mechanism of Three Gorges and Wuyang Dams. In addition, analyses with simultaneous environmental factors showed that the seasonal and inter-annual variations of SWT appear to be closely correlated with water level and rainfall. Long-term remote tracking of the SWT dynamics presented in this study could provide new insight and reference for reservoir management in the post-Three Gorges Project Era.

TI  - Integrating RELAX with PS-InSAR Technique to Improve Identification of Persistent Scatterers for Land Subsidence Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying Persistent Scatterers (PSs) is one of the key processing steps of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique. The number, density, and reliability of identified PSs directly affect the monitoring accuracy of land subsidence, especially in higher density urban environments. As a result of the side-looking viewing geometry of SAR, the layover effect poses a major challenge to the PS identification. This research proposes joint modeling of the PS-InSAR technique and RELAX algorithm for SAR tomography (PS-InSAR+RELAX) to detect single and double scatterers and to improve the identification and reliability of PSs. It has been demonstrated that RELAX improves separation of the scatterers when compared to two other spectral analysis methods for SAR tomography, Beam-Forming (BF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). RELAX exhibits the least noise when the number of baseline changes from 15 to 30, and it can separate the scatterers at a lower Normal-Slant-Range (NSR) height than the two other methods. As RELAX can better identify, separate, and then filter out layover scatterers, the number and density of PSs identified by PS-InSAR+RELAX is reduced and visually simplified, suggesting that the method can effectively reduce the influence of the layover effect on the PS identification. Also, the PSs identified by PS-InSAR+RELAX are more coherent than those identified by the traditional PS-InSAR technique. The proposed technique has been applied to Sentinel-1A data acquired from 2014 to 2016, to monitor land subsidence in the city of Beijing, China. When evaluated against the leveling measurements, PS-InSAR+RELAX performs better than the traditional PS-InSAR technique, with the correlation coefficients (r) of r = 0.98 and r = 0.95, respectively.

TI  - Warming Effort and Energy Budget Difference of Various Human Land Use Intensity: Case Study of Beijing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Human land use intensity affects the surface energy balance by changing the biogeophysical parameters. This study used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote sensing data and surface energy balance algorithms to quantify changes in surface energy budgets corresponding to changes in land use in Beijing from 2000 to 2015. Land use was reclassified by considering land use intensity. The difference in the latent heat flux (LE) and net radiation (R-n) (LE-R-n) expressed the warming or cooling effect. The results showed that: (i) The increasing trend of net longwave radiation in Beijing offset the decreasing trend of net shortwave radiation. The R-n changed slightly, while the LE and LE-R-n showed a significant increase of 0.55 and 0.56 W/(m(2)center dot year), respectively. The findings indicated that considering only radiative forcing, or even R-n, was not enough to measure the impacts of land use change on the energy budget. (ii) The order of R-n, LE, and LE-R-n values from high to low were natural and seminatural areas, cropland, mixed pixel areas, urban expansion areas, and old urban areas. Compared with natural and seminatural areas, the changing LE-R-n trend in the other four land use types decreased with the increase in human impact intensity, indicating that human activities weakened the positive change trend of LE-R-n and increased the warming effect. (iii) Although the temporal trend of LE increased in Beijing from 2000 to 2015, the effect of R-n on LE-R-n was greater than that of LE, especially in the four land use types affected by human activities. The results for surface temperature in various land use types confirmed this point. This study highlights the energy budget differences of various land use types affected by human activities. It makes an important contribution to understanding the urban heat island effect from a biogeophysical perspective.

TI  - Fracture Behavior of Permeable Asphalt Mixtures with Steel Slag under Low Temperature Based on Acoustic Emission Technique
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic emission (AE), as a nondestructive testing (NDT) and real-time monitoring technique, could characterize the damage evolution and fracture behavior of materials. The primary objective of this paper was to investigate the improvement mechanism of steel slag on the low-temperature fracture behavior of permeable asphalt mixtures (PAM). Firstly, steel slag coarse aggregates were used to replace basalt coarse aggregates with equal volume at different levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). Then, the low-temperature splitting test with slow loading was used to obtain steady crack growth, and the crack initiation and propagation of specimens were monitored by AE technique in real time. From the low-temperature splitting test results, SS-100 (permeable asphalt mixtures with 100% steel slag) has the optimal low-temperature cracking resistance. Therefore, the difference of fracture behavior between the control group (permeable asphalt mixtures without steel slag) and SS-100 was mainly discussed. From the AE test results, a slight bottom-up trend of sentinel function was founded in the 0.6-0.9 displacement level for SS-100, which is different from the control group. Furthermore, the fracture stages of the control group and SS-100 could be divided based on cumulative RA and cumulative AF curves. The incorporation of 100% steel slag reduced the shear events and restrained the growth of shear cracking of the specimen in the macro-crack stage. Finally, the considerable drops of three kinds ofb-values in the final phase were found in the control group, but significant repeated fluctuations in SS-100. In short, the fracture behavior of PAM under low temperature was significantly improved after adding 100% steel slag.

TI  - Effects of Irrigation on Water, Carbon, and Nitrogen Budgets in a Semiarid Watershed in the Pacific Northwest: A Modeling Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we use the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5) to investigate how irrigation modulates hydrologic and biogeochemical dynamics in the Upper Columbia-Priest Rapids (UCPR) watershed, a typical semiarid watershed located in the northwestern United States dominated by cropland. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first application of CLM5 with landscape heterogeneity fully resolved over a watershed. The model is calibrated and evaluated against flux measurements from an AmeriFlux site and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. Two numerical experiments (i.e., irrigated and rainfed) are performed at hyperresolution (similar to 1 km) over the period of 2010-2018, accounting for realistic crop types and management practices. Our results show that irrigation fundamentally alters hydrologic and biogeochemical dynamics of the watershed. By adding 79.6 mm year(-1)water in addition to the mean annual precipitation of 204.0 mm year(-1), irrigation leads to increases in evapotranspiration and runoff, accompanied by shallower groundwater table depths. Increases in crop productivity in response to irrigation result in more carbon storage in the watershed, and drastically large seasonal fluctuations in soil organic carbon in response to changes in soil temperature and moisture. Irrigation also intensifies the rate of denitrification and mineralization during the growing season, enhancing the interactions between soil mineral nitrogen, the atmosphere, and freshwater systems. Our study demonstrates the potential of CLM5 as an effective tool for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics in highly managed semiarid watersheds.

TI  - Biases Characteristics Assessment of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) Measurement on Board Fengyun-4A Geostationary Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Fengyun-4A geostationary meteorological satellite was successfully launched on 11 December 2016, carrying an Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) to provide the observations of visible, near infrared, and infrared bands with improved spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution. The AGRI infrared observations can be assimilated into numerical weather prediction (NWP) data assimilation systems to improve the atmospheric analysis and weather forecasting capabilities. To achieve data assimilation, the first and crucial step is to characterize and evaluate the biases of the AGRI brightness temperatures in infrared channels 8-14. This study conducts the assessment of clear-sky AGRI full-disk infrared observation biases by coupling the RTTOV model and ERA Interim analysis. The AGRI observations are generally in good agreement with the model simulations. It is found that the biases over the ocean and land are less than 1.4 and 1.6 K, respectively. For bias difference between land and ocean, channels 11-13 are more obvious than water vapor channels 9-10. The fitting coefficient of linear regression tests between AGRI biases and sensor zenith angles manifests no obvious scan angle-dependent biases over ocean. All infrared channels observations are scene temperature-dependent over the ocean and land.

TI  - Determine the Stumpf 2003 Model Parameters for Multispectral Remote Sensing Shallow Water Bathymetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Stumpf 2003 model is a widely used model for shallow water bathymetry estimation for multi-spectral remote sensing. There are three parameters should be determined in this model. One is the parameter n in the term of a logarithmic ratio, and the other two parameters are m(0) and m(1), which are determined by a linear regression. In many researches the n is assigned as a constant directly. There is no more discussion on how to determine these parameters, especially for the value of n. In this paper, it suggest a two-step-method when using the Stumpf 2003 model for bathymetry estimation. The first step determines the value of the parameter n according to the linearity between the term of a logarithmic ratio and water depth. The second step is to obtain the other two parameters mo and m1 by a conventional linear regression. The method is tested and verified using a WorldView-2 (WV2) multi-spectral image and the corresponding in-situ water bathymetry by a sonar. 512 samples are extracted randomly as a train dataset, these data are used to train the Stumpf 2003 model; the remain 129 samples are collected as a validation dataset. The results show that using the two-step-method can improve the accuracy of bathymetry estimation. According to the train dataset, the RMSE is 3.829 using the model parameters (n=54.766) determined by this method, while the RMSE is 4.005 using the model parameters (n=1000) determined in the conventional way. Similar RMSE results also obtained for the validation dataset, they are 1.753 (n=54.766) and 1.816 (n=1000) respectively. It also shows an improvement. So this paper suggest to use the two-step-method to determine the model parameters for bathymetry estimation when using Stumpf 2003 model.

TI  - Acute toxicity, oxidative stress and DNA damage of chlorpyrifos to earthworms (<i>Eisenia fetida</i>): The difference between artificial and natural soils
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pesticides can damage the soil environment, including damage to sentinel organisms such as earthworms. When assessing the toxicity of pesticides towards earthworms, assays are usually performed using standardized artificial soil, however, soil physicochemical properties may affect pesticide toxicity. In the present study, the toxicity of a commonly used insecticide (chlorpyrifos) to earthworms (Eisenia fetida) was determined in artificial soil and three typical natural soils (fluvo-aquic soil, black soil and red clay) by measuring acute and subchronic toxicity. Soil tests were conducted to measure the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos to Eisenia fetida quantified by the half lethal concentration (LC50) while subchronic toxicity tests assessed the impact of low dose chlorpyrifos exposure (0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg; up to 56 d) on reactive oxygen species content, antioxidant enzymes activities, detoxifying enzyme activity, malondialdehyde content, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine content. Subchronic toxicity was quantified using the integrated biomarker response (IBR) which highlighted that the toxicity of chlorpyrifos in artificial and natural soils was not the same. Outcomes from artificial soil studies may underestimate (fluvo-aquic soil and red clay) or overestimate (black soil) chlorpyrifos effects. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating Potential Ground Subsidence Geo-Hazard of Xiamen Xiang'an New Airport on Reclaimed Land by SAR Interferometry
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The land reclaimed from the seaside may have a long-term subsidence trend, which poses a potential geohazard in the future land use. Xiamen Xiang'an New Airport (XXNA) is built on reclaimed land since 2016. Based on the spaceborne Sentinel-1 data between January 2018 to April 2019 and the time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, this paper analyzed the reclaimed land subsidence evolution at XXNA in this period. InSAR measurements show that XXNA is suffering from severe subsidence, mainly in three regions because of the earth and sand compacting. By analyzing the spatial subsidence characterizations of the main subsiding areas combined with historical land reclamation and future land use planning, we find the potential threat of subsidence to future land use. Correlation between subsidence and the period of reclamation was found, indicating that the consolidation and compression in dredger fill is the main cause of subsidence. By combining subsidence monitoring results with different land use types and adopting the Expectation (Ex) and Entropy (En) methods, we analyzed the key area with potential subsidence geo-hazard. This work shows that with SAR interferometry, it is possible to find the large area ground subsidence in the airport reclaimed area. The areas with potential subsidence geo-hazards are consistent with the deep reclaimed earth, which means high subsidence risk in the future.

TI  - Prediction of Winter Wheat Maturity Dates through Assimilating Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index into Crop Growth Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting crop maturity dates is important for improving crop harvest planning and grain quality. The prediction of crop maturity dates by assimilating remote sensing information into crop growth model has not been fully explored. In this study, a data assimilation framework incorporating the leaf area index (LAI) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into a World Food Studies (WOFOST) model was proposed to predict the maturity dates of winter wheat in Henan province, China. Minimization of normalized cost function was used to obtain the input parameters of the WOFOST model. The WOFOST model was run with the re-initialized parameter to forecast the maturity dates of winter wheat grid by grid, and THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) was used as forecasting period weather input in the future 15 days (d) for the WOFOST model. The results demonstrated a promising regional maturity date prediction with determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.94 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.86 d. The outcomes also showed that the optimal forecasting starting time for Henan was 30 April, corresponding to a stage from anthesis to grain filling. Our study indicated great potential of using data assimilation approaches in winter wheat maturity date prediction.

TI  - Low Dimensional Discriminative Representation of Fully Connected Layer Features Using Extended LargeVis Method for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there have been rapid advances in high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval, which plays an important role in remote sensing data management and utilization. For content-based remote sensing image retrieval, low-dimensional, representative and discriminative features are essential to ensure good retrieval accuracy and speed. Dimensionality reduction is one of the important solutions to improve the quality of features in image retrieval, in which LargeVis is an effective algorithm specifically designed for Big Data visualization. Here, an extended LargeVis (E-LargeVis) dimensionality reduction method for high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval is proposed. This can realize the dimensionality reduction of single high-dimensional data by modeling the implicit mapping relationship between LargeVis high-dimensional data and low-dimensional data with support vector regression. An effective high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval method is proposed to obtain stronger representative and discriminative deep features. First, the fully connected layer features are extracted using a channel attention-based ResNet50 as a backbone network. Then, E-LargeVis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the fully connected features to obtain a low-dimensional discriminative representation. Finally, L2 distance is computed for similarity measurement to realize the retrieval of high-resolution remote sensing images. The experimental results on four high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, including UCM, RS19, RSSCN7, and AID, show that for various convolutional neural network architectures, the proposed E-LargeVis can effectively improve retrieval performance, far exceeding other dimensionality reduction methods.

TI  - Variations in Canopy Cover and Its Relationship with Canopy Water and Temperature in the Miombo Woodland Based on Satellite Data
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the canopy cover relationship with canopy water content and canopy temperature in the Miombo ecosystem is important for studying the consequences of climate change. To better understand these relationships, we studied the satellite data-based land surface temperature (LST) as proxy for canopy temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as proxies for canopy cover. Meanwhile, the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) was used as a proxy for canopy water content. We used several statistical approaches including the correlated component regression linear model (CCR.LM) to understand the relationships. Our results showed that the most determinant factor of variations in the canopy cover was the interaction between canopy water content (i.e., NDII) and canopy temperature (i.e., LST) with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging between 0.67 and 0.96. However, the coefficients of estimates showed the canopy water content (i.e., NDII) to have had the largest percentage of the interactive effect on the variations in canopy cover regardless of the proxy used i.e., LAI or NDVI. From 2009-2018, the NDII (proxy for canopy water content) showed no significant (at alpha level 0.05) trend. However, there was a significant upward trend in LST (proxy for canopy temperature) with a magnitude of 0.17 degrees C/year. Yet, the upward trend in LST did not result in significant (at alpha level 0.05) downward changes in canopy cover (i.e., proxied by LAI and NDVI). This result augments the observed least determinant factor characterization of temperature (i.e., LST) on the variations in canopy cover as compared to the vegetation water content (i.e., NDII).

TI  - National Scale Surface Deformation Time Series Generation through Advanced DInSAR Processing of Sentinel-1 Data within a Cloud Computing Environment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an automatic pipeline implemented within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Computing platform for the interferometric processing of large Sentinel-1 (S1) multi-temporal SAR datasets, aimed at analyzing Earth surface deformation phenomena at wide spatial scale. The developed processing chain is based on the advanced DInSAR approach referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique, which allows producing, with centimeter to millimeter accuracy, surface deformation time series and the corresponding mean velocity maps from a temporal sequence of SAR images. The implemented solution addresses the aspects relevant to i) S1 input data archiving; ii) interferometric processing of S1 data sequences, performed in parallel on the AWS computing nodes through both multi-node and multi-core programming techniques; iii) storage of the generated interferometric products. The experimental results are focused on a national scale DInSAR analysis performed over the whole Italian territory by processing 18 S1 slices acquired from descending orbits between March 2015 and April 2017, corresponding to 2612 S1 acquisitions. Our analysis clearly shows that an effective integration of advanced remote sensing methods and new ICT technologies can successfully contribute to deeply investigate the Earth System processes and to address new challenges within the Big Data EO scenario.

TI  - The Reprocessed Suomi NPP Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and its follow-on NOAA Joint Polar Satellite Systems (JPSS) satellites marks the beginning of a new era of operational satellite observations of the Earth and atmosphere for environmental applications with high spatial resolution and sampling rate. The S-NPP and JPSS are equipped with five instruments, each with advanced design in Earth sampling, including the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). Among them, the ATMS is the new generation of microwave sounder measuring temperature profiles from the surface to the upper stratosphere and moisture profiles from the surface to the upper troposphere, while CrIS is the first of a series of advanced operational hyperspectral sounders providing more accurate atmospheric and moisture sounding observations with higher vertical resolution for weather and climate applications. The OMPS instrument measures solar backscattered ultraviolet to provide information on the concentrations of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, and VIIRS provides global observations of a variety of essential environmental variables over the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and ocean with visible and infrared imagery. The CERES instrument measures the solar energy reflected by the Earth, the longwave radiative emission from the Earth, and the role of cloud processes in the Earth's energy balance. Presently, observations from several instruments on S-NPP and JPSS-1 (re-named NOAA-20 after launch) provide near real-time monitoring of the environmental changes and improve weather forecasting by assimilation into numerical weather prediction models. Envisioning the need for consistencies in satellite retrievals, improving climate reanalyses, development of climate data records, and improving numerical weather forecasting, the NOAA/Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) has been reprocessing the S-NPP observations for ATMS, CrIS, OMPS, and VIIRS through their life cycle. This article provides a summary of the instrument observing principles, data characteristics, reprocessing approaches, calibration algorithms, and validation results of the reprocessed sensor data records. The reprocessing generated consistent Level-1 sensor data records using unified and consistent calibration algorithms for each instrument that removed artificial jumps in data owing to operational changes, instrument anomalies, contaminations by anomaly views of the environment or spacecraft, and other causes. The reprocessed sensor data records were compared with and validated against other observations for a consistency check whenever such data were available. The reprocessed data will be archived in the NOAA data center with the same format as the operational data and technical support for data requests. Such a reprocessing is expected to improve the efficiency of the use of the S-NPP and JPSS satellite data and the accuracy of the observed essential environmental variables through either consistent satellite retrievals or use of the reprocessed data in numerical data assimilations.

TI  - SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING BASED ON LONG-TERM TIME SERIES LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE (LST) DATA - A CASE STUDY IN HEBI CITY, HENAN PROVINCE
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time-series land surface temperature (LST) data acquired by moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to calculate temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDItime) data. Results showed that predicted soil water contents fit well with the data measured by 12 meteorological sites and 25 manually measured data, with identical variation tendency. It indicates that the soil moisture prediction method presented in this paper is highly effective. This method will help to provide scientific and technical supports for making intelligent decisions, guiding measures of the agricultural irrigation and enhancing grain yield.

TI  - TOPOGRAPHIC CORRECTION OF LAPAN-A3/LAPAN-IPB MULTISPECTRAL IMAGE: A COMPARISON OF FIVE DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance variability in mountainous regions caused by steep slopes can decrease the accuracy of landcover mapping. Topographic correction aims to reduce this effect, and various techniques have been proposed to conduct such correction on satellite imagery. This paper presents the initial results of five different topographic correction techniques applied to LAPAN-A3 multispectral images, namely cosine correction, improved cosine correction, Minnaert correction, modified Minnaert correction and two-stage normalization. The widely-available AIDS World 3D 30 meter DEM was employed, with the evaluation made in a mountainous area in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, located in an ancient volcanic region, with slopes ranging from 0 to 60 degrees. The slope aspect was almost equally distributed in all directions. Visual and statistical analysis was conducted before and after the topographic correction to evaluate the results. Standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient variation (CV) were calculated; the results show that the topographic corrections were able to reduce the effect of shadows and relief. Minnaert correction proved to be the best method in terms of visual appearance and spectral variability reduction.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry in optically complex waters using a model inversion approach and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an assessment of a model inversion approach to derive shallow water bathymetry in optically complex waters, with the aim of both understanding localised capability and contributing to the global evaluation of Sentinel-2 for coastal monitoring. A dataset of 12 Sentinel-2 MSI images, in three different study areas along the Irish coast, has been analysed. Before the application of the bathymetric model two atmospheric correction procedures were tested: Deep Water Correction (DWC) and Case 2 Regional Coastal Color (C2RCC) processor. DWC outperformed C2RCC in the majority of the satellite images showing more consistent results. Using DWC for atmospheric correction before the application of the bathymetric model, the lowest average RMSE was found in Dublin Bay (RMSE = 1.60, bias = -0.51), followed by Mulroy Bay (RMSE = 1.66, bias = 1.30) while Brandon Bay showed the highest average error (RMSE = 2.43, bias = 1.86). However, when the optimal imagery selection was considered, depth estimations with a bias less than 0.1 m and a spread of +/- 1.40 m were achieved up to 10 m. These results were comparable to those achieved by empirical tuning methods, despite not relying on any in situ depth data. This conclusion is of particular relevance as model inversion approaches might allow future modifications in crucial parts of the processing chain leading to improved results. Atmospheric correction, the selection of optimal images (e.g. low turbidity), the definition of suitably limited ranges for the per-pixel occurrence of optical constituents (phytoplankton, CDOM, backscatter) and seabed reflectances, in combination with the understanding of the specifics characteristics at each particular site, were critical steps in the derivation of satellite bathymetry.

AB  - This study describes the interpretation of integrated GIS-based remote sensing and electrical resistivity geophysical methods as part of the need to provide groundwater overview for sustainable management in the basement of north-eastern Osun State, Nigeria. Six groundwater conditioning factors are synthesized based on the analytical hierarchy process and multi-criteria decision analysis to produce groundwater potential index map constrained by existing borehole yields. The results indicate that the estimated groundwater potential index map can serve as a gross predictor of the groundwater distribution in the region. This study may influence town planning and land use decisions for sustainable management of groundwater resource in the area.

TI  - Additional outreach effort of providing an opportunity to obtain a kit for fecal immunochemical test during the general health check-up to improve colorectal cancer screening rate in Japan: A longitudinal study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives A sufficient screening rate is indispensable to optimize the positive impact of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an additional outreach of providing an opportunity to obtain a kit for fecal immunochemical test (FIT) during the general health check-up to increase CRC screening rate. Methods This was a longitudinal study using pre-existing data in Kujukuri Town, Japan. The town provided CRC screening in the fiscal year (FY) 2017 using an existing procedure for all beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance, whereas in FY 2018, an additional outreach effort was made to only those with an even number of age (exposed group), who were offered an opportunity to obtain a kit for FIT at the time of general health check-ups but not to those with an odd number of age (control group). To estimate the effectiveness, generalized estimating equation (GEE) with individuals as clusters was performed. Results In total, 3,530 individuals were included (1,708 in the control group and 1,822 in the exposed group). GEE showed significant interaction between the groups (control and exposed) and FYs (2017 and 2018) (p<0.001), indicating that the change in CRC screening rate from 2017 to 2018 was significantly different between the two groups. Although an achieved actual rate of 17.1% in the exposed group in FY 2018 was low, the additional outreach increased the rate by 5.8 percentage point (95% confidence interval, 3.5-8.1) compared with an existing rate. Conclusions Additional outreach of providing an opportunity to obtain a kit for FIT at the time of the general health check-up improved the CRC screening rate. However, screening rate achieved by this strategy remained low, indicating further efforts is required.

TI  - Facilitative priority effects drive parasite assembly under coinfection
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Host individuals are often coinfected with diverse parasite assemblages, resulting in complex interactions among parasites within hosts. Within hosts, priority effects occur when the infection sequence alters the outcome of interactions among parasites. Yet, the role of host immunity in this process remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the host response to the first infection could generate priority effects among parasites, altering the assembly of later-arriving strains during epidemics. We tested this by infecting sentinel host genotypes ofPlantago lanceolatawith strains of the fungal parasitePodosphaera plantaginisand measuring susceptibility to subsequent infection during experimental and natural epidemics. In these experiments, prior infection by one strain often increased susceptibility to other strains, and these facilitative priority effects altered the structure of parasite assemblages, but this effect depended on host genotype, host population and parasite genotype. Thus, host genotype, spatial structure and priority effects among strains all independently altered parasite assembly. Using a fine-scale survey and sampling of infections on wild hosts in several populations, we then identified a signal of facilitative priority effects, which altered parasite assembly during natural epidemics. Together, these results provide evidence that within-host priority effects of early-arriving strains can drive parasite assembly, with implications for how strain diversity is spatially and temporally distributed during epidemics.By combining an analysis of common garden and field experiments, together with a survey of wild hosts, the authors show that prior infection by a plant fungal parasite increases susceptibility to infection by other strains and that this priming effect influences the assembly of the parasite community.

TI  - Axillary Management After Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Data to guide axillary management after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) remain limited. Methods We analyzed type of axillary surgery [sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) vs. axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)] and residual nodal disease burden after NET in two cohorts of patients with cT1-4N0-1M0 hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer: Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DFBWCC) cohort (2015-2018) and the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) cohort (2012-2016). Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine adjusted 5-year overall survival (OS) by type of axillary surgery. Results Ninety-four (4.3%) of 2191 HR+/HER2- DFBWCC patients and 4363 (1.5%) of 283,344 NCDB patients were selected for NET. Of those who underwent axillary surgery, 30 (43.5%) in the DFBWCC cohort and 1583 (40.6%) in the NCDB cohort had ALND. Over 90% of cN0 patients in both cohorts had fewer than three positive nodes on final pathology [44 (95.7%) DFBWCC and 2945 (91.3%) NCDB]. In contrast, only 7 (30.4%) DFBWCC patients and 342 (50.7%) NCDB cN1 patients had fewer than three positive nodes. In the DFBWCC patients, there were no locoregional recurrences and four distant recurrences. In the NCDB, 5-year OS did not differ by type of axillary surgery regardless of residual nodal disease burden: 96.6% SLNB versus 97.9% ALND for 0 positive nodes; 84.4% versus 84.4% for one to two positive nodes, and 75.9% versus 77.3% for three or more positive nodes (allp > 0.10). Conclusions In cN0 patients selected for NET, > 90% have fewer than three positive nodes at surgery. The lack of a survival difference between SLNB and ALND suggests an opportunity to de-escalate treatment of the axilla in patients with limited residual nodal disease.

TI  - Relational Dependence in a Culture of Self-Creation: A Theological Query into the Health of the Medical World
T2  - LINACRE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Half of the medical professionals in the United States are experiencing symptoms of burnout. From the perspective of theological anthropology, this dehumanizing aspect of the field is not reducible to ethical failures, for it is rooted in the radically new worldview known as self-creation. As an implicit denial of Christian understanding of creation, self-creation entails a rejection of relationality and dependence-both proper to the Revelation of Jesus Christ. This article proposes that this lost Christian patrimony is intimately connected to the increasingly unhealthy dependence we place upon modern medicine. Relying on the help of theologian Joseph Ratzinger, we will come to see that a recovery of relational dependence is not only necessary for the salvation of man-but the very health of the medical world at large.

TI  - The accuracy of sentinel node biopsy by 99mTc-sodium phytate in patients with pancreatic cancer.
T2  - Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic cancer. The identification of the first nodal drainage site (sentinel node) may improve the detection of metastatic nodes and can contribute to a less invasive surgery. We aimed to determine the accuracy of sentinel node mapping in patients with pancreatic cancer using intraoperative radiotracer injection technique.METHODS: At surgical exposure, peritumoral injection of 0.4-0.5 mci/0.5 ml of 99mTc- sodium phytate was performed. After tumor resection, sentinel nodes were investigated in the most common areas using a hand-held gamma probe. Any lymph node with in vivo count twice the background was considered as sentinel node, thus, it was removed and sent for pathological assessment. Then a standard lymph node dissection was performed for all patients.RESULTS: Fourteen patients with cancer in the head of the pancreas were included in this study. Overall, 180 lymph nodes were harvested with a mean of 11.6±4.7 lymph nodes per patient. In eight patients, at least one sentinel node could be identified (detection rate about 64%). False negative rate of the study was 3/5 (60%).CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed insufficient diagnostic accuracy and high false negative rate for sentinel lymph node mapping with 99mTc- sodium phytate in pancreatic cancer.

TI  - The use of NEP scale to evaluate the environmental worldview of the employees in the city of Kacanik in Republic of Kosovo
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tendency for higher economic development with the aim of increasing the citizens' standard of living has led many natural resources in Kosovo to be overused and degraded. This environmental degradation is nowadays presented in the form of air, water and soil pollution. To cope with environmental problems in a society, its citizens, especially the young generations, need environmental education which plays a very important role for development of environmental attitudes and beliefs, which should be friendly and protective for environment and natural resources. In our survey, we used 15-item NEP scale to evaluate the environmental worldview of three groups of employees in city of Kacanik, in order to see if they have pro-anthropocentric approach, Dominance Social Paradigm which declares that natural sources are eternal, so they can be broadly utilized to fulfill human demands, or pro-ecological view, New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) that expects the integral part of the ecosystem is human being and natural resources cannot be utilized without control because they are insufficient. Our results show that all groups of respondents have a high pro-NEP score, higher than 45%, which means that the citizens are conscious about environmental problems in their city and country in general; thus, they have environmental concerns and are ready to support environmental policies for a sustainable economic development.

TI  - Feature selection for improved classification accuracy targeting riverine sand mapping
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular monitoring of riverine sand is crucial for its sustainable management. Towards readily generating spatial information regarding the extent of riverine sand, this study utilizes satellite-based remote sensing data as input features while applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to discern the inherent land cover classes. The input features comprised of spectral bands, derived spectral indices, derived textural features and ancillary information such as elevation, slope and aspect. The objective of this study was to identify a set of features that help improve the SVM classification accuracy with respect to the benchmark accuracy achieved by using only the spectral bands. Apart from testing a few commonly used logical combinations of features, the study focused on employing the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) method along with the best-first search algorithm to generate a feature-set that comprised of most relevant and least correlated features. This feature-set was found to improve the SVM classification accuracy by 2.9% with respect to the benchmark value. Further, when tested with the limited number of training samples, similar results were achieved. This study proves that it is beneficial to utilize the CFS method for feature selection prior to SVM classification and recommends a set of 19 remote sensing derived features that are relevant towards riverine sand mapping.

TI  - High-multiplexed monitoring of protein biomarkers in the sentinel <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> by targeted scout-MRM assay, a new vision for ecotoxicoproteomics
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecotoxicoproteomics employs mass spectrometry-based approaches centered on proteins of sentinel organisms to assess for instance, chemical toxicity in fresh water. In this study, we combined proteogenomics experiments and a novel targeted proteomics approach free from retention time scheduling called Scout-MRM. This methodology will enable the measurement of simultaneously changes in the relative abundance of multiple proteins involved in key physiological processes and potentially impacted by contaminants in the freshwater sentinel Gammarus fossarum. The development and validation of the assay were performed to target 157 protein biomarkers of this non-model organism. We carefully chose and validated the transitions to monitor using conventional parameters (linearity, repeatability, LOD, LOQ). Finally, the potential of the methodology is illustrated by measuring 277peptide-plex assay (831 transitions) in sentinel animals exposed in natura to different agricultural sites potentially exposed to pesticide contamination. Multivariate data analyses highlighted the modulation of several key proteins involved in feeding and molting. This multiplex-targeted proteomics assay paves the way for the discovery and the use of a large panel of novel protein biomarkers in emergent ecotoxicological models for environmental monitoring in the future.Biological significance: The study contributed to the development of Scout-MRM for the high-throughput quantitation of a large panel of proteins in the Gammarus fossarum freshwater sentinel. Increasing the number of markers in ecotoxicoproteomics is of most interest to assess the impact of pollutants in freshwater organisms. The development and validation of the assay enabled the monitoring of a large panel of reporter peptides of exposed gammarids. To illustrate the applicability of the methodology, animals from different agricultural sites were analysed. The application of the assay highlighted the modulation of some biomarker proteins involved in key physiological pathways, such as molting, feeding and general stress response. Increasing multiplexing capabilities and field test will provide the development of diagnostic protein biomarkers for emergent ecotoxicological models in future environmental biomonitoring programs.

TI  - Dust induced radiative perturbations during an episode of long-range dust transport over Delhi, India: a high-resolution regional NWP model study
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust-induced modifications to the radiative fluxes/heating during a light-blocking haze episode over Delhi, India, 7-9th Nov 2017-triggered by long range transport from a severe Saudi Arabian dust storm-have been investigated with a regional NWP model, NCUM-R with prognostic dust-radiation feedbacks. The study employs 'Double Radiation Calls', wherein parallel runs of the radiation scheme 'with' (prognostic) and 'without' (diagnostic) dust radiative effects-while prognostic fields drive the forecast-isolate the dust-induced perturbations. The forecasted dust optical depth agreed spatially with the AOD from MODIS with Angstrom Exponent > 0.5, indicating that the dust was well mixed with the fine mode anthropogenic aerosols upwind. The 'downward shortwave (SW) flux' was diminished (upto - 12.9 Wm(-2)) in layers sampling (i) near-surface (L1(Avg)), (ii) well-mixed layer within the planetary boundary layer (PBL, L2(Avg)) and (iii) free-troposphere (FT, L3(Avg)). Dust-induced 'Solar heating' dominated in FT (upto 9.5 x 10(-7) Ks(-1)) and the patches below (in L2(Avg)) exhibited a cooling, leading to thermal dipoles. The 'upward longwave (LW) flux' in FT was reduced and 'LW heating' prevailed in all levels-peak (2.5 x 10(-6)Ks(-1)) in L2(Avg)-along with well-defined cooling zones in L1(Avg). The dust-radiation interaction in turn influenced the boundary layer meteorology, manifested as (i) shallow PBLs that spatially correlate with dust-induced cooling of the boundary layer column, (ii) enhanced surface humidity and (iii) reduced visibility. The study is an instance of prognostic dust-radiation feedbacks improving the skill of NWP models in dust-laden regions.

TI  - IL-16 processing in sentinel node regulatory T cells is a factor in bladder cancer immunity
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the effort of developing new immunotherapies, the sentinel node (SN) has proven a promising source from which to harness an effective antitumour T cell response. However, tumour immune escape, a process in which regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role, remains a major limiting factor. Therefore, there is a clear need to increase the knowledge of Treg function and signalling in sentinel nodes. Here, we set out to explore whether the proteome in SN-resident T cells is altered by the tumour and to identify key proteins in SN T cell signalling, focusing on Tregs. Five patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer were prospectively included. Mass spectrometry was performed on two patients, with validation and functional studies being performed on three additional patients and four healthy donors. At cystectomy, SN, non-SN lymph nodes and peripheral blood samples were collected from the patients and T cell subsets isolated through flow cytometry before downstream experiments. Proteomic analysis indicated that growth and immune signalling pathways are upregulated in SN-resident Tregs. Furthermore, centrality analysis identified the cytokine IL-16 to be central in the SN-Treg signalling network. We show that tumour-released factors, through activating caspase-3, increase Treg IL-16 processing into bioactive forms, reinforcing Treg suppressive capacity. In conclusion, we provide evidence that Tregs exposed to secreted factors from bladder tumours show increased immune and growth signalling and altered IL-16 processing which translates to enhanced Treg suppressive function, indicating altered IL-16 signalling as a novel tumour immune escape mechanism.

TI  - Fluvial gravel bar mapping with spectral signal mixture analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents a method for mapping fluvial gravel bars based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. The proposed method therefore uses spectral signal mixture analysis (SSMA) because its results allow the development of land cover fraction maps for surface water, gravel, and vegetation. The method is validated on a spatially heterogeneous mountainous area in the upper Soca river basin in north-west Slovenia, Central Europe. Unmixing results in highly accurate fraction maps with MAE of around 0.1. Gravel fractions are mapped the most accurately, indicating that the approach can be used successfully for fluvial gravel bar mapping. Endmember sets selected automatically perform slightly worse (MAE higher by at most 0.05) than sets selected manually based on high resolution reference data. Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery can be used for accurate mapping with differences between the two remote sensing systems within 0.05 MAE. For the study area, the SSMA-based soft classification method is more accurate for land cover mapping than a Spectral Angle Mapping-based hard classification. The method is promising for an effective use in other cases where highly accurate subpixel information is needed, because it is able to detect small-scale changes that could go unnoticed with hard classification mapping.

TI  - A Critical Reflection on Environmental Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper problematises the current conception and purview of environmental education (EE), seeing it as part and parcel of the modernist western worldview that normalises and valorises human domination and exploitation of nature in the name of progress. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens through which to examine and expose the modernist western blueprint of EE, this paper suggests another way of reconsidering EE: the Zen way of 'becoming one with ten thousand things'. Paradoxically, the Zen way, to be true to itself, must transcend itself, and this paper invites the reader to see EE in the same light. To go further than just arguing for a Zen-inspired EE, this paper includes a section that offers three practices for the reader to try.

TI  - The advantage of one-step nucleic acid amplification for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer patients
T2  - ANNALS OF GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Generally, the postoperative examination of lymph nodes (LNs) is based on a microscopic examination of one hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slide; however, an examination of only one part of the LN might lead to incorrect staging of the tumor due to tissue allocation bias. Although multilevel sectioning and the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) have improved the detection of micrometastases in LNs, this approach is laborious, time-consuming, and costly. A novel molecular technique for the detection of LN metastases of tumors, called one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA), is a rapid and semi-quantitative examination quantifying the number of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) mRNA copies derived from a tumor. OSNA is already in clinical use for the diagnosis of LN metastasis in breast cancer patients; however, the use of OSNA is under investigation with promising results for colorectal cancer (CRC). The present review assessed recent studies on OSNA vs a histopathological examination and its implications for CRC staging and treatment. A total of 16 studies of OSNA in CRC yielded by a PubMed search were reviewed. Among them, seven studies evaluating the diagnostic performance revealed that OSNA had a high specificity (96.8%), high concordance rate (96.0%), and negative predictive value (98.6%) in a pooled assessment. In addition, four studies examining the utility of OSNA in sentinel LNs (SLNs) and two studies focusing on upstaging in pathologically node-negative CRC patients were also reviewed. Multicenter prospective studies with a large cohort of CRC patients are warranted to reveal the benefits of OSNA in the future.

TI  - Impact ofCOVID-19 State of Emergency restrictions on presentations to two Victorian emergency departments
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine if COVID-19 State of Emergency (SOE) restrictions were associated with a reduction in presentations to two urban EDs in Melbourne, Victoria. Methods This retrospective observational study included adult patients presenting to The Alfred and Sandringham Hospital EDs during the first month of stage 2 and 3 SOE restrictions (26 March-25 April 2020). Patients transferred from other hospitals or diagnosed with COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the average number of presentations per day. Secondary outcomes included the average daily number of presentations for pre-specified subgroups defined by triage category and diagnosis. The independent impact of SOE restrictions, adjusted for underlying trends in attendance, was determined using negative binomial regression and reported as an incident rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Average daily attendance during the exposure period was 174.7. In the absence of SOE restrictions, 278.8 presentations per day were predicted, a reduction of 37.3% (IRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.59-0.67). Attendance was lower than anticipated for all triage categories (especially category 5 [IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44-0.59]) and diagnostic groups (including circulatory problems [IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50-0.76] and injury [IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63]). There were fewer than predicted presentations for several sentinel diagnoses, including gastroenteritis (IRR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) and renal colic (IRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.92). Conclusions SOE restrictions were associated with a significant reduction in ED presentations across a range of triage categories and diagnoses. Public health messaging should emphasise the importance of timely ED attendance for acute illness and injury.

TI  - Spatial downscaling of MODIS Chlorophyll-a with machine learning techniques over the west coast of the Yellow Sea in South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective water quality monitoring of coastal areas through the measurement of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has remarkably progressed by ocean color remote sensing. Among different sensors, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 3 products provide reliable global representations of the Chl-a concentration. On the other hand, due to the coarse spatial resolution of MODIS data, its applicability is limited for spatially complex coastal regions. To overcome this limitation, a few downscaling techniques have been suggested based on the polynomial regression method. However, this type of regression has some restrictions, such as sensitivity to outliers, and nonlinear types of machine learning algorithms have not been tested in downscaling Chl-a datasets. Therefore, three machine learning (ML) techniques, support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and long short-term memory (LSTM), were developed using the Sentinel-2A/MSI bands as predictors and MODIS Chl-a as a predictand and compared their results with the results of multiple polynomial regression (MPR), to find the most suitable model for downscaling MODIS Chl-a in coastal area of South Korea. The obtained results showed that the 2nd degree MPR and SVR-Radial Basis Function (RBF) illustrate the best performance in the winter and summer days, respectively. In addition, LSTM is less sensitive to the changes in all variables (sensitivity index range from 0.31 to 0.48). Overall, we conclude that the downscaling approach based on ML models, especially SVR-RBF, can serve as a suitable alternative in some cases to produce high-resolution Chl-a maps, especially for coastal marine water quality monitoring.

TI  - Discharge estimation for medium-sized river using multi-temporal remote sensing data: a case study in Brazil
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased availability of remote sensing data associated with good revisit capabilities promotes the use of these data to estimate hydrological variables such as river width. This becomes especially useful for regions with poor coverage ofin situstations. In this study, we propose a methodological approach to estimate river discharge from time series of river width. The discharge fromin situhydrological stations was regionalized to calibrate a series of width-discharge models of three different types using theoretical hydraulic geometry power functions. Our methods used both individual and average width to estimate discharge. It was found that a priori selected average widths yielded models with better adjustment than the systematic average or the individual width approaches. Nearly 70% of the models generated with the selected average widths produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values better than 0.7. The article explores the implications of estimating discharge from width and describes the method used.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Terrestrial Evapotranspiration in the Upper Taohe River Basin from 2001 to 2018 Based on MOD16 ET Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential component of watershed hydrological cycle. Spatial-temporal variations analyses of evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration (PET) have remarkable theoretical and practical significances for understanding the interaction between climate changes and hydrological cycle and optimal allocation of water resources under global warming background. The MODIS-estimated ET agreed well with basin evapotranspiration from water balance principle methods in the study. The spatiotemporal variations results based on MOD16 ET data showed the following: (1) multiyear mean ET and PET were 464.2 mm and 1192.2 mm, and annual ET showed an upward trend at a rate of 3.48 mm/a, while PET decreased significantly at a rate of -8.18 mm/a. The annual ET trend showed a complemental relationship with PET; (2) at the seasonal scale, ET was highest in summer and least in winter, while PET was higher in spring and summer. The change of ET and PET in spring and summer had a great contribution to the annual variations; (3) ET and PET in the northern part were significantly stronger than those in the western and southern parts; (4) ET in cropland increased significantly, while PET decreased obviously in grass and forest; (5) changes of ET and PET were closely related to climatic factors. The rise in temperature caused the increase in ET and the decrease of wind speed contributed more to the decrease in PET. The results can provide a scientific basis for water resources planning and management.

TI  - Prediction of nodal staging in breast cancer patients with 1-2 sentinel nodes in the Z0011 era
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to provide an innovative nomogram to predict the risk of >2 positive nodes in patients fulfilling the Z0011 criteria with 1-2 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) only retrieved. From 2007 to 2017, at the Breast Unit of ICS Maugeri Hospital 271 patients with 1-2 macrometastatic SLNs, fulfilling the Z0011 criteria, underwent axillary dissection and were retrospectively reviewed. A mean of 1.5 SLNs per patient were identified and retrieved. One hundred eighty-seven (69.0%) had 1-2 positive nodes, and 84 (31.0%) had >2 metastatic nodes. Independent predictors of axillary status were: positive SLNs/retrieved SLNs ratio (odds ratio [OR] 10.95,P = .001), extranodal extension (OR 5.51,P = .0002), and multifocal disease (OR 2.9,P = .003). A nomogram based on these variables was constructed (area under curve after bootstrap = 0.74). The proposed nomogram might select those patients fulfilling the Z0011 criteria, with 1-2 SLNs harvested, in whom a high axillary tumor burden is expected, aiding to guide adjuvant treatments.

TI  - Exploring the term "harmony" and its practical significance in Confucian classics with examples drawn from the <i>Liji</i>
T2  - PHILOSOPHY COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese character, he (), "harmony," occurs more than 100 times in the Liji (; the Book of Rites). This accounts for over one-third of the term's total number of occurrences in the 13 pre-Qin Confucian classics. In this study, we engage with existing scholarship on the concept of "harmony" in Chinese culture and contribute to the discussion by analyzing the variety of senses that "harmony" has in the pre-Qin Confucian classics, especially the Liji. We find that usages of the term "he" ("harmony") in the Liji fall into six categories, namely, self, external things, music, human relations, politics, and the universe. We hold that the ways in which harmony features in the Liji and other Confucian classics can help us understand the Chinese cultural presupposition that there exists "only one world," meaning that this world encompasses both the natural and the supernatural, and that human beings are a holistic blend of body and heart-mind, which does not give rise to any dualistic tension between body and mind. Based on our understanding of the unique Chinese worldview and the corresponding view on life, this study aims to give an account for the importance of harmony as a guideline within various areas of Chinese life.

TI  - Understanding Uneven Land Subsidence in Beijing, China, Using a Novel Combination of Geophysical Prospecting and InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach was developed to quantitatively examine land subsidence. It combines a new geophysical (NG) prospecting and the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology to explore uneven development of land subsidence in Beijing, China. We derived land subsidence spatial information over 4 years (from November 2014 to July 2018) based on Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and the small-baseline InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method. Also, profile data were acquired using seismic frequency resonance (SFR) approach in a few settlement areas. We developed a geological model based on boreholes and SFR data. Thus, we can quantitively study the driving forces of a typical uneven land subsidence. We found that faults are controlling spatial developments of land subsidence in Beijing. The subsidence rates have different values along the same fault. Also, we revealed the contributions of compressible layers to the formation of uneven land subsidence.

TI  - Characteristics of Raindrop Size Distribution in Seoul, South Korea According to Rain and Weather Types
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The raindrop size distribution (RSD) is useful in understanding various precipitation-related processes. Here, we analyze disdrometer data collected in Seoul, South Korea from May 2018 to July 2019 to characterize the RSD according to rain and weather types. Rain types are categorized into stratiform, mixed, and convective rain, and weather types into the Changma front (type CF) and low-pressure system (type L). The slope parameter ? decreases and the intercept parameterN(0)fluctuates with rain rate. Among the rain types, the RSD of stratiform (convective) rain shows the steepest (mildest) slope and the smallest (largest) mean diameter. The logarithm of generalized intercept parameter log(10)N(w)and ? for stratiform rain have considerably dispersed distributions, which may be attributed to the diversity within the stratiform rain type in Seoul. Mixed-type rain has a larger mean value of log(10)N(w)compared to stratiform and convective rain. Regarding the weather types, the RSD of type CF exhibits a milder slope, a larger mass-weighted mean diameter, and a larger radar reflectivity than type L. These differences between the weather types can be explained by the larger convective proportion in type CF (33%) compared to type L (9%). Possible causes for the differences between the RSD characteristics of the two weather types are examined using reanalysis and satellite data. Type CF has a larger convective available potential energy, a higher cloud top, and more active ice microphysical processes than type L, which can lead to different RSD characteristics.

TI  - Prediction of AOD data by geographical and temporal weighted regression with nonlinear principal component analysis
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - When predicting aerosol optical depth (AOD) values for geographical weighted regression (GWR) and geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR), the input variables are influenced by multiple collinearity. Additionally, too many input variables make the model computationally complex, and too few input variables can reduce the prediction accuracy. In this study, a nonlinear principal component analysis geographical weighted regression method (NLPCA-GWR) and a nonlinear principal component analysis geographical and temporal weighted regression method (NLPCA-GTWR) are proposed. The NLPCA-GWR and NLPCA-GTWR methods use nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of several related variables that influence the AOD and to obtain several comprehensive indicators. The obtained comprehensive indicators are used as dependent variables that are input into the GWR and GTWR models to predict AOD values. To test the effectiveness of the NLPCA-GWR and NLPCA-GTWR methods, this paper uses Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei AOD data from April 2015; air quality data; meteorological data; and geospatial data as experimental data to model and compare the GWR and GTWR methods with the same number of input variables. The results show that the MAE, RMSE, AIC, R-2, and Rj2 of the NLPCA-GWR method are 13.58%, 6.99%, 13.86%, 4.07%, and 3.96% higher, respectively, than those of the GWR method. Compared with the GTWR method, the NLPCA-GTWR method improved the MAE, RMSE, AIC, R-2, and Rj2 by 6.53%, 2.91%, 2.17%, 1.14%, and 1.14%, respectively.

TI  - Image fusion framework considering mixed pixels and its application to pansharpening methods based on multiresolution analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of a high-spatial-resolution (HSR) panchromatic band and several multispectral bands with a relative low spatial resolution has become a research focus with the development of HSR remote sensing technology. Previous studies have demonstrated that fused spectra of mixed pixels (MPs) remain mixed, which considerably contributes to spectral distortions observed in fused images produced by most of the current pansharpening methods. Several works have attempted to reduce spectral distortions of fused spectra of MPs to improve the quality of fused products generated by some fusion methods based on component substitution (CS). An image fusion framework for reducing spectral distortions caused by the incorrect fusion of MPs is proposed for both CS and fusion methods based on multiresolution analysis (MRA). Using the proposed framework based on image segmentation, the fused products of two classic MRA-based pansharpening methods were improved by improving the fusion spectra of MPs. The improved fused images were compared with the original fusion products through a fusion experiment using three datasets recorded by WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-3. Experimental results showed that the improved fused products yielded higher Q2(n) and quality with no reference values and lower relative average spectral error, dimensionless global relative error of synthesis, and spectral angle mapper values than the corresponding original fusion products. This indicates that the proposed image fusion framework is effective for reducing spectral distortions of fused images generated by the two MRA-based fusion methods.

TI  - Retrieval of Ice-Over-Water Cloud Microphysical and Optical Properties Using Passive Radiometers
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current satellite cloud products from passive radiometers provide effective single-layer cloud properties by assuming a homogeneous cloud in a pixel, resulting in inevitable biases when multiple-layer clouds are present in a vertical column. We devise a novel method to retrieve cloud vertical properties for ice-over-water clouds using passive radiometers. Based on the absorptivity differences of liquid water and ice clouds at four shortwave-infrared channels (centered at 0.87, 1.61, 2.13, and 2.25 mu m), cloud optical thicknesses (COT) and effective radii of both upper-layer ice and lower-layer liquid water clouds are inferred simultaneously. The algorithm works most effectively for clouds with ice COT 5. The simulated spectral reflectances based on our retrieved ice-over-water clouds become more consistent with observations than those with a single-layer assumption. This new algorithm will improve our understanding of clouds, and we suggest that these four cloud channels should be all included in future satellite sensors.

TI  - Impacts of Topography on the Land Cover Classification in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many disagreements and uncertainties among global land use/land cover (LULC) products, which make it unsuitable to apply these products directly to a specific region. In this study, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with 250 m spatial resolution, combining with geographic features, were used for LULC classification in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China. The authors tested the Random Forest (RF), the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Their final classification product was also compared with 3 global LULC maps. The results showed that (1) topographic information could improve the classification results to some extent when they were integrated with spectral information in complex mountain regions; (2) the classification results using an RF classifier reached the highest overall accuracy (88.84%); (3) there was consistency with homogenous classes between our classification result and the 3 LULC products, but inconsistency with heterogeneous classes; and (4) the overall accuracy of this study was improved about 10% compared with the 3 LULC products. Therefore, this classification product is more suitable than global LULC products when considering complex terrain factors in mountain regions.

TI  - InSAR Evidence Indicates a Link Between Fluid Injection for Salt Mining and the 2019 Changning (China) Earthquake Sequence
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In June 2019, an earthquake sequence comprising five M > 5 events occurred in a region of southwest China with fluid injection for both hydraulic fracturing and salt mining, which raised an extensive controversy on the cause. Here we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to determine the source parameters of the sequence and to investigate the relationship with local injection activities. Both Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 SAR images are collected to measure coseismic and preseismic surface deformation. Geodetic inversions with coseismic observations show that the sequence ruptured a previously unmapped southwest-dipping thrust fault above 3 km depth, which intersects with the open-hole sections of wells for solution mining of salt. In the 4 months before the sequence, cumulative line-of-sight displacements near the wells are around 1-2 cm after correcting seasonal-like deformation. Our results indicate that water injection likely enhanced pore pressure within the fault zone and thus contributed to inducing the sequence.Plain Language Summary Earthquakes are seldom reported in relation to fluid injection for salt mining. Here, we present a unique case of an earthquake sequence probably induced by such human activity in Changning (southwest China). The sequence began with a Ms 6.0 earthquake, which is an unprecedented magnitude and larger than the historical records of earthquakes induced by wastewater disposal and hydraulic fracturing. Due to the sparse distribution of seismic stations and the failure of a key station closest to injection wells for salt mining before the Ms 6.0 earthquake, available seismic data are not enough to constrain the spatial locations of events in the earthquake sequence. Here we instead use high spatial-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations of coseismic surface deformation to image the causative fault of the sequence. We find that the open-hole sections of injection wells intersect the seismogenic fault. Moreover, the cumulative surface displacements near the salt mine in the similar to 4 months before the sequence are 1-2 cm, which was mainly caused by ground uplift. Accordingly, we hypothesize that fluid injection increased pore pressure within the fault zone and brought it to rupture. Our interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations and inversion results present significant evidence toward the causality between salt mining and the earthquake sequence.

TI  - Low-sample size remote sensing image recognition based on a multihead attention integration network
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, small sample recognition for hyperspectral images has been a popular research topic. It is very difficult for an algorithm to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of feature mining, feature selection and feature integration. The traditional single model has difficulty completing multiple tasks at the same time, ultimately leading to poor small sample recognition results for remote sensing images. This paper proposes a multimodel joint algorithm for deep feature mining based on multiscale convolution (MC) under multihead attention (MA) and deep feature integration based on bidirectional independent recurrent neural networks (BiIndRNNs), MACBINet. First, this paper proposes a multihead attention mechanism that assigns multiple weight coefficients to each feature to better select remote sensing image features; then, it implements the deep mining of features and the retention of multiple deep features through multiscale convolution. Subsequently, it implements contextual semantic information integration for long-sequence features through bidirectional independent recurrent neural networks to avoid the problem of gradient disappearance during training on a small sample of data. Finally, the softmax function is used to perform recognition on three public remote sensing data sets. The experimental results prove that our proposed MACBINet achieves the best results to date for small sample classification.

TI  - Evaluation of the Performance of the Integration of Remote Sensing and Noah Hydrologic Model for Soil Moisture Estimation in Hetao Irrigation Region of Inner Mongolia
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important parameter in Land surface system research, surface soil moisture (SSM) links the surface water and groundwater that plays a key role in water resources, agricultural management and global warming studies. Remote sensing techniques provide a direct and convenient means to estimate SSM on a regional scale. In this study, the performance of the normalized land surface temperature-vegetation index (LST-VI) model was evaluated using the in situ soil moisture measurements at Hetao irrigation region of Inner Mongolia that is a representative semi-arid area with relatively uniform underlying surface. The model was used to estimate soil moisture from HJ-1B and Landsat 8 images on clear days in 2014-2017. The overall SSM estimation accuracy was high, and the average RMSE was approximately 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Moreover, a systematic sensitivity analysis was conducted for the input parameters and other impact factors. The results demonstrated that the model could credibly monitor the regional surface soil water content.

TI  - Environmental Analysis of Land Use and Land Change of Najran City: GIS and Remote Sensing
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study critically analyzes changes in land use and land cover by means of multi-temporal remote sensing of Najran City in Saudi Arabia between 1975 and 2019. A number of remotely sensed data were employed to create multi-maps using: (a) the normalized difference vegetation index; (b) head-up digitizing; and (c) supervised classification of Landsat images using field observation and accuracy assessment, including field verification and Google Earth Professional. Criteria from a well-known technique of environmental assessment, the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), were used to critically analyze land use and evaluate levels of sustainability, with particular focus on ecology. Therefore, land around Najran can be characterized as follows: (1) Najran valley; (2) agricultural land; (3) built-up areas; (4) reclaimed land; (5) basement rock; and (6) desert. The results indicate that agricultural land grew from an average of 39.81 km(2)(1.07%) in 1975 to 218.51 km(2)(5.9%) in 2005, although this was followed by a marked decline between 2005 and 2019. Urban land increased from 1.12 km(2)(0.031%) in 1975 to 154.35 km(2)(4.13%) in 2019. Furthermore, there was approximately 1289.47 km(2)of reclaimed land in 1975 (i.e., 34.64% of the total area study area) but approximately 1151.1 km(2)(30.86%) in 2019. There was a small amount of desert (i.e., sand dunes) in the study area, and no change was recorded in the basement rock. This study analyzed these land changes, likening them to BREEAM criteria of ecology and land use. A number of unsustainable practices were potentially resulting in serious land contamination and pollution of both surface and ground water, as well as an increased risk of flooding.

TI  - Identification of vegetation responses to soil moisture, rainfall, and LULC over different meteorological subdivisions in India using remote sensing data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were analyzed to study the vegetation dynamics over different meteorological subdivisions in India for the period 2000-2016. Soil moisture (SM), rainfall (RF), and land use land cover (LULC) data were analyzed to identify the climatic and anthropogenic drivers that cause vegetation changes at the subdivision scale. Principal component analysis and MK (Mann-Kendall) test showed significant greening trend over semi-arid regions of Northwest India (NWI) and South India (SI) while slight browning trend seen over some of the subdivisions in Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains and Western Ghats (WG). It is found that the NDVI has superior correlation with soil moisture compared with rainfall and the croplands (CL) found to have significant increasing trend over the NWI and SI. Increasing trend in soil moisture over the NWI and SI may have contributed to increase in CL area and the greening trend. Over IG plains, the NDVI showed moderate correlation with SM and RF, and the greening trend (browning trend) in some regions can be attributed to increase in natural vegetation mosaic (decrease of CL). The NDVI has shown browning trend over the core monsoon regions of Madhya Pradesh (an increase of barren lands over west MP and decrease of CL over east MP) and Western Ghats (significant decrease of CL over Konkan and Goa). This study revealed that the soil moisture and LULC changes are the major driving factors for the vegetation changes over majority of the subdivisions in India.

TI  - Mid-Winter Breakout of Landfast Sea Ice and Major Storm Leads to Significant Ice Push Event Along Chukchi Sea Coastline
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the winter of 2016, anomalous sea ice conditions and a powerful storm culminated in a destructive erosion event along the Chukchi Sea coastline of Cape Espenberg, Alaska. This event is commonly referred to as an "ice push" or "ivu," the Inupiat word for an ice ridging event. In this article, we report the process and impact of this event by combining traditional ecological knowledge, news accounts, meteorological data, remote sensing, and ground surveys. The midwinter detachment of shorefast ice was caused by a low-pressure system and wind-driven swell that destabilized shorefast ice, while northerly winds developed an open-water lead offshore to the eventual impact area. These conditions preceded the impact of an extratropical cyclone on December 31, 2016, when powerful southerly winds and the second largest storm surge in Kotzebue Sound since at least 2003 led to the compressional failure of the ice cover under uniaxial loading perpendicular to the southern coastline of the Cape, resulting in the ice push event. Ice-pushed debris was shoved up to 6.2 m above mean high water, with similar to 3.5 km of coastline experiencing net erosion. The largest accumulation of ice-pushed debris had a volume of 1,000 m(3), and rose 3 + m above the surrounding ground surface even after roughly 6 months of melting. On low-lying areas, driftwood and other debris were deposited 130 m landward by the surge 5.0 m above mean high water, indicating the potential threat of such events to property, infrastructure, and, in this case, archeological sites and associated cultural resources. The anomalous environmental and sea ice conditions that preceded the ivu seem to suggest that such events may occur more frequently in a warmer Arctic.

TI  - Mapping China's regional economic activity by integrating points-of-interest and remote sensing data with random forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light imageries are widely used for mapping the gross domestic product (GDP) over large areas. However, nighttime light imagery is inappropriate to disaggregate agricultural GDP and inadequate to differentiate the GDP from the secondary and tertiary sectors. Points-of-interest, a kind of geospatial big data with geographic locations and textual descriptions of the category, can effectively distinguish industrial and commercial areas, and therefore have the potential to improve the precise GDP mapping from secondary and tertiary sectors. In this study, a machine learning method, random forest, was used to disaggregate the 2010 county-level census GDP data of mainland China to 1 km x 1 km grids. Six Random Forest models were constructed for different economic sectors to explore the non-linear relationships between various geographic predictors and GDP from different sectors. By fusing points-of-interest of varying categories, the spatial distribution of economic activities from the secondary and tertiary sectors was effectively distinguished. Compared to previous studies, the strategy of developing specific Random Forest models for different sectors generated a more reasonable distribution of GDP. Our results highlight the feasibility of using point-of-interest data in disaggregating non-agricultural GDP by exploiting the complementary features of the different data sources.

TI  - Monitoring Matang's Mangroves in Peninsular Malaysia through Earth observations: A globally relevant approach
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of rotational timber harvesting of mangroves is set to increase, particularly given greater recognition of the economic, societal and environmental benefits. Generic and standardized procedures for monitoring mangroves are, therefore, needed to ensure their long-term sustainable utilisation. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Perak State, Peninsular Malaysia, thematic and continuous environmental descriptors with defined codes or units, including lifeform, forest age (years), canopy cover (%), above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1)) and relative amounts of woody debris (%), were retrieved from time-series data from spaceborne optical and single/dual polarimetric and interferometric RADAR. These were then combined for multiple points in time to generate land cover and evidence-based change maps according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and using the framework of the Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM). Change maps were based on a pre-defined taxonomy, with focus on clear cutting and regrowth. Uncertainties surrounding the land cover and change maps were based on those determined for the environmental descriptors used for their generation and through comparison with independent retrieval from other EO data sources. For the MMFR and also for other mangroves worldwide where harvesting is occurring or being considered, a new approach and opportunity for supporting management of mangroves is presented, which has application for future planning of mangrove resources.

TI  - Effect of land use land cover changes on runoff using hydrological model: a case study in Hiranyakeshi watershed
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of the effects of land use land cover changes is crucial to know the hydrological status of the river basins. Various applications like remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and hydrological modeling approach are required to visualize and understand these effects on the watershed hydrological system. The research focuses on assessing the effects of land use land cover (LU/LC) changes and its impacts on the runoff in the Hiranyakeshi watershed using a semi-distributed hydrological model viz. soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Therefore, this research was initially carried out by analyzing changes in LULC by classifying Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellite images for the year 2000 and 2015. The LULC classification is prepared with different classes such as forest, agriculture, fallow land, plantation, water bodies, and urban area. The accuracy assessment of the classified images was performed by error matrix; the values were found to be 65% (for two classified images); the kappa coefficient value found to be 0.51 and 0.56 for the year 2000 and 2015. The classification results obtained are within satisfactory limits; hence, the classified image is used to assess the changes in LULC over the period. Results show an increase in agricultural activities (11.45%), urban area (1.15%), water body (0.15%), and a decrease in barren land (11.46%) and forest (1.42%). To simulate the changes in the runoff, the classified LULC image for the year 2000 is used in the SWAT model during the calibration (from 1995 to 1999) and validation (from 2000 to 2005). The performance results of the model are evaluated with statistical indicatorsR(2)and NSE, and the value 0.73 and 0.83 during the calibration and 0.70 and 0.84 during the validation period was achieved. Further, the model is simulated using classified LULC image of the year 2015 to assess changes in annual runoff; it is observed a decrease in annual runoff in the study area with respect to changes in LULC.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) changes over time and continuous monitoring provides insight on trends to inform both empirical treatment and public health action. Aims: To survey trends in relative isolation frequency (RIF) and AMR among key bloodstream pathogens using data from the Greek Electronic System for the Surveillance of AMR (WHONET-Greece). Methods: This observational study looked into routine susceptibility data of 50,488 blood culture isolates from hospitalised patients in 25 tertiary hospitals, participating in the WHONET-Greece for trends over time between January 2010 and December 2017. Only the first isolate per species from each patient was included. Hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs) were analysed separately. Results: During the study, the RIF of Acinetobacter baumannii increased in wards, as did the proportion of A. baumannii isolates, which were non-susceptible to most antibiotics in both wards and ICUs. Coincidently, Klebsiella pneumoniae RIF declined while the respective rates of non susceptible isolates to carbapenems and gentamicin increased. Pseudomonas aeruginosa RIF remained stable but decreasing proportions of non-susceptible isolates to all studied antibiotics, except imipenem were observed. Escherichia coli. RIF increased as did the proportion of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Concerning Staphylococcus aureus, a decline in the percentage of nneticillin resistant isolates in ICUs was found, while the percentages of Enterococcus faecium isolates with non-susceptibility to vancomycin stayed stable.Conclusions: Recognising these trends over time is important, since the epidemiology of AMR is complex, involving different 'bug and drug' combinations. This should be taken into consideration to control AMR.

TI  - Space-Time Drought Dynamics and Soil Erosion in Puruliya District of West Bengal, India: A Conceptual Design
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper integrates drought and soil erosion problems of Puruliya district of West Bengal. The space-time dynamics of vegetative drought is assessed based on the mean monthly time-series MODIS data for the period of 2000-2013. The drought recurrence ranges from 0 to 29 months, and the mean frequency was assessed to be 7.09 months for the entire period under deliberation. The potential soil disintegration of the district was estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation in the geo-spatial environment. The locale has been arranged into six potential soil erosion classes ranging from low-to-severe risk depending upon the computed soil erosion amount. The mean soil erosion rate of the district was anticipated as 76.29 t ha(-1) year(-1). The erosion amount is high in gently sloping grounds covering mainly harvested agricultural fields and open fields. These areas contribute mostly the soil erosion in this district. It is found that in this area the slope length-steepness factor is the major erosion-controlling factor. About one-fourth of the total area comes under the threat of a very high-to-severe erosion zone. Also, it was observed that the drought condition of the district is strongly correlated with the soil moisture condition in the drought-affected months and the precipitation amount. The study likewise distinguished the conceivable interrelationship between the soil erosion problem and drought frequency for better monitoring and policy decision making. A considerable increasing trend is observed in mean soil erosion with increasing frequency of drought-affected months for the study period.

TI  - Quantifying spatiotemporal variability of glacier algal blooms and the impact on surface albedo in southwestern Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo reduction due to light-absorbing impurities can substantially enhance ice sheet surface melt by increasing surface absorption of solar energy. Glacier algae have been suggested to play a critical role in darkening the ablation zone in southwestern Greenland. It was very recently found that the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) band ratio R-709nm/R-673nm can characterize the spatial patterns of glacier algal blooms. However, Sentinel-3 was launched in 2016, and current data are only available over three melting seasons (2016-2019). Here, we demonstrate the capability of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) for mapping glacier algae from space and extend the quantification of glacier algal blooms over southwestern Greenland back to the period 2004-2011. Several band ratio indices (MERIS chlorophyll a indices and the impurity index) were computed and compared with each other. The results indicate that the MERIS two-band ratio index (2BDA) R-709nm/R-665nm is very effective in capturing the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of glacier algal growth on bare ice in July and August. We analyzed the interannual (2004-2011) and summer (July-August) trends of algal distribution and found significant seasonal and interannual increases in glacier algae close to the Jakobshavn Isbrae Glacier and along the middle dark zone between the altitudes of 1200 and 1400 m. Using broadband albedo data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we quantified the impact of glacier algal growth on bare ice albedo, finding a significant correlation between algal development and albedo reduction over algae-abundant areas. Our analysis indicates the strong potential for the satellite algal index to be used to reduce bare ice albedo biases in regional climate model simulations.

TI  - Scale Invariance of Albedo-Based Wind Friction Velocity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining reliable estimates of aerodynamic roughness is necessary to interpret and accurately predict aeolian sediment transport dynamics. However, inherent uncertainties in field measurements and models of surface aerodynamic properties continue to undermine aeolian research, monitoring, and dust modeling. A new relation between aerodynamic shelter and land surface shadow has been established at the wind tunnel scale, enabling the potential for estimates of wind erosion and dust emission to be obtained across scales from albedo data. Here, we compare estimates of wind friction velocity (u(*)) derived from traditional methods (wind speed profiles) with those derived from the albedo model at two separate scales using bare soil patch (via net radiometers) and landscape (via Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] 500 m) data sets. Results show that profile-derived estimates ofu(*)are highly variable in anisotropic surface roughness due to changes in wind direction and fetch. Wind speed profiles poorly estimate soil surface (bed) wind friction velocities necessary for aeolian sediment transport research and modeling. Albedo-based estimates ofu(*)at both scales have small variability because the estimate is integrated over a defined, fixed area and resolves the partition of wind momentum between roughness elements and the soil surface. We demonstrate that the wind tunnel-based calibration of albedo for predicting wind friction velocities at the soil surface (u(s*)) is applicable across scales. The albedo-based approach enables consistent and reliable drag partition correction across scales for model and field estimates ofu(s*)necessary for wind erosion and dust emission modeling.

TI  - Improved index overlay mineral potential modeling in brown- and green-fields exploration using geochemical, geological and remote sensing data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The data-driven index overlay technique is an amended version of the conventional index overlay method, which has been utilized for mineral potential modeling (MPM) in brown-fields exploration, whereby a data-driven way is utilized to determine the relative significance of both individual evidence maps and evidential values. Although this method evades exploration bias in the conventional index overlay MPM resulting from categorization of evidential maps into some optional classes, it still possesses two major issues: (i) since this technique utilizes the plots of prediction-area (P-A) for defining the importance degree of every evidential map, it carries exploration bias resulting from the use of known mineral occurrences (KMOs) and (ii) it is not applicable in green-fields areas where there may be no KMOs. In this study, we propound an improved index overlay MPM to overcome the deficiencies described above, whereby every individual evidential map is rendered a weight without expert opinion and without the use of KMOs through a modified Shannon's entropy method. To illustrate this procedure, we applied it to the brown-fields Dolatabad district of southern Iran as a MPM case study for podiform chromite deposits. The results indicated that the improved index overlay approach outperformed the data-driven index overlay method for modeling the potential of the podiform chromite deposits. After successful testing of the improved index overlay technique, we applied it to the green-fields Birjand district of eastern Iran in order to ascertain promising zones for further detailed exploration of the targeted deposit.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dust storm is one of the severe natural disasters that has been recently threatening the Middle East region due to climate changes and human activities. This phenomenon has become a national crisis in some countries in this region in previous years, especially in spring and summer. This research aims to detect and monitor the areas covered by the seasonal and occasional dust storm from (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. MODIS imagery possesses impressive spectral and temporal characteristics that are essential for such an environmental application of Earth observations. An efficient algorithm, based on the spectral and statistical analysis of both thermal and reflectance bands of MODIS data, was developed through a decision tree method. To this end, an index was proposed to detect the dust over the land using the brightness temperature of thermal bands. The results of the proposed algorithm were assessed utilizing ground-based observation of synoptic stations. The proposed method showed high reliability and performance as well as the automatic capability of dust detection in land and sea areas of the image simultaneously. The evaluation of results showed that the proposed algorithm could detect thin and thick dust storms with an overall accuracy of about 80%. Moreover, the dust monitoring results visually agreed well with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aerosol index dust products. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Predicting recurrence in patients with sentinel node-negative melanoma: validation of theEORTCnomogram using population-based data
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Identifying patients with sentinel node (SN)-negative melanoma who are at greatest risk of recurrence is important. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group proposed a prognostic model that has not been validated in population-based data. The EORTC nomogram includes Breslow thickness, ulceration status and anatomical location as parameters. The aim of this study was to validate the EORTC model externally using a large national data set. Methods Adults with histologically proven, invasive cutaneous melanoma with a negative SN biopsy in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2014 were identified from the Dutch Pathology Registry, and relevant data were extracted. The EORTC nomogram was used to predict recurrence-free survival. The predictive performance of the nomogram was assessed by discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration. Results A total of 8795 patients met the eligibility criteria, of whom 14 center dot 7 per cent subsequently developed metastatic disease. Of these recurrences, 20 center dot 9 per cent occurred after the first 5 years of follow-up. Validation of the EORTC nomogram showed a C-statistic of 0 center dot 70 (95 per cent c.i. 0 center dot 68 to 0 center dot 71) for recurrence-free survival, with excellent calibration (R-2 = 0 center dot 99;P = 0 center dot 999, Hosmer-Lemeshow test). Conclusion This population-based validation confirmed the value of the EORTC nomogram in predicting recurrence-free survival in patients with SN-negative melanoma. The EORTC nomogram could be used in clinical practice for personalizing follow-up and selecting high-risk patients for trials of adjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Renal cell carcinoma with leiomyomatous stroma in tuberous sclerosis complex: a distinct entity
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Renal cell carcinoma with leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLS) is an emerging entity frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We described herein a series of RCCLS in TSC patients at pathological and cytogenetic levels. Three male patients with TSC and RCCLS were identified between 2000 and 2019 at the University Hospital of Rennes. Histologically, the architecture was tubulo-papillary with thick bundles of smooth muscle cells. The tumor cells showed clear cytoplasm with eosinophilic globules. The immunohistochemical profile was identical with an intense positivity of CK7, CAIX, and CD10 and a heterogeneous positivity of CK20. SDHB was low but positive and TFE3 was not expressed. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) did not show any quantitative chromosome abnormality. No recurrence was observed with a median follow-up of 4 years. RCCLS in TSC patients has morphological, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic distinct features that could constitute a distinct entity and a sentinel manifestation for the diagnosis of TSC.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we have used visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor of Landsat 8 satellite to delineate promising areas for iron exploration in the parts of Madhya Pradesh, India. OLI bands resampled laboratory reflectance spectra of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) were used as the reference to identify OLI spectral bands suitable in recording spectral features of Iron bearing minerals. Subsequently, BIFs were delineated in the principal component (PC) image prepared using those PC bands; which had opposite Eigen vector loading for the spectral bands; which recorded absorption minima and shoulder of the spectral feature of iron. Within the BIF, iron enriched zones were identified by integrating constrained energy minimization (CEM) maps of BIF, hematite and limonite-goethite. Integrated CEM map delineating iron enrichment zones was validated in the field based on measured Fe values of samples using X-ray Fluorescence Instrument.

TI  - Epidemiology of Irritable Hip in Western Scotland: A Follow-Up Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA 'limping child' commonly presents to the emergency department (ED). In the absence of trauma, many are diagnosed with irritable hip (IH). The aetiology of IH is not well understood and there may be geographical and seasonal variations. We previously established one year (2016) epidemiological data of IH presenting to the Royal Hospital for Children (RHCG) ED in Glasgow, Scotland. The sentinel findings in that year were (i) an age distribution shift to younger (peak at two years of age), (ii) no marked association with social class, and (iii) a spring preponderance. We sought to strengthen or refute these findings by repeating our study to obtain comparative data for 2017.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of all children discharged from the RHCG ED from January to December 2017. Relevant discharge codes were determined, and patient records screened. Patients without a discharge code had their presenting complaint and medical record screened. These data were compared to that of the previously published study from the same ED (2016).ResultsSeveral findings were consistent with the conclusions of the 2016 study. The incidence was similar with 362 and 354 cases diagnosed in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The boy-girl ratio was consistent across both data-sets, 2:1 and 1.9:1 respectively. The mean age of presentation was similar (3.3 vs 3.5 years) across both years, with the same medians (three years) and peaks (two years). There was no overt difference in incidence or correlation to social deprivation. However, in 2016, a spring preponderance was seen whereas there was an autumn preponderance in 2017. Pooling data from the two cohorts, 93% (n=668) of patients were managed exclusively by ED physicians, with 70% (n=504) not requiring any further follow- up. The majority of patients who required follow- up were seen in ED clinics (169/212, 79.7%). No patient initially diagnosed as IH was found to have septic arthritis (SA).ConclusionIn this follow-up study, we again found (i) a younger age profile than other studies, and (ii) no overt association with social deprivation. The major difference between the previous (2016) and current (2017) study was the apparent seasonal peaks: spring (2016), and autumn (2017). This difference does not negate the 'antecedent infection' hypothesis, but any aetiological proposal should be capable of accounting for this discrepancy. Additionally, our studies highlight that the majority of these patients can be managed in the ED alone.

TI  - Inversion of soil roughness for estimating soil moisture from time-series Sentinel-1 backscatter observations over Yanco sites
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 provides improved temporal and spatial resolutions in comparison with previous satellite missions. Unlike the change detection method that assumes the time-invariance of surface roughness at a coarse resolution, this study spatially inverted roughness and soil moisture from Sentinel-1 backscatter. Although it is important at high-resolution, local measurements of surface roughness are not available in an operational setting. Thus, question was how often time-varying soil roughness information should be updated in operations for reasonable soil moisture retrievals but at effective computational cost. Local validations show that a monthly update for surface roughness is sufficient for soil moisture retrievals. In more details, Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 0.01 m(3)/m(3)is found at Yanco A3 site, and 0.03 m(3)/m(3)at Yanco A5 site, with differences in backscattering between Integral Equation Model (IEM) simulation and Sentinel-1 measurement of 0.78 dB at Yanco A3 site and 0.012 dB at Yanco A5 site, respectively.

TI  - Combination of endoscopic submucosal dissection and laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection in early mucinous gastric cancer: Role of lymph node metastasis
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDRecent evidence showed that combining endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection may avoid unnecessary gastrectomy in treating early mucinous gastric cancer (EMGC) patients with risks of positive lymph node metastasis (pLNM). AIM To explore the predictive factors for pLNM in EMGC, and to optimize the clinical application of combing ESD and sentinel lymph node dissection in a proper subgroup of patients with EMGC.METHODSThirty-one patients with EMGC who had undergone gastrectomy with lymph node dissection were consecutively enrolled from January 1988 to December 2016. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between the rates of pLNM and clinicopathological factors, providing odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval. And the association between the number of predictors and the pLNM rate was also investigated.RESULTSDepth of invasion (OR = 7.342, 1.127-33.256,P= 0.039), tumor diameter (OR = 9.158, 1.348-29.133,P= 0.044), and lymphatic vessel involvement (OR = 27.749, 1.821-33.143,P= 0.019) turned out to be significant and might be the independent risk factors for predicating pLNM in the multivariate analysis. For patients with 1, 2, and 3 risk factors, the pLNM rates were 9.1%, 33.3%, and 75.0%, respectively. pLNM was not detected in seven patients without any of these risk factors.CONCLUSIONESD might serve as a safe and sufficient treatment for intramucosal EMGC if tumor size <= 2 cm, and when lymphatic vessel involvement is absent by postoperative histological examination. Combining ESD and sentinel lymph node dissection could be recommended as a safe and effective treatment for EMGC patients with a potential risk of pLNM.

TI  - Object-based island hierarchical land cover classification using unmanned aerial vehicle multitype data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an emerging technology applied recently in land cover classification, owing to its ability to acquire very high-resolution spatial data, that has provided an effective means for detailed land cover mapping, especially for a small island area. Selecting suitable UAV-acquired data and exploring the combined use of UAV multitype data are of significance for island mapping. Nine classification models were established through a fusion method of visible, multispectral, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data acquired by UAVs. A two-level hierarchical land cover classification (level 1 and level 2) of the Donkey Island in China was performed using geographic object-based image analysis with random forest classifier. We investigated the performance of land cover classification models containing different sets of features (spectral, height, intensity, and shape features extracted from UAV data) and evaluated the importance of various features. The results demonstrate that the overall accuracy (OA) of the models generally increase with decreasing detail and the amount of information entering the classification process. The OA achieved range from 82.08% to 92.54% and 74.12% to 85.08% across the nine models for level 1 and level 2, respectively. The best result was achieved with a model combining all features based on multispectral and LIDAR data. Height and intensity information input significantly affect the quality of classification models positively, with height apparently more significant than LIDAR information. When comparing different features, spectral features prominently assist in discriminating land cover classes. The importance of height and intensity features to classification accuracy varies for the classification models, showing greater importance in models based on visible data.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria of sentinel lymph node micrometastasis or macrometastasis based on tissue rinse liquid-based cytology in gynecological cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aimed to establish intraoperative diagnostic criteria of sentinel lymph node (SLN) micro-/macrometastasis on the basis of tissue rinse liquid-based cytology (TRLBC) in gynecological cancer. Methods We enrolled 214 patients with gynecological cancer who underwent rapid diagnosis of SLN metastasis on the basis of TRLBC from a total of 490 SLNs. For slides that were classified as positive for atypical cells on cytological inspection, we counted the number of clusters (an atypical cell mass consisted of three or more cells) and the number of single cells (an atypical cell other than clusters). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to determine the efficiency of predicting SLN micro-/macrometastasis. Results On cytological inspection, 36 slides were classified as positive for atypical cells, while 21 slides (4.3%) were true positive, 15 (3.1%) were false positive, and 454 (92.6%) were true negative. There were no false negative results in this study. The area under the ROC curve for the number of cluster was superior to that for the number of single cells for distinguishing micro-/macrometastasis from negative/isolated tumor cells (0.86 vs. 0.67,P = 0.032). The optimum cut-off value of the number of clusters was 5 for distinguishing these two categories. Conclusions TRLBC is a highly sensitive alternative for detecting SLN metastasis as a rapid intraoperative diagnosis. Counting the number of atypical cell clusters might be useful for distinguishing micro-/macrometastasis from isolated tumor cells.

TI  - Landsat-7 and ASTER remote sensing satellite imagery for identification of iron skarn mineralization in metamorphic regions
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite remote sensing imagery for mineral exploration is a fast and low-cost approach for indicating high potential zones. Exploration of iron skarn mineralization in metamorphic regions is challenging during the fieldwork campaign. In this study, Landsat-7 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery were used for mapping alteration zones and geological structures associated with iron skarn mineralization in the Galali region, NW, Iran. Band ratio and Directed Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) and Automatic Lineament Extraction methods were applied to Landsat-7 data. Relative Absorption Band Depth (RBD) and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) algorithms were implemented to ASTER data. Fieldwork and laboratory analysis were conducted to verify the remote sensing results. Results indicate that propylitic alteration zone and intersection of N-S and NW-SE and curvilinear features are typically associated with iron skarn mineralization and some high potential zones are identified for future exploration projects.

TI  - Characterisation of Landslide using InSAR Technique and Electrical Resistivity Method at Paya Terubong, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground movement is common around hilly areas; as such, there is a need to investigate the activities of the ground surface and subsurface of such regions. This research presents an application of the Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique and electrical resistivity (ER) method for the measurement of ground deformations and investigation of the subsurface features, respectively, at Paya Terubong, Penang Island. The PS-InSAR is an instrument for detecting patterns of deformation over a wide region, while the ER approach is used to image subsurface characteristics and measure the resistivity of the rock formation. Satellite data obtained from Sentinel-1A (S-1A) were used to detect some active ground deformation zones. The velocity of - 41 mm/Yr was discovered along the line of sight (LOS) of the system, indicating subsidence. An ER survey was performed at the topsoil within 5 m depth based on the ground deformation patterns detected through the InSAR technique. Two-dimensional (2-D) resistivity lines were laid using the ABEM SAS4000 Terameter and a dipole-dipole array with an electrode spacing of 2.5 m. The areas with low values of resistivity ranging between 0 and 20 omega m were classified as saturated zones. The efflux and influx of subsurface water when the layers of rocks are lubricated and downcutting of steep slopes are among the suspected causes of deformation. The application of the two techniques has improved the understanding of both the surface and subsurface mechanisms, reduced variation in the results, and allowed the investigation of active landslide areas.

TI  - m6A RNA methylation impacts fate choices during skin morphogenesis
T2  - ELIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - N-6-methyladenosine is the most prominent RNA modification in mammals. Here, we study mouse skin embryogenesis to tackle m6A's functions and physiological importance. We first landscape the m6A modifications on skin epithelial progenitor mRNAs. Contrasting with in vivo ribosomal profiling, we unearth a correlation between m6A modification in coding sequences and enhanced translation, particularly of key morphogenetic signaling pathways. Tapping physiological relevance, we show that m6A loss profoundly alters these cues and perturbs cellular fate choices and tissue architecture in all skin lineages. By single-cell transcriptomics and bioinformatics, both signaling and canonical translation pathways show significant downregulation after m6A loss. Interestingly, however, many highly m6A-modified mRNAs are markedly upregulated upon m6A loss, and they encode RNA-methylation, RNA-processing and RNA-metabolism factors. Together, our findings suggest that m6A functions to enhance translation of key morphogenetic regulators, while also destabilizing sentinel mRNAs that are primed to activate rescue pathways when m6A levels drop.

TI  - Impact of urbanization and land surface temperature changes in a coastal town in Kerala, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and unscientific developments have resulted in large-scale degradation of the environment around major cities all over the world. The problem is acute in many tropical and sub-tropical Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) having high population density and are undergoing rapid economic developments. Lack of adequate studies to contain the ill-effects of developments is major challenge before the decision makers at different levels. In this paper, an attempt has been carried out to examine the spatio-temporal changes in urban growth and land surface temperature (LST) responses in a coastal city in SW India, the Thiruvananthapuram city (Kerala) that enjoys a tropical wet climate, as an example. Landsat imageries of 1988, 2000 and 2019 have been used to estimate the extent of urban growth and LST changes. The study revealed a marked decrease in vegetation cover (125-71 km(2)) and barren land (7-4 km(2)) in the area during 1988-2019. The built-up area showed a marked increase from 10 to 68 km(2). It was noticed that the average LST has been increased from 26.5 degrees C to 28.1 degrees C during the study period. The study stresses the imminent need for strengthening the extent of green cover in the area and make developments more environment-friendly.

TI  - CALIOP V4 cloud thermodynamic phase assignment and the impact of near-nadir viewing angles
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of thermodynamic cloud phase is critical for establishing the radiative impact of clouds on climate and weather. Depolarization of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 532 nm signal provides a useful addition to other methods of thermodynamic phase discrimination that rely on temperature, cloud top altitude or a temperature-based cloud phase climatology. Active detection of the thermodynamic phase of multiple cloud layers in a vertical column using cloud layer-integrated depolarization and backscatter also alleviates ambiguities in cloud phase determination by passive radiometers. The CALIOP phase algorithm primarily uses vertically integrated cloud layer depolarization and attenuated backscatter to determine the dominant thermodynamic phase of hydrometeors present in a cloud layer segment, at horizontal resolutions for cloud layer detection varying between 333m and 80 km, with cloud layer vertical resolutions between 60m and 8 km. CALIOP ice cloud backscatter observations taken with a 0.3 degrees near-nadir view between June 2006 and November 2007 include a significant amount of specular reflection from hexagonal smooth crystal faces that are oriented perpendicularly to the incident lidar beam (horizontally oriented ice - HOI). These specular reflections from HOI are shown here to occur between 0 and -40 degrees C, with a peak in the CALIOP distribution observed globally at -15 degrees C. Recent viewing angle testing occurring during 2017 at 1, 1.5 and 2 degrees and reported here quantifies the impact of changing the viewing angle on these specular reflections and verifies earlier observations by POLDER. These viewing angle tests show that at the 15 degrees C peak of the HOI distribution the mean backscatter from all ice clouds decreases by 50% and depolarization increases by a factor of 5 as the viewing angle increases from 0.3 to 3 degrees. To avoid these specular reflections, the CALIOP viewing angle was changed from 0.3 to 3 degrees in November 2007, and since then CALIOP has been observing clouds almost continuously for 12-13 more years. This has provided more data for a thorough re-evaluation of phase determination and has motivated changes to the CALIOP cloud phase algorithm for Version 4 (V4). The V4 algorithm now excludes over-identification of HOI at 3 degrees, particularly in cold clouds. The V4 algorithm also considers cloud layer temperature at the 532 nm centroid and has been streamlined for more consistent identification of water and ice clouds. In V4 some cloud layer boundaries have changed because 532 nm layer-integrated attenuated backscatter in V4 has increased due to improved calibration and extended layer boundaries, while the corresponding depolarization has stayed about the same. There are more V4 cloud layers detected and, combined with increasing cloud edges, the V4 total atmospheric cloud volume increases by 6%-9% over V3 for high-confidence cloud phases and by 1%-2% for all cloudy bins. Collocated CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) observations of ice and water cloud particle microphysical indices complement the CALIOP ice and water cloud phase determinations.

TI  - Collective property rights reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we draw on common-pool resource theory to argue that indigenous territories, when granted full property rights, will be effective at curbing deforestation. Using satellite data, we test the effect of property rights on deforestation between 1982 and 2016. In order to identify causal effects, we combine a regression discontinuity design with the orthogonal timing of homologation. We find that observations inside territories with full property rights show a significant decrease in deforestation, while the effect does not exist in territories without full property rights. While these are local average treatment effects, our results suggest that not only do indigenous territories serve a human-rights role, but they are a cost-effective way for governments to preserve their forested areas. First, obtaining full property rights is crucial to recognize indigenous peoples' original right to land and protect their territories from illegal deforestation. Second, when implemented, indigenous property rights reduce deforestation inside indigenous territories in the Amazon rainforest, and could provide an important positive externality for Brazil and the rest of the world in terms of climate change mitigation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection in oral cancer: a within-patient comparison between [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-tilmanocept and [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-nanocolloid
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has proven to reliably stage the clinically negative neck in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept may be of benefit in OSCC with complex lymphatic drainage patterns and close spatial relation to SLNs. Methods A prospective within-patient evaluation study was designed to compare [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept with [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid for SLN detection. A total of 20 patients with early-stage OSCC were included, who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with both tracers. Both lymphoscintigraphic images of each patient were evaluated for SLN detection and radiotracer distribution at 2-4 h post-injection. Results The injection site's remaining radioactivity was significantly lower for [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (29.9%), compared with [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid (60.9%;p < 0.001). Radioactive uptake in SLNs was significantly lower for [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (1.95%) compared with [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid (3.16%;p = 0.010). No significant difference was seen in SLN to injection site ratio in radioactivity between [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (0.066) and [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid (0.054;p = 0.232). A median of 3.0 and 2.5 SLNs were identified with [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept and [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.297). Radioactive uptake in higher echelon nodes was not significantly different between [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (0.57%) and [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid (0.86%) (p = 0.052). A median of 2.0 and 2.5 higher echelon nodes was identified with [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept and [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.083). Conclusion [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept had a higher injection site clearance, but at the same time a lower uptake in the SLN, resulting in an SLN to injection site ratio, which was not significantly different from [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid. The relatively low-radioactive uptake in SLNs of [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept may limit intraoperative detection of SLNs, but can be overcome by a higher injection dose.

TI  - Melanoma andCOVID-19: A narrative review focused on treatment
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is the most severe form of skin cancer and its incidence has increased over the past few decades. COVID-19 pandemic affected the diagnosis and management of many diseases including melanoma. In this study, we aimed to provide a review focused on the diagnosis and management of melanoma in the era of COVID-19. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using the keywords "melanoma," "coronavirus," "COVID 19," and "SARS-CoV-2." The relevant guidelines published by the European Society for Medical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network were also included. The current guidelines recommend that surgical interventions for new diagnosis of invasive primary melanoma, patients with postoperative complications, wide resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy for newly diagnosed T3-T4 melanoma, and planned surgical procedures for patients in neo-adjuvant trials should be prioritized. Surgical treatment of T3/T4 melanomas should be prioritized over T1/T2 melanomas except for any melanoma in which large clinical residual lesion is visible. Adjuvant therapies can be postponed for up to 12 weeks depending on the local center circumstances. PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy is recommended for patients starting immunologic therapy. Combination immunotherapy is still considered suitable for patients with higher-risk disease. Encorafenib and binimetinib should be prioritized for patients requiring BRAF-targeted therapy due to the lower chance of symptoms mimicking COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Quantifying surface severity of the 2014 and 2015 fires in the Great Slave Lake area of Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this paper was the development of surface organic layer severity maps for the 2014 and 2015 fires in the Great Slave Lake area of the Northwest Territories and Alberta, Canada, using multiple linear regression models generated from pairing field data with Landsat 8 data. Field severity data were collected at 90 sites across the region, together with other site metrics, in order to develop a mapping approach for surface severity, an important metric for assessing carbon loss from fire. The approach utilised a combination of remote sensing indices to build a predictive model of severity that was applied within burn perimeters. Separate models were created for burns in the Shield and Plain ecoregions using spectral data from Landsat 8. The final Shield and Plain models resulted in estimates of surface severity with 0.74 variance explained (R-2) for the Plain ecoregions and 0.67 for the Shield. The 2014 fires in the Plain ecoregion were more severe than the 2015 fires and fires in both years in the Shield ecoregion. In further analysis of the field data, an assessment of relationships between surface severity and other site-level severity metrics found mixed results.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their causes for the last 30 years from 1987 to 2017, covering an area of about 7673.87 km(2)in Hangar Watershed, Ethiopia. The LULC maps were produced from three Landsat images of 1987 (Landsat-5 TM), 2001 (Landsat-7 ETM+) and 2017 (Landsat-8 OLI_TIRS) through pixel-based supervised image classification. The results indicated that there were an expansion in cultivated land (by + 24%, + 6%, and + 28%) and built-up area (by + 22%, + 19%, and + 37%) for LULC of corresponding years 1987-2001, 2001-2017 and 1987-2017. Whereas, there was a decrease in the forest (by - 20%, - 15% and - 32%), rangeland (by - 28%, - 13% and - 37%), grassland (by - 65%, - 6% and - 67%) and water body (by - 2%, - 54% and - 55%) for LULC of 1987-2001, 2001-2017 and 1987-2017 correspondingly. The major causes of these changes were identified as population expansion associated with increasing agricultural expansion, big tree clearing for building and wood extraction for fuel. The extraction of wood for fuel and building should be limited and legally managed, awareness of land use/land cover change hazard should be given for the community so that they shift the trends of land use and land cover change towards increasing vegetation covers which in turn can balance sediment yield.

TI  - Detection of the cloud liquid water path horizontal inhomogeneity in a coastline area by means of ground-based microwave observations: feasibility study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement of cloud modelling for global and regional climate and weather studies requires comprehensive information on many cloud parameters. This information is delivered by remote observations of clouds from ground-based and space-borne platforms using different methods and processing algorithms. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is one of the main obtained quantities. Previously, measurements of LWP by the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) and AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite instruments provided evidence for the systematic differences between LWP values over land and water areas in northern Europe. An attempt is made to detect such differences by means of ground-based microwave observations performed near the coastline of the Gulf of Finland in the vicinity of St Petersburg, Russia. The microwave radiometer (RPG-HATPRO, Radiometer Physics GmbH - Humidity And Temperature PROfiler), located 2.5 km from the coastline, is functioning in the angular scanning mode and is probing the air portions over land (at an elevation angle of 90 degrees) and over water (at seven elevation angles in the range 4.8-30 degrees). The influence of the land-sea LWP difference on the brightness temperature values in the 31.4 GHz spectral channel has been demonstrated, and the following features have been detected: (1) an interfering systematic signal is present in the 31.4 GHz channel, which can be attributed to the humidity horizontal gradient, (2) clouds over the opposite shore of the Gulf of Finland mask the LWP gradient effect. Preliminary results of the retrieval of LWP over water by the statistical regression method applied to the microwave measurements by HATPRO in the 31.4 and 22.24 GHz channels are presented. The monthly averaged results are compared to the corresponding values derived from the satellite observations by the SEVIRI instrument and from the reanalysis data.

TI  - Airport Detection Method Combined with Continuous Learning of Residual-Based Network on Remote Sensing Image
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the existing high-resolution and large-scale target remote sensing image object detection, the traditional method cannot achieve airport target recognition from optical remote sensing images quickly and accurately due to the single feature extraction and slow speed. Inspired by the hierarchical cognition of the human visual system, the continuous learning of residual-based convolution neural network (CLRNet) suitable for medium and high resolution optical remote sensing images is proposed. Firstly, the depth residual block is constructed as the feature extraction network. Secondly, the continuous learning method is used to fine tune the airport detection model from the massive remote sensing data. After continuous learning process, the model with strong robustness and low forgetting degree is obtained. The model can accurately and quickly identify airport from optical remote sensing images under massive and complex backgrounds. Our model has a better recognition effect for airports covered by thin clouds or incompletely captured by satellites. The domestic Jilin-1 satellite image dataset is selected for testing. Experiments show that the accuracy of the detection method mAP (IoU is not less than 0. 5) can reach 0.9613, and the detection speed can reach 0.23 s per scene.

TI  - Forest fire effects on sediment connectivity in headwater sub -catchments: Evaluation of indices performance
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires and post-fire practices influence the hydrological response of the soil in terms of runoff and sediment connectivity (SC). In this study, the ability of four indices (IC-Borselli, IC-Cavalli, IC-Persichillo and aggregated index of connectivity (AIC)) to assess SC was evaluated in three Mediterranean headwater sub-catchments (66, 143 and 194 ha) affected by an arson fire in 2012. Three temporal scenarios (before the fire, one year after the fire and two years after the fire including post-fire practices (salvage logging, skid trails and check dams)) and two computation targets (streams: hillslopechannel SC; and check-dams: hillslopeoutlet SC) were considered, obtaining 66 maps of SC at fine spatial resolution (2?m of cell size). Burn severity classes were estimated using Landsat-7 imagery and the dNBR index. The indices' output analysis included geomorphic (landscape units), mathematic (significance, percentiles and frequency distribution), fire (burn severity classes and unburnt areas) and sedimentological (measured specific sediment yield - SSY) criteria. The IC-Borselli and AIC were the most responsive approaches to the effects of fire on SC at catchment scale, whereas the IC-Persichillo was the most sensitive index to the increasing burn severities. The overlay between the fire severities and the geomorphic features appeared as a key aspect to understand the hydrological response at both the stream-system and outlet targets. We found a good and positive agreement between the measured SSY in the three check-dams and the changes in the estimated SCOUTLET due to the fire, especially with the IC-Borselli and AIC. For a better implementation of post-fire programs, we recommend SCOUTLET maps from AIC to assess sediment transport in streams, which is dominated by the deposition process, and SCSTREAM maps from IC-Borselli and AIC to place sediment control measures at hillslopes for intense rainfall events when effective sediment transport happens.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria is an epidemic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genusPlasmodiumand transmitted using the chew of infected female mosquitoes of the speciesAnopheles. The main objective of this research was to map malaria-risk hot-spot site for selected woredas of Jimma zone, Oromia region using GIS-based multicriteria analysis and RS technology applications. To achieve the objectives of the study, a retrospective comparative study design was employed using data from local health services. Over five years and climatic data (rainfall and temperature) collected, as well as environmental data, socioeconomic data were collected using household questionnaires. Sample study kebeles for questioners and r interview was conducted using purposive sampling technique. The malaria hazard assessed based on the environmental factors, computed using GIS-based multicriteria decision-evaluation technique (MCDE). 17.8%, 34.7%, 18.0%, 14.5% and 15.0% of the study area were exposed to very high, high, moderate, low and very low malaria hazard area, respectively. The final result output based on this approach is malaria-risk map. Then, it was produced from overlay analysis using (MCDE). The result revealed that, out of the total area (4136.9 km(2)), 29.8% very high, 30.7% high, 26.6% moderate, 10.2% low, and 2.7% of the areas are very low malaria-risk level, respectively. The result of the findings of large areas of the districts are in high-risk area of malaria. It will help to take successful measures for malaria control and eradication program and considered one of the most significant inputs used for any aspect of the planning, execution, monitoring and assessment of the woredas growth process as well as malaria eradication programmes.

TI  - Tracking changes in soil organic carbon across the heterogeneous agricultural landscape of the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) can improve the capacity of agricultural systems to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Despite its importance, the current understanding of the magnitude or even the direction of SOC change in agricultural landscapes is limited. While changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and climate are among the main drivers of changes in SOC, their relative importance for the spatiotemporal assessment of SOC is unclear. This study evaluated LULC and SOC dynamics using archived and recent soil samples, remote sensing, and digital soil mapping in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. We combined both pixel- and object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery to assess LULC changes from 1984 to 2018. We achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and kappa coefficient of 0.77 for LULC classification using a random forest model. For predicting SOC for the same time period, we applied soil and vegetation indices derived from Landsat images, topographic indices, historic soil survey variables, and climate data in a random forest model. The SOC prediction of 2018 resulted in a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.67, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76, and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.12. For 1984, the SOC prediction accuracies were 0.46, 0.58, and 0.18 for R-2, CCC, and nRMSE, respectively. We detected SOC loss in 61%, gain in 12%, while 27% remained unchanged across the study area. Although we detected large losses of SOC due to LULC change, the majority of the SOC losses across the landscape were attributed to areas that were remained in the same type of agricultural production since 1984. Climate variability did not, however, have a strong effect on SOC changes. These results can inform decision making in the study area to support sustainable LULC management for enhancing SOC sequestration.

TI  - Corbicula fluminea : A sentinel species for urban Rare Earth Element origin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the global population, coupled with growing consumption of Rare Earth Elements (REEs), has led to increasing transfer of these emerging contaminants into the environment, particularly through the effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The objectives of this study were to determine the geochemical quality of a French river subject to strong urban pressure (the Jalle River in the Bordeaux area) and to examine the bioavailability of natural and anthropogenic REEs in a model species of freshwater bivalve, the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. To this end, two fractions (dissolved and total) of the water from the Jalle River were sampled and the bivalves were exposed by in situ caging during a three-month monitoring period. The REE patterns obtained showed the presence of Gadolinium (Gd) anomalies in the dissolved and total fractions as well as in Corbicula fluminea. The apparent bioavailability of natural REEs was in the following order for the dissolved fraction: Medium REEs (MREEs) > Light REEs (LREEs) > Heavy REEs (HREEs) and for the particulate fraction: MREEs > LREEs = HREEs. These results highlight the importance of the particulate fraction in the study of the bioavailability of REEs in bivalves. An increase of anthropogenic Gd (Gd-anth) was observed in the dissolved fraction between the upstream site (3.4 ng.L-1) and the WWTP Downstream site (48.4 ng.L-1). The Gd anomaly observed in the water was also observed in Corbicula fluminea with a significant increase in the bioaccumulation of Gd-anth, from 1.5 +/- 1 ng.g(DW)(-1) upstream to 4.1 +/- 0.7 ng.g(DW)(-1) downstream of the WWTP effluents, thus confirming the enhanced bioavailability of medical-origin Gd to freshwater bivalves. This study strongly suggests that Corbicula fluminea can be used as a sentinel species in the monitoring of Gd contamination of medical origin. It would thus appear important to consider the potential entry of this contaminant into the human food chain via other, commercially exploited bivalve species.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the month of May 2019, Ms Priya Vaidehi who works as a chartered accountant in a small firm in the city of Pune was pondering about her personal investment. While surfing on social media on the sunny hot afternoon of 2 May 2019, she came across the news of the biggest merger deal in the Indian telecom sector. The news was about how Britain's Vodafone Group merged its Indian subsidiary with Idea Cellular, to create the country's largest telecom firm. They mentioned how the combined entity will accelerate the pan-India expansion of wireless broadband services and also expand financial inclusion through mobile money services. Since the merger, the network has an outreach of 92 per cent of population of India.Ms Vaidehi planning for her future investments narrowed down her investment search to do a deeper analysis of the merger of two telecom giants Vodafone and Idea. The Indian telecommunication market has a subscriber base of 1.20 billion and is rapidly growing. The country's wireless subscriptions has witnessed compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.62 per cent to reach 1,183.41 million in the year 2018. Over the past few years, from the announcement of merger to the declaration of completion of merger, she has noticed that there has been volatility in the share price of Idea Cellular. Though the subscriber base of Vodafone, Idea's is around 400 million, and sales had gone up 53.5 per cent in the third quarter of FY 2018-2019, but the share price had been plunging to an average fall of 14 per cent. She was in deep thought whether she should invest in buying the shares of Vodafone Idea? Will her instinct help her or the knowledge of financial markets aid in taking the right decision?

TI  - Insights of Forest Dynamics for the Regional Ecological Fragility Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a vital role in sustaining various life forms on the earth. These ecosystems support society through the provision of goods (timber, fuelwood, etc.) and an array of ecological services (carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, etc.). However, unplanned developmental activities have been affecting the ecological integrity evident from the fragmentation of forests, barren hilltops, conversion of perennial streams to intermittent or seasonal streams, etc. During the past three decades, forests have undergone major transitions with the breaking of contiguous native forests into small parcels of land, restricting the movement of species thereby limiting the potential of species for dispersal and colonization. This paper analyzes the landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of forests fragmentation of Shimoga District, Central Western Ghats and prioritizes ecologically fragile or Ecologically Sensitive regions (ESR) at village levels based on bio-geo-climatic-social variables with the land use dynamics considering temporal remote sensing data. Results revealed that there was a net loss of 10% in forest cover from 43.83% (1973) to 34.02% (2018), primarily caused by the expansion of agriculture, horticulture, and forest plantations. Forest fragmentation has increased, evident from the decline of the interior forest to an extent of 11% from 26% (1973-2018). ESR prioritization at village level in the Shimoga district considering the ecological, geo-climatic and social variables indicate that 11% villages are ESR 1 (highest sensitivity), 30% are in ESR 2 (higher sensitivity), 36% are in ESR 3 (high sensitivity) and the remaining 23% are in ESR 4 or moderate sensitivity category. The analysis illustrates the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of landscape structure for sustainable management of tropical forests.

AB  - Objective Extending the superior border of the breast tangent fields to include the low axilla is a technique employed to target the axillary lymph node (LN) without adding additional fields. This technique, commonly referred to as high tangents, is typically done in the supine position. The feasibility of delivering high tangents in the prone position has never been reported. Methods Patients from 2012 to 2018 at a single institution who were prescribed treatment with high tangents using two tangentially opposed beams in the prone position were identified. The levels I-III axillary LNs were retrospectively contoured. The dose delivered to the LN, breast, and organs at risk was calculated using the original treatment plan. For LN, coverage was defined as > 90% of the prescribed dose. Results Forty-one patients treated with high tangents were identified. The median age was 62. Most patients underwent sentinel LN biopsy (88%), of which 59% had macroscopic disease and 30% had micrometastatic disease. Four patients had no axillary staging. Most patients (76%) were treated with hypofractionated radiation. The median distance from the superior border of the anterior oblique field to the humeral head was 0.6 cm (range: 0-1.5 cm). The mean coverage of the level I and level II axilla was 88.7% and 40.0% respectively. Axillary level I coverage for distance from the humeral head < 1 cm was 95.1%, whereas distance > 1 cm was 76.4% (p = 0.017). Conclusions This series demonstrates the feasibility of high tangents in the prone position, offering good coverage of level I LN, particularly with < 1 cm distance from the humeral head.

TI  - Don't rely too much on trees: Evidence from flood mitigation in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining a popular flood disaster dataset with climate data and satellite land cover data from China, this paper estimates how forests mitigate the frequency of flooding, resulting in two major findings. First, we confirm that an increase in forest area mitigates the possibility of flood occurrence even after controlling for socioeconomic and meteorological variables and time-invariant individual effects. Second, broadleaf trees and mixed-tree forests have a flood mitigation effect, whereas coniferous trees do not; these results are robust against alternative model specifications. This paper newly corroborates the concept of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction. While there is an emerging consensus that ecosystems can mitigate natural disasters, there is limited evidence on how ecosystems mitigate disasters. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to show that the type of forest is critical for mitigating floods in a rigorous econometric way (survival analysis) spanning numerous areas of interest.

TI  - Semi-Global Stereo Matching of Remote Sensing Images Combined with Speeded up Robust Features
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The semi-global stereo matching (SGM) for remote sensing images is sensitive to noise and produces fringes in the areas with discontinuous disparity and weak texture, resulting in a low matching rate. An SGM algorithm for remote sensing images combined with speeded up robust features (SURF) is proposed herein. First, SURF is used to calculate feature-matching points and the main directions of the feature points in remote sensing images, and a fast nearest neighbor search algorithm is applied to eliminate the inaccurate matching points. Then, the Census transformation is used to calculate the matching cost of the two remote sensing images, and the path weight of the SGM algorithm in a different convergence path direction is adjusted by the main direction of the feature points. Finally, improved weighted joint bilateral filtering (WJBF) method is applied to refine the disparity to remove noise and fringes in the disparity maps. Experiments arc performed on WorldView, IKONOS, and SuperView-1 remote sensing image datasets. Results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the contrast algorithms in both subjective and objective evaluation indexes, effectively eliminating the fringes and noise in weak texture and disparity discontinuity area and improves the stereo-matching accuracy.

TI  - Comparison of two deep learning methods for ship target recognition with optical remotely sensed data
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of modern marine monitoring systems, ship target identification has important significance in maintaining marine rights and monitoring maritime traffic. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, image detection and recognition based on deep learning methods have become the most popular and practical method. In this paper, two deep learning algorithms, the Mask R-CNN algorithm and the Faster R-CNN algorithm, are used to build ship target feature extraction and recognition models based on deep convolutional neural networks. The established models were compared and analyzed to verify the feasibility of target detection algorithms. In this study, 5748 remote sensing maps were selected as the dataset for experiments, and two algorithms were used to classify and extract warships and civilian ships. Experiments showed that for the accuracy of ship identification, Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN reached 95.21% and 92.76%, respectively. These results demonstrated that the Mask R-CNN algorithm achieves pixel-level segmentation. Compared with the Faster R-CNN algorithm, the obtained target detection effect is more accurate, and the performance in target detection and classification is better, which reflects the great advantage of pixel-level recognition.

TI  - The human-environment nexus and vegetation-rainfall sensitivity in tropical drylands
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is projected to lead to an increase in both the areal extent and degree of aridity in the world's drylands. At the same time, the majority of drylands are located in developing countries where high population densities and rapid population growth place additional pressure on the ecosystem. Thus, drylands are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and large-scale environmental degradation. However, little is known about the long-term functional response of vegetation to such changes induced by the interplay of complex human-environmental interactions. Here we use time series of satellite data to show how vegetation productivity in relation to water availability, which is a major aspect of vegetation functioning in tropical drylands, has changed over the past two decades. In total, one-third of tropical dryland ecosystems show significant (P < 0.05) changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity with pronounced differences between regions and continents. We identify population as the main driver of negative changes, especially for developing countries. This is contrasted by positive changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity in richer countries, probably resulting from favourable climatic conditions and/or caused by an intensification and expansion of human land management. Our results highlight geographic and economic differences in the relationship between vegetation-rainfall sensitivity and associated drivers in tropical drylands, marking an important step towards the identification, understanding and mitigation of potential negative effects from a changing world on ecosystems and human well-being.Drylands are under pressure from climate change and population growth. This study finds the sensitivity of dryland vegetation to rainfall changing, with opposite effects in poorer and richer nations.

TI  - Vertical influence of temperature and precipitation on snow cover variability in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow cover in mountainous areas is a key source of water for downstream regions. The snow cover area (SCA) in the Northern Hemisphere has significantly decreased during the past decades in response to global warming. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the primary factors controlling the spatiotemporal variabilities in the SCA in high altitude regions. In this study, based on remote sensing data of SCA, temperature, and precipitation in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, Pearson's correlation analysis was used to identify the relative importance of temperature and precipitation on the SCA variability with altitude. The results showed that temperature played a more dominant role for the SCA than precipitation at all elevation during the period 2001-2017; three threshold altitudes at high, moderate, and low elevation were identified, and these threshold altitudes are dynamic and vary with time; the threshold altitude at high elevation was 5,925 +/- 125 m, below which temperature (precipitation) was negatively (positively) correlated and above which temperature (precipitation) was positively (negatively) correlated with the SCA; the threshold altitude at moderate elevation was 3,200 +/- 300 m, below which temperature (precipitation) was positively (negatively) correlated and above which temperature (precipitation) was negatively (positively) correlated with the SCA; the threshold altitude in low elevation regions was 2,100 +/- 200 m. This study sheds light on the dominant climatic control factors on the variability in SCA in high altitude regions. These results have major implications for SCA and water resources availability under future climate change.

TI  - OBIA4RTM-towards an operational open-source solution for coupling object-based image analysis with radiative transfer modelling
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer models (RTM) provide universally applicable, highly accurate prospects for plant parameter retrieval. Due to the ill-posed nature of radiative transfer theory, however, the retrieval of plant parameters requires sophisticated strategies for model inversion. We argue that object-based image analysis (OBIA) works as an effective regularization measure to cope with this ill-posedness. Despite similar findings reported in the literature, OBIA and RTM are rarely used in a combined manner. Additionally, there is a clear lack of software solutions ready for operational usage. Therefore, we propose OBIA4RTM as an approach to combine OBIA and RTM using Python and PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial databases in a fully Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant way. First results obtained in agricultural regions in southern Germany and Austria using Sentinel-2 data during the 2017 and 2018 growing season show root mean squared errors (RMSE) in the leaf area index (LAI) of 1.47 m(2)/m(2) in the case of silage maize and 1.31 m(2)/m(2) in the case of winter cereals. Issues of integrating space and time as well as defining appropriate validation strategies, however, require further research.

TI  - Estimation of hourly average illuminance under clear sky conditions in Chongqing
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based methods are proposed for the estimation of clear day average hourly illuminance from satellite data under local climate conditions. First, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data collected using a ground-based sun photometer were used to calibrate the satellite remote sensing AOD data. Next, we screened for the factors affecting the illuminance of clear sky and detected three important factors, namely the sine of the solar altitude angle, aerosol optical thickness, and atmospheric precise water content. Finally, based on the AOD data of satellite remote sensing, combined with the local illumination data and meteorological data, a clear sky average hourly illumination model in Chongqing was established via the regression method. There was good agreement between the calculated and the measured values of clear day average hourly illuminance, with a root mean square difference and mean bias difference of 22% and -0.05%, respectively. The model was used to map clear day annual, quarterly, and monthly average hourly illuminance. The maps show the clear day annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of average hourly illuminance in Chongqing.

TI  - Forest Owners' Willingness to Implement Measures to Safeguard Biodiversity: Values, Attitudes, Ecological Worldview and Forest Ownership Objectives
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective implementation and development of conservation schemes to which participation of forest owners is voluntary, requires an understanding of forest owners' views on measures to safeguard forest biodiversity. The Forest Biodiversity Program for Southern Finland is currently the most important instrument of voluntary forest conservation in Finland. The aim of this study is to explore what kind of methods the forest owners are willing to implement to safeguard biodiversity in their own forests and to identify forest owner groups based on these views. The aim is also to compare forest owners' values, attitudes, endorsement of an ecological worldview and objectives for forest ownership as well as the background characteristics in these groups. The data were collected in 2015, by a nationwide mail survey sent to 3000 Finnish family forest owners (n = 1035). Five forest owner types were identified:Conservationists, Moderate conservationists, Compensation oriented, Promoters of biodiversity through forest managementandUninterested. Previous experience of implementation of voluntary measures to safeguard biodiversity and positive attitudes towards conservation were important in explaining the willingness to adopt conservation measures. The results can be utilized in developing voluntary conservation programs and in targeting advisory services related to biodiversity protection to different forest owner groups more accurately. The results support the need for flexible voluntary conservation programs, including a large variety of mechanisms to protect nature values in family owned forests.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focused on the recent flood inundation (July 2020) that occurred in the lower Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains (IGBP) using concurrent C-band Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar images in Google Earth Engine. The study exhibited that a substantial proportion of IGBP (40,929 km(2)) was inundated primarily in Bangladesh (9.09% of the total inundation), Assam (8.99%), and Bihar (6.29%) during June-July 2020. The severe impact of flood inundation was observed in croplands (4.41% of the total cropland), followed by settlements (20.98% of the total settlements) that affected a large population (similar to 10,046,262) in IGBP. The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has debilitated the efforts of mitigation and responses to flooding risks. The study necessitates adopting an integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder approach with an emphasis on self-reliance of the community for sustenance with local resources and practices.

TI  - How robust are landslide susceptibility estimates?
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of contemporary landslide research is concerned with predicting and mapping susceptibility to slope failure. Many studies rely on generalised linear models with environmental predictors that are trained with data collected from within and outside of the margins of mapped landslides. Whether and how the performance of these models depends on sample size, location, or time remains largely untested. We address this question by exploring the sensitivity of a multivariate logistic regression-one of the most widely used susceptibility models-to data sampled from different portions of landslides in two independent inventories (i.e. a historic and a multi-temporal) covering parts of the eastern rim of the Fergana Basin, Kyrgyzstan. We find that considering only areas on lower parts of landslides, and hence most likely their deposits, can improve the model performance by >10% over the reference case that uses the entire landslide areas, especially for landslides of intermediate size. Hence, using landslide toe areas may suffice for this particular model and come in useful where landslide scars are vague or hidden in this part of Central Asia. The model performance marginally varied after progressively updating and adding more landslides data through time. We conclude that landslide susceptibility estimates for the study area remain largely insensitive to changes in data over about a decade. Spatial or temporal stratified sampling contributes only minor variations to model performance. Our findings call for more extensive testing of the concept of dynamic susceptibility and its interpretation in data-driven models, especially within the broader framework of landslide risk assessment under environmental and land-use change.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the eastern part of the Gediz Graben, especially in the Sarigol region, surface deformations that occurred without destructive earthquakes or that continue to occur are frequently observed from the 1969 Alasehir earthquake to the present. Especially in areas where aseismic and tectonic effects are thought to co-exist, such as the Gediz Graben, the general deformation character of the study area cannot be identified precisely from the surface deformations that are determined using the GNSS method as pointwise. However, the general deformation character of the study area can be identified clearly by determining the surface deformations of the study area with the PSInSAR method areally. In this study, in order to determine surface deformations that may be caused by aseismic and/or tectonic effects in the Gediz Graben areally, deformations in the direction of Line of Sight (LOS) were determined by using the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) method. In order to determine movements in the LOS direction, TERRASAR-X Stripmap satellite radar images of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) were used. According to the evaluations obtained from the PSInSAR results, it is understood that while there are subsidences in the graben area of the Gediz Graben, there are uplifts in the north and south of the graben. The subsidence values in the graben were obtained to be approximately - 50 mm/year. This result indicates that in addition to creep movement of tectonic origin in the study area, the local soil characteristics and/or seasonal groundwater changes may also increase deformation in areas where deformation occurs.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study, first of its kind in the Kashmir Valley, uses a time series of satellite data (1980-2018) to determine the glacier health, which is critical for sustaining the perenniality of the rivers originating from the area. The role of topography, morphology and climate on the observed glacier recession was investigated. In total, 147 glaciers were mapped from 1980 image; similar to 72% of the glaciers have area <= 3 km(2) and a majority of them (123) are having size < 1 km(2). The glaciers have reduced from 101.73 +/- 16.79 km(2) in 1980 to 72.41 +/- 4.7 km(2) in 2018 showing a recession of 29.32 +/- 12.09 km(2) during the period (28.82%). The observed glacier loss is higher (0.77 +/- 0.31 km(2)a(-1)) compared with the other Himalayan regions. The results indicated that there is strong influence of altitude, aspect, slope and climate on glacier recession. The glaciers with area <= 1 km(2) have receded significantly more (41.20 +/- 6.20%) than the larger glaciers > 3 km(2) in area (15.97 +/- 5.13%). The glaciers situated between 4200 and 4400 m altitudes have receded more (similar to 55 +/- 5.01%) than those situated at altitudes > 4800 m (similar to 19 +/- 6.9%). Furthermore, the glaciers with steep slope (> 25) have witnessed lower recession (0.25 +/- 0.15 km(2)a(-1)) compared to the glaciers with gentle slope (0.51 +/- 0.22 km(2)a(-1)). The south-facing glaciers showed higher recession (similar to 38%) compared with the north-facing glaciers (similar to 27%). The findings suggest that the increase in temperature and decline in winter solid precipitation have resulted in the glacier recession with the consequent depletion of the stream flows, which, if continued in the future, would adversely affect the economy in the region.

TI  - Impact of Wildfire on the Surface Energy Balance in Six California Case Studies
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the impact of wildfires on surface energy exchange through the assessment of six California wildfires that occurred in the last 20 years. A burned-unburned binary mask was generated from the MODIS approximate date of burn product and implemented into the Simplified Simple Biosphere model for a series of simulations. Model performance was evaluated against the North American Land Data Assimilation System and is found to simulate surface temperature and net radiation accurately. Simulations show a decrease in latent heat flux in every case study except the Rush fire, which occurred in Lassen County in August 2012. Post-fire changes in net radiation and sensible heat followed similar trends, decreasing in each of the domains except for the Rush and Cedar fires. The greatest changes in temporally-averaged net radiation occurred in the Rim (- 41.7 W m(-2)), Basin Complex (- 31.6 W m(-2)), and Rush (26.5 W m(-2)) fires. Initial increases in sensible heat flux, caused by the decrease in albedo from ash deposition, are balanced by decreases in latent heat flux in the Zaca, Rim, and Basin Complex case studies. Results also indicate a relationship between decreases in average sensible heat flux and leaf-area-index change. Wildfires that burn in sparsely vegetated areas are associated with increases in sensible heat flux, an effect that is magnified by long ash-deposition periods (i.e., Rush fire), while wildfires that burn in densely vegetated areas are associated with large decreases in sensible and latent heat flux (i.e., Rim, Basin Complex fires).

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Barley is one of the strategic agricultural products available in the world, and yield prediction is important for ensuring food security. One way of estimating a product is to use remote sensing data in conjunction with field data and meteorological data. One of the main issues surrounding this comprises the use of machine learning techniques to create a multi-resource data-based estimation model. Many studies have been conducted on barley yield prediction from planting to harvest. Still, the effect of different time intervals on yield prediction has not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of different periods on yield prediction has not been investigated. RESULTS In the present study, the whole growth period was divided into three parts. Using one of the major barley production areas in Iran, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated. In the first step, a model for integrating field data, remote sensing data and meteorological data was prepared. The results obtained show that, among the four machine learning methods implemented, the gaussian process regression algorithm performed best and estimated yield withr(2)= 0.84, root mean square error = 737 kg ha(-1)and mean absolute = 650 kg ha(-1), 1 month before harvest. CONCLUSION It was found that the estimation results change depending on different agricultural zones and temporal training settings. The findings of the present study provide a powerful potential tool for the yield prediction of barley using multi-source data and machine learning. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Modeling the effects of historical and future land use/land cover change dynamics on the hydrological response of Ashi watershed, northeastern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of anthropogenic activities in major river watersheds leading to alterations in the environment has triggered this study within the Ashi watershed of northeast China. Understanding individual land use/land cover (LULC) change contribution to watershed hydrology is vital for water resource planning, utilization of land resources and sustaining hydrological balance. This research investigates the influence of LULC alteration on the hydrology of the watershed from 1990 to 2014 and predicts LULC impacts on the hydrological components under different scenarios in 2030. Combined approach for Landsat images classification; Cellular-Automated (CA-Markov) for prediction and Soil and Water Assessment Tool were used. Partial least square regression (PLSR) model was applied to quantify the contribution of each LULC on hydrology. The results show that urban, water, agriculture, open canopy and other vegetation experienced an increment from 1990 to 2014. The predicted LULC for 2030 based on worst-case scenarios indicates urbanization and agriculture increase, while best-case scenario indicates a controlled expansion trend of urban and agriculture and regeneration of closed canopy. The changes in LULC increase stream flow (11.5%), surface runoff (86.6%), water yield (10.5%) but reduce lateral flow (64.9%), groundwater (27.9%) and ET (1%). Stream flow, water yield, surface runoff, lateral flow and evapotranspiration are expected to further increase under both scenarios, increasing more in the worst-case scenario. Urban, agriculture and close forest contributed in determining hydrological processes and are therefore chief environmental stressors in the Ashi watershed. This recommends regulating urban sprawl and agricultural activities to maintain hydrological balance.

TI  - Estimation of colored dissolved organic matter using Sentinel-2 data in the coastal waters of Singapore
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal waters, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is often present in moderate to high concentrations due to input from nearby landmasses and rivers. CDOM absorbs light sharply in the UV-blue region, causing waters to appear yellow or brown. This has a significant effect on optical and biogeochemical processes in coastal waters, as it inhibits the penetration of light within the water. It is thus important to be able to monitor CDOM levels on a regular basis. A model is presented linking Sentinel-2 reflectance data to the CDOM absorption coefficient. Such a model is useful for monitoring the CDOM absorption in coastal waters due to the frequency of Sentinel-2 passes and relatively high-spatial resolution. This model was developed and validated using concurrent field measurements of above-surface remote-sensing reflectance and the in situ CDOM absorption coefficient, from the coastal waters of Singapore. The leave-one-out cross-validation scheme was used to validate the model due to the small number of data points. The model is further tested with Sentinel-2 images of the same locations, not more than one day apart from the in situ measurements. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diagnosis of imported malaria cases in Henan Province from 2015 to 2019, so as to provide the evidence for malaria surveillance during the post-elimination stage.METHODS: The data pertaining to malaria cases in Henan Province from 2015 to 2019 were extracted via the web-based Chinese Information System for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention and the Parasitic Diseases Information Reporting Management System (PDIRMS) of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the diagnostic methods, diagnostic institutions and diagnostic time of imported malaria cases were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 952 imported malaria cases were reported in Henan Province during the period from 2015 through 2019, and all cases were laboratory-confirmed. The positive rate of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was 98.61% (779/790), which was significantly greater than that (94.22%, 897/952) of microscopic examinations (chi2 = 22.773, P < 0.05). The proportion of imported malaria cases diagnosed in medical institutions increased from 65.22% (120/184) in 2015 to 81.50% (185/227) in 2019. Among the 238 imported malaria cases diagnosed in centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), 71.01% (169/238) were diagnosed in county-level CDC, and among the 704 cases diagnosed in medical institutions, only 8.38% (59/704) were diagnosed at county-level medical institutions. The median time from onset to definitive diagnosis of malaria was 3 days, and the median duration between onset and initial diagnosis of malaria was 1 day. The duration between initial diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of malaria varied significantly among years (chi2 = 24.956, P < 0.05), and the interquartile range from initial diagnosis to definitive diagnosis reduced from 4 days in 2016 to 2 days in 2019. In addition, the median time from initial diagnosis to definitive diagnosis was significantly longer in severe falciparum malaria cases than in non-severe falciparum malaria cases (2 days vs. 1 day; Z = 7.557, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Medical institutions play a more and more important role in the identification and surveillance of malaria cases; however, the diagnostic capability of malaria remains low in county-level medical institutions. The diagnostic awareness and capability of county-level medical institutions requires to be improved, in order to play their roles as sentinel hospitals in the malaria surveillance during the post-elimination stage.

TI  - Regional-scale monitoring of underwater and dry ground subsidence in high phreatic areas of North China Plain
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence monitoring provides information required when developing land use plans and allows for proactive management of subsidence issues. However, it has been challenging to accurately detect land subsidence areas, especially those under waterbodies. This study evaluated the applicability of integrated use of the optical Landsat-8 OLI and microwave Sentinel-1A TOPSAR imagery to delineate subsidence areas and quantify subsidence rates in a typical coal mining area of North China Plain. An Enhanced Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (E-MNDWI) was combined with Short BAseline Subset-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) image to monitor underwater and dry ground subsidence. The results demonstrated that the method could delineate underwater and dry ground subsidence and quantify its rates accurately. The proposed method estimated subsidence area corresponded to 34.8% (16.7 km(2)) of the study area. The size of underwater subsidence areas was substantial and accounted for 43.7% of the subsidence areas. Seasonal underwater subsidence areas were generally distributed in the vicinity of perennial ones. Dry ground subsidence covered 9.4 km(2)of the study area and generally occurred in urban and rural residential areas with the maximum subsidence of up to 80.1 mm/year. This study demonstrates the efficiency and capacity of integrating optical and microwave images to monitor the subsidence progresses, which thus can help develop effective rehabilitation policy and strategy to mitigate the impacts of land subsidence.

TI  - [A nomogram to predict non-sentinel lymph node metastasis for breast cancer patients with positive axillary sentinel lymph node].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To identify the risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node (nSLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients with 1~2 positive axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) and construct an accurate prediction model. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed in 917 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery treatment between 2002 and 2017 and pathologically confirmed 1-2 positive SLNs. According to the date of surgery, patients were divided into training group (497 cases) and validation group (420 cases). A nomogram was built to predict nSLN metastasis and the accuracy of the model was validated. Results: Among the 917 patients, 251 (27.4%) had nSLN metastasis. Univariate analysis showed tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), extra-capsular extension (ECE), the number of positive and negative SLN and macro-metastasis of SLN were associated with nSLN metastasis (all P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed the numbers of positive SLN, negative SLN and macro-metastasis of SLN were independent predictors of nSLN metastasis (all P<0.05). A nomogram was constructed based on the 6 factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.718 for the training group and 0.742 for the validation group. Conclusion: We have developed a nomogram that uses 6 risk factors commonly available to accurately estimate the likelihood of nSLN metastasis for individual patient, which might be helpful for radiation oncologists to make a decision on regional nodal irradiation.

TI  - Surface roughness distribution map for Iraq using satellite data and GIS techniques
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study shows the potential of using the satellite data techniques that are supported by the GIS and remote sensing (RS) approaches to produce the roughness map for the surface of Iraq and any area in a very efficient manner. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generated using MODIS data acquired on 23 April 2015. Thirty-six points were used to build and verify the proposed model of surface roughness coefficient (n), which was correlated withNDVIlayer according to the types of soil cover and land use to create the predicted distributed roughness map. The results revealed that there has been a great match between the proposed surface roughness map produced in this study with the topographical map of Iraq. The results presented also that the minimum and maximum values of surface roughnessnwere located in the far south and far north of about 0.029 and o.16, respectively, whereas the concentrated value ofnwas scattered and ranged from 0.035 to 0.16 in north, central, and south parts of the study area. The statistical analysis resulted mean,R, andCOVvalues of 1.02, 0989, and 15.553% consecutively, which exposed the good accuracy and consistency of the predicted roughness map. Verification was conducted which revealed a good accuracy and consistency of the predicted roughness map.

TI  - An effective thread milling force prediction model considering instantaneous cutting thickness based on the cylindrical thread milling simplified to side milling process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective thread milling force prediction model considering instantaneous cutting thickness is presented based on the cylindrical thread milling simplified to the side milling process. Firstly, based on the thread milling process simplified to side milling, an effective calculation model of instantaneous cutting thickness and a milling force model of single-layer cutter teeth are established considering the specific geometric profile of the cutting edge, chip groove angle, and tooth profile angle of the threaded milling cutter. Then, according to the time-domain difference of each layer of cutter teeth, a simplified thread milling force prediction model corresponding to the number of layers can be obtained. Finally, comparing the predicted values of the proposed model with the experimental results of cylindrical thread milling forces, the results show that the average prediction accuracy ofF(x),F-y, andF(z)are 90.75%, 83.56%, and 78.79%, respectively. The established simplified cylindrical thread milling force prediction model is accurate and reliable.

TI  - Tropical cyclones impact on tropopause and the lower stratosphere vapour based on satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the deep convection systems, tropical cyclones (TCs) could significantly affect the thermodynamic structure and cloud microphysical processes near the tropopause, which may cause changes in troposphere and stratosphere water vapour activity, with important influences on global climate change. However, the effects of TCs on tropopause and the lower stratosphere water vapour remain unclear. Here, we use satellite data from year 2012 to 2016 to assess the effect of TCs on water vapour at the tropopause and in the lower stratosphere over the Northwest tropical Pacific Ocean. It is found that TCs could decrease the tropopause temperature and increase the process of water vapour deposition on cloud ice to a certain extent. This process can increase cloud ice mixing ratio and then dehydrate the tropopause. Part of the small cloud ice particles will be injected into the lower stratosphere, where they would be sublimated, hydrating the lower stratosphere. Compared to non-TC area, the average water vapours in TC area decrease about 1.04 ppmv near the tropopause, but increase by 0.75 ppmv in the lower stratosphere.

TI  - A systematic review of urban sprawl studies in India: a geospatial data perspective
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews articles published in the English language and using geospatial data in analysing the state of urban sprawl in India. India is not far behind in the unparalleled global phenomenon of urbanization, with it adding the highest number of urban dwellers by 2050. We review a total of 153 articles involving the use of remote sensing data for studying urban sprawl in India since it was first reported in the 1980s to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of urban sprawl studies since the year 2010 attributing to 72% of the total publications. This review helped in finding preferences as regards the most frequently studied city, platforms/sensors used, journals and the most active group carrying out urban sprawl studies. We then group the studies decade wise and report the major findings. Earlier studies mainly focused on the post-classification comparison of multi-temporal data. With the advancement of geospatial technology along with the ease of availability of satellite data, there has been a significant spurge in the number and quality of urban sprawl studies in the recent decades and involves advanced methods like spatial metrics, artificial neural network, object-based classification, and different kinds of modelling for future prediction of sprawl. Our findings suggest that sprawl research has evolved significantly over the years. With the availability of a large number of studies and copious amounts of data, the governmental agencies and large organizations should actively formulate a national-level database and incorporate these studies in various urban planning decisions.

TI  - Multi-decadal shoreline change analysis in coast of Thiruchendur Taluk, Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India, using remote sensing and DSAS techniques
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline position has been forwarding or retrograding due to many factors, among them climate change and human interferences play a major role. The shoreline changes can be analyzed by various methods. In the present study, Linear Regression Rate (LRR) method is applied for the demarcation of rate of shoreline changes along the coast of Thiruchendur Taluk, Thoothukudi district, by using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). It is an extension tool in ArcGIS. The length of the coast is 45 km. The coastal zone is further divided into three coastal zones based on their administrative division (panchayat union). The zones are Alwarthirunagiri coast, Thiruchendur coast, and Udankudi coast. These zone divisions are done for detailed mapping. Multi-date of remotely sensed data was used for mapping the details. These data are georeferenced with the UTM projection of WGS1984 and digitized the shorelines with the FCC color image. Transect lines were generated using DSAS tool. The transect lines starting from 752 to 1210 were used for present study to assess the shoreline changes. The tool had generated the LRR Statistic reports on each transect lines for all shorelines. The statistic report has been classified into five classes, viz., high erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion, and high accretion. Finally, the shoreline has classified with LRR reports. The overall result shows that, low accretion has notied at 36 km (79%), high accretion perceived at 8.7 km (8.7%), and stable has observed in 8.3 km (8.3%), along the coast. Whereas, low erosion was noticed around 1.4 km (3.1%), and no high erosion was noticed along the study area. Thiruchendur and Udankudi coastal zones are mostly perceived low rate of shoreline changes with the rate from 1.02 to 3.96 m/year, happen in 18.9 km and 16.5 km, respectively. But, Alwarthirunagiri coast zone, low rate of erosion is noticed along the 1.4-km length of the shore. The study has concluded that, most of the Thiruchendur Taluk coastal areas are under the low-rate accretion, and the same area is observed as erosion along the coast due to both natural and human activities. Thiruchendur Taluk has major coastal cities, and a large number of people live around the coast. There are numerous natural resources and tourist places around the coast. Therefore, this coastal area shoreline changes studies should be examined.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to evaluate the utility of remotely sensed data in estimating the impact of wattle invasion and clearance on native grass species productivity using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imaging and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm. Therefore this study assessed grass above ground biomass (AGB) at various levels of wattle invasion In assessing the impacts of wattle invasion on grass AGB the study found that, wattle invasion significantly reduces grass AGB when, compared with uninvaded and cleared plots. Mean grass AGB was 89.64 g m(-2), 43.87 g m(-2)and 83.36 g m(-2)for the cleared, moderately invaded and uninvaded, respectively. The study further found no significant differences between cleared and uninvaded plots (p= 0.826). However, moderately invaded plots were significantly lower than the cleared (p< 0.0001) and uninvaded plots (p= 0.001). In assessing the applicability of remotely sensed data, the findings of this study showed that the most influential variables in estimating biomass were red-edge-based VIs. Specifically, the simple ratio VI (band5/band2) was the most optimal variable for predicting grass AGB across various levels of wattle invasion yielding high accuracies (root mean square error of prediction [RMSEP] = 19.11 g m(-2)andR(2)= 0.83). Additionally, PLSR results showed that the moderately invaded treatment was most optimally predicted with RMSEP of 13.06 g m(-2). Overall, the results underscore the utility of remotely sensed data in monitoring grassland degradation and restoration.

TI  - Getting from Sea to Nurseries: Considering Tidal Dynamics of Juvenile Habitat Distribution and Connectivity in a Highly Modified Estuarine Riverscape
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Productive and ecologically highly valuable ecosystems, macrotidal estuaries are also characterised by complex habitat and connectivity dynamics driven by tidal and freshwater influence. Organisms living in these constantly changing systems have to match their movement patterns to the shifting habitat mosaic using available windows of connectivity to access habitat patches of interest. This appears particularly important for the juvenile stages of many fish species colonising shallow and intertidal areas of the estuaries as summer nurseries. We apply tools from landscape ecology to investigate the estuarine habitat and connectivity dynamics on the example of juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We test under which conditions spatio-temporal bottlenecks to estuarine nursery colonisation may emerge for this species in a human-modified estuary. Combining a hydrodynamic model of the Seine estuary with remote sensing data allows us to capture structural changes in habitat availability and connectivity at the estuarine scale and at a fine spatio-temporal resolution. With chronological least-cost modelling of successive tidal steps, we assess patterns of nursery accessibility and estimate tidal colonisation fronts for different mobility scenarios. We show that, at certain hydrological conditions, tidal water level variation causes local disruptions of habitat availability and connectivity, creating temporary bottlenecks for seabass juveniles' movement. Fish mobility appears determinant for their vulnerability to these connectivity disruptions. Our approach allows for quantitative assessment and visualisation of riverscape complexity related to tidal dynamics. It is applicable to other highly dynamic ecosystems, where the mobile nature of connectivity and habitats needs to be integrated into conservation and management planning.

TI  - Predicting spatial patterns of bird richness in an urban landscape in Himalayan foothills, India
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing pace of urbanization is the leading cause of decline in natural areas and associated biodiversity in developing countries. Bird richness is considered as a key indicator of urban environment quality. We investigated the relationship between satellite image derived landscape variables and field surveyed bird counts to predict bird richness in a rapidly urbanizing city in Western Himalayan foothills of India. Predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data comprised of vegetation productivity, landscape metrics and topography. We found that bird richness in this low density residential urban environment was positively related to greenness, elevation, and the degree of contrast between neighbourhood patches, while it was negatively related to patch densities. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) explained about 90% variability in bird richness distribution. Results indicated high bird species richness in elevated remnant vegetation patches and green spaces compared to low lying "core" settlement areas. The study urges to consider conservation and protection of green cover spaces in urban areas through effective landscape and urban planning.

TI  - Rapid Fluvio-Thermal Erosion of a Yedoma Permafrost Cliff in the Lena River Delta
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of ice-rich permafrost deposits has the potential to release large amounts of previously freeze-locked carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) with local implications, such as affecting riverine and near-shore ecosystems, but also global impacts such as the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Here, we study the rapid erosion of the up to 27.7 m high and 1,660 m long Sobo-Sise yedoma cliff in the Lena River Delta using a remote sensing-based time-series analysis covering 53 years and calculate the mean annual sediment as well as C and N release into the Lena River. We find that the Sobo-Sise yedoma cliff, which exposes ice-rich late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits, had a mean long-term (1965-2018) erosion rate of 9.1 m yr(-1)with locally and temporally varying rates of up to 22.3 m yr(-1). These rates are among the highest measured erosion rates for permafrost coastal and river shoreline stretches. The fluvio-thermal erosion led to the release of substantial amounts of C (soil organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) and N to the river system. On average, currently at least 5.2 x 10(6)kg organic C and 0.4 x 10(6)kg N were eroded annually (2015-2018) into the Lena River. The observed sediment and organic matter erosion was persistent over the observation period also due to the specific configuration of river flow direction and cliff shore orientation. Our observations highlight the importance to further study rapid fluvio-thermal erosion processes in the permafrost region, also because our study shows increasing erosion rates at Sobo-Sise Cliff in the most recent investigated time periods. The organic C and N transport from land to river and eventually to the Arctic Ocean from this and similar settings may have severe implications on the biogeochemistry and ecology of the near-shore zone of the Laptev Sea as well as for turnover and rapid release of old C and N to the atmosphere.

TI  - Hydrological and productive impacts of recent land-use and land-cover changes in the semiarid Chaco: Understanding novel water excess in water scarce farmlands
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, the rapid replacement of native forests by crops and pastures in the Argentinean semiarid Chaco plains has triggered unprecedented groundwater level raises resulting from deep drainage increases, leading to the first massive waterlogging event on records (similar to 25,000 Ha flooded in 2015 near Bandera, one of the most cultivated clusters of the Chaco). In this paper, we link this episode to the ongoing deforestation and cropping scheme shifts through the combined analysis of remote sensing data, agricultural surveys, local farmer information and hydrologic modelling. From 2000 to 2015, the agricultural area of Bandera increased from 21% to 50%, mostly at the expense of dry forests. In this period, agriculture migrated from more intensive (i.e., double-cropping) to more water-conservative (i.e., late-summer single crops) schemes as a general strategy to reduce drought risks. These changes reduced regional evapotranspiration and increased the intensity of deep drainage in wet years. Contrasting cropping schemes displayed significant evapotranspiration differences, but all of them experienced substantial drainage losses (similar to 100-200 mm) during the wettest year (2014/2015), suggesting that cropping adjustments have a limited capacity to halt the generation of water excesses. Nearly 50% of the cropped area in Bandera could not be sown or harvested following the groundwater recharge event of 2014/2015. In the ongoing context of shallow and rising water tables, the introduction of novel cropping schemes that include deep-rooted perennials, to promote transpirative groundwater discharge, seems crucial to avoid the recurrence of water excesses and their associated dryland salinity risk in the region.

TI  - The spatiotemporal characteristics of the air pollutants in China from 2015 to 2019
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - China's rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to poor air quality, and air pollution has caused great concern among the Chinese public. Most analyses of air pollution trends in China are based on model simulations or satellite data. Studies using field observation data and focusing on the latest data from environmental monitoring stations covering the whole country to assess the latest trends of different pollutants in different regions are relatively rare. The State Council of China promulgated the toughest-ever Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) in 2013. This led to a major improvement in air quality. We use the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) and mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O-3, and SO(2)in 362 cities from 2015 to 2019, obtained from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, to study their temporal and spatial changes and assess the effectiveness of the policy on the atmospheric environment since its promulgation and implementation. We found that the national and regional air quality in China continues to improve, with PM2.5, PM10, AQI, CO, and SO(2)exhibiting negative trends. However, O(3)and NO(2)pollution is an urgent problem that needs to be solved and the current control strategy for PM(2.5)will only partially reduce the PM(2.5)pollution in the western region. Although the implementation of "Action Plan" measures has effectively improved air quality, China's air pollution is still serious and far from the WHO standard. Implementing measures for continuous and effective emissions control is still a top priority.

TI  - Engaging Multiple Worldviews With Quantitative Decision Support: A Robust Decision-Making Demonstration Using the Lake Model
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many of today's most pressing policy challenges are usefully characterized as wicked problems. With contested framings parties to a decision disagree not only on potential solutions, but on the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. The quantitative tools of risk and policy analysis, commonly designed to develop and compare choices within a single decision framing, are poorly designed to bring quantitative information into debates with contested framings. This study aims to build on recent advances in decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) to demonstrate methods and tools that may help resolve the tension between quantitative decision support and multiworldview approaches for addressing wicked problems. The study employs robust decision making (RDM), one common DMDU method, and a new version of the lake model, a simple and widely used model of a coupled human and natural system, to conduct a stylized analysis that reflects three different worldviews. The RDM analysis solves the decision challenge independently for each worldview and then compares each set of solutions from the vantage of the other worldviews. The resulting utopia-dystopia matrix informs problem reframing that seeks robust, adaptive strategies independently consistent with each worldview and thus provides a locus for agreement. The study describes how stakeholder engagements might use such analytic tools and their information products to provide overlapping but alternative entry points for groups with fundamentally different worldviews to engage with each other in deliberative processes appropriate for wicked problems.

TI  - Triple metachronous primary cancer of uterus, colon, and breast cancer A case report and review of the literature
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale: Triple or more primary malignancies are rare, with only 23 previous cases including breast cancer reported in the English language studies between January 1990 and December 2019. Patient concerns: The patient was a 67-year-old woman with a mass in her right breast. She had a previous history of uterine and colon cancer. Both ultrasonography and mammography revealed a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 breast lesion, in which proliferative nodules are more likely. Given her previous history of 2 malignancies, her doctors strongly recommended a biopsy. Diagnosis and interventions: The biopsy pathology suggested intraductal breast cancer. Mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma, grade II, stage I. The sample was positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and negative for cerbB-2. No radiotherapy or chemotherapy was administered except for endocrine therapy. A follow-up at 19 months showed no breast recurrence or distant metastases. Outcomes: No recurrence or distant metastasis occurred within the 19-month, 11-year, and 20-year follow-ups for breast, colon, and uterine cancers, respectively. Lessons: To our knowledge, this is the first review of triple or more primary malignancies including breast cancer. These malignancies occur predominantly in older female patients. The most prevalent tumors of triple or more primary malignancies including breast cancer occur in the colon, uterus, and lung. A favorable prognosis is associated with early-stage malignancies.

TI  - Same-day or next-day sentinel node biopsy after lymphoscintigraphy for melanoma using<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labelled antimony sulphide colloid
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Two recent publications have reported that a shorter interval between preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is associated with improved survival of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. The aims of this study were to analyse prospectively collected survival data for patients who had SNB on the same day as lymphoscintigraphy or the day after; and to assess tracer migration from sentinel nodes to second-tier nodes after lymphoscintigraphy on the previous day. Methods Outcome data were obtained for patients who had lymphoscintigraphy and SNB on the same day (time interval less than 8 h) or the next day (interval more than 16 h). In a separate prospective cohort, same-day and next-day lymphoscintigraphic images of sentinel nodes and second-tier nodes were compared. Results Following lymphoscintigraphy, 2848 patients had same-day and 3328 had next-day SNB. Survival outcomes did not differ between these groups. In a prospectively studied cohort of 30 patients, none had significant tracer migration from sentinel nodes to second-tier nodes on imaging the following day. Conclusion No difference in survival after same- or next-day sentinel node biopsy is seen when(99m)Tc-labelled antimony sulphide colloid is used. This may be because of less tracer migration to second-tier nodes.

TI  - Motivations for Relationships as Sources of Meaning: Ghanaian and South African Experiences
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Afrocentric paradigms reflect assumptions of the overarching importance of interconnectedness and social bonds in meaningful experiences. It is, however, not known if types of relatedness vary in importance as meaning sources in the subjective experiences of laypeople, or what the reasons are that they ascribe to the importance of relationships. The empirical and theoretical substantiation of philosophical assumptions is needed to provide a scientific basis for appropriate well-being interventions in African contexts. Therefore, this study aimed to empirically explore the relative importance of various types of relationships as sources of meaning and in particularwhyrelationships are important to laypeople in relatively collectivist African contexts. Using a bottom-up qualitative approach with quantification of responses, this study explored how prominently relationships featured as meaning sources compared to other domains of life and then, in particular, the motivations for the importance of various types of relationships as found in four African samples: a Ghanaian urban group (n= 389), a South African multicultural, English-speaking urban group (n= 585), and two South African Setswana-speaking groups (n= 512 rural,n= 380 urban). Findings showed that the relational domains of life, namely, family, interpersonal relations, spirituality/religion, and community/society, made up a large proportion of responses on what provides meaning in life-in particular family and spirituality/religion with community/society occurring the least. The reasons for meaning experienced in various relationship types included domain-typical relational descriptors, such as contributions made or rewards received. However, many intrapersonal motives also emerged: inner well-being, happiness, joy, a sense of competence, and own growth. Material needs and harmony also surfaced as motivations for relational importance. Findings are aligned with African philosophical perspectives as far as the importance of relationships and the value attached to spirituality/religion are concerned, but contributed additionally by showing that different types of relationships vary in importance: close relationships are more important than community/societal relationships. Unearthing the reasons for the importance of relationships points toward a dialectic pattern of African individualism-collectivism in which independent and interdependent orientations flow together. Such knowledge is vital for the promotion of mental health and well-being in these contexts.

TI  - Towards harmonisation of chemical monitoring using avian apex predators: Identi fication of key species for pan-European biomonitoring
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Biomonitoring in raptors can be used to study long-term and large-scale changes in environmental pollution. In Europe, suchmonitoring is needed to assess environmental risks and outcomes of chemicals regulation, which is harmonised across the European Union. To be effective, themost appropriate sentinels need to bemonitored. Our aim was to identify which European raptor species are the likely most appropriate biomonitors when pollutant quantification is based on analysing tissues. Our current study was restricted to terrestrial exposure pathways and considered four priority pollutant groups: toxic metals (lead and mercury), anticoagulant rodenticides, pesticides and medicinal products. Weevaluated information on the distribution and key ecological traits (foodweb, foraging trait, diet, preferred habitat, and migratory behaviour) of European raptors to identify the most appropriate sentinel species. Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and/or tawny owl (Strix aluco) proved the most suitable candidates for many of the pollutants considered. Moreover, they are abundant in Europe, enhancing the likelihood that samples can be collected. However, other species may be better sentinels for certain pollutants, such as the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) for lead, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) formercury across areas including Northern Europe, and vultures (where they occur in Europe) are likely best suited for monitoring non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Overall, however, we argue the selection of candidate species for widescale monitoring of a range of pollutants can be reduced to very few raptor species. We recommend that the common buzzard and tawny owl should be the initial focus of any pan-European raptor monitoring. The lack of previous widespread monitoring using these species suggests that their utility as sentinels for environmnetal pollution has not been widely recognised. Finally, although the current study focussed on Europe, our trait-based approach for identifying raptor biomonitors can be applied to other continents and contaminants. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Measurement and zonation of soil surface moisture in arid and semi-arid regions using Landsat 8 images
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of soil surface moisture is an imperative factor in water and energy cycle. Due to the variability of soil characteristics such as topography, vegetation, and climate dynamics, this important factor varies with respect to time and place. Measuring methods can provide soil moisture information in a wide range of short intervals with reasonable accuracy. In present research, Landsat 8 satellite data with various soil moisture content estimation methods were tested. In order to evaluate the accuracy of each method, the real-field data used 80 samples of volumetric soil moisture content in suburban areas of Semnan city that were collected at the time of satellite passage of the area. Some of the indicators used in this study are normalized vegetation index, NDTI index, NDMI index, PSMI index (use full form of these indices), surface temperature, and SMSWIR index. The SMSWIR index with correlation coefficient was 0.78, and the correlation coefficient of regression model was 0.61, and RMSE was 3.69. The results of the regression model and real data were estimated to be 3.69, which are recommended for assessing surface soil moisture in arid and desert regions. Three indicators of SMSWIR index, NDTI index, and NDMI index with a small difference are not suitable indices for measuring soil moisture content in desert areas with vegetation cover. By employing multivariable regression models, soil moisture model was also prepared by using the studied indices. The findings of this research indicate that the simultaneous correlation model is superior to the surface soil moisture mapping.

T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSexually transmissible infection (STI) and blood-borne virus (BBV) diagnoses data are a core component of the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). However, the NNDSS data alone is not enough to understand STI and BBV burden among priority population groups, like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, because it lacks testing, treatment and management data. Here, we describe the processes involved in establishing a STI and BBV sentinel surveillance network representative of Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services (ACCHS)-known as the ATLAS network-to augment the NNDSS and to help us understand the burden of disease due to STI and BBV among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.MethodsResearchers invited participation from ACCHS in urban, regional and remote areas clustered in five clinical hubs across four Australian jurisdictions. Participation agreements were developed for each clinical hub and individual ACCHS. Deidentified electronic medical record (EMR) data relating to STI and BBV testing, treatment and management are collected passively from each ACCHS via the GRHANITE(tm) data extraction tool. These data are analysed centrally to inform 12 performance measures which are included in regular surveillance reports generated for each ACCHS and clinical hub.ResultsThe ATLAS network currently includes 29 ACCHS. Regular reports are provided to ACCHS to assess clinical practice and drive continuous quality improvement initiatives internally. Data is also aggregated at the hub, jurisdictional and national level and will be used to inform clinical guidelines and to guide future research questions. The ATLAS infrastructure can be expanded to include other health services and potentially linked to other data sources using GRHANITE.ConclusionsThe ATLAS network is an established national surveillance network specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The data collected through the ATLAS network augments the NNDSS and will contribute to improved STI and BBV clinical care, guidelines and policy program-planning.

TI  - Forecasting NDVI in multiple complex areas using neural network techniques combined feature engineering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) is a critical variable for monitoring climate change, studying ecological balance, and exploring the pattern of regional phenology. Traditional neural network models only consider image features in time series prediction, while historical data and its changes play an important role in time series forecasting. For this study, we proposed convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined feature engineering forecasting model (SF-CNN), which integrated both the advantages of image characteristics learned from CNN and statistic characteristics calculated by historical data related to the forecast period to improve the accuracy of NDVI predictions in the next 3 months with 30-day interval at multiple complex areas. To intuitively show the performance of SF-CNN, it was compared with CNN using the same parameters. Results mainly showed that (1) in terms of visual analysis, the texture, pattern, and structure of predicted NDVI using SF-CNN are similar to the observed NDVI, and SF-CNN exhibits strong generalization ability; (2) in terms of quantitative assessment, SF-CNN generally outperforms CNN, and it can improve the reliability and robustness for predicting NDVI through simple statistical characteristics while reducing the uncertainties; (3) SF-CNN can learn seasonal and sudden changes in four different and complex study areas with considerable accuracy and without extra data.

TI  - Do changes in STEC diagnostics mislead interpretation of disease surveillance data in Switzerland? Time trends in positivity, 2007 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Laboratory-confirmed cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have been notifiable to the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases in Switzerland since 1999. Since 2015, a large increase in case numbers has been observed. Around the same time, syndromic multiplex PCR started to replace other diagnostic methods in standard laboratory practice for gastrointestinal pathogen testing, suggesting that the increase in notified cases is due to a change in test practices and numbers. Aim: This study examined the impact of changes in diagnostic methods, in particular the introduction of multiplex PCR panels, on routine STEC surveillance data in Switzerland. Methods: We analysed routine laboratory data from 11 laboratories, which reported 61.9% of all STEC cases from 2007 to 2016 to calculate the positivity, i.e. the rate of the number of positive STEC tests divided by the total number of tests performed. Results: The introduction of multiplex PCR had a strong impact on STEC test frequency and identified cases, with the number of tests performed increasing sevenfold from 2007 to 2016. Still, age- and sex-standardised positivity increased from 0.8% in 2007 to 1.7% in 2016. Conclusion: Increasing positivity suggests that the increase in case notifications cannot be attributed to an increase in test numbers alone. Therefore, we cannot exclude a real epidemiological trend for the observed increase. Modernising the notification system to address current gaps in information availability, e.g. diagnostic methods, and improved triangulation of clinical presentation, diagnostic and serotype information are needed to deal with emerging disease and technological advances.

TI  - Estimating purple-soil moisture content using Vis-NIR spectroscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is essential for plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems. This study investigated the visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra of three subgroups of purple soils (calcareous, neutral, and acidic) from western Chongqing, China, containing different water contents. The relationship between soil moisture and spectral reflectivity (R) was analyzed using four spectral transformations, and estimation models were established for estimating the soil moisture content (SMC) of purple soil based on stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). We found that soil spectra were similar for different moisture contents, with reflectivity decreasing with increasing moisture content and following the order neutral > calcareous > acidic purple soil (at constant moisture content). Three of the four spectral transformations can highlight spectral sensitivity to SMC and significantly improve the correlation between the reflectance spectra and SMC. SMLR and PLSR methods provide similar prediction accuracy. The PLSR-based model using a first-order reflectivity differential (R ') is more effective for estimating the SMC, and gave coefficient of determination (R-v(2)), root mean square errors of validation (RMSEV), and ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance (RPIQ) values of 0.946, 1.347, and 6.328, respectively, for the calcareous soil, and 0.944, 1.818, and 6.569, respectively, for the acidic purple soil. For neutral purple soil, the best prediction was obtained using the SMLR method withRtransformation, yieldingRv(2), RMSEV and RPIQ values of 0.973, 0.888 and 8.791, respectively. In general, PLSR is more suitable than SMLR for estimating the SMC of purple soil.

TI  - Occult metastatic thyroid cancer diagnosed during breast cancer axillary sentinel node biopsy
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES AND METABOLISM CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In most developed countries, breast carcinoma is the most common malignancy in women and while thyroid cancer is less common, its incidence is almost three to five times greater in women than in men. Since 1966, studies have demonstrated an association between thyroid and breast cancer and despite these studies, the mechanism/s by which they are related, remains unclear. We present a case of a 56-year-old lady who initially presented in 2014 with a screen detected left breast carcinoma but was subsequently found to have occult metastatic thyroid cancer to the axilla, diagnosed from a sentinel node biopsy from the primary breast procedure. The patient underwent a left mastectomy, left axillary dissection and total thyroidectomy followed by three courses of radioactive iodine ablation. Despite this, her thyroglobulin level continued to increase, which was secondary to a metastatic thyroid cancer parasternal metastasis. Breast and thyroid cancer presents metachronously or synchronously more often than by chance. With improving mortality in primary cancers, such as breast and differentiated thyroid cancer, it is likely that as clinicians, we will continue to encounter this association in practice.

TI  - Comparison of Direct and Indirect Determination of Leaf Area Index in Permanent Grassland
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indirect, non-destructive methods to derive biophysical parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI), are of major importance for optimal grassland growth modelling and management. In this study, we compared different methods for the estimation of LAI in permanent grassland including (i) two direct methods, (ii) two indirect optical methods (AccuPAR and LAI-2200C), (iii) a proximal (field spectrometer) and a satellite remote sensing approach using Sentinel-2 (S-2) data, both based on radiative transfer modelling (RTM) of vegetation. To consider the seasonal variability of LAI sufficiently, we performed in situ measurements weekly during the entire growing season of 2018 and 2019. The RTM-based methods showed the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) when compared with direct green LAI measurements, which ranged from 1.68 to 7.85. The indirect optical methods resulted in higher RMSE values but in similar high correlation coefficients (r). The comparison between the indirect optical methods showed that the AccuPAR and the LAI-2200C highly correlate with a systematic underestimation of the AccuPAR in the upper range of LAI values. As expected, S-2 and the field spectrometer showed the highest correlation (RMSE: 0.40 and r: 0.95). Generally, we observed a significant influence of the seasonal changes of the canopy structure and morphology on the estimation accuracy.

TI  - Time-Series Analysis of Subsidence in Nanning, China, Based on Sentinel-1A Data by the SBAS InSAR Method
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that the Sentinel-1 constellation can be used for continuous tracking of ground deformation phenomena. In this study, the spatial-temporal subsidence characteristics in Nanning were investigated with 18 Sentinel-1A TOPS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from 25 June 2015 to 16 December 2016 based on the small baseline subset interferometric SAR (SBAS InSAR) technique. The results showed that the annual average surface deformation rates in Nanning ranged from - 48 mm/year to 20 mm/year, and the maximum deformation was detected in the Langdong area. The SBAS-derived results were validated by Nanning continuously operating reference station (CORS) and levelling measurement data. The correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between SBAS-derived and levelling-derived mean deformation rates were 0.79 and 2 mm/year, respectively. The maximum discrepancy and the RMSE amounted to 7 mm/year and 4 mm/year comparing the SBAS time-series with the CORS-measured displacement. The verification using levelling and CORS implied high reliability and precision of surface subsidence derived by SBAS InSAR. Our analysis revealed that surface subsidence in Nanning was mainly caused by large-scale urban construction, which should be paid enough attention to avoid further aggravation. With the help of the meteorological data, we also found that the subsidence in Nanning was closely related to climatic anomalies in 2015. This research work will provide important theoretical and practical reference value for urban planning and construction in Nanning.

TI  - Characteristics of surface evapotranspiration and its response to climate and land use and land cover in the Huai River Basin of eastern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huai River Basin (HRB) has experienced significant climate and land use and land cover changes (LUCC) which have impacted the water cycle in recent times. However, little is understood about the impact of climate change and LUCC affecting evapotranspiration (ET). Thus, we investigate how surface ET response to climate change and LUCC in the HRB for the period from 2001 to 2014. ET and land cover types products (i.e., MOD16 and MCD12Q1, respectively) from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were employed in this research. Water balance method and D20 pan evaporation data (E-pan) as well as eddy covariance (EC) measurements were used to validate the MOD16 product, and the Theil-Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall (M-K) test were adopted to estimate the magnitude and significance of ET trends. Moreover, daily meteorological data of 137 weather stations from 2001 to 2014 were also employed to explore the correlation mechanism between ET and meteorological factors. The results showed that the accuracy of MOD16 product data were convincible and could be used to estimate ET in the HRB. The higher values of ET are mainly distributed in the south and lower values in the north. ET decreased significantly in all seasons except in spring, especially in winter. The results also depicted that the land-use type in the HRB is mainly croplands, followed by forests and grasslands. Croplands area showed a decreasing trend at a rate of -176.2 km(2)center dot a(-1), grasslands area presents a w-type fluctuation decreasing trend with a rate of -35.8 km(2)center dot a(-1), urban/built-up area increased at a rate of 138.3 km(2)center dot a(-1), water bodies area decreased gradually at a rate of -1.38 km(2)center dot a(-1), wetlands area increased significantly at a rate of 43.6 km(2)center dot a(-1), and barren area decreased gradually at a rate of -9.5 km(2)center dot a(-1). The average annual ET is closely related to land-use types and shows a significant downward trend in general. The corresponding ET magnitude is exhibited as follows: forests>grasslands>croplands>wetlands>water bodies>urban/build-up lands>barren. Results of the study also suggest water conditions (precipitation (Pre) and relative humidity (RH) decrease) are major controlling factors in the decline of ET. Overall, the LUCC has a smaller influence on ET than climate change in the HRB. This research will provide a better insight into climate change and LUCC impacts on water resources.

TI  - Development of integrated wetland change detection approach: In case of Erdos Larus Relictus National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are threatened by the global warming and the human exploitation pressure, and have been shrinking quickly in recent years. Timely and accurate wetland area change detection is the primary task for wetland conservation and restoration. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated change detection approach which integrates the advantages of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and change vector analysis (CVA) for the change identification of wetland dynamics. In the proposed approach, water, vegetation and soil fractions of wetlands were derived by SMA; then, the detailed change information (including change magnitude and 12 change direction categories) were calculated through CVA. The proposed approach was applied for the wetlands change in Erdos Larus Relictus National Nature Reserve (ELRNNR), China, using time-series Landsat images during 1977-2017. We found that the wetland faced serious degradation, with water fraction changed to soil (5.79 km(2)), to vegetation (1.35 km(2)) and to both soil and vegetation (3.53 km(2)). From 1977 to 2000, a slight degradation occurred in the northeast edge of Bojiang Lake and a marginal degradation in Bojiang and Houjia Lakes inside the ELRNNR, with water fraction changed to soil and vegetation. During 2000-2010, severe degradation occurred in ELRNNR, and from 2010 to 2017, the wetland was more susceptible to the precipitation change and human activities. Analysis of the result indicated that the long-term drought and effects of mismanagement as well as misuse by human beings were the driving factors of wetland degradation. The proposed approach in this study achieves a higher accuracy than the classification approach to detect wetland change, with the ability to obtain more detailed change information.

TI  - Improved Risk Prediction Calculator for Sentinel Node Positivity in Patients With Melanoma: The Melanoma Institute Australia Nomogram
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE For patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, the risk of sentinel node (SN) metastasis varies according to several clinicopathologic parameters. Patient selection for SN biopsy can be assisted by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and ASCO/Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) guidelines and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) online nomogram. We sought to develop an improved online risk calculator using alternative clinicopathologic parameters to more accurately predict SN positivity.PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from 3,477 patients with melanoma who underwent SN biopsy at Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) were analyzed. A new nomogram was developed by replacing body site and Clark level from the MSKCC model with mitotic rate, melanoma subtype, and lymphovascular invasion. The predictive performance of the new nomogram was externally validated using data from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (n = 3,496).RESULTS The MSKCC model receiver operating characteristic curve had a predictive accuracy of 67.7% (95% CI, 65.3% to 70.0%). The MIA model had a predictive accuracy of 73.9% (95% CI, 71.9% to 75.9%), a 9.2% increase in accuracy over the MSKCC model (P < .001). Among the 2,748 SN-negative patients, SN biopsy would not have been offered to 22.1%, 13.4%, and 12.4% based on the MIA model, the MSKCC model, and NCCN or ASCO/SSO criteria, respectively. External validation generated a C-statistic of 75.0% (95% CI, 73.2% to 76.7%).CONCLUSION A robust nomogram was developed that more accurately estimates the risk of SN positivity in patients with melanoma than currently available methods. The model only requires the input of 6 widely available clinicopathologic parameters. Importantly, the number of patients undergoing unnecessary SN biopsy would be significantly reduced compared with use of the MSKCC nomogram or the NCCN or ASCO/SSO guidelines, without losing sensitivity. An online calculator is available at www.melanomarisk.org.au.

TI  - Identification of skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) pelagic hotspots applying a satellite remote sensing-driven analysis of ecological niche factors: A short-term run
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna (SJT) pelagic hotspots in the western North Pacific (WNP) were modelled using fishery and satellite remotely sensed data with Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) models. Our objectives were to model and predict habitat hotspots for SJT and assess the monthly changes in sub-surface temperatures and mixed layer depths at fishing locations. SJT presence-only monthly resolved data, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, diffuse attenuation coefficient, sea surface heights and surface wind speed were used to construct ENFA models and generate habitat suitability indices using a short-term dataset from March-November 2004. The suitability indices were then predicted for July-October (2007 and 2008). Monthly aggregated polygons of areas fished by skipjack tuna pole and line vessels were also overlaid on the predicted habitat suitability maps. Distributions of sub-surface temperatures and mixed layer depths (MLD) at fishing locations were also examined. Our results showed good fit for ENFA models, as indicated by the absolute validation index, the contrast validation index and the continuous Boyce index. The predicted hotspots showed varying concurrences when compared with 25-degree polygons derived from fished areas. Northward shifts in SJT hotspots corresponded with declining MLDs from March to September. The MLDs were shallower in summer and deeper in autumn and winter months. The habitat hotspots modeled using ENFA were consistent with the known ecology and seasonal migration pattern of SJT. The findings of this work, derived from a short-term dataset, enable identification of SJT hotspots in the WNP, thus contributing valuable information for future research on SJT habitat prediction models.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Removal After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Clinically Node-Negative Patients: When to Stop?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The maximum number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) to be resected to accurately stage the axilla in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the treatment of clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer has not been determined. We sought to determine the sequence of removal of the positive SLNs in this patient population. Methods All patients aged >= 18 years diagnosed with cN0 invasive breast cancer who received NAC and underwent SLN surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between September 2008 and September 2018 were identified. Univariate analysis was performed to compare factors associated with positive nodes and where the first positive node was in the sequence of removal of the SLNs. Results We identified 446 cancers among 440 patients with a median age of 51 (IQR: 43, 61) years. At surgery, 381 (85.4%) cancers were pathologically node (ypN) negative and 65 (14.6%) were pN + . The number of nodes removed was similar for both patients with ypN0 and ypN + disease, with a median number of SLNs removed of 2.0 (IQR: 2.0, 3.0). Of all patients with a positive node, the first positive node was most commonly the 1st node removed (75.4%), and was identified by the 3rd SLN removed in all cases. Conclusions Among cN0 patients treated with NAC, if a positive SLN is present, it is most commonly identified as the 1st sentinel node removed by the surgeon, and was identified by the 3rd sentinel node in our series. This suggests that once 3 SLNs have been resected, removal of additional sentinel lymph nodes does not add diagnostic value.

TI  - Classification of sea ice types in Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Sentinel-1 image-based sea ice classification algorithm using a machine-learning-based model trained in a semi-automated manner is proposed to support daily ice charting. Previous studies mostly rely on manual work in selecting training and validation data. We show that the readily available ice charts from the operational ice services can reduce the amount of manual work in preparation of large amounts of training/testing data. Furthermore, they can feed highly reliable data to the trainer by indirectly exploiting the best ability of the sea ice experts working at the operational ice services. The proposed scheme has two phases training and operational. Both phases start from the removal of thermal, scalloping, and textural noise from Sentinel-1 data and calculation of grey level co-occurrence matrix and Haralick texture features in a sliding window. In the training phase, the weekly ice charts are reprojected into the SAR image geometry. A random forest classifier is trained with the texture features on input and labels from the rasterized ice charts on output. Then, the trained classifier is directly applied to the texture features from Sentinel-1 images operationally. Test results from the two datasets spanning winter (January-March) and summer (June-August) seasons acquired over the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea showed that the classifier is capable of retrieving three generalized cover types (open water, mixed first-year ice, old ice) with overall accuracies of 87 % and 67 % in winter and summer seasons, respectively. For the summer season, the classifier failed in distinguishing mixed first-year ice from old ice with accuracy of only 12 %; however, it performed rather like an ice-water discriminator with high accuracy of 98 % as the misclassification between the mixed first-year ice and old ice was between them. The accuracy for five cover types (open water, new ice, young ice, first-year ice, old ice) in the winter season was 60 %. The errors are attributed both to incorrect manual classification on the ice charts and to the semi-automated algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for near-real-time service of the ice map using daily mosaicked Sentinel-1 images.

TI  - Analyzing non-sentinel axillary metastases in patients with T3-T4 cN0 early breast cancer and tumor-involved sentinel lymph nodes undergoing breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, completing axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) did not benefit patients with T1-T2 cN0 early breast cancer and 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCT). This paper reports cALND rates in the clinical routine for patients who had higher (T3-T4) tumor stages and/or underwent mastectomy but otherwise met the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria. Aim of this study is to determine cALND time trends and non-sentinel axillary metastases (NSAM) rates to estimate occult axillary tumor burden. Methods Data were included from patients treated in 179 German breast cancer centers between 2008 and 2015. Time-trend rates were analyzed for cALND of patients with T3-T4 tumors separated for BCT and mastectomy and regarding presence of axillary macrometastases or micrometastases. Results Data were available for 188,909 patients, of whom 19,009 were identified with 1-2 positive SLN. Those 19,009 patients were separated into 4 cohorts: (1) Patients with T1-T2 tumors receiving BCT (ACOSOG Z0011 eligible;n = 13,741), (2) T1-T2 with mastectomy (n = 4093), (3) T3-T4 with BCT (n = 269), (4) T3-T4 with mastectomy (n = 906). Among patients with T3-T4 tumors, cALND rates declined from 2008 to 2015: from 88.2 to 62.6% for patients receiving mastectomy and from 96.6 to 58.1% in patients receiving BCT. Overall rates for any NSAM after cALND for cohorts 1-4 were 33.4%, 42.3%, 46.9%, 58.8%, respectively. Conclusions The cALND rates have decreased substantially in routine care in patients with 'extended' ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria. Axillary tumor burden is higher in these patients than in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial.

TI  - Evaluating the capacity of species distribution modeling to predict the geographic distribution of the mangrove community in Mexico
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide important environmental services, but have been impacted massively in recent years by human activities. Studies of mangroves have focused on their ecology and function at local or landscape scales, but little has been done to understand their broader distributional patterns or the environmental factors that determine those distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs), have been used to estimate potential distributions of hundreds of species, yet no SDM studies to date have assessed mangrove community distributions in Mexico (the country with the fourth largest extent of this ecosystem). We used maximum entropy approaches to model environmental suitability for mangrove species distributions in the country, and to identify the environmental factors most important in determining those distributions. We also evaluated whether this modeling approach is adequate to estimate mangrove distribution as a community across Mexico. Best models were selected based on statistical significance (AUC ratio), predictive performance (omission error of 5%), and model complexity (Akaike criterion); after this evaluation, only one model per species met the three evaluation criteria. Environmental variable sets that included distance to coast yielded significantly better models; variables with strongest contributions included elevation, temperature of the coldest month, and organic carbon content of soil. Based on our results, we conclude that SDMs can be used to map mangrove communities in Mexico, but that results can be improved at local scales with inclusion of local variables (salinity, hydroperiod and microtopography), field validations, and remote sensing data.

TI  - Low-Cost Solutions for Assessment of Flash Flood Impacts Using Sentinel-1/2 Data Fusion and Hydrologic/Hydraulic Modeling: Wadi El-Natrun Region, Egypt
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are among the most common natural hazards in Egyptian and Arabian deserts. In this work, we utilized two Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images, before and after the flash flood, SRTM, and geolocated terrestrial photos captured by volunteers. This paper aims to three substantial objectives: (1) monitoring the flash flood impacts on Wadi El-Natrun region based on free satellite data and mapping the destroyed vegetation cover; (2) the integration of the free remote sensing data, geolocated terrestrial photos, and GIS techniques, along with hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, to evaluate the impact of flash flood hazards on the study area; and (3) assistance of the decision-makers in planning the required protective works to avoid the probable flooding. Two scenarios have been applied to estimate the flash flood effect. The first scenario has relied on Sentinel-1/2 data fusion before and after the flash flood, while the second scenario has been implemented based on the integration of the Sentinel-2 images and hydrologic and hydraulic flood modeling with the help of ArcGIS software to simulate the flash flood route. The results demonstrated that although the first scenario is an efficient solution for continuous monitoring of the change in the water bodies, it is limited in the detection of the submerged vegetation area. On the other hand, the second scenario provided the flash flood route and hydrological parameters, which determine the hazard degree of the basins, thus helping the decision-maker to manage the flood risk. Moreover, the second scenario surpasses the first one by estimating the destroyed infrastructure. Consequently, the second scenario is appropriate to assess the flash flood impacts and mitigate its influence in the future.

TI  - Return to rapid ice loss in Greenland and record loss in 2019 detected by the GRACE-FO satellites
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet returned to record levels in 2019, following unusually small loss in 2017-18, according to an analysis of satellite data from GRACE and its follow-on mission GRACE-FO.Between 2003-2016, the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) was one of the largest contributors to sea level rise, as it lost about 255 Gt of ice per year. This mass loss slowed in 2017 and 2018 to about 100 Gt yr(-1). Here we examine further changes in rate of GrIS mass loss, by analyzing data from the GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment - Follow On) satellite mission, launched in May 2018. Using simulations with regional climate models we show that the mass losses observed in 2017 and 2018 by the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions are lower than in any other two year period between 2003 and 2019, the combined period of the two missions. We find that this reduced ice loss results from two anomalous cold summers in western Greenland, compounded by snow-rich autumn and winter conditions in the east. For 2019, GRACE-FO reveals a return to high melt rates leading to a mass loss of 223 +/- 12 Gt month(-1) during the month of July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532 +/- 58 Gt yr(-1).

TI  - A spatiotemporal urban metabolism model for the Canberra suburb of Braddon in Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision makers, planners and actors in cities design policies, plan, invest money and build infrastructure, and consumers buy houses and use transport infrastructure without sound information about the environmental consequences of many of those decisions. Decisions, however, that have a lasting impact on sustainable development outcomes. In this study, we employ novel analytical techniques to align the spatial characteristics of the built urban environment with information for building materials and GHG embodiment to inform planning and investment decisions at the district, suburb and city scale. We represent a three-dimensional model of a suburb established from remotely sensed data and use algorithms to identify building types and align those with their typical material composition. We analyse the urban development of the modelled suburb in three historical time steps - 1955, 1981 and 2015 - and establish the consequence of urban planning decisions on material use and GHG embodiment. We test the new methodology for its applicability for a whole of city analysis and discuss the benefit for environmentally sustainable urban planning and design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Physiological traits associated with high temperature tolerance differ by fruit types and sizes in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>L.)
T2  - HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plants are very sensitive to environmental stresses, particularly to high temperature (HT) which is predicted to increase. This study was conducted to investigate the response to HT for identifying physiological traits associated with HT tolerance in tomato. Thirty-eight tomato accessions with three fruit sizes (cherry, medium and large) were grown in greenhouses where temperature set-point for ventilation was 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C for normal temperature (NT) and HT, respectively. HT increases plant height and stem diameter but little effect on leaf length and width. For reproductive traits, HT has positive effect on the number of flowers (NFL) but negative on the number of fruits (NFR), fruit set (FS), weight (FW) and yield (FY), and pollen germination (PG) and tube length. In the correlation analysis, except for accession T37 with extreme value causing spurious results, PG did not show significant correlation with FS, FW and FY, but with NFL and NFR in HT condition. NFR (HT), FS (HT) and FY (NT) are identified as physiological traits associated with HT tolerance based on correlation with FY (HT). However, their association to HT tolerance differ by fruit sizes. NFR (HT) was significantly correlated with FY (HT) in sub-population of cherry (r = 0.859**, n = 14), medium (r = 0.848**, n = 7) and large fruit types (r = 0.769**, n = 16) but not in total population (r = 0.302NS, n = 37). FS (HT) and, interestingly, FY (NT) were significantly correlated with fruit yield (HT) in total population and a cherry fruit sub-population but not in medium and large fruit sub-population. Results suggest that physiological traits associated with HT tolerance differ by fruit size and breeding programs should consider different selection criteria for different fruit types when develop cultivars with HT tolerance.

TI  - Determinants of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> multiplicity of infection and genetic diversity in Burkina Faso
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Investigating malaria transmission dynamics is essential to inform policy decision making. Whether multiplicity of infection (MOI) dynamic from individual infections could be a reliable malaria metric in high transmission settings with marked variation in seasons of malaria transmission has been poorly assessed. This study aimed at investigating factors driving Plasmodium falciparum MOI and genetic diversity in a hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso.Methods: Blood samples collected from a pharmacovigilance trial were used for polymerase chain reaction genotyping of the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2. MOI was defined as the number of distinct parasite genotypes co-existing within a particular infection. Monthly rainfall data were obtained from satellite data of the Global Precipitation Measurement Database while monthly malaria incidence aggregated data were extracted from District Health Information Software 2 medical data of the Center-West health regional direction.Results: In the study area, infected people harboured an average of 2.732 (+/- 0.056) different parasite genotypes. A significant correlation between the monthly MOI and the monthly malaria incidence was observed, suggesting that MOI could be a good predictor of transmission intensity. A strong effect of season on MOI was observed, with infected patients harbouring higher number of parasite genotypes during the rainy season as compared to the dry season. There was a negative relationship between MOI and host age. In addition, MOI decreased with increasing parasite densities, suggesting that there was a within-host competition among co-infecting genetically distinctP. falciparumvariants. Each allelic family of themsp1andmsp2genes was present all year round with no significant monthly fluctuation.Conclusions: In high malaria endemic settings with marked variation in seasons of malaria transmission, MOI represents an appropriate malaria metric which provides useful information about the longitudinal changes in malaria transmission in a given area. Besides transmission season, patient age and parasite density are important factors to consider for better understanding of variations in MOI. All allelic families ofmsp1andmsp2genes were found in both dry and rainy season. The approach offers the opportunity of translating genotyping data into relevant epidemiological information for malaria control.

TI  - Grid-scale agricultural land and water management: A remote-sensing-based multiobjective approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper developed a remote-sensing-based multiobjective (RSM) approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale. To meet the spatial resolution and accuracy need of agricultural management, downscaled precipitation data sets were obtained with the help of global precipitation measurement (GPM) data and other spatial information. Spatial crop water requirement information were obtained via the combination use of the Penman-Monteith method, remote sensing information (MOD16/PET) and virtual water theory. Through integrating these spatial data and considering the impact of different spatial environments on crop growth, a grid-based integer multiobjective programming (GIMP) model was developed to determine best suitable crop planting types at all grids. GIMP can simultaneously consider several conflicting objectives: crop growth suitability, crop spatial water requirements, and ecosystem service value. Further, GIMP results were inputted into a grid-based nonlinear fractional multiobjective programming (GNFMP) model with three objectives: maximize economic benefits, maximize water productivity, and minimize blue water utilization, to optimize irrigation-water allocation. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, a realworld application in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China was conducted. Results show that the proposed method can improve the ecosystem service value by 0.36 x 10(8) CNY, the economic benefit by 21.85%, the irrigation-water productivity by 25.92%, and reduce blue water utilization rate by 24.32% comparing with status quo.

TI  - Lake water volume fluctuations in response to climate change in Xinjiang, China from 2002 to 2018
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a global impact on the water cycle and its spatial patterns, and these impacts are more pronounced in eco-fragile regions. Arid regions are significantly affected by human activities like farming, and climate change, which influences lake water volumes, especially in different latitudes. This study integrates radar altimetry data from 2002 to 2018 with optical remote sensing images to analyze changes in the lake areas, levels, and volumes at different altitudes in Xinjiang, China. We analyzed changes in lake volumes in March, June, and October and studied their causes. The results showed large changes in the surface areas, levels, and volumes of lakes at different altitudes. During 2002-2010, the lakes in low- and medium-altitude areas were shrinking but lakes in high altitude areas were expanding. Monthly analysis revealed more diversified results: the lake water levels and volumes tended to decrease in March (-0.10 m/year, 37.55x 10(8) m(3)) and increase in June (0.03 m/year, 3.48 x10(8) m(3)) and October (0.04 m/year, 26.90x10(8) m(3)). The time series lake water volume data was reconstructed for 2011 to 2018 based on the empirical model and the total lake water volume showed a slightly increasing trend during this period (71.35 x10(8) m(3)). We hypothesized that changes in lake water at high altitudes were influenced by temperature-induced glacial snow melt and lake water in low- to medium-altitude areas was most influenced by human activities like agricultural irrigation practices.

TI  - COVID-19 and surface water quality: Improved lake water quality during the lockdown
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range:-10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 - April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dissecting the immune landscape of tumor draining lymph nodes in melanoma with high-plex spatially resolved protein detection
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In melanoma patients, microscopic tumor in the sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLN) increases the risk of distant metastases, but the transition from tumor in the SLN to metastatic disease remains poorly understood. Methods Fluorescent staining for CD3, CD20, CD11c, and DNA was performed on SLN tissue and matching primary tumors. Regions of interest (ROI) were then chosen geometrically (e.g., tumor) or by fluorescent cell subset markers (e.g., CD11c). Each ROI was further analyzed using NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling high-resolution multiplex profiling. Digital counts for 59-panel immune-related proteins were collected and normalized to account for system variation and ROI area. Results Tumor regions of SLNs had variable infiltration of CD3 cells among patients. The patient with overall survival (OS) > 8 years had the most CD11c- and CD3-expressing cells infiltrating the SLN tumor region. All patients had CD11c (dendritic cell, DC) infiltration into the SLN tumor region. Selecting ROI by specific cell subtype, we compared protein expression of CD11c cells between tumor and non-tumor/normal tissue SLN regions. Known markers of DC activation such as CD86, HLA-DR, and OX40L were lowest on CD11c cells within SLN tumor for the patient with OS < 1 year and highest on the patient with OS > 8 years. Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of profiling the protein expression of CD11c cells within the SLN tumor. Identifying early regulators of melanoma control when the disease is microscopically detected in the SLN is beneficial and requires follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node intraoperative analysis in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Surgical staging in endometrial cancer has evolved and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has replaced a full pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in several cases. An intraoperative evaluation of SLN might identify patients who could benefit the most from a full lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical relevance of frozen section of SLN. Methods A retrospective analysis in patients with endometrial cancer who underwent SLN mapping with intraoperative evaluation at frozen section between February 2016 and September 2019 was performed. In case of metastatic involvement, a full lymphadenectomy was performed. Results Fifty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. Clinical-pathologic characteristics of the patients and surgical data were analyzed. Overall, bilateral and unilateral detection rates were 100% (58/58), 89.7% (52/58), and 10.3% (6/58), respectively. Eight patients had a stage IIIC disease at permanent section. Frozen section detected SLN metastases in four of eight patients. Of these, two were micrometastases and two were macrometastases. At frozen section of the SLNs, no macrometastases were misdiagnosed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of frozen section in detecting metastases was 50%, 100%, 93%, 100% and 92.6%, respectively. Conclusion The intraoperative evaluation of SLN in endometrial cancer accurately identifies patients with macrometastases. This is the cohort that might benefit the most of a full lymphadenectomy for a higher risk of additional lymph node metastases.

TI  - Malaria prevalence in symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women in a high malaria-burden state in India
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Malaria in pregnancy ('MiP') poses risks to mother, foetus and newborn. Studies from Africa and Asia have reported high prevalence of 'MiP' and recommended further research to address 'MiP'. India has a significant burden of 'MiP' but most of the studies are a decade old. Hardly any studies exist in India that report on asymptomatic malaria in pregnant women. The current Indian policies for malaria control are silent on 'MiP'. A campaign was carried out by community health workers (CHWs) in 2019 to screen pregnant women across rural Chhattisgarh. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Malaria was tested in pregnant women by CHWs using bivalent rapid tests. Multi-stage sampling was used to cover 21,572 pregnant women screened across different geographical areas of rural Chhattisgarh. Cross-tabulation and multivariate regression were used to find out the relationship of 'MiP' with different symptoms and geographical areas. GIS maps were used to compare malaria in pregnant women against overall febrile population. Results In rural Chhattisgarh, malaria was present in 0.81% of the pregnant women at the time of testing. 'MiP' prevalence varied across geographies, reaching 4.48% in the geographical division with highest burden. Febrile pregnant women had three times greater malaria-positivity than overall febrile population and both showed a similar geographical pattern. Discussion Prevalence of 'MiP' was found to be less than earlier studies in the state. Though overall malaria in India has shown some decline, a policy response is needed for 'MiP' in high-burden areas. Fever, diarrhoea and jaundice remain relevant symptoms in 'MiP', but around one fourth of malaria-positive pregnant-women were afebrile, suggesting the need for strategies to address it. Conclusion The current study based on a large sample provides fresh evidence on 'MiP' in India. It used CHWs as skilled providers for large-scale screening for malaria. In high-burden areas, intermittent screening and treatment (IST) of all pregnant women can be a useful strategy in order to address 'MiP'. Pregnant women can be considered as a pertinent sentinel population for malaria. The global and national policies need to evolve concrete strategies for addressing malaria in pregnancy.

TI  - Usefulness of sentinel lymph node mapping using indocyanine green and fluorescent imaging in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for endometrial cancer. This study aimed to assess whether sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) is applicable in endometrial cancer. A retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer who were diagnosed and treated in Asan Medical Centre from September 2015 to December 2017 was conducted. One hundred patients underwent robotic (da Vinci (R)) or laparoscopic surgical treatment, including SLNM with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence detection using the Firefly (R) and NIR/ICG systems. At least one lymph node area was observed in 100% of SLNM cases. Sentinel node detection and frozen biopsy were performed in all cases, and all patients with metastasis were found on SLNM. The sensitivity and negative predictive value were both 100% in the patient-by-patient and station-by-station analyses. SLNM appears to be a feasible method to reduce the morbidity and increase the detection rate in early-stage endometrial carcinoma. What is already known on this subject?There are studies that it is safe to diagnose the possibility of lymph node metastasis through sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer. What do the results of this study add?In this study, it is shown that the accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping is 100% accurate. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practise and/or further research?Therefore, total lymphadenectomy will not be necessary for the future.

TI  - Continuity of care and health care cost among community-dwelling older adult veterans living with dementia
T2  - HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To estimate the causal impact of continuity of care (COC) on total, institutional, and noninstitutional cost among community-dwelling older veterans with dementia. Data Sources Combined Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Medicare data in Fiscal Years (FYs) 2014-2015. Study Design FY 2014 COC was measured by the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care (BBC) index on a 0-1 scale. FY 2015 total combined VHA and Medicare cost, institutional cost of acute inpatient, emergency department [ED], long-/short-stay nursing home, and noninstitutional long-term care (LTC) cost for medical (like skilled-) and social (like unskilled-) services were assessed controlling for covariates. An instrumental variable for COC (change of residence by more than 10 miles) was used to account for unobserved health confounders. Data Collection Community-dwelling veterans with dementia aged 66 and older, enrolled in Traditional Medicare (N = 102 073). Principal Findings Mean BBC in FY 2014 was 0.32; mean total cost in FY 2015 was $35 425. A 0.1 higher BBC resulted in (a) $4045 lower total cost; (b) $1597 lower acute inpatient cost, $119 lower ED cost, $4368 lower long-stay nursing home cost; (c) $402 higher noninstitutional medical LTC and $764 higher noninstitutional social LTC cost. BBC had no impact on short-stay nursing home cost. Conclusions COC is an effective approach to reducing total health care cost by supporting noninstitutional care and reducing institutional care.

TI  - Fire Danger Observed from Space
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is one of the critical components of the Earth system, significantly affecting atmospheric emissions and carbon budgets. Fires occurring in the interface between wildland and urban areas also have important socioeconomic effects, affecting people's lives and resources. Even though fires are natural in many ecosystems, climate and societal changes have recently caused particularly severe fire seasons (Australia, California, Amazonia, Portugal horizontal ellipsis ). Mitigating the negative impacts of fire requires further efforts to assess fire danger conditions. Satellite Earth observation provides considerable capabilities to evaluate the different variables involved in fire danger. Data obtained from remote sensors offer information on possible sources of fire ignition, on fuel status and abundance, and on the topography and the meteorological conditions that will affect fire spread. Satellite observations also provide near-real-time information on fire occurrence for early response teams. This article describes the different variables affecting fire danger and illustrates how satellite data can offer useful information to estimate these variables, focusing on global and continental fire danger systems.

TI  - Hkakabo Razi landscape as one of the last exemplar of large contiguous forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation around the world endanger the functioning of ecosystems, climate stability, and conservation of biodiversity. We assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest cover in Myanmar's Hkakabo Razi Landscape (HRL) to determine its integrity based on forest change and fragmentation patterns from 1989 to 2016. Over 80% of the HRL was covered by natural areas, from which forest was the most prevalent (around 60%). Between 1989 and 2016, forest cover declined at an annual rate of 0.225%. Forest degradation occurred mainly around the larger plains of Putao and Naung Mung, areas with relatively high human activity. Although the rate of forest interior loss was approximately 2 to 3 times larger than the rate of total forest loss, forest interior was prevalent with little fragmentation. Physical and environmental variables were the main predictors of either remaining in the current land-cover class or transitioning to another class, although remaining in the current land cover was more likely than land conversion. The forests of the HRL have experienced low human impact and still constitute large tracts of contiguous forest interior. To ensure the protection of these large tracts of forest, sustainable forest policies and management should be implemented.

TI  - Flood inundation mapping- Kerala 2018; Harnessing the power of SAR, automatic threshold detection method and Google Earth Engine
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood inundation maps provide valuable information towards flood risk preparedness, management, communication, response, and mitigation at the time of disaster, and can be developed by harnessing the power of satellite imagery. In the present study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data and Otsu method were utilized to map flood inundation areas. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for implementing Otsu algorithm and processing Sentinel-1 SAR data. The results were assessed by (i) calculating a confusion matrix; (ii) comparing the submerge water areas of flooded (Aug 2018), non-flooded (Jan 2018) and previous year's flooded season (Aug 2016, Aug 2017), and (iii) analyzing historical rainfall patterns to understand the flood event. The overall accuracy for the Sentinel-1 SAR flood inundation maps of 9th and 21st August 2018 was observed as 94.3% and 94.1% respectively. The submerged area (region under water) classified significant flooding as compared to the non-flooded (January 2018) and previous year's same season (August 2015-2017) classified outputs. Summing up, observations from Sentinel-1 SAR data using Otsu algorithm in GEE can act as a powerful tool for mapping flood inundation areas at the time of disaster, and enhance existing efforts towards saving lives and livelihoods of communities, and safeguarding infrastructure and businesses.

TI  - Axillary Downstaging in Occult Primary Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used for clinically node-positive (cN+) tumors with intact primary breast cancer (IPBC) to downstage the axilla, and those who convert to cN0 may be eligible for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Rates of axillary downstaging in occult primary breast cancer (OPBC) are unknown. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) following NAC in a cohort of patients with OPBC. Methods Twenty-eight patients with stage II/III OPBC treated between January 2008 and December 2019 were identified. Twenty patients had cN1-3 OPBC, pretreatment lymph node needle biopsy, and received NAC; these constituted the study population. Treatment factors and nodal pCR rates were summarized by tumor subtype. Results Median age at diagnosis was 54 years. Most patients presented with cN1 disease (75%) and ductal histology (80%). Nodal pCR was seen in 16/20 (80%) patients. Eight (40%) patients were triple negative, 6 (30%) were estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER +/HER2 -), and 6 (30%) were HER2 positive, with pCR rates of 88%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. Among the 15 patients who presented as cN1, 14 (93%) converted to cN0 following NAC. Of these, nine underwent SLNB and all achieved nodal pCR (100%). Conclusion In this small series, 80% of OPBC patients achieved nodal pCR following NAC. pCR rates varied by receptor profile, being lowest in the ER positive/HER2 negative group and highest in the HER2 positive group (50-100%); however, these rates are excellent and numerically exceed those in the literature for IPBC. Given the pCR rate, SLNB may be an option in select OPBC patients who downstage following NAC.

TI  - Volunteered remote sensing data generation with air passengers as sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellites are playing very important roles in diverse earth observation fields. However, long revisit period, high cost and dense cloud cover have been the main limitations of satellite remote sensing for a long time. This paper introduces the novel volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing (VPARS) concept, which can partly overcome these problems. By obtaining aerial imaging data from passengers using a portable smartphone on a passenger aircraft, it has various advantages including low cost, high revisit, dense coverage, and partial anti-cloud, which can well complement conventional remote sensing data. This paper examines the concept of VPARS and give general data processing framework of VPARS. Several cases were given to validate this processing approach. Two preliminary applications on land cover classification and economic activity monitoring validate the applicability of the VPARS data. Furthermore, we examine the issues about data maintenance, potential applications, limitations and challenges. We conclude the VPARS can benefit both scientific and industrial communities who rely on remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Presence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains a severe contraindication to the percutaneous left atrial appendage closure procedure (LAAC), due to increased embolic risk. Recently, the experience developed in cerebral protection device in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure was translated in LAAC to address this issue. Aim To evaluate efficacy and safety of Sentinel cerebral protection system (CPS) in supporting LAAC in real-world patient with persistent LAA thrombus. Methods and results The study retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and thrombus in LAA who underwent LAAC supported by Sentinel CPS in seven European high-volume centres. Twenty-seven patients were included with a median age of 69.1 +/- 9.7 years old, with median CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLEED scores 3 [2-5] and 3 [2.75-4], respectively. Technical and procedural success was achieved in all patients. No periprocedural TIA, stroke, or supra-aortic trunks dissection was recorded. Conclusions In this multicenter registry, LAAC supported by Sentinel CPS in patients with LAA persistent thrombus seems to be a safe and efficacious treatment.

TI  - UAV-based training for fully fuzzy classification of Sentinel-2 fluvial scenes
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - An estimated 76% of global stream area is occupied by channels with widths above 30m. Sentinel-2 imagery with resolutions of 10m could supply information about the composition of river corridors at national and global scales. Fuzzy classification models that infer sub-pixel composition could further be used to compensate for small channel widths imaged at 10m of spatial resolution. A major challenge to this approach is the acquisition of suitable training data useable in machine learning models that can predict land-cover type information from image radiance values. In this contribution, we present a method which combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Sentinel-2 imagery in order to develop a fuzzy classification approach capable of large-scale investigations. Our approach uses hyperspatial UAV imagery in order to derive high-resolution class information that can be used to train fuzzy classification models for Sentinel-2 data where all bands are super-resolved to a spatial resolution of 10m. We use a multi-temporal UAV dataset covering an area of 5.25km(2). Using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, we predict sub-pixel membership for Sentinel-2 pixels in the fluvial corridor as divided into classes of water, vegetation and dry sediment. Our CNN model can predict fuzzy class memberships with median errors from -5% to +3% and mean absolute errors from 10% to 20%. We also show that our CNN fuzzy predictor can be used to predict crisp classes with accuracies from 95.5% to 99.9%. Finally, we use an example to show how a fuzzy CNN model trained with localized UAV data can be applied to longer channel reaches and detect new vegetation growth. We therefore argue that the novel use of UAVs as field validation tools for freely available satellite data can bridge the scale gap between local and regional fluvial studies. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - A fuzzy machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt fields
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stubble burning is the most common practice in Northern region of India and is considered as the main reason for pollution in nearby NCR (National Capital Region) New Delhi, India. Therefore, in this research work, paddy stubble burnt fields were identified by using fuzzy based machine learning algorithms for a test site in Patiala, Punjab, India. An Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel based Modified Possibilisticc-Means (MPCM) algorithms were used for this purpose. The main objective of this research work was to test the effectiveness of machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt filed and also to find out the better classifier amongst Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel MPCM classifier. The Sentinel 2A/2B cloud free temporal data having a high frequency of repetitiveness in the interval of 5-days were used. To reduce spectral dimensionality of data Class Based Sensor Independent Indices (CBSII) database were generated. The burning was mainly observed from the last week of October to the first week of November and has been visualized using variation of CBSII-NDVI temporal plot. Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) was computed and compared with CBSII-NDVI outputs for both the ED and Kernel based MPCM classifiers. Delta Normalized Burnt Ratio (Delta NBR) was computed for cross-validation of burnt patches and is found to be in between 0.45 and 0.66. Thus, it can be concluded that kernel based MPCM classifiers are more efficient in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise in comparison to distance based MPCM classifiers, for the mapping of paddy burnt fields.

TI  - Factors affecting the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed in patients having surgery for breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The goal of sentinel lymph node biopsy is to establish the presence or absence of cancer cells in regional axillary nodes. The number of sentinel nodes harvested from each patient varies. The aim of this study was to determine what factors influence the number of sentinel nodes excised at sentinel node biopsy. Methods Data from 426 patients with breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at the Edinburgh Breast Unit by 10 different experienced breast surgeons were included in this analysis. Univariate and multivariable statistical analysis was performed. Results In the multivariate analysis the number of sentinel nodes biopsied varied significantly between operating surgeon (p < 0.0001) and was also statistically associated with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) and with the number of involved lymph nodes (p < 0.0001). More nodes were removed in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. Conclusions This study shows that the surgeon plays a pivotal and significant role in determining the numbers of sentinel nodes removed by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Surgeons should monitor their own data on the average numbers of sentinel nodes they remove. Some surgeons may not be removing sufficient numbers of sentinel nodes to maintain a low false negative rate for this procedure.

TI  - Articulating the new urban water paradigm
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban water systems in industrialized countries have underpinned unprecedented improvements in urban living standards through effective drinking water supply, sanitation and drainage. However, conventional urban water systems are increasingly regarded as too rigid and not sufficiently resilient to confront growing social, technological and environmental complexity and uncertainty, manifested, for example, in the maladaptation to climate change, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and degrading urban livability. In response, a new urban water paradigm has emerged in the last two decades within the context of a broader societal change that promotes a more organic worldview over the classical mechanistic and technocratic understanding of reality. This article develops and applies an analytical framework to coherently describe the new paradigm and contrast it with the old urban water paradigm. The framework includes a philosophical foundation and set of methodological principles that shape the new paradigm's approach to governance, management, and infrastructure.

TI  - Independent and Opposing Associations of Habitual Exercise and Chronic PM<sub>2.5</sub>Exposures on Hypertension Incidence
T2  - CIRCULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We investigated the joint associations of habitual physical activity (PA) and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with the development of hypertension in a longitudinal cohort in Taiwan. Methods: We selected 140 072 adults (>= 18 years of age) without hypertension who joined a standard medical screening program with 360 905 medical examinations between 2001 and 2016. PM(2.5)exposure was estimated at each participant's address using a satellite data-based spatiotemporal model with 1 km(2)resolution. Information on habitual PA and a wide range of covariates was collected using a standard self-administered questionnaire. We used the Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates to examine the joint associations. Results: The mean age of all observations was 41.7 years, and 48.8% were male. The mean value for systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 112.5 and 68.7mm Hg, respectively. Approximately 34.2% of all observations were inactive (0 metabolic equivalence values-hours), 29.8% had moderate-PA (median [interquartile range]; 3.75 [3.38 to 4.38] metabolic equivalence values-hours), and 36.0% had high-PA (15.7 [10.3 to 24.8] metabolic equivalence values-hours). The mean +/- SD of PM(2.5)was 26.1 +/- 7.3 mu g/m(3). The prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer was 2.1%, 2.9%, and 1.5%, respectively. After adjusting for a wide range of covariates (including a mutual adjustment for PA or PM2.5), a higher PA level was associated with a lower risk of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] for the moderate- and high-PA was 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89-0.97] and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88-0.96], respectively, as compared with the inactive-PA), whereas a higher level of PM(2.5)was associated with a higher risk of hypertension (HR for the moderate- and high-PM(2.5)was 1.37 [95% CI, 1.32-1.43] and 1.92 [95% CI, 1.81-2.04], respectively, as compared with the low-PM(2.5)group]. No significant interaction was observed between PA and PM2.5(HR 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02]). Conclusions: A high-PA and low PM(2.5)exposure were associated with a lower risk of hypertension. The negative association between PA and hypertension remained stable in people exposed to various levels of PM2.5, and the positive association between PM(2.5)and hypertension was not modified by PA. Our results indicated that PA is a suitable hypertension prevention strategy for people residing in relatively polluted regions.

TI  - Comparing methods for estimating leaf area index by multi-angular remote sensing in winter wheat
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflectance of wheat's canopy exhibits angular sensitivity, which can influence the accuracy of different methods for its leaf area index (LAI) estimation through multi-angular remote sensing. The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare the ability of various methods for LAI estimation from 13 view zenith angles (VZAs). The four methods included: (1) common hyper-spectral vegetation indices (VIs), ( 2) optimal two-band combination VIs (i.e., VIs: normalized difference index, simple ratio index, and difference vegetation index), (3) back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and (4) partial least squares regression (PLSR). Our results demonstrated that the red-edge plays a key role in estimating LAI, in that the traditional VIs, optimal two-band VIs, and PLSR including the red-edge band all showed satisfactory performance, with coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.72 in the nadir direction. However, the estimation accuracy of LAI was not positively related with band number, and BPNN gave unsatisfactory results under a larger viewing angle, with R-2 <= 0.60 for extreme angles. The predictive ability of all four methods declined with an increasing VZA, with reliable LAI estimation near the nadir direction. Importantly, by comparing the four methods, PLSR emerged as superior in both its estimation accuracy and angular insensitivity, with R-2 = 0.83 in the nadir direction and >= 0.65 for extreme angles. For this reason, we highly recommend it be used with multi-angular remote sensing data, especially in agricultural applications.

T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In their articlePsychology: a Giant with Feet of Clay, Zagaria, Ando and Zennaro aim to clean up the confusing and inconsistent conceptual landscape in current psychology. They find that evolutionary psychology with its dialectical focus on nature and nurture could be the unifying meta-theory that contemporary psychology is depending on in order to compete with harder sciences, such as biology and physiology. The aim of developing a unified conceptual consensus in psychology is flattering. However, the view depends on a worldview that one can reach a psychological science with objective properties through universal concepts that are non-effected by cognitive factors. My point of view is that psychological concepts carry a great deal of implicit theoretical baggage because they come with rich connotations, acquired through everyday usage. My view has got a methodological point that leads to considerations concerning the question: how psychologists are to study concepts in order to understand them? To grasp the meaning of a given concept in its context means to understand not only its literal meaning but also how it can be applied to the world and what is done by it. All these dimensions of the meaning of a concept are deeply rooted in the respective diachronic and synchronic contexts, and that is why a psychologist should be radically prepared to change her or his expectations considering the meaning of any concept under study.

TI  - Conserving the axilla in breast cancer
T2  - ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - It is recognised that surgical conservatism is the most effective way of managing the axilla in breast cancer patients undergoing primary breast conserving surgery. The extended clinical scenarios in which a less aggressive approach can be safely adopted warrant consideration-including a group of patients who potentially could bypass surgical staging of the axilla altogether. The application of omission of further surgical management and axillary radiotherapy in the primary surgical and neoadjuvant chemotherapy settings are considered.

TI  - Monitoring of Canopy Reflectance Change Based on Flowering Rate
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data have certain disadvantages as well as being a widely used tool for investigating biophysical and biochemical characteristics in grasslands due to its many advantages. Most importantly, some external influences have negative effects on the signals obtained from the canopy. Studies conducted in recent years have revealed that one of these negative externalities is the flowering on the canopy. The purpose of this study is to show how spectral reflectance readings are affected in samples with different flowering rates. The following procedure in the given order was carried out, and this procedure was repeated for a total of 46 measurements from within 10 quadrats: (1) placing quadrats of 50 x 50 cm on selected sampling areas, (2) performing spectral measurements in the quadrats, (3) measuring the chlorophyll content, (4) taking photographs of the quadrats and (5) subtilization of some of the flowers in the quadrats. Vegetation indices were also generated from collected spectral data during the data processing stage, and the flowering rate in each canopy was determined by the supervised classification method. Relations between flowering rate and spectral data were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression models. The results show that there was a linear relationship between the flowering rate and the spectral reflectance in the red and green regions, whereas there was no statistically significant relationship with the reflectance in the NIR region. Moreover, all vegetation indices, especially REP, were affected from flowering variations. This effect was found to be lower in heterogeneous samples and higher in homogeneous samples. Evidence was found that the basic factor governing this effect was the fact that the flowers formed an obstacle to the detection of chlorophyll content by covering a certain part of the canopy.

TI  - Automatic measurement of mandibular cortical bone width on cone-beam computed tomography images
T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The computed tomography cortical index (CTCI), computed tomography mandibular index (CTMI), and computed tomography index (inferior) [CTI(I)] are indexes obtained from cone-beam computed tomography images for the assessment of the mandibular cortex quality for implant planning or osteoporosis. However, cross-sectional image reconstruction for the measurements is labor-intensive. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a method to automatically reconstruct cross-sectional images and measure the cortex width in all areas inferior to the mental foramen (MF). Methods Seventy-one women (mean age: 52.4 years; range: 20-78 years) were enrolled. They were divided into four age and CTCI groups, including females younger (FY) and females older (FO) than 50 years (C1: normal, C2: mild/moderate erosion, and C3: severe porosity). Automatic and manual measurements of CTMI and CTI(I) were compared, and the inter- and intraobserver agreements were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The relationships between CTMI or CTI(I) and CTCI were also assessed. Results The mean processing times for reconstruction and measurements were 31.9 s and 1.22 s, respectively. ICCs for the comparison of automatic and manual measurements were 0.932 and 0.993 in the C1 and C2/C3 groups, respectively. Significant differences in CTMI and CTI(I) were observed between the FY or the FO-C1 and FO-C3 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion The automatic and manual measurements showed a strong agreement. The new method could drastically reduce routine clinical workload. Additionally, our method enables the measurement of the cortex width in all the mandibular bones inferior to the MF.

TI  - Novel Fig-Associated Viroid-Like RNAs Containing Hammerhead Ribozymes in Both Polarity Strands Identified by High-Throughput Sequencing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, the existence of viroid-like RNAs (Vd-LRNAs) associated with fig trees grown in the Hawaiian Islands has been predicted. One of these RNAs has been characterized as a circular RNA ranging in size from 357 to 360 nucleotides. Structural and biochemical features of this RNA, tentatively named fig hammerhead viroid-like RNA (FHVd-LR), markedly resemble those previously reported for several viroids and viroid-like satellite RNAs (Vd-LsatRNAs), which are non-protein-coding RNAs infecting their hosts autonomously and in combination with a helper virus, respectively. The full-length sequence of FHVd-LR variants was determined by RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Despite a low global sequence identity with known viroids and Vd-LsatRNAs, FHVd-LR contains a hammerhead ribozyme (HRz) in each polarity strand. Northern blot hybridization assays identified the circular and linear forms of both polarity strands of FHVd-LR and showed that one strand, assigned the (+) polarity, accumulates at higher levels than the (-) polarity strandin vivo.The (+) polarity RNA assumes a rod-like secondary structure of minimal free energy with the conserved domains of the HRzs located in opposition to each other, a feature typical of several viroids and Vd-LRNAs. The HRzs of both FHVd-LR polarity strands were shown to be activein vitroduring transcription, self-cleaving the RNAs at the predicted sites. These data, together with the sequence variability observed in the cloned and sequenced full-length variants, indicate that FHVd-LR is a novel viroid or Vd-LsatRNA. According to HTS data, the coexistence of FHVd-LR of different sizes in the same host cannot be excluded. The relationships of FHVd-LR with previously reported viroids and Vd-LsatRNAs, and the need to perform bioassays to conclusively clarify the biological nature of this circular RNA, are discussed.

TI  - Glacier shrinkage in the Alps continues unabated as revealed by a new glacier inventory from Sentinel-2
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The ongoing glacier shrinkage in the Alps requires frequent updates of glacier outlines to provide an accurate database for monitoring, modelling purposes (e.g. determination of run-off, mass balance, or future glacier extent), and other applications. With the launch of the first Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite in 2015, it became possible to create a consistent, Alpine-wide glacier inventory with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 10 m. The first S2 images from August 2015 already provided excellent mapping conditions for most glacierized regions in the Alps and were used as a base for the compilation of a new Alpine-wide glacier inventory in a collaborative team effort. In all countries, glacier outlines from the latest national inventories have been used as a guide to compile an update consistent with the respective previous interpretation. The automated mapping of clean glacier ice was straightforward using the band ratio method, but the numerous debris-covered glaciers required intense manual editing. Cloud cover over many glaciers in Italy required also including S2 scenes from 2016. The outline uncertainty was determined with digitizing of 14 glaciers several times by all participants. Topographic information for all glaciers was obtained from the ALOS AW3D30 digital elevation model (DEM). Overall, we derived a total glacier area of 1806 +/- 60 km(2) when considering 4395 glaciers > 0.01 km(2). This is 14% (-1.2% a(-1)) less than the 2100 km(2) derived from Landsat in 2003 and indicates an unabated continuation of glacier shrinkage in the Alps since the mid-1980s. It is a lower-bound estimate, as due to the higher spatial resolution of S2 many small glaciers were additionally mapped or increased in size compared to 2003. Median elevations peak around 3000ma.s.l., with a high variability that depends on location and aspect. The uncertainty assessment revealed locally strong differences in interpretation of debris-covered glaciers, resulting in limitations for change assessment when using glacier extents digitized by different analysts. The inventory is available at https.//doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.909133 (Paul et al., 2019).

TI  - In-orbit Earth reflectance validation of TROPOMI on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the study described in this paper is to determine the accuracy of the radiometric calibration of the TROPOMI instrument in flight, using its Earth radiance and solar irradiance measurements, from which the Earth reflectance is determined. The Earth reflectances are compared to radiative transfer calculations. We restrict ourselves to clear-sky observations as these are less difficult to model than observations containing clouds and/or aerosols. The limiting factor in the radiative transfer calculations is then the knowledge of the surface reflectance. We use OMI and SCIAMACHY surface Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) information to model the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This Lambertian, nondirectional description of the surface reflection contribution results in a relatively large source of uncertainty in the calculations. These errors can be reduced significantly by filtering out geometries for which we know that surface LER is a poor approximation of the real surface reflectivity. This filtering is done by comparing the OMI/SCIAMACHY surface LER information to MODIS surface BRDF information.We report calibration accuracies and errors for 21 selected wavelength bands between 328 and 2314 nm, located in TROPOMI spectral bands 3-7. All wavelength bands show good linear response to the intensity of the radiation and negligible offset problems. Reflectances in spectral bands 5 and 6 (wavelength bands 670 to 772 nm) have good absolute agreement with the simulations, showing calibration errors on the order of 0.01 or 0 %-3 %. Trends over the mission lifetime, due to instrument degradation, are studied and found to be negligible at these wavelengths. Reflectances in bands 3 and 4 (wavelength bands 328 to 494 nm), on the other hand, are found to be affected by serious calibration errors, on the order of 0.004-0.02 and ranging between 6 % and 10 %, depending on the wavelength. The TROPOMI requirements (of 2 % maximal deviation) are not met in this case. Trends due to instrument degradation are also found, being strongest for the 328 nm wavelength band and almost absent for the 494 nm wavelength band.The validation results obtained for TROPOMI spectral band 7 show behaviour that we cannot fully explain. As a result, these results call for more research and different methods to study the calibration of the reflectance. It seems plausible, though, that the reflectance for this particular band is underestimated by about 6 %. A table is provided containing the final results for all 21 selected wavelength bands.

TI  - Integration of high-resolution optical and SAR satellite remote sensing datasets for aboveground biomass estimation in subtropical pine forest, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate stand-alone and combined Pleiades high-resolution passive optical and ALOS PALSAR active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in subtropical mountainous Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest in Murree Forest Division, Punjab, Pakistan. Spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, etc.) and sigma nought HV-polarization backscatter dB values are derived from processing optical and SAR datasets, respectively, and modeled against field-measured AGB values through various regression models (linear, nonlinear, multi-linear). For combination of multiple spectral indices, NDVI, TNDVI, and MSAVI2 performed the best with modelR(2)/RMSE values of 0.86/47.3 tons/ha. AGB modeling with SAR sigma nought dB values gives low modelR(2)value of 0.39. The multi-linear combination of SAR sigma nought dB values with spectral indices exhibits more variability as compared with the combined spectral indices model. The Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) results follow closely the behavior of the model statistics. SAR data reaches AGB saturation at around 120-140 tons/ha, with the region of high sensitivity around 50-130 tons/ha; the SAR-derived AGB results show clear underestimation at higher AGB values. The models involving only spectral indices underestimate AGB at low values (< 60 tons/ha). This study presents biomass estimation maps of the Chir Pine forest in the study area and also the suitability of optical and SAR satellite imagery for estimating various biomass ranges. The results of this work can be utilized towards environmental monitoring and policy-level applications, including forest ecosystem management, environmental impact assessment, and performance-based REDD+ payment distribution.

TI  - Examining the PALSAR-2 Global forest/non-forest maps through Turkish afforestation practices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests and afforestation have significant importance, given the present course of World's climate resulting from our insensitive behaviours, policies, ambitions, etc. Turkish Forest Service has departments, sole purposes of which are to combat desertification through afforestation, flood control, and watershed rehabilitation works. Majority of the works is carried out in the semi-arid central part of the country, which is known as the Irano-Turanian phytogeographic region. Hydroelectric dam projects, which have extensively been conducted to produce energy and to harness the rivers when needed, have been at the centre of these efforts in the region. Afforestation works, which have long been used to safeguard dam reservoirs, have always been associated with such projects because they are implemented even prior to water deposition. They along with the country's managed forests are looked after as the natural forest cover. Improvements in remote sensing at this point enabled the agencies to diversify their efforts in monitoring the natural resources and strengthening the decision makers' hand in management preferences in both global and regional scales. There are various data produced through the classification of satellite imagery representing the existence or the percentage of forests in any location on Earth. In this study, Global Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar PALSAR-2/PALSAR mosaic and forest/non-forest maps of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Global Forest Cover Change (GFCC) thematic image tiles of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which are two of the widely accepted such data, were compared to one another and to our control results produced by a pixel-based classification method to assess the performance of afforestation works around seven major hydroelectric dam reservoirs situated within the central part of Turkey. The results showed that Global PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest maps were somewhat capturing the trend, but overly exaggerating the ground facts up to 1064%. GFCC epochs, on the other hand, did not yield sound results in this semi-arid part of Turkey. Latter data could not even capture the successfully afforested sites.

TI  - Comparison between laparoscopic and robotic surgery for sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer using indocyanine green and near infra-red fluorescence imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) and near infra-red fluorescence imaging in minimally invasive surgery is an option to map sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of SLN mapping between laparoscopic and robotic surgery. One-hundred-and-forty women with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer, were treated with a minimally invasive hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and SLN mapping. After anaesthetic induction, ICG was superficially injected into cervical submucosa and deeply injected into the cervical stroma at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions (1.25 mg/site). Eleven cases were abandoned after ICG injection (laparoscopic surgery seven cases and robotic surgery four cases) because of obesity, technical difficulty and peritoneal disease. One-hundred-and-eleven patients were analysed. Seventy-six patients had a laparoscopic procedure and 33 patients had robotic surgery. The overall and bilateral detection rates were 97% and 83% for laparoscopic surgery and 88% and 73% for robotic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was superior to robotic surgery in terms of overall detection (p-value .046). There was no significant difference in the intra-operative SLN identification time or SLN dissection time between laparoscopy and robotic surgery (p-value .247 and .145, respectively). Further research is required to compare laparoscopy and robotic surgery in terms of SLN detection.Impact Statement What is already known on this subject?Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping aims to avoid complications and provide useful staging information for endometrial cancer. ICG has been shown to improve the detection rate and NPV compared with other tracers (blue dye and technetium 99). No data exists comparing SLN mapping rates using ICG in laparoscopy and robotic surgery. What do the results of this study add?The overall and bilateral detection rates were 97% and 83% for laparoscopic surgery and 88% and 73% for robotic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was superior to robotic surgery in terms of overall detection. There was no significant difference in the intra-operative SLN identification time or SLN dissection time between laparoscopy and robotic surgery. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?: This study confirms that laparoscopy and robotic surgery are not different in terms of bilateral detection rate and SLN operating time; the study population is small.

TI  - Prediction Model of Thermal Thawing Sensibility and Thaw Depth for Permafrost Embankment along the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor Using MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper was to reveal the distribution law of permafrost thermal thawing sensibility and thaw depth caused by road construction in Qinghai-Tibet engineering corridor (QTEC). The prediction models of permafrost thermal thawing sensibility and thaw depth have been developed by incorporating the MODIS and in situ soil temperature observation data. The comprehensive earth-atmosphere-coupled numerical models of different embankment structures have been utilized to calculate the thaw depth of the underlying permafrost foundation. Finally, using the given data and above developed prediction models, the distribution maps of permafrost thermal thawing sensibility and thaw depth in QTEC are obtained by grid calculation. The results show the following: (1) Insensitive permafrost of QTEC mainly distributes in the large-scale mountain and high latitude area, and highly sensitive permafrost is located in the perennial river bed, flood plain, and terrace regions. (2) Road construction has a strong thermal disturbance to underlying permafrost, and the proportion of large thaw depth area of separate embankment is obviously smaller than that of 26 m full-width embankment. (3) Increase of subgrade interval reduces the proportion of large thaw depth areas, and the application of separate embankment structure is an effective engineering means for the Qinghai-Tibet expressway.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-1 offshore winds and average wind power estimation around Ireland
T2  - WIND ENERGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, surface wind speed and average wind power derived from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Level 2 Ocean (OCN) product were validated against four weather buoys and three coastal weather stations around Ireland. A total of 1544 match-up points was obtained over a 2-year period running from May 2017 to May 2019. The match-up comparison showed that the satellite data underestimated the wind speed compared to in situ devices, with an average bias of 0.4 m s(-1), which decreased linearly as a function of average wind speed. Long-term statistics using all the available data, while assuming a Weibull law for the wind speed, were also produced and resulted in a significant reduction of the bias. Additionally, the average wind power was found to be consistent with in situ data, resulting in an error of 10% and 5% for weather buoys and coastal stations, respectively. These results show that the Sentinel-1 Level 2 OCN product can be used to estimate the wind resource distribution, even in coastal areas. Maps of the average and seasonal wind speed and wind power illustrated that the error was spatially dependent, which should be taken into consideration when working with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data.

TI  - Crop type identification and spatial mapping using Sentinel-2 satellite data with focus on field-level information
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of croplands helps in making decisions (for insurance claims, crop management and contingency plans) at the macro-level, especially in drylands where variability in cropping is very high owing to erratic weather conditions. Dryland cereals and grain legumes are key to ensuring the food and nutritional security of a large number of vulnerable populations living in the drylands. Reliable information on area cultivated to such crops forms part of the national accounting of food production and supply in many Asian countries, many of which are employing remote sensing tools to improve the accuracy of assessments of cultivated areas. This paper assesses the capabilities and limitations of mapping cultivated areas in the Rabi (winter) season and corresponding cropping patterns in three districts characterized by small-plot agriculture. The study used Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 15-day time-series at 10 m resolution by employing a Spectral Matching Technique (SMT) approach. The use of SMT is based on the well-studied relationship between temporal NDVI signatures and crop phenology. The rabi season in India, dominated by non-rainy days, is best suited for the application of this method, as persistent cloud cover will hamper the availability of images necessary to generate clearly differentiating temporal signatures. Our study showed that the temporal signatures of wheat, chickpea and mustard are easily distinguishable, enabling an overall accuracy of 84%, with wheat and mustard achieving 86% and 94% accuracies, respectively. The most significant misclassifications were in irrigated areas for mustard and wheat, in small-plot mustard fields covered by trees and in fragmented chickpea areas. A comparison of district-wise national crop statistics and those obtained from this study revealed a correlation of 96%.

TI  - Delineation of the forest-tundra ecotone using texture-based classification of satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition zone between the boreal forest and Arctic tundra, the forest-tundra ecotone (FTE), is an area of high ecological and climatological significance. Despite its importance, a globally consistent high spatial resolution mapping is lacking. Accurate mapping of the FTE requires the use of satellite remote sensing data. Here we use the Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product and reference point data to derive the location and characteristics of the FTE. An image texture-based supervised classification scheme is developed based on a study area in Central Eurasia to statistically exploit the spatial patterns of the transition zone. Texture statistics for the VCF image are derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based on which the study area is classified into forest, tundra, and FTEs. Adaptive parameterization is implemented to achieve optimal classification performance in the study area. This method is further applied to six additional study areas around the circumarctic region to test its adaptability. In all study areas, this method achieves better FTE delineation results than previously reported methods, showing better classification accuracies (average of 0.826) and more realistic and complete representation of the FTE as shown by visual examination. This shows the universal applicability of the method and it is potential to be used to achieve more detailed and accurate circumarctic mapping of the FTE, which could serve as the basis of time series analysis of FTE positions, eventually contributing to a better understanding of the inter-relations between climate change and shifts in sub-arctic vegetation.

TI  - Can ensemble techniques improve coral reef habitat classification accuracy using multispectral data?
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has potential in studies of the benthic habitat and extracting the reflectance from the data of multispectral sensors, but traditional image classification techniques cannot provide coral habitat maps with adequate accuracy. This study tested five traditional and three ensemble classification techniques on QuickBird for mapping the benthic composition of coral reefs on the Lang Tengah Island (Malaysia). The common techniques, minimum distance, maximum likelihood,K-nearest neighbour, Fisher and parallelepiped techniques were compared with ensemble classifiers, such as majority voting (MV), simple averaging, and mode combination. The per-class accuracy of the habitat detection improved in the ensemble classifiers; in particular, the MV classifier achieved 95%, 65%, 75% and 95% accuracies for coral, sparse coral, coral rubble and sand, respectively. Ensembles increased the accuracy of the habitat mapping classification by 28%, relative to conventional techniques. Thus, the ensemble techniques can be preferred over the traditional for benthic habitat mapping.

TI  - Recent glacier variations on Mount Melimoyu (44°50'S-72°51'W), Chilean Patagonia, using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyzed the application of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and GLIMS data for mapping glacier retreat and to estimate glacier area changes of Mount Melimoyu, located in northern Patagonia, Chile for the period between 1970 and 2017. The results showed a decrease of about 35.61% in the area for the period analyzed and there is a continuing retreating trend in the region. The decreasing trend in mean annual precipitation may explain the recent glacier changes, which indicates a large sensibility for meteorological variability of glaciers, which is influenced by geomorphometry and glacier area, in the region. Using Sentinel 2 imagery, we provided inventory of rock glaciers in the study area. Glacier outlines obtained through manual delineation showed comparable results with the glacier outlines using Sentinel-2 MSI data in the study area, which shows greater accuracy in glacier mapping using Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Drivers of the spatial phytoplankton gradient in estuarine-coastal systems: generic implications of a case study in a Dutch tidal bay
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the primary energy and carbon source in aquatic food webs, phytoplankton generally display spatial heterogeneity due to complicated biotic and abiotic controls; however our understanding of the causes of this spatial heterogeneity is challenging, as it involves multiple regulatory mechanisms. We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19 years (1995-2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine- coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.

TI  - Climate change drives glacier retreat in Bhaga basin located in Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports changes in different glaciers of Bhaga basin located in western Himalaya, from 1979 to 2017. Glacier boundaries were delineated through semi-automated approach using Landsat satellite imagery. The variation of glacier extent in different elevation zones, snout retreat and decadal changes are observed. Results show that the total area of glaciers was 238 km2in 1979, which reduced to 230.8 km2by 2017 (retreat rate 12m yr-1). Glaciers at low elevation and smaller in size are retreating faster. Analysis of Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation data shows decreasing trend of annual precipitation (-2.724 mm yr-1, 1951-2015) and increasing trend of mean annual temperature (0.021 degrees C yr-1). The statistical analysis using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope tests, applied at different confidence interval demonstrates that climate change corresponds to deglaciation, and topography controls glacier recession in the basin.

TI  - Applicability of ordinary Kriging modeling techniques for filling satellite data gaps in support of coastal management
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective coastal zone management relies on accurate and sound data of environmental parameters. In many cases, however, lack of pertinent environmental variable datasets hinders the development of sustainable policies and practices. Marine remote sensing has been used extensively to provide such datasets, with limited success due to different spatial resolutions, non-overlapping grids, and different spatial extent, since, in most cases, they are derived from miscellaneous sources. Several methods have been proposed aiming to overcome this problem and enable remote-sensing techniques to attain the highest possible applicability in coastal ecosystem management studies. Most of these techniques use interpolation modeling techniques for satellite data gap filling near the shoreline. This paper presents the use of the Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology, as an interpolator of satellite data, from miscellaneous and variant environmental datasets of the territorial waters of the Heraklion Prefecture, on the island of Crete. The applicability of OK in satellite data gap filling was examined by the use of cross-validation, taking into account resolution levels for optimum estimations. In addition, a number of diagnostic statistics were employed to evaluate the performance of the interpolation models used. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is valid and independent of remote-sensing data characteristics, thus proving that OK can be used to homogenize effectively and integrate fully diverse satellite datasets. This study concludes that the methodology described in predicting estimates of missing values of satellite data with statistical certainty can be used as an effective tool in coastal management.

TI  - Detection of wind corridors based on "Climatopes": a study in central Ji'nan
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind corridor blueprints are an essential reference for climate planning that takes into account zones of fresh cold air, air channels as well as heat island alleviation zones. This article addresses the matter of how to plan urban wind corridors more efficiently by proposing a "ventilation potential coefficient" (VPC) as well as providing an index for natural cold sources. The study additionally proposes a surface urban heat island (SUHI) index as a means of evaluating the severity of the heat island effect. Based on these three indexes, a new method of categorizing urban climatic zones, called "Climatopes", is developed. Using the above methods, data from 2016 meteorological observation stations and Landsat8 satellites, as well as urban planning materials and basic geographical information on a scale of 1:2000 are used to create an Urban Climate Analysis Map (UCAnMap) and formulate a plan for the construction of wind corridors in the urban centre of Ji'nan. The results reveal that the intensity of urban heat islands in Ji'nan is closely related to a lack of natural cold sources, the specific layout of different types of land use as well as poor planning of urban "function zones". Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the VPC and other factors such as surface roughness length, building height, the density of building frontal area and floor area ratios. The potential wind corridors could also be determined based on the VPC. Based on an UCAnMap composed of 11 Climatopes and background wind environments, this article ascertains that it would be possible to construct a network of 3 Level One corridors (each over 500 m wide) and 11 Level Two corridors (each over 80-m wide). Additionally, regulatory measures and protective legislation are proposed for the corridors, as well as for the city's overall development.

TI  - Evaluation of Extra-axillary Lymph Nodes by Ultrasound in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - An integral part of management of breast cancer is the appropriate treatment of the involved lymph nodes. While axillary nodes are always assessed and managed by sentinel node biopsy or an axillary clearance, the extra-axillary nodes do not receive equivalent attention even though they may influence staging, treatment, and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the extra-axillary nodes by Doppler ultrasonogram in 228 patients with breast cancer over an 8-year period from January 2012 to January 2020. It is a case series analysis to evaluate axillary and extra-axillary lymph node basins in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using linear array transducer ultrasonogram. It was found that while patients with T1 and T2 lesions did not have extra-axillary nodal involvement, 12% of T3 lesions (102 patients) and 50% of T4 lesions (48 patients) exhibited extra-axillary node involvement. Among the extra-axillary sites, internal mammary nodes were most often involved (24 patients) followed by infra-clavicular (8 patients) and supra-clavicular (4 patients) sites. Clinical examination by palpation could detect only the supra-clavicular nodes but was false negative in all patients who had an internal mammary or infra-clavicular node detected on ultrasound. Failure to identify internal mammary, supra-clavicular, and infra-clavicular lymph nodes can result in erroneous understaging in breast cancer patients leading to inadequate treatment and worse than anticipated prognosis. Therefore, all breast cancer patients as part of their pre-treatment protocol should undergo focused ultrasonogram evaluation of their axillary as well as extra-axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Deep-hole in situ stress measurement method in high-altitude area based on remote sensing technology
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the understanding of the physical properties of earthquakes and the interior of the earth, a method for measuring deep-hole in situ stress in high-altitude areas based on remote sensing technology is proposed. The area of 2500 m above sea level is selected as the research area of in situ stress measurement in this paper. The digital image of Landsat TM5 (30 m) is used as the main information source, and the spectrum of the visible-shortwave infrared band is 0.38-2.5 um. The information enhancement of TM7-4-2 band is selected to process the clear remote sensing image of the research area. After locating deep boreholes based on remote sensing images, the in situ stress of deep boreholes is measured by the non-elastic strain recovery method. Core samples at five depths of 730 m, 980 m, 1030 m, 1080 m, and 1110 m are extracted and pasted with 18 strain gauges. The principal stress direction is obtained by core orientation, and the stress components are determined by calculating six independent directions of inelastic normal strain and rock's inelastic strain recovery flexibility. The results are as follows: the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress is 31 degrees similar to 46 degrees and the dominant direction is 36 degrees; the inelastic strain of each strain gauge is positive strain, the curve increases steadily with time, and the initial inelastic strain increases quickly and then slows down, which accords with the law of inelastic strain change. Experiments show that this method can provide a basis for the study of geological conditions at high altitudes.

TI  - Shoulder amplitude movement does not influence postoperative wound complications after breast cancer surgery: a randomized clinical trial
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The goal of this study is to evaluate the influence of shoulder exercises with restricted amplitude movement (RAM) or free amplitude movement (FAM) performed from the first postoperative day (1st POD) on the incidence of surgical wound complications (SWC) in breast cancer. Methods This study comprises a randomized clinical trial with an intention-to-treat analysis including 465 women aged 18 to 79, who underwent curative surgery for breast cancer. Participants were submitted to perform free amplitude movement (FAM) or restricted amplitude movement (RAM) shoulder exercises, until the 30th postoperative day. The outcome measures were the SWC: seroma, dehiscence, necrosis, infection, hematoma and bruise. Results 461 participants completed the follow-up. Thirty days after surgery, 63.8% of the women presented some surgical wound complication, with necrosis (39.3%) and seroma (30.8%) as the most frequent. No statistically significant differences in SWC according to postoperative amplitude shoulder exercise (FAM vs RAM), even after a stratified analysis by type of surgery (segmentectomy vs mastectomy) or axillary approach (axillary lymphadenectomy versus sentinel lymph node biopsy) were observed. Conclusion FAM exercises do not increase the incidence of postoperative wound complications compared to RAM exercises.

TI  - Driving forces of grassland vegetation changes in Chen Barag Banner, Inner Mongolia
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia is an important ecological zone of northern China and 67% of its land area is grassland. This ecologically fragile region has experienced significant vegetation degradation during the last decades. Although the spatial extents and rates of vegetation change have previously been characterized through various remote sensing and GIS studies, the underlying driving factors of vegetation changes are still not well understood. In this study, we first used time-series MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2016 to characterize the temporal trend of vegetation changes. These vegetation change trends were compared with climate and socioeconomic variables to determine the potential drivers. We used a set of statistical methods, including multiple linear regression (MLR), spatial correlation analysis, and partial least squares (PLS) regression analyzes, to quantify the spatial distribution of the driving forces and their relative importance to vegetation changes. Results show that the main driving factors and their impact magnitude (weight) are in the order of human activities (r = -0.785, p < 0.01, VIP = 1.37), precipitation (r = 0.541, p < 0.05, VIP = 0.89), temperature (r = -0.319, p > 0.05 VIP = 0.59). The area affected by human activities was 10.57%. Specific human activities, such as coal mining and grazing were negatively associated with vegetation cover, while eco-engineering projects had positive impacts. This study provided thorough quantification of driving forces of vegetation change and enhanced our understanding of their interactions. Our integrated geospatial-statistical approach is particularly important for sustainable development of ecosystem balance in Chen Barag Banner and other areas facing similar challenges.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy predicts systemic recurrence in digital papillary adenocarcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Digital papillary adenocarcinoma (DPA) is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of sweat gland origin. It can recur at local, regional, or distant sites. There is limited knowledge about the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in predicting recurrence in these patients. We present our experience with this uncommon tumor to evaluate the role of SLNB in predicting outcome. Methods Medical records of all patients who underwent surgical treatment for biopsy-proven upper extremity DPA at the study institution were reviewed. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze data. Results Twenty-one patients were identified. Most patients were male (71%), and the median age was 51 years. SLNB was performed in 18 patients; three were positive for nodal metastatic disease (17%). At a median follow-up of 53 months, there were no local recurrences and two cases of systemic recurrence. No patient with a negative sentinel lymph node has evidence of metastasis or recurrence. Fisher's exact test demonstrated a significant association between a positive SLNB and recurrence (P = .02). Conclusion SLNB revealed metastatic disease in 17% of patients with DPA and appears to predict systemic recurrence in this small series.

TI  - Dissecting the genetic overlap of smoking behaviors, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A focus on nicotinic receptors and nicotine metabolizing enzyme
T2  - GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoking is a major contributor to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two of the strongest genetic associations of smoking-related phenotypes are the chromosomal regions 15q25.1, encompassing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genesCHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4, and 19q13.2, encompassing the nicotine metabolizing geneCYP2A6. In this study, we examined genetic relations between cigarettes smoked per day, smoking cessation, lung cancer, and COPD. Data consisted of genome-wide association study summary results. Genetic correlations were estimated using linkage disequilibrium score regression software. For each pair of outcomes, z-score-z-score (ZZ) plots were generated. Overall, heavier smoking and decreased smoking cessation showed positive genetic associations with increased lung cancer and COPD risk. The chromosomal region 19q13.2, however, showed a different correlational pattern. For example, the effect allele-C of the sentinel SNP (rs56113850) withinCYP2A6was associated with an increased risk of heavier smoking (z-score = 19.2;p = 1.10 x 10(-81)), lung cancer (z-score = 8.91;p = 5.02 x 10(-19)), and COPD (z-score = 4.04;p = 5.40 x 10(-5)). Surprisingly, this allele-C (rs56113850) was associated with increased smoking cessation (z-score = -8.17;p = 2.52 x 10(-26)). This inverse relationship highlights the need for additional investigation to determine howCYP2A6variation could increase smoking cessation while also increasing the risk of lung cancer and COPD likely through increased cigarettes smoked per day.

TI  - Linkage Between the Vertical Evolution of Clouds and Droplet Growth Modes as Seen From FY-4A AGRI and GPM DPR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on matched scans from the FY-4A satellite's Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) and the NASA/JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR), the microphysical mechanisms of the derived vertical evolution of cloud effective radius (Re) and its correspondence with precipitation droplet growth modes are revealed in this study. The results show that there were two turning points in the Re vertical evolution, which divided the Re profile into solid-phase, mixed-phase, and liquid-phase zones from top to bottom. There were also two turning points in the upper layer of DPR reflectivity, which showed good correspondence with Re turning points in both height and physical sense. The main droplet growth modes in the three zones are nucleation/glaciation, deposition, and riming, respectively. The linkage between Re vertical evolution and droplet growth modes would be useful in real-time monitoring of cloud microphysical processes.

TI  - A Heavy Precipitation Event in the Yangtze River Basin Led by an Eastward Moving Tibetan Plateau Cloud System in the Summer of 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - From 29 June to 6 July 2016, China's Yangtze River Basin experienced heavy precipitation, causing more than 200 deaths and affecting tens of millions of people. Using ERA5 reanalysis, soundings, and satellite observations from FY-2 and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), we reviewed this heavy rainfall event from the perspective of its meteorological triggers and the cloud microphysics. As the cloud system moved eastward from the Tibetan Plateau, precipitation particles got larger and denser, and the enhancement of stratiform precipitation contributed the most precipitation. The riming and aggregation processes, the dominant growth modes of particles, were significantly enhanced between 5.5 and 7 km. The increase in the echo-top height had a considerable positive effect on the near-surface particle size (from similar to 1.0 mm at 4 km to similar to 1.5 mm at 10 km), but this feature was not significant over the Tibetan Plateau. We suggest that the microphysics of this event was dominated by the combination of the eastward moving cloud system, which acted as continuous "seeder" cloud, and the increase in water vapor associated with the low-level vortex and jet, which generated enhancing "feeder" cloud. The particles from the "seeder" cloud grew by the lower "feeder" cloud, thus increasing the particle size to enhance the precipitation. Overall, the generation and movement of such a cloud system is an important atmospheric disturbance for the generation of heavy precipitation downstream, and could be an early warning signal in the forecasting of heavy rainfall in China during the Meiyu period.

TI  - Observations of Buried Lake Drainage on the Antarctic Ice Sheet
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 1992 and 2017, the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) lost ice equivalent to 7.6 +/- 3.9 mm of sea level rise. AIS mass loss is mitigated by ice shelves that provide a buttress by regulating ice flow from tributary glaciers. However, ice-shelf stability is threatened by meltwater ponding, which may initiate, or reactivate preexisting, fractures, currently poorly understood processes. Here, through ground penetrating radar (GPR) analysis over a buried lake in the grounding zone of an East Antarctic ice shelf, we present the first field observations of a lake drainage event in Antarctica via vertical fractures. Concurrent with the lake drainage event, we observe a decrease in surface elevation and an increase in Sentinel-1 backscatter. Finally, we suggest that fractures that are initiated or reactivated by lake drainage events in a grounding zone will propagate with ice flow onto the ice shelf itself, where they may have implications for its stability.Plain Language Summary The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is losing mass, thereby contributing to sea level rise. Ice shelves, which are thick floating layers of glacier ice extending from the glaciers on land, buttress much of the AIS and protect it from even more mass loss. The stability of these ice shelves is threatened by meltwater ponds that form during the summer and may cause ice shelves to break up. Here, we present field observations from Antarctica of a buried meltwater lake drainage via vertical fractures. To detect the drainage event, we use radar observations collected in the field, along with surface height changes and radar images from satellites, from both before and after the drainage event. Our study improves the understanding of meltwater processes on Antarctic ice shelves, and implications of those processes on ice-shelf stability.

AB  - Treatment of cutaneous melanoma is changing with significant developments over the past several years that promise to reshape the field of melanoma surgical oncology. Modifications to the staging system based on analysis of a large international dataset, the timing and extent of regional lymphadenectomy, the emergence of effective systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, and the role of adjuvant radiation are all undergoing a data-driven evolution. Surgeon engagement in multidisciplinary decision making remains an essential component of contemporary management for patients across all stages of melanoma and demands specific involvement of head and neck surgical oncologists.

TI  - Classification tree analysis (CTA) of smoke detection using Himawari_8 satellite data over Sumatera-Borneo Island, Indonesia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) for automatic smoke detection using Himawari_8 Satellite data over the Maritime Continent of Sumatera and Borneo Islands in Indonesia. Two timestamps of the Region of Interest (ROI) sampling, including Cumulonimbus (Cb) top, low-middle cloud, smoke, bare soil, cirrus cloud, vegetation, and water classes, were used as the input to determine the best CTA models. The CTA model classification was supervised using a collection of 21 single and transformation bands. The study also employed and compared two impurity measures, the Gini Index, and Entropy. The responses of the output of 4 CTA models (Entropy-09, Gini-09, Entropy-10, and Gini-10) were spatially, temporally, and statistically analysed. Furthermore, the CTA models were validated using METAR data (weather airport observation), with results showing that Entropy-10 have the highest Overall Accuracy value of 0.79, and lowest False Alarm Rate Value of 0.11. The computing time shows that Entropy-9 is the fastest with a mean of 19.8 s, followed by entropy-10 with 20.7 s. The accuracy assessment, spatial and temporal analyses, and computing process revealed that the Entropy-10 was the best model. The results of the CTA Entropy-10 are implemented over a small area, such as an airport to justify the work of weather observers and forecasters. This is often based on the objective satellite-based smoke detection product. Furthermore, they serve as information for aviation users in improving their situational awareness of adverse weather conditions related to safety.

TI  - Effect of Dust Load on the Cloud Top Ice-Water Partitioning Over Northern Middle to High Latitudes With CALIPSO Products
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified effects of dust load on the cloud top ice cloud fraction (ICF) in terms of the dust extinction coefficient (sigma(ext)). We analyzed 3-year data sets obtained from an active satellite sensor over middle to high latitudes in the northern hemisphere for temperatures (T) between 230 and 273 K and sigma(ext) values between 0.005 and 0.145 km(-1). At about 250 K, ICF changed by about 30% in response to the above range of sigma(ext), whereas at extreme T values, ICF was relatively insensitive to sigma(ext). Thus, we concluded that ICF was primarily determined by T, with substantial influence of sigma(ext) at about 250 K, likely due to increased opportunities for freezing as sigma(ext) increases. Sensitivity of ICF was the lowest both at the largest sigma(ext) and lowest T and at the smallest sigma(ext) and highest T, while it was the highest at about 0.03 km(-1) of sigma(ext) and about 250 K. If there are any physical parameters that influence the ICF except temperature (T), how much does this parameter influence ICF in a given T? Dust particles have been long known as efficient ice nucleating particles. Although previous studies suggested that more dust particles increased ICF, they did not use quantitative parameters of the dust amount, but less-quantitative indicators such as relative dust frequency. Therefore, we used the dust extinction coefficient (sigma(ext)) as a quantitative parameter of dust amount and examined the relationship between the dust amount and ICF for T between 230 and 273 K. We observed the following phenomena from satellite data. At about 250 K, ICF substantially depended on sigma(ext) likely due to increased opportunities for freezing as sigma(ext) increases. However, at extreme T values, ICF was relatively insensitive to sigma(ext). Moreover, we found that sensitivity of ICF was the lowest both at the largest sigma(ext) and lowest T and at the smallest sigma(ext) and highest T, while it was the highest at about 0.03 km(-1) of sigma(ext) and about 250 K. These behaviors of the ICF sensitivity could be understood from characteristics of T (the lower, the easier for freezing) and sigma(ext) (the larger, the easier for freezing).

TI  - Global Retrievals of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence at Red Wavelengths With TROPOMI
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of solar-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF) from spaceborne spectrometers can advance our understanding of terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles. Here we present the first global retrievals of SIF at red wavelengths from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Despite the weak signal level, considerable uncertainties, and subtle measurement artifacts, spatial patterns and magnitudes agree with independent data sets. Over land, spatial patterns of our red SIF estimates covary with the far-red SIF data. Red SIF over the ocean is highly consistent with the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) inferred from measurements of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), even when comparing single days and fine spatial scales. Major advantages of our Fraunhofer line-based SIF retrievals include the capability to sense SIF through optically thin cloud/aerosol layers and an insensitivity to ocean color. This opens up new avenues for studying ocean biogeochemistry from space.Plain Language Summary Plants absorb sunlight to power photosynthesis, but a small fraction of the energy is always re-emitted as a faint glow termed solar-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF). This weak electromagnetic signal can be measured with spectrometers that are sensitive enough and cover the wavelengths where SIF occurs (red to far red). Even though SIF is not a direct measure of the carbon uptake by photosynthesis, strong linear relationships between far-red SIF and independent estimates of photosynthesis have been observed over land. ESA's Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite hosts the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a highly sensitive sensor designed to monitor atmospheric trace gases and air pollutants from space. The band setting of TROPOMI permits us also to infer SIF in both the red and far-red wavelength domain. Here, we present global estimates of red SIF over both marine and terrestrial surfaces as seen from TROPOMI.

TI  - The Grass Is Not Always Greener on the Other Side: Seasonal Reversal of Vegetation Greenness in Aspect-Driven Semiarid Ecosystems
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our current understanding of semiarid ecosystems is that they tend to display higher vegetation greenness on polar-facing slopes (PFS) than on equatorial-facing slopes (EFS). However, recent studies have argued that higher vegetation greenness can occur on EFS during part of the year. To assess whether this seasonal reversal of aspect-driven vegetation is a common occurrence, we conducted a global-scale analysis of vegetation greenness on a monthly time scale over an 18-year period (2000-2017). We examined the influence of climate seasonality on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of PFS and EFS at 60 different catchments with aspect-controlled vegetation located across all continents except Antarctica. Our results show that an overwhelming majority of sites (70%) display seasonal reversal, associated with transitions from water-limited to energy-limited conditions during wet winters. These findings highlight the need to consider seasonal variations of aspect-driven vegetation patterns in ecohydrology, geomorphology, and Earth system models.Plain Language Summary Sunny (equatorial-facing) slopes receive more solar radiation than shady (polar-facing) slopes. A common assumption in water-limited semiarid ecosystems is that this difference in solar radiation results in shady slopes being greener than sunny slopes, because they lose less water to the atmosphere due to evapotranspiration. Some studies have suggested seasonal changes to this pattern, but the lack of a global-scale analysis has prevented a clear understanding of the extent of this phenomenon and its causes. Here, we used an 18-year record of remotely sensed monthly data to compare vegetation activity on opposing slopes in 60 semiarid catchments with different climates from all over the world. Our results show three different patterns: (1) always greener shady slopes; (2) greener shady slopes in summer but greener sunny slopes in winter; and (3) no discernible difference between slopes. Contrary to the common belief that shady slopes are always greener in semiarid landscapes, the majority of the studied sites show a seasonal reversal of this patterns in vegetation greenness. We attribute this contrasting behavior to the timing of precipitation and different growth responses of vegetation types on opposing slopes. At sites having wet winters, sunny slopes benefit more from solar radiation; hence, their vegetation grows more rapidly than that of shady slopes. These findings underline the importance of considering the seasonal variations of vegetation pattern on opposing slopes in ecohydrological, geomorphological, and Earth system models.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud-Top Property Retrievals From Advanced Himawari Imager, MODIS, CloudSat/CPR, CALIPSO/CALIOP, and Radiosonde
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The information on cloud properties and microphysical characteristics is critical for environmental research and application, such as that on weather, climate, hydrology, and green energy and Earth energy budget. The launch of the new-generation geostationary satellite, for example, the Japanese Himawari-8, enables retrieval of cloud information through multichannel observation. To confirm the retrievals from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 (Himawari-8/AHI), this study accessed the cloud retrievals from AHI and compare them against those obtained from spaceborne passive and active sensors on the low Earth orbit satellites, such as NASA's CloudSat, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). The atmospheric thermodynamic state from in situ radiosonde provides another dimension for evaluating the retrieved cloud-top temperature and height, which were obtained and analyzed during two research cruises over the South China Sea during monsoon onset season with large cloud variability to ensure the comprehensive intercomparisons. The findings show that the cloud-top altitude, cloud optical thickness, and cloud effective particle radius retrieved from AHI are consistent with passive Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Furthermore, both spaceborne active Cloud Priofiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data confirm the low uncertainty of cloud-top altitude, particularly when the cloud is optically thick. Large cloud-top altitude discrepancy among these data in the optically thin cloud might be due to the limited AHI spectral channels or instrumental spatial resolutions. The cloud-top temperature and altitudes in either liquid or ice phase cloud agree well with collocated sounding profiles, with low difference of 1 K and 170 m, respectively.

T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image analysis usually refers to processing of images with the objective of finding objects presented in the image. The extraction and the analysis of image data is a fundamental step for image segmentation, in this work a new method allowing the evolution of the threshold satellite image defined and based on the optimization multi-objective for segmentation of Worldview images and funded on the Tsallis and the Renyi entropies. The Objective is the reclassification of all unclassified pixels by the previous method in 2017. The improved analysis and the optimized method multi-objective thresholding are proposed. First, respectively for each Worldview image selected, the optimal thresholds for all the criteria used in this study is find. Finally, by using the evaluation criteria corresponding to the Levine and Nazif criteria and the criteria of the mean square error, in order to challenge the performance of this method to that previously developed in 2017. The results obtained by this approach were very satisfactory and the efficacy of this method confirmed. This method overcomes the difficulties of the method previously developed in 2017 and obtained results that are more precise. Therefore, the new method based on multi-objective optimization contribute significantly to performance.

TI  - Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.

TI  - Water Surface Elevation Constraints in a Data Assimilation Scheme to Infer Floodplain Topography: A Case Study in the Logone Floodplain
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy of inundation extents from flood models are directly related to the quality of topographic information. Globally available digital elevation models (DEMs) are not accurate enough to support flood modeling. Satellite derived flood maps provide indirect information about ground elevations. Previous work proposed a data assimilation algorithm to leverage flood maps for improving topography but was tested only in context of a numerical experiment with synthetic data. Here we show for the first time that a data assimilation algorithm leveraging real remote sensing measurements to modify floodplain DEMs improves floodplain simulations. Over our study area, we observe a significant increase in inundation prediction capability using the updated DEM, with 9-19% average improvement in skill assessment characteristics. This algorithm is promising and fairly straightforward and can be used in data-poor floodplains where high-resolution DEMs do not exist.

TI  - Effects of Snow Grain Shape and Mixing State of Snow Impurity on Retrieval of Snow Physical Parameters From Ground-Based Optical Instrument
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed new snow grain model and snow impurity mixture models for the purpose of accurate retrievals of snow grain size and concentration of light-absorbing particles (LAP) in snow from the optical remote sensing data. Two kinds of ice crystal models, irregularly shaped Voronoi columns, and Voronoi aggregates were employed. LAP can be captured by the snow through two processes: dry and wet deposition. Two different snow impurity mixture models were proposed. One is an external mixture model. We employed a coated sphere model in which soot were hydrophilic particles to represent a hygroscopic property of aerosol and assumed the hydrophilic soot particles to be externally mixed with snow particles. The other is an internal mixture model. We employed a dynamic effective medium approximation method in which soot particles were randomly located within snow particle with any size distribution and number concentration. Validation of these models is conducted using a ground-based spectral radiometer system with in situ measurement data. For snow grain size retrievals, a Voronoi mixture model seamlessly representing a geometrical shape and an optical properties of various snow types can provide accurate retrievals. For the retrieval of LAP concentration in snow, employing different mixing state models depending on season and measurement site gives accurate results. We also discussed the uncertainty of retrieved snow parameters on the surface slope involved in the retrieval accuracy. These models are expected to be useful for advanced airborne/satellite remote sensing and climate studies via radiative transfer modeling in the atmosphere-snow system.

TI  - Assessing Historical Variability of South Asian Monsoon Lows and Depressions With an Optimized Tracking Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclonic low-pressure systems (LPS) produce abundant rainfall in South Asia, where they are traditionally categorized as monsoon lows, monsoon depressions, and more intense cyclonic storms. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has tracked monsoon depressions for over a century, finding a large decline in their number in recent decades, but their methods have changed over time and do not include monsoon lows. This study presents a fast, objective algorithm for identifying monsoon LPS and uses it to assess interannual variability and trends in reanalyses. Variables and thresholds used in the algorithm are selected to best match a subjectively analyzed LPS data set while minimizing disagreement between four reanalyses in a training period. The stream function of 850 hPa horizontal wind is found to be optimal in this sense; it is less noisy than vorticity and represents the complete nondivergent wind, even when flow is not geostrophic. Using this algorithm, LPS statistics are computed for five reanalyses, and none show a detectable trend in monsoon depression counts since 1979. Both the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and the IMD data set show a step-like reduction in depression counts when they began using geostationary satellite data, in 1979 and 1982, respectively; the 1958-2018 linear trend in JRA-55, however, is smaller than in the IMD data set, and its error bar includes 0. There are more LPS in seasons with above-average monsoon rainfall and in La Nina years, but few other large-scale modes of interannual variability are found to modulate LPS counts, lifetimes, or track length consistently across reanalyses.

TI  - Monitoring land use changes and its future prospects using cellular automata simulation and artificial neural network for Ahmedabad city, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban sprawl is one of the potential threat for sustainable development. The present study has been carried out on Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) area including Ahmedabad city to monitor the urban sprawl from 1976 to 2017. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Built-Up Index, and Built-Up Index are applied to monitor the urban land use change by using multi-temporal and multi-date remote sensing satellite data from Landsat. The future scenario of urban land use prediction of AMC has been modelled by the use of cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN) with GIS techniques. The results of land use monitoring indicate that the built-up area has increased by 156.93 km(2)whereas, agricultural land, open spaces, urban vegetation, and water bodies have decreased during the last 4-decades from 1976 to 2017. Moreover, the results of CA simulation reveals that the built-up will continue to increase in the future at the cost of other classes. The decadal built-up growth was 2.58 km(2)during the earlier period and it was the highest (5.98 km(2)) during the decade of 2007-2017. The validation of results related to CA-ANN has been measured by the Kappa coefficient in which the obtained values of Kappa local, Kappa histogram and Kappa overall were 0.92, 0.75, and 0.69 respectively and the measured percentage of correctness was 78.63%. The predicted urban land use growth reveals that the built-up would cover the maximum part of the AMC area by 2027 provided that the present land use trend, demographic growth, and commercial development does not show any major change. Therefore, the study pertaining to LULC change and its future prediction will be highly helpful for urban planners and administrators to prepare a sustainable city planning for the Ahmedabad city and its surroundings.

TI  - Ocean Tide Loading Effects on InSAR Observations Over Wide Regions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent and future Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) missions provide spatially wide and temporally continuous observations capturing relative ground motions over great distances which enable nationwide or continent-wide deformation mapping. To achieve this, long wavelength errors, which increase with distance and are coupled with geophysical deformation, must be corrected. We predict the ocean tide loading (OTL) effect on Sentinel-1 interferograms globally for all ascending and descending acquisitions, and they are largest in coastal regions. Then, interferograms over southwest Britain are investigated, with the OTL correction having a similar noise reduction effect as when correcting for tropospheric delay (27% standard deviation reduction for tropospheric delay and 46% for combined tropospheric delay and OTL). OTL corrections contribute considerably to the noise reduction of the InSAR time series, with the time series standard deviation reducing by 33% after correcting tropospheric errors and 52% after also applying OTL corrections.Plain Language Summary Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) interferograms provide measurements of Earth's surface deformation at unprecedented detail over areas of tens to now several hundred kilometers with the current Sentinel-1 mission. However, geophysical signals are easily masked in these measurements by errors which increase with distance and exhibit long wavelength effects. One such long wavelength effect is ocean tide loading (OTL), which is negligible over shorter distances (tens of kilometers), but becomes important over several hundred kilometers and has not normally been considered for InSAR. Over 5 years, we evaluate the OTL effect globally on interferograms from Sentinel-1 and suggest substantial contamination arises over most coastal and many tectonically active regions. The OTL correction improves the precision of individual interferograms and contributes considerably to the noise reduction of the InSAR time series. Our results demonstrate the importance of the OTL effect on InSAR measurements for studies such as plate-scale interseismic strain rate accumulation, postseismic relaxation and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, and on those seeking to generate nationwide or continent-wide deformation products using InSAR. This will soon be even more important, as future InSAR missions (e.g., GEOSAR) may have a spatial extent of over 1,000 km.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important areas where satellite images can play a key role in the monitoring of the temporal changes is the vegetated cover regions. In particular, the conversion of natural vegetation cover types in human dominated areas is still changing on a global scale with a number of unknown consequences for the environment. In these difficult circumstances, vegetation growth monitoring technique has been proposed to monitor the agriculture fields on vegetation patterns of major unimodal (i.e. annual or yearly growth information) and bimodal (i.e. biannual or half yearly growth information) changes during the growth of the different crops. The study region which is considered in this paper contains many agricultural fields and at least two cultivation period are there to observe the unimodal and bimodal greenness change information. This type of information can be achieved by properly analysing the time series satellite images, which provides a good temporal resolution satellite images which might be having a moderate spatial resolution and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) may be one of the good option for this purpose. To analyse the unimodal and bimodal greenness, it is important to segregate the agriculture areas and then mark the area of unimodal and bimodal greenness prone zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have attempted to analyse one year satellite data of study region using harmonic analysis and proposed a probability density function (PDF) based classification technique for segregating the agriculture areas. These segregated areas are further utilized to obtain the unimodal and bimodal greenness prone zones. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Representativeness of global climate and vegetation by carbon-monitoring networks; implications for estimates of gross and net primary productivity at biome and global levels
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major uncertainties in estimating global Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is the ability of carbon-monitoring sites to represent the climate and canopy-density of global vegetation ("representativeness"). These sites are used for empirical upscaling and calibration of global landsurface models. The current study determines the representativeness of two important carbon-monitoring networks - FLUXNET2015 and the Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) - by calculating the euclidian distance in climate-canopy space between each global 0.5 degrees cell and all carbon-monitoring sites of the same biome or Plant Functional Type (PFT). Reliance on the single (most similar) site has been adopted in the past. A straightforward weighted upscaling, using inverse euclidian distance, identifies which PFTs contribute most to global primary productivity in the context of how well they are represented in carbon-monitoring networks. Some vegetation types, which are numerically well-represented within the network, are sampled at the 'wrong' latitude and in more temperate climes than their global distribution. This includes non-mediterranean needleleaf forest which is one of the main vegetation types contributing to global GPP and NPP. (Semi-)arid regions (mean annual precipitation < 400 mm yr(-1)) are undersampled as well as the sparse vegetation that tends to characterise them. These regions include the tundra and the northern half of the boreal forest where growth is disproportionately affected by climate change. We find a large spread in NPP and GPP recorded at sites of the same PFT (standard deviation is 56% mean). Consequently, our bootstrap error analysis indicates that a minimum of 50 climate-representative sites per PFT is required to quantify adequately (2% precision) the primary productivity of each global vegetation type. Selecting unchartered climate-canopy space for new sites appears to be more important than a simple increase in site numbers.

TI  - A review of the impact of blue space on the urban microclimate
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon represents a major public health issue and has received great attention due to rapid urbanisation. Blue spaces have long been considered a possible mitigation strategy to ameliorate the UHI. However, our knowledge regarding the interaction ofwaterbodieswith their urban surroundings is still limited. This review attempts through a comparative analysis of the available literature to examine the thermal effects of static blue spaces on the urban climate. Remote sensing studies are the most common approach analysed in this review but there is a clear disparity between the cooling potentials reported by remote sensing as opposed to field measurements or numerical simulations, likely due to a lack of nocturnal measurements, when warming due to thermal inertia can occur and consideration of the latent heat flux. The size and shape of blue spaces are shown to be important variables for the cooling achieved in urban settings but there is no consensus in the literature. This is likely due to the different locations and climates of the studies, it can be hypothesised that in locations with an even distribution of wind directions a rounder waterbody is more effective while in locations where wind direction is more uniform an elongated waterbody aligned to the wind is more effective due to the increased fetch. From the analysis of the literature, it is clear that there is still a distinct knowledge gap regarding the physical interpretation of waterbodies' contribution to the urban climate. There is also a current lack of information about the diurnal and seasonal variability of the various structures and processes. There is evidence, however, that the comfort achieved by sensible cooling can be offset by the increased water vapour content and that during the night blue spaces may actually exacerbate the UHI, reducing urban thermal comfort.

TI  - Geospatial and statistical interpretation of lineaments: salinity intrusion in the Kribi-Campo coastland of Cameroon
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study detected, mapped and analysed lineaments from Landsat-8 satellite images of the coastal area of Kribi-Campo, Cameroon. Kribi, a fast-growing coastal city with a youthful population whose main industry is agriculture, is currently under great pressure due to the influx of internally displaced persons, victims of the current socio-political crisis in the western part of Cameroon. With the growing demand for food and water resources, it has been reported that saline soils and groundwater are affecting the agricultural productivity and domestic water supply of the area. This paper investigates the lineaments network in this area to understand its spatial distribution, its extent and the potential effect on inland intrusion of saline water. The datasets, including Landsat-8 imagery, geological data and a digital elevation model were processed using principal component analysis and filtering techniques. Linear features were enhanced based on textural changes of false colour composite images to describe fractures, faults and hydrology features. 390 effective lineaments were extracted automatically and manually from those images and analysed based on length, density and orientation using statistical analysis. But before this processing, non-effective lineaments that may correspond to terraces, linear valleys, cliffs, or tonal contrast as well as to human activities have been deleted. The effective lineaments range in length from 95 to 4910 m with an average of 1171 m. Although the lineaments are not isotropic, their perpendicular orientations to the coast suggest potential intrusion of saline water into regional groundwater resources and farmlands. The paper presents a combined technique of geospatial and statistical analysis in the interpretation of lineament effects which have the potential to inform on salinity intrusion in coastlands. The electrical conductivity of 50 groundwater samples collected in the study area are used to validate the impact of lineaments on seawater intrusion. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing the origin of a massive cyanobacterial bloom in the Rio de la Plata (2019): Towards an early warning system
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rio de la Plata estuary drains the second largest river basin of South America. The occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms of the Microcystis and Dolichospermum complex in the Uruguayan coast are associated with high flows of Uruguay River due to rainy years. In summer 2019, a massive cyanobacterial bloom reached up to the Uruguayan Atlantic coast. This study seeks to unveil the origin and the environmental conditions that favored the occurrence of the last cyanobacterial bloom in the Rio de la Plata, and to contribute with the development of an early warning system of cyanobacterial scum on Montevideo beaches. A complementary approach was applied with Sentinel-2 imagery, environmental data of monitoring programs of Salto Grande Reservoir and Montevideo beaches, hydro-meteorological information, and hydroelectric dam operation. Images were analyzed with the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), which allowed evaluating several water bodies within the same ranges. Positive anomalous rainfall increased river flows, particularly that of Uruguay and Negro rivers, which caused the opening of the dam spillways. NDCI maps showed that areas with high values (NDCI>0.06) in Salto Grande reservoir kept a similar surface area before and after the prolonged overflow period (8.7-7.8 km(2), before and after). In the Rio Negro reservoirs, however, NDCI>0.06 coverage remarkably changed (62.5 km(2), Palmar reservoir), with a subsequent 56-fold reduction in the post-discharge of surface water. Twenty days after opening the spillways, Montevideo beaches were closed to swimming and the NDCI>0.06 surface reached 51.7 km(2) in the Rio de la Plata coast. The dynamics of NDCI areas, the downstream bloom discharge, and the predicted Rio de la Plata residual currents, suggest that the cyanobacterial bloom originated in the Negro River (Palmar reservoir). This bloom event was one of the worst that occurred in the Rio de la Plata in last 20 years, circulated along the Uruguayan sub-corridor to the Atlantic coast along 690 km from its origin, and lasted three months on Montevideo coast. This is the first study that addresses the impact of cyanobacterial blooms from the Negro River reservoirs on the Rio de la Plata estuary. Therefore, the Negro River basin is where the main efforts should be directed to mitigate massive cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Insights into the Microwave Instruments Onboard the Feng-Yun 3D Satellite: Data Quality and Assimilation in the Met Office NWP System
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the microwave instruments onboard the latest Chinese polar-orbiting satellite, Feng-Yun 3D (FY-3D). Comparing three months of observations from the Microwave Temperature Sounder 2 (MWTS-2), the Microwave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) to Met Office short-range forecasts, we characterize the instrumental biases, show how those biases have changed with respect to their predecessors onboard FY-3C, and how they compare to the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) onboard NOAA-20 and the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI). The MWTS-2 global bias is much reduced with respect to its predecessor and compares well to ATMS at equivalent channel frequencies, differing only by 0.36 +/- 0.28 K (1 sigma) on average. A suboptimal averaging of raw digital counts is found to cause an increase in striping noise and an ascending-descending bias. MWHS-2 benefits from a new calibration method improving the 183-GHz humidity channels with respect to its predecessor and biases for these channels are within +/- 1.9 K to ATMS. MWRI presents the largest improvements, with reduced global bias and standard deviation with respect to FY-3C; although, spurious, seemingly transient, brightness temperatures have been detected in the observations at 36.5 GHz (vertical polarization). The strong solar-dependent bias that affects the instrument on FY-3C has been reduced to less than 0.2 K on average for FY-3D MWRI. Experiments where radiances from these instruments were assimilated on top of a full global system demonstrated a neutral to positive impact on the forecasts, as well as on the fit to the background of independent instruments.

TI  - Late Quaternary fluvial landform evolution and controlling factors along the Yulin River on the Northern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yulin River in the northern Tibetan Plateau, consists of multiple geomorphological features, including alluvial fans, fluvial terraces, and river profile knickpoints. Collectively, these provide a natural laboratory for exploring the late Quaternary fluvial landform evolution in response to both climatic change and tectonic activities in the region of the Altyn Tagh Fault. In this study, we investigated the distribution, sequences and sediment characteristics of the fluvial landforms along the Yulin River based on high-precision (0.5 m-resolution) Worldview satellite images and field observations. Mid-Pleistocene alluvial fans formed the highest fluvial landform surface into which ten major inset fluvial terraces were developed, distributed along three stream segments. Real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) measurement of terrace surfaces and the modern river longitudinal profiles was conducted across the Dongbatu Shan to show fluvial landform geometry and tectonic deformation. Fluvial terrace surfaces were deformed due to fault uplift as illustrated by spatially variable surface geometries. The chronological sequences of terraces along the Yulin River since 160 ka were reconstructed based on Be-10 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCNs) dating. Results indicated that river incision occurred mainly during periods of climate transition, suggesting that terrace evolution was partly controlled by climate changes. Moreover, terrace exposure ages showed an upstream younging trend along the river, demonstrating a probable response to knickpoint retreat. Combined with terrace deformation and ages, fault uplift rates were constrained, which were lower than the river incision rates during the Late Quaternary, indicating that crustal shortening was mainly absorbed by the growth of the regional anticline. Collectively, our results suggest that the evolution of fluvial landforms along the Yulin River is a function of interplay between regional tectonic activities and climatic changes, which is significant to understand the NW-outward splay of the Altyn Tagh Fault.

TI  - Uruguayan native grasslands net aerial primary production model and its application on safe stocking rate concept
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Native pastures in Uruguay grasslands are the main resource for livestock extensive farming. Remote sensing data of Net Aerial Primary Production is a useful tool to enhance knowledge about grasslands dynamics and behaviour. The pasture productivity on grasslands is highly affected by climate and droughts episodes impacts directly on secondary productivity of livestock systems. Using remote sensing data, a harmonic sinusoidal model affected by a "climate coefficient" is proposed to generate prospective scenarios and to study an implementation of the Safe stocking rate concept. This information can be use in extension activity to help farmers to adapt their systems to native grass dynamics on the adaptive management paradigm.

TI  - A nomogram for predicting axillary pathologic complete response in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer with cytologically proven axillary lymph node metastases
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objective of this study was to determine an axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) and its influencing factors in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer and cytologically proven axillary lymph node metastases. A prediction nomogram was established to provide information for the de-escalation of axillary management in these patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods The authors retrospectively enrolled all patients with HR-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy data set of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. All data were prospectively collected. From 2007 to 2016, 533 consecutive patients were included. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, after which a nomogram was constructed and validated. Results An axillary pCR was achieved in 168 patients (31.5%), the which was much higher than the proportion of those who achieved a breast pCR (103 patients; 19.3%). Patients who had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease (P = .004), a better primary tumor response (P = .001), earlier clinical stage (P = .045), and lower estrogen receptor expression (P < .001) were more likely to achieve a lymph node pCR. The nomogram indicated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78-0.89) in the training set. The validation set showed good discrimination with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.69-0.81). The C-index was 0.834 and 0.756 in the training and validation cohort, respectively. The nomogram was well calibrated. Conclusions The authors developed and validated a nomogram for predicting axillary pCR in patients with HR-positive disease accurately by using clinicopathologic factors available before surgery. The model will facilitate logical clinical decision making and clinical trial design.

TI  - Using Landsat satellites to assess the impact of check dams built across erosive gullies on vegetation rehabilitation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion, a process of soil removal due to water accumulation and runoff, is a worldwide problem affecting agricultural lands. Building check dams perpendicular to the flow direction is one of the suggested control practices to stabilize this process. Though there are many studies on the effect of erosive controls on land stabilization, few examine its effect on the rehabilitation of vegetation. Here we use information from the satellites Landsat-7 (1999-2018) and Landsat-8 (2013-2018) to assess the effect of soil check dams built during 2012 across three gullies with distinct structures in a dryland area on vegetative cover andwater status. We use a time series analysis technique to decompose Landsat-derived soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) intowoody (SAVIW) and herbaceous (iSAVIH) contributions. The integral over the seasonal signal of the normalized difference water index (iNDWI) was used to assess changes in water status in the gully. We used herbaceous biomass collected in the field in 2014-2017 to validate iSAVIH as a proxy of herbaceous biomass. Our results show that following the construction of the check dams, the change inwoody vegetation cover is best described by a sigmoid model with an increase of similar to 57% (95% CI: 39%-76%; p < 0.0001), while the herbaceous vegetation increases linearly at a rate of similar to 71% per year (95% CI: 48%-93% y(-1); p < 0.0001). The correlation between iSAVIH and herbaceous biomass (R-2= 0.56; n= 16; p < 0.001) corroborates this increase. We found higher herbaceous productivity in the deeper gully compared to the shallower gullies but not statistically different increase rates. An increase in iNDWI of similar to 68% (95% CI: 43%-95%; p < 0.0001) likely implies an improved water infiltration rate that favored the vegetation expansion. Our satellite-based approach can be used to assess the impact of erosive control practices on vegetation rehabilitation in heterogeneous gullies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel joint scoring in rheumatoid arthritis: an individualized power Doppler assessment strategy
T2  - CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Musculoskeletal ultrasound quantifies the total synovial inflammatory burden in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is time consuming when scanning numerous joints. This study evaluated a novel patient-centered method for constructing a longitudinal ultrasound score in RA patients.Methods Fifty-four RA patients starting intravenous tocilizumab were evaluated with power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) of 34 joints and DAS28-ESR was assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 16, and 24. The sentinel joint score (SJS) was derived from the reduced subset of joints with PDUS >= 1 at baseline. Total PDUS (tPDUS) score and US7 were also calculated. Changes in tPDUS and SJS were correlated. Effect sizes were calculated for tPDUS, SJS, and US7. The proportion of "flipped" joints without baseline PDUS signal that later developed PDUS signal was estimated.Results At baseline, 1236/1829 joints scanned (67.5%) did not have PDUS signal. The proportion of "flipped" joints at 24 weeks was 5.6% for >= 1, 2.9% for >= 2, and 1.0% for = 3 PD. tPDUS and SJS scores were highly correlated (r= 0.91 to 0.97). Overall the effect sizes for tPDUS, SJS, and US7 increased over 24 weeks, where SJS was the highest (SJS 1.00 4-week, 1.07 12-week, 1.26 24-week) and tPDUS and US7 were comparable (tPDUS 0.32 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.84 24-week; US7 0.23 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.74 24-week).Conclusion In RA patients starting a biologic, scanning only joints with baseline PDUS signal can substantially reduce the number of joints requiring follow-up scanning by 67.5% and improves feasibility. "Flipped" joints are infrequently seen after starting therapy.

TI  - Continental weathering intensity during the termination of the Marinoan Snowball Earth: Mg isotope evidence from the basal Doushantuo cap carbonate in South China
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Neoproterozoic global glaciations (720-635 Ma) represent the most severe icehouse climatic conditions in Earth's history, collectively known as the 'Snowball Earth events'. The 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis (Hoffman et al. 1998) proposed that the termination of the global glaciation was driven by the extremely high atmospheric pCO(2) level (300 times of present atmospheric level, PAL) that was accumulated during the global glaciation by volcanic degassing for tens of million years. Because of extremely high temperature, the deglaciation might associate with intense continental weathering that brought abundant bicarbonate and alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca) to the ocean, resulting in the rapid precipitation of cap carbonate all over the world. Thus, cap carbonate precipitation marks the termination of global glaciation. The deglacial intense continental weathering has been recently supported by Mg isotopes. However, the Mg isotope data also indicate that the deglaciation might have significantly predated the cap carbonate precipitation, and limited data suggest that the weathering intensity was already low during the cap carbonate precipitation. In order to further test whether the cap carbonate precipitation was associated with low weathering intensity, here we analyzed Mg isotopic composition of siliciclastic component (delta Mg-26(sil)) of the Doushantuo cap carbonate in the Yangtze Block, South China. Four cap carbonate sections (the Tongle (TL) drill core, the Fanyang (FY) section, the Wuluo (WL) drill core, and the Jiulongwan (JLW) section), spanning from shelf to basin environments, were analyzed. delta Mg-26(sil) ranges from -0.43 parts per thousand to +0.39 parts per thousand (n = 10), from -0.31 parts per thousand to +0.48 parts per thousand (n = 9), from -0.06 parts per thousand to +0.10 parts per thousand (n = 7), and from -1.42 parts per thousand to -0.03 parts per thousand (n = 8) for the JLW, FY, WL, and TL samples, respectively. There are negative correlations between Mg/Al and delta Mg-26(sil) in JLW, WL, and TL. The geochemical data indicate that the variation of delta(26)Mg(sil )might be attributed to authigenic clay formation during the cap carbonate precipitation. The binary mixing model indicates that the isotopic compositions of terrestrial clays range from 0 parts per thousand to +0.3 parts per thousand, comparable to the values of modern soil clays but significantly lower than the values of the upper Nantuo Formation (up to similar to + 0.90 parts per thousand), suggesting the moderate to low weathering intensity during the cap carbonate deposition. Our study suggests low atmospheric pCO(2) level during cap carbonate precipitation probably due to the consumption by intense continental weathering

TI  - Structures and Northward Propagation of the Quasi-Biweekly Oscillation in the Western North Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the northward-propagating quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) in the western North Pacific by examining the composite meridional structures. Using newly released reanalysis and remote sensing data, the northward propagation is understood in terms of the meridional contrasts in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) moisture and the column-integrated moist static energy (MSE). The meridional contrast in the PBL moisture, with larger values north of the convection center, is predominantly attributed to the moisture convergence associated with barotropic vorticity anomalies. A secondary contribution comes from the meridional moisture advection, for which advections by mean and perturbation winds are almost equally important. The meridional contrast in the MSE tendency, due to the recharge in the front of convection and discharge in the rear of convection, is jointly contributed by the meridional and vertical MSE advections. The meridional MSE advection mainly depends on the moisture processes particularly in the PBL, and the vertical MSE advection largely results from the advection of the mean MSE by vertical velocity anomalies, wherein the upper-troposphere ascending motion related to the stratiform heating in the rear of the convection plays the major role. In addition, partial feedback from sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is evaluated on the basis of MSE budget analysis. SST anomalies tend to enhance the surface turbulent heat fluxes ahead of the convention center and suppress them behind the convention center, thus positively contributing approximately 20% of the meridional contrast in the MSE tendency.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The long-term clinical course of patients with an enterovirus central nervous system infection (ECI) is poorly understood.Methods. We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study of all Danish patients with ECI diagnosed 1997-2016 (n = 1745) and a comparison cohort from the general population individually matched on date of birth and sex (n=17450). Outcomes were categorized into mortality and risk of cancer and likely measures of neurological sequelae: neuropsychiatric morbidities, educational landmarks, use of hospital services, employment, receipt of disability pension, income, number of sick leave days, and nursing home residency.Results. Mortality in the first year was higher among patients with ECI (mortality rate ratio[MRR] = 10.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.17-24.1), but thereafter mortality was not higher (MMR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47-1.86). Long-term outcomes for patients with ECI were not inferior to those of the comparison cohort for risk of cancer, epilepsy, mental and behavioral disorders, dementia, depression, school start, school marks, high school education, use of hospital services, employment, receipt of disability pension, income, days of sick leave, or nursing home residency.Conclusions. Diagnosis of an ECI had no substantial impact on long-term survival, health, or social/educational functioning.

T2  - Ocean & Coastal Management
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective management tool for the spatial prioritization of the Cozumel Reefs National Park (CRNP), using a systematic approach, is an urgent need for the conservation of one of the most important Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Mexico. In this study, we integrated a model using seascape metrics, the spatio-temporal variation of substrate coverage, and frequency of reef use for SCUBA diving, to systematically identify priority areas for conservation within the CRNP. We identified seven habitat types: sand beds, reef, two habitats of macroalgae beds (high and low cover), and seagrass beds with three different densities, using a supervised classification on a SPOT 7 (2017) satellite image (overall accuracy of 84%, Kappa of 0.79). Matlab and Fragstats were used to calculate seascape metrics (habitat [beta]-diversity, shape complexity and connectivity). A change detection analysis, comparing the SPOT 7 with an Ikonos image, was utilized to estimate seascape change between 2004 and 2017. Interviews with diving operators were also obtained, to calculate the frequency of visits to different reefs within the CRNP. A weighted overlay analysis, integrating the metrics mentioned above, was used to identify priority areas for conservation. We identified five areas, where management strategies need to be strengthened (e.g. limiting the number of visitors). The current subzonation of the protected area does not reflect the conservation priorities identified by our analysis. However, given that the CRNP management plan is in the process of being updated, the obtained results can help the CRNP managers improve the conservation efforts based on a systematic and robust approach, ensuring the design and implementation of cost-effective strategies for the conservation of the MPA.

TI  - Predicting the deforestation probability using the binary logistic regression, random forest, ensemble rotational forest, REPTree: A case study at the Gumani River Basin, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth and its corresponding effects like the expansion of human settlement, increasing agricultural land, and industry lead to the loss of forest area in most parts of the world especially in such highly populated nations like India. Forest canopy density (FCD) is a useful measure to assess the forest cover change in its own as numerous works of forest change have been done using only FCD with the help of remote sensing and GIS. The coupling of binary logistic regression (BLR), random forest (RF), ensemble of rotational forest and reduced error pruning trees (RTF-REPTree) with FCD makes it more convenient to find out the deforestation probability. Advanced vegetation index (AVI), bare soil index (BSI), shadow index (SI), and scaled vegetation density (VD) derived from Landsat imageries are the main input parameters to identify the FCD. After preparing the FCDs of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 the deforestation map of the study area was prepared and considered as dependent parameter for deforestation probability modelling. On the other hand, twelve deforestation determining factors were used to delineate the deforestation probability with the help of BLR, RF and RTF-REPTree models. These deforestation probability models were validated through area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), efficiency, true skill statistics (TSS) and Kappa co-efficient. The validation result shows that all the models like BLR (AUC = 0.874), RF (AUC = 0.886) and RTF-REPTree (AUC = 0.919) have good capability of assessing the deforestation probability but among them, RTF-REPTree has the highest accuracy level. The result also shows that low canopy density area i.e. not under the dense forest cover has increased by 9.26% from 1990 to 2017. Besides, nearly 30% of the forested land is under high to very high deforestation probable zone, which needs to be protected with immediate measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling large-scale biometeorological indices to monitor agricultural-growing areas: applications in the fruit circuit region, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aimed to support the rational crop expansion in agricultural-growing regions. MODIS satellite images are used together with gridded weather data to model biometeorological parameters at the Fruit Circuit region, state of Sao Paulo, Southeast Brazil. This region has experienced some cases of drought, while arising rainfall water excess in some periods, demanding large-scale water and energy balance studies to subsidize water resource policies. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was applied together with the radiation-use efficiency (RUE) model for biometeorological index assessments. The highest latent heat fluxes (lambda E), above 8.0 MJ m(-2) d(-1), at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (R-G) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m(-2) d(-1)in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m(-2) d(-1)at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m(-3), are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m(-3)) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year. The results of the large-scale modeling showed applicability of the models for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics over 16-day timescale and at a 250-m spatial resolution in areas experiencing climate and land-use changes by combining climate data and MODIS images. Application of these tools enables to indicate the best options for expanding the agriculture activities, being of great potential for rational natural resources management, in regions under environmental vulnerability conditions.

TI  - Interventions have limited effects on the population dynamics of <i>Ips</i> <i>typographus</i> and its natural enemies in the Western Carpathians (Central Europe)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus kill extensive areas of Norway spruce forests in Central Europe, affecting both protected areas and neighboring commercial forests. In protected areas, uncontrolled (non-intervention) management allows natural beetle-induced tree mortality, while in commercial forests infested trees are salvage-logged in order to lower I. typographus numbers and stabilize wood production. However, the effects of active pest controls on I. typographus population are often ambiguous, and little is known about how antagonists, beetle density, or intraspecific competition help terminate I. typographus outbreaks. To answer this question, we studied I. typographus population development, breeding performance, and natural antagonists under intervention and non-intervention management in the High Tatra Mts. from 2014 to 2017. We used sentinel logs and windthrown trees, following the current legislation in Tatransky narodny park (TANAP, Slovakia) and Tatrzanski Park Narodowy (TPN, Poland). Both parks are mountainous, are covered by Norway spruce forests that have been extensively affected by windthrows and extensive I. typographus outbreaks over the last 20 years, and are zoned under intervention and non-intervention types of management. We found that I. typographus was a dominant species and that its numbers gradually increased during the study, but that the numbers of maternal galleries in sentinel logs (from 50 to 300 per m(2)) and sex ratio (1 male:2.5 females) remained the same among years. The length of maternal galleries and egg production (per m(2) of bark), however, gradually declined, and breeding performance decreased from 10 daughter beetles per female in 2014 to almost zero in 2017. These parameters did not significantly differ between intervention and non-intervention sites. Antagonists were not abundant and had limited effects on I. typographus numbers.Active intervention did not affect I. typographus population dynamics or rates of parasitism but increased numbers of Thanasimus beetles, which are predators of bark beetles. In other words, intervention increased the numbers of some natural enemies of I. typographus but did not affect I. typographus population dynamics. Because control measures did not reduce I. typographus numbers in the intervention zone, the natural ecological processes crucial for maintaining ecosystem functioning and biodiversity were evidently preserved.

TI  - IMU Sensors Beneath Walking Surface for Ground Reaction Force Prediction in Gait
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Utilization of inertial measurement units (IMU) data for ground reaction force (GRF) prediction has been widely studied and documented when these sensors attach to the body segments. However, it was inconvenient and required people's cooperation. A novel approach of the current study was setting IMU sensors mounted underneath the walking surface to measure footstep induced structural vibration. We aimed to conduct the force plate to validate the prediction accuracy of this approach. Methods: Fifteen hundred steps were recorded from five individuals. Twenty-four measured features from four IMU sensors were treated as inputs to the long short-term memory model for multidimensional GRF predictions. The GRF data from the force plate were considered as the ground truth for comparisons. The accuracy performance was determined by the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) method. Results: The averaged NRMSE was 6.05%, 3.93%, and 4.37% for Fx, Fy, and Fz, respectively. Conclusion: The accuracy was comparable with IMU sensors attached to the body, particularly in the vertical direction. The current study demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and successfully predicted ground reaction force with high accuracy. Significance: The validation of IMU sensors mounted underneath the walking surface for GRF prediction provides an alternative method for biometrics in gait.

TI  - Deforestation dynamics in Brazil's Amazonian settlements: Effects of land-tenure concentration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Amazon deforestation is a major global and national environmental concern, and the ability to model and project both its course and the effect of different policy options depends on understanding how this process occurs at present and how it might change in the future. The present paper addresses one key factor in Amazon deforestation: land-tenure concentration in settlements. Brazil's policies for establishing and regulating settlement projects represent critical government decisions shaping the landscape in the 5 x 10(6) km(2) Legal Amazonia region. We used remote-sensing data and information provided by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) to evaluate the effect of land-tenure concentration in a settlement project (Projeto de Assentamento) located in a frontier area where cattle-ranching is expanding. We identified the actors and their deforestation patterns in the Matupi settlement in the southern part of Brazil's state of Amazonas. We spatially identified actors who concentrated "lots" (the parcels of land distributed to individual settlers) in 2011 and assessed whether the concentration was done by individual landholders or by "families" (where members merged their lots and the clearing was done together). Deforestation rates (1995-2011) were estimated for each type of actor and the trajectory of deforestation in the settlement (cumulative deforestation to 1994 and annual deforestation 1995-2016) was also analyzed. Concentrators occupied 28% (9653 ha) of the settlement and 29% of the lots (152 lots) analyzed; the numbers of lots concentrated ranged from two to ten. Concentrators of two lots and non-concentrators were the predominant actor types in the settlement. The mean annual clearing per landholding for concentrators of two lots (families: 4.1 +/- 2.8 ha (mean +/- SD); individuals: 5.1 +/- 4.6 ha) was greater than for non-concentrators (1.7 +/- 1.2 ha), despite their having similar patterns of small clearings. Concentrators of three or more lots had mean annual clearing per landholding between 6.2 +/- 12.2 ha and 23.9 +/- 38.7 ha and, the pattern of patches cleared per year >34 ha in area was predominant. The deforestation rate per lot was higher among concentrators as compared to non-concentrators, showing that lot concentration speeds deforestation. Analysis of deforestation patterns helps to better understand the process of lot concentration by spatially identifying the predominant patterns of each type of actor. The approach used in our study could assist authorities in identifying and monitoring land-tenure concentration in settlements. Agrarian-reform policymakers need to monitor this process, since it speeds deforestation in Amazonian settlement projects, as well as undermining the social objectives of the agrarian-reform program.

TI  - Use of high-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography and dynamic cell imaging for rapid intraoperative diagnosis during breast cancer surgery
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although traditional intraoperative assessments (ie, frozen sections) may lower reoperation rates in patients with breast cancer, time/tissue limitations and accuracy concerns have discouraged their routine clinical use. Full-field optical coherence tomography (FFOCT) and dynamic cell imaging (DCI) are novel optical imaging techniques offering rapid histologic approximations that are unfettered by requisite handling steps. This study was conducted to determine the feasibility and diagnostic utility of FFOCT and DCI in examining breast and lymph node specimens during breast cancer surgery. Methods FFOCT and DCI were applied to normal and cancerous breast tissue, benign breast lesions, and resected axillary lymph nodes. The tissues were then subjected to conventional processing and staining (hematoxylin-eosin) for purposes of comparison. Results A total of 314 specimens, including 173 breast biopsies (malignant, 132; benign/normal, 41) and 141 resected lymph nodes (tumor-positive, 48; tumor-negative, 93), were obtained from 158 patients during breast surgery for prospective imaging evaluations. In breast cancer diagnosis, the minimum sensitivities (FFOCT, 85.6%; DCI, 88.6%) and specificities of optical imaging (FFOCT, 85.4%; DCI, 95.1%) were high, although they diverged somewhat in nodal assessments (FFOCT sensitivity, 66.7%; FFOCT specificity, 79.6%; DCI sensitivity, 83.3%; DCI specificity, 98.9%). Conclusions These timely and tissue-sparing optical imaging techniques proved highly accurate in diagnosing breast cancer and nodal metastasis. They compare favorably with routine histologic sections and demonstrate their promise in this setting.

TI  - Large-scale afforestation significantly increases permanent surface water in China's vegetation restoration regions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - China is facing the challenge of the uncertain impacts of large-scale afforestation on regional water resources. However, the effects of vegetation cover changes on the variation in surface water at the regional scale are still controversial. Here, we focused on the 0.9 million km(2) vegetation restoration region in China, where the highest significant vegetation cover changes on the earth. Multi-source remote sensing data were used to describe the characteristics of seasonality and transition of surface water and to analyse the causes of surface water changes from climate, vegetation cover and other human factors. Our results show that the annual maximum NDVI of Northeast region (NE) and Loess Plateau region (LP) increased significantly from 0.74 to 0.85 and 0.49 to 0.62 from 2000 to 2015, respectively. Meanwhile, permanent water, as a vital component of surface water, exhibited net increases of 695.6 km(2) and 119.4 km(2) in NE and LP from 2000 to 2015, respectively. The extension in permanent water and the implementation of ecological projects exhibited highly consistent spatiotemporal patterns. Statistical analysis indicated that vegetation cover is an important factor in controlling permanent water changes. Human activities such as building dams and reservoirs are also an important explanatory variable for permanent water increases. The newly built dams contributed 43% in NE and 25% in LP to the increase in permanent water. In addition, although climatic factors were not the main factor influencing permanent water, precipitation significantly affected the total surface water in NE. These findings have potential implications for understanding surface water and forest dynamics and formulating regional development plans in the vegetation restoration region in China.

TI  - Improving regional wheat yields estimations by multi-step-assimilating of a crop model with multi-source data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating multi-source data into crop models is a promising way to improve crop growth simulations and yield estimations over a large area. Most of previous studies have mainly assimilated one of the observed/retrieved variables such as leaf area index (LAI) or soil moisture. However, assimilating multi-source data into a model and evaluating their respective contributions to improvements in model simulations have been rare. In this study, we proposed a novel Multi-Step-Assimilating of a crop model with Multi-source Data (MSAcmMD) and further demonstrated it with the MCWLA-Wheat model in improving the simulations of crop development, soil moisture dynamics, and grain yield for winter wheat in the North China Plain. The MSAcmMD, based on the calibrating assimilation strategy, followed the logical links among sub-modules of the crop model. It includes four assimilation steps: (i) calibrating crop model parameters; (ii) assimilating crop phenology; (iii) assimilating soil moisture; and (iv) assimilating crop LAI. The results showed that MSAcmMD can improve substantially the simulations of crop development, soil moisture dynamics, grain yields, and their spatiotemporal patterns over a large area and during a relative long-term period. During 2001-2008, across the study areas, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the simulated yields was increased from 0.39 to 0.75, and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) was reduced from 1096 to 467 kg/ha, relative to the initial model estimates. An additional validation for the year of 2009 further substantiated the robustness of MSAcmMD, with average R-2 of 0.65 and RMSE of 500 kg/ ha. Further analyses showed that assimilation of soil moisture contributed most to the improvement of yield estimations, with R-2 increasing by 43% and RMSE reducing by 47%. Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising assimilation system in improving crop growth simulations and yield predictions over a large area. MSAcmMD and the related methods provided a large potential in applying to other crops and regions.

TI  - Linking Vegetation-Climate-Fire Relationships in Sub-Saharan Africa to Key Ecological Processes in Two Dynamic Global Vegetation Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is largely influenced by fires, which play an important ecological role influencing the distribution and structure of grassland, savanna and forest biomes. Here vegetation strongly interacts with climate and other environmental factors, such as herbivory and humans. Fire-enabled Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) display high uncertainty in predicting the distribution of current tropical biomes and the associated transitions, mainly due to the way they represent the main ecological processes and feedbacks related to water and fire. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of two state-of-the-art DGVMs, LPJ-GUESS and JSBACH, also currently used in two Earth System Models (ESMs), in order to assess which key ecological processes need to be included or improved to represent realistic interactions between vegetation cover, precipitation and fires in sub-Saharan Africa. To this end, we compare models and remote-sensing data, analyzing the relationships between tree and grass cover, mean annual rainfall, average rainfall seasonality and average fire intervals, using generalized linear models, and we compare the patterns of grasslands, savannas, and forests in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis suggests that LPJ-GUESS (with a simple fire-model and complex vegetation description) performs well in regions of low precipitation, while in humid and mesic areas the representation of the fire process should probably be improved to obtain more open savannas. JSBACH (with a complex fire-model and a simple vegetation description) can simulate a vegetation-fire feedback that can maintain open savannas at intermediate and high precipitation, although this feedback seems to have stronger effects than observed, while at low precipitation JSBACH needs improvements in the representation of tree-grass competition and drought effects. This comparative process-based analysis permits to highlight the main factors that determine the tropical vegetation distribution in models and observations in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting possible improvements in DGVMs and, consequently, in ESM simulations for future projections. Given the need to use carbon storage in vegetation as a climate mitigation measure, these models represent a valuable tool to improve our understanding of the sustainability of vegetation carbon pools as a carbon sink and the vulnerability to disturbances such as fire.

TI  - How Does Straw Burning Affect Urban Air Quality in China?JEL codes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, straw burning has been debated as one of the causes of severe air pollution in developing countries. However, the magnitude and pattern of its impact on air quality have not been precisely estimated. This study employs remote sensing data on straw fires from different satellite sources and examines its overall impact on urban air quality in China. Exploiting daily variations in straw burning activities and air pollution with a difference-in-differences strategy across 290 cities and 620days, I find a clear temporal pattern for the straw burning effect. On the first day after burning, the index of air pollution increases by 6.5 in urban areas, equivalent to 9.4% of the mean. This impact decreases over time and remains significant for at least eight days. The effect is larger for fires located in the upwind direction relative to urban areas and is limited with lower wind speed. In terms of distance, pollution is mostly driven by straw fires within 100km from urban centers but could also be influenced by fires as far as 600km away. Among different pollutants, particulate matters are increased most by straw fires. The effect is largest and most persistent in October and November, when straw burning prevails in the north after harvest, but is also non-negligible in other seasons.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I address a specific methodological issue, namely the analysis of interaction that researchers undertaking design-based research (DBR) face when adopting a traditional approach to context. I first describe my methodological worldview in which the meaning of context is continuously negotiated by participants from sociocultural perspectives. I explain how pragmatic and dialectical stances strengthen the use of a mixed methods approach to capturelearning in context. I argue for the combination of link and trajectory analyses to analyze interactions from learners' perspectives. I illustrate how the combination of critical discourse analysis and social network analysis enables researchers to trace a trajectory of learning and discover what has changed over time. I discuss equity, reflexivity, and trustworthiness when conducting DBR. I conclude by presenting the limitations of this combined method while indicating future tasks and directions for using a mixed methods approach in DBR.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many methods and techniques utilize a combination of different bandwidths in the visible, NIR (Near Infrared), and SWIR (Shortwave Infrared) regions for glacier ice mapping. In this study, we investigated and compared various techniques to map the clean ice area of the glaciers using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. The effectiveness of different techniques and effects of different sensors on the mapping accuracy was also assessed in the Dhauliganga basin of Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand state of India. Also, the time series composite of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data was used as reference data for estimating the bare or clean glacier ice area. It was reported from the study that clean ice/snow areas mapped using band ratios Red/SWIR and NIR/SWIR from Landsat 8 were overestimated by 4.41% and 4.94% respectively which were larger as compared to Sentinel 2. The most rigorous and well-known technique for glacier mapping, NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) was also checked for both sensors. Clean ice/snow areas mapped from NDSI were found to be 1.35% less as compared to Red/SWIR and 2.62% greater as compared to NIR/SWIR bands of the Landsat 8. However using the same bands from the Sentinel 2, NDSI overestimated 0.67% and 5.27% respectively over both the ratios.

TI  - Molecular characteristics of the VP1 region of enterovirus 71 strains in China
T2  - GUT PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the most commonly implicated causative agent of severe outbreaks of paediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD).VP1 protein, a capsid protein of EV71, is responsible for the genotype of the virus and is essential for vaccine development and effectiveness. However, the genotypes of EV71 isolates in China are still not completely clear. Methods The VP1 gene sequences of 3712 EV71 virus strains from China, excluding repetitive sequences and 30 known EV71 genotypes as reference strains, between 1986 and 2019 were obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic tree, amino acid homology, genetic variation and genotype analyses of the EV71VP1 protein were performed with MEGA 6.0 software. Results The amino acid identity was found to be 88.33%-100% among the 3712 EV71 strains, 93.47%-100% compared with vaccine strain H07, and 93.04%-100% compared with vaccine strains FY7VP5 or FY-23 K-B. Since 2000, the prevalent strains of EV71 were mainly of the C4 genotype. Among these, the C4a subgenotype was predominant, followed by the C4b subgenotype; other subgenotypes appeared sporadically between 2005 and 2018 in mainland China. The B4 genotype was the main genotype in Taiwan, and the epidemic strains were constantly changing. Some amino acid variations in VP1 of EV71 occurred with high frequencies, including A289T (20.99%), H22Q (16.49%), A293S (15.95%), S283T (15.11%), V249I (7.76%), N31D (7.25%), and E98K (6.65%). Conclusion The C4 genotype of EV71 in China matches the vaccine and should effectively control EV71. However, the efficacy of the vaccine is partially affected by the continuous change in epidemic strains in Taiwan. These results suggest that the genetic characteristics of the EV71-VP1 region should be continuously monitored, which is critical for epidemic control and vaccine design to prevent EV71 infection in children.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Urban Expansion Using Remote Sensing Methods and Data: A Case Study of Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use in the Yangtze River Delta in 2000 and 2017 was classified by the visual interpretation of Landsat satellite images. Then, these images were overlain with economic and physical geographical data to analyze the urban spatial expansion pattern and its physical constraints and socioeconomic influence factors by employing a combination of transition matrix analysis, expansion intensity indices, and equal-fan analysis. The results showed that from 2000 to 2017, there was a significant increase in built-up areas in the region, with rapid expansion in the core area. The northern and southern parts of the Yangtze River Delta experienced different urban spatial expansions, with a higher scale and rate in the cities along the Yangtze River and the coast in Jiangsu Province in the north than in Zhejiang Province in the south. Cities expanded towards megacities or hubs along the Yangtze River or the coast, indicating that urban expansion is influenced by preferential policies and urban planning factors in addition to the spillover effects of neighboring cities and the adjacency to seas or large rivers. Finally, urban expansion is significantly constrained by elevation, with cities at lower elevations or in flat terrain undergoing more rapid urban expansion and development.

TI  - A Self-Adaptive Wildfire Detection Algorithm with Two-Dimensional Otsu Optimization
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gradual increase in wildfires has caused frequent trips and outages along electrical transmission lines, which is a serious threat to the operational stability of power grids. A self-adaptive wildfire detection algorithm has been developed and tested in this paper. Most of existing wildfire detection methods employed fixed thresholds to identify potential wildfire pixels while the background pixels were ignored. By calculating two-dimensional histogram of the brightness temperatures of mid-infrared channel, the threshold selection is self-adaptive and potential pixels containing scenes of fire can be distinguished automatically. Based on the two-dimensional Otsu method and contextual test algorithm, an improved wildfire detection algorithm that uses multitemporal Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) data is described. The wildfire detection results within three kilometers of electrical transmission lines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has accurate low-temperature wildfire detection ability.

TI  - Detection of triggered shallow slips caused by large earthquakes using L-band SAR interferometry
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferograms pertaining to large earthquakes typically reveal the occurrence of elastic deformations caused by the earthquake along with several complex surface displacements. In this study, we identified displacement lineaments from interferograms; some of which occur on the shallow section of seismogenic faults. However, such displacements are typically located away from the hypocenter, and they are considered as triggered shallow slips. We found that the triggered shallow slips had a varied nature, as follows. (1) No evidence has yet been obtained regarding the generation of large seismic motion via triggered shallow slips; thus, their occurrence is seldom considered a cause of major earthquakes. However, we found that a movement of triggered shallow slip associated with anM6-class earthquake occurred on an active fault that has previously caused anM7-class earthquake. (2) At certain locations, several parallel displacement lineaments have been discovered. During the Kumamoto earthquake sequence in 2016, the strain created by the main shock and the motion of triggered shallow slips coincided at a specific location, resulting in the creation of parallel triggered shallow slips by the main shock. Conversely, at another location, the movements of the main shock and triggered shallow slips did not match, since the main shock was simply a trigger, whereas the latter parallel triggered shallow slips are likely a means for releasing previously accumulated strain. (3) The fault scaling law-which states that the length and displacement of a fault are proportional-does not hold true for triggered shallow slips. However, the parallel triggered shallow slips show a relationship between horizontal spacing and its displacement. This may be attributed to immobility in deep locations. These results lead to the following conclusions. Large earthquakes tend to trigger shallow slips on the pre-existing faults. Subsequently, these triggered shallow slips release accumulated strain by causing fault motions, which in turn result in displacement lineaments. The occurrence of such passive faulting creates weak, mobile fault planes that repeatedly move at the same location. These triggered shallow slips cause the diversity among active faults as a result.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Modeling of Megech River Catchment, Lake Tana Basin, North Western Ethiopia, Using Morphometric Analysis
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study intended to flood susceptibility modeling by using drainage morphometric investigations of the Megech River catchment, Lake Tana Basin, North Western Ethiopia. Drainage morphometric criterion study performs a critical aspect in recognizing the factual aspects of river catchment with concern to floods. In the present study, we depicted the Megech River catchment into four sub-watersheds, followed by clipping off the drainage grid by using ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array-Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) digital elevation model, toposheets, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager coupled with the Geographic Information System (GIS) program. The drainage morphometric parameters, such as basic, linear, areal and relief, were calculated in the current research by using the standard formula. The morphometric parameters, such as bifurcation ratio, drainage density, length of overland flow and drainage frequency, have a direct connection with flood susceptibility. Hence, rank 1 assigned to the highest values of the above-mentioned parameters followed by second-rank to second-highest value and rank third given the lowest value of the above parameters. The morphometric parameters, such as circulatory ratio, form factor, elongation ratio, drainage texture and compactness coefficient, have a reverse relation with flood proneness. Hence, rank 1 assigned to the lowest values of those parameters, followed by rank two to the second-lowest value and rank three given to the highest value of the above parameters. The compound factor is computed by aggregating the assigned ranks of the morphometric drainage parameters mentioned above and then dividing by the number of morphometric criteria used for sub-watersheds prioritization. The results of the present study displayed sub-watershed 3 scored very high prioritization (Ist), including a compound factor value of 1.89, and sub-watershed 2 got the highest compound factor value of 3.11, and it scored the lowest rank (IVth). The found sub-watershed 3 in the current research area was acquired as a high-priority grade one, and it demands urgent flood regulation remedies for competent water budget devising and administration in the Megech catchment area. The current study demonstrates the capability of sub-watershedwise drainage morphometric investigations in the flood susceptibility analysis using toposheets, optical remote sensing data and digital elevation model associated with GIS tools.

T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary management after NET has not been well studied and the significance of residual axillary node disease after NET remains uncertain. We used the National Cancer Data Base to examine the prognostic significance of residual nodal disease after NET. From 2010-2016, 4,496 patients received NET for cT1-3N0-1M0 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Among cN0 patients treated with NET, final node status was ypN0 in 65%, isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in 3%, ypN1mi in 6%, and ypN1 in 26%. In cN1 patients, nodal pathologic complete response was uncommon (10%), and residual nodal disease included ITCs in 1%, ypN1mi in 3%, and ypN1 in 86%. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival (OS) between patients with pathologic node-negative disease, ITCs, or micrometastases after NET. When compared to a matched cohort of upfront surgery patients, there were also no differences in 5-year OS between NET and upfront surgery patients for any residual nodal disease category. These findings suggest NET patient outcomes mirror those of upfront surgery patients and present an opportunity to consider de-escalation of axillary management strategies in NET patients.

TI  - Remote monitoring of agricultural systems using NDVI time series and machine learning methods: a tool for an adaptive agricultural policy
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to provide accurate information about changes in agricultural systems (AS) using phenological metrics derived from the NDVI time series. Use of such information could help land managers optimize land use choices and monitor the status of agricultural lands, under a variety of environmental and socioeconomic conditions. For this purpose, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data were used to derive phenological metrics over the Oum Er-Rbia basin (central Morocco). Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers were explored and compared on their ability to classify AS classes over the study area. Four main AS classes have been considered: (1) irrigated annual crop (IAC), (2) irrigated perennial crop (IPC), (3) rainfed area (RA), and (4) fallow (FA). By comparing the accuracy of the three classifiers, the RF method showed the best performance with an overall accuracy of 0.97 and kappa coefficient of 0.96. The RF method was then chosen to examine time variations in AS over a 16-year period (2000-2016). The AS main variations were detected and evaluated for the four AS classes. These variations have been found to be linked well with other indicators of local agricultural land management, as well as the historical agricultural drought changes over the study area. Overall, the results present a tool for decision makers to improve agricultural management and provide a different perspective in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of agricultural systems.

TI  - Targeted Axillary Dissection for Patients Who Convert to Clinically Node Negative After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer (BC) can eradicate axillary disease in > 40% of patients. The standard of care for node-positive BC has been axillary lymph node dissection. In this review, we examine the data for de-escalating axillary surgery after NAC. Recent Findings Studies have shown that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is accurate after NAC. False negative rates (FNR) of SLNB after NAC in node-positive patients have been reduced with a combination of dual tracers and localization of the clipped positive node. Clipped nodes may be localized with a variety of methods. Targeted axillary dissection (removal of clipped node in conjunction with SLNB) results in an acceptable FNR and can be considered in certain patients with axillary clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patient selection is important, as those with persistently positive nodes on clinical exam should proceed directly to axillary dissection.

TI  - New spectral indices for detection of urban built-up surfaces and its sub-classes in AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of urban built-up surfaces is a key indicator of the level of urbanization, which originates from several ecological effects. In this study, three new spectral indices i.e. New Impervious Index (NII), Road Detection Index (RDI) and New Roof Extraction Index (NREI) have been developed for detection of built-up (Level-1), road and roof surfaces (Level-2), respectively, followed by a separability analysis between spectrally confused urban land cover classes. The entire analysis is carried out using AVIRIS-NG and ground hyperspectral data of the Udaipur, Rajasthan region of India. The results of the analysis depict that the proposed indices show an overall average accuracy of 96.12%, 92.24%, and 94.77%, respectively, which are higher than the outcomes of different existing built-up indices. Further, the separability analysis also confirms that the proposed indices can prove to be effective for separating built-up surfaces (Level-1 and 2) from the spectrally similar background.

TI  - Romantic intimacy and terror management: Examining the mediating roles of felt security, relational self-esteem, and relational worldview defense
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory posits that close relationships assuage existential mortality concerns because they foster attachment-based felt security, enhance self-esteem, and validate shared cultural worldviews. However, the relative buffering influence of these mechanisms remains relatively unknown and has sparked theoretical debate. Some theorists argue that felt security is central, whereas others suggest it does not offer unique protection from death awareness, independent of self-esteem and worldview validation. We conducted two experiments to clarify felt security's role. Testing felt security on its own, it significantly mediated the association between death awareness and increased intimacy striving (Study 1). However, when tested alongside relational self-esteem and worldview validation, felt security again exerted a significant mediating effect in parallel with relational self-esteem, although only among female participants (Study 2). These results provide initial support for the subordinate tripartite model and functional independence claim put forth in recent years. We discuss the implications of these findings.

T2  - BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To analyze the effect of different types of bone cement distribution after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). Methods One hundred thirty seven patients with single level OVCF who underwent PVP were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups according to bone cement distribution. Group A: bone cement contacted both upper and lower endplates; Group B: bone cement missed at least one endplate. Group B was divided into 3 subgroups. Group B1: bone cement only contacted the upper endplates; Group B2: bone cement only contacted the lower endplates; Group B3: bone cement only located in the middle of vertebral body. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 24 h post operation and last follow-up, anterior vertebral height restoration ratio (AVHRR), anterior vertebral height loss ratio (AVHLR), local kyphotic angle change and vertebral body recompression rate were compared. Results 24 h post operation, the pain of all groups were significantly improved. The average follow-up time was 15.3 +/- 6.3 (6-24) months. At last follow-up, the VAS score of group A was lower than that of group B. There were 14 cases (10.2%) of adjacent vertebral fracture, 5 cases (8.6%) in group A and 9 cases (11.4%) in group B. There were 9 cases (6.6%) of cement leakage, 4 cases (6.9%) in group A and 5 cases (6.3%) in group B. At last follow-up, there were 16 cases (11.7%) of vertebral body recompression, including 3 cases (5.2%) in group A and 13 cases (16.5%) in group B. There was no significant difference in AVHRR between two groups. Local kyphotic angle change was significant larger in group B. At last follow-up, AVHLR in group B was higher than that in group A. Analysis in subgroup B revealed no significant difference in VAS score, local kyphotic angle change, vertebral recompression rate, AVHRR or AVHLR. Conclusions If the bone cement fully contacted both the upper and lower endplates, it can better restore the strength of the vertebral body and maintain the height of the vertebral body, reduce the risk of the vertebral body recompression and long-term pain.

TI  - Topographically and hydrologically signatures express subsurface geological structures in an arid region: a modified integrated approach using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the ability of remote sensing sensors to map subsurface fault zones with the support of hydrological information collected from boreholes. We first extract linear features crosscut and drain the study area and its adjoining mountainous areas from the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), the Landsat 8 images and a set of slope and shaded relief maps derived from the PALSAR DEM using visual interpretation and D8 algorithm. To delineate displacements of subsurface faults were then, interpreted from interpolated maps of groundwater level and aquifer thickness. The subsurface faults are well evident in the form palaeochannels, abruption change in flow direction and the change in the groundwater table and aquifer thickness. The extracted surface linear features were compared against those that exist in the geological map. The result showed that the subsurface geological structures can be indicated from remote sensing and hydrological data.

TI  - Assessing the potential for spectrally based remote sensing of salmon spawning locations
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing tools are increasingly used for quantitative mapping of fluvial habitats, yet few techniques exist for continuous sampling of aquatic organisms, such as spawning salmonids. This study assessed the potential for spectrally based remote sensing of salmon spawning locations (i.e., redds) using data acquired from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) along a large, gravel-bed river. We developed a novel, semi-automated approach for detecting salmon redds by applying machine learning classification and object detection techniques to UAS-based imagery. We found that both true colour (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery could be used to identify salmon redds, though with varying degrees of accuracy. Redds were mapped with accuracies of similar to 0.75 from RGB imagery using logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) classification algorithms, but this type of data could not be used to identify redds using Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA). The hyperspectral imagery was more useful for mapping salmon redds, with accuracies greater than 0.9 for both logistic regression and SVM classifiers; OBIA of the hyperspectral data resulted in redd detection accuracies up to 0.86. The hyperspectral imagery also yielded complementary physical habitat information including water depth and substrate composition, which we quantified on the basis of a spectrally based chlorophyll absorption ratio. Overall, the hyperspectral imagery more effectively identified salmon spawning locations than RGB images and was more conducive to the classification approaches we evaluated. Each type of remotely sensed data had advantages and limitations, which are important for potential users to understand when incorporating UAS-based data collection into river ecosystem studies.

TI  - Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Evolution Based on Regional Road Scope
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To balance sustainable road construction and environmental impact, intrinsic relationships between regional road networks and land surface temperature (LST) along the roads must be examined. In this study, we hypothesize that expanding road networks can affect the LST within a given region. Thus, we determined the influence of varying road grades on the surrounding LST. Using an improved single-window algorithm with reasonably adjusted water vapor parameters, LST data for the relevant areas were extracted from Landsat 8 data. Analyzing these data revealed that, in the improved single-window algorithm, the MOD05 L2 water vapor parameter could obtain results, indicating that road grades are positively correlated with LST changes when road network mileage is increased. In addition, we found that LST was increased by highways and low-grade roads over distances of 180 m and 150 m compared with the surrounding area, respectively. Furthermore, LST was affected by road interchanges over a distance of 300 m and by intersections formed by low-grade roads over 150 m; both have a linear nonuniform influence on the propagation models. Finally, we determined that different highways in the LST radiation range can interact to form an LST concentration zone, resulting in further LST increases.

TI  - Multispectral and hyperspectral images based land use / land cover change prediction analysis: an extensive review
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Research in the field of remote sensing attracts attention among researchers all over the world. From different remote sensing applications, the problem on Land Use/ Land Cover change analysis has been considered as the critical research for more than four decades. The researchers had discovered the new innovative ways of finding the solution to analyze the Land Use/ Land Cover change over a particular region. The multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images play a considerable part in analyzing environmental changes. Many algorithms developed and used by researchers for analyzing the Land Use/ Land Cover change are discussed in this paper. This review article aims to provide detailed analyses of performing Land Use/ Land Cover changes in the field of remote sensing. The main motive is to make the future researchers know about the flow of the Land Use/ Land Cover change analysis process and provide a clear presentation about every method. The results of this Land Use/ Land Cover problem mainly assist the land resource management, urban planners, and other government officials across the world in protecting the land resource and its nature for future needs.

TI  - The economic benefits of trade facilitation: US Customs and Border Protection's Centers of Excellence and Expertise programme
T2  - WORLD ECONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the impacts of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Center of Excellence and Expertise (CEE) Program on the U.S. trade community. CBP established ten CEEs in order to facilitate trade by removing non-tariff barriers. CEEs process importers at "virtual" centres as opposed to individual ports of entry, and they are specialised according to particular sectors. CEEs were anticipated to use government resources more efficiently, reduce paperwork, improve information flows and contribute towards a single window for documenting trade. We use difference-in-difference (DID) analysis of CBP administrative data to identify the impacts of importer membership in a CEE on key outcomes, including import shipment examination rates and form filings. We also use survey-generated data on importer administrative and business costs in order to monetise the value of impacts. These data reveal that the cost to importers of having a shipment examined at a port is roughly ten to twenty times higher than the cost of importers having to file a form with a CEE. Estimated impact results suggest that two of the ten CEEs--Electronics and Automotive--had a statistically significant negative impact on examination rates. We review the reasons for these results, which underscore the need when doing an impact analysis for careful understanding of the underlying data and processes involved in order to develop and explain impact results. For the two CEEs that had significant impacts on import examinations, we quantify the monetary value of these impacts and estimate that they saved their members roughly $1 million in trade examination costs in FY 2014. We also estimate that expanding membership to cover more importers could yield savings of between $7 million and $18 million annually. Finally, we find that CBP could redirect approximately 9,000 import examinations and 7,000 form filings from lower-risk CEE importers to higher-risk importers, possibly increasing trade-enforcement effectiveness.

TI  - Using state space grids to analyze teacher-student interaction over time
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we explain how our inquiry worldview informs one methodological approach we have used to better understand classroom processes and change, State Space Grids (SSGs). We describe our approach to measuring a fundamental classroom process, that of teacher-student interaction, and its influence on a valued educational outcome, student engagement. Drawing from Complex Dynamic Systems theory, we illustrate the affordances of SSGs to study stability and change in teachers' observed instructional practices in relation to students' observed engagement. Examples from observed interaction over 3 years in two classrooms show that SSGs enabled us to analyze how and why particular teacher-student "systems" developed, producing optimal and non-optimal patterns for student engagement. Conclusions involve the benefits of SSGs for our research questions and research in educational psychology.

TI  - The pruning phenological phase-based method for extracting tea plantations by field hyperspectral data and Landsat time series imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea plantations expansion has occurred in the major tea planting area of Yunnan province, China, however, it is a big challenge to extract and map the distribution of tea plantations due to their non-obvious phenological characteristics in the tropical and subtropical regions. Firstly, we demonstrated the pruning phenological phase of tea plantations by using field hyperspectral data. Secondly, we analyzed the optical features of typical land cover types from the available time series Landsat imagery with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We proposed a pixel and phenology- based approach to extract and map tea plantations distribution at the 30-m resolution of the historical time period of 2015 to 2019. The resultant map had high user/producer accuracies of 91.07% and 86.90%, respectively. Our study provides a promising new approach to extract and map tea plantations in complex tropical landscapes at fine spatial resolution by using only free historical Landsat imagery.

TI  - Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration by M5 Model Tree Based on Hydrological and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Estimation of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is an important factor in river engineering, which is used as an indicator of land-use change, water quality studies, and all projects related to constructions in rivers. In this research, the M5 model tree and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were utilized to estimate the SSC at Ahvaz station on the Karun River. In this study, 135 cloud-free images of the MODIS sensor on the Terra satellite were taken for days corresponding to field SSC data, during the years 2000 to 2015. Input parameters of the model tree in this study were flow discharge, derived from hydrological data, and red (R), near-infrared (NIR) bands, and NIR/R ratio extracted from MODIS imagery. The results of statistical analysis illustrate that the M5 model outperforms the sediment rating curve (SRC) method, which is the most common method of estimating suspended sediment load. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index for the M5 model tree of 0.58 was achieved, which was much better than that of the SRC method (0.26). At high fluxes, the efficiency of the SRC method significantly reduced, while the model tree provides acceptable results. The global sensitivity analysis on the M5 model pointed out that 93% of output variance was established by the main effects of input parameters, and less than 7% belong to the interaction effects. 73% and 12% of output variance specified by the main effects of flow discharge and NIR/R ratio, respectively.

TI  - <i>Tectona grandis</i>canopy cover predicted by remote sensing
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The phytosanitary status ofTectona grandisplantations are monitored conventionally with periodic data collection in the field, which is often costly and has low efficiency. The objective of this research was to develop a methodology to predict the canopy cover ofT. grandisplantations using multispectral images of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite and photographic imagery. The study was carried out in aT. grandisplantation of seminal origin, in Caceres, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Hemispherical photographic (HP) images of the plant canopy were obtained with a digital camera coupled to a "fisheye" lens fixed at 1.3 m high at two dates in the rainy and the dry season. Cloudless and no shadow images of the S2 satellite bands were concurrently obtained with the field images. Multivariate permutative analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to predict canopy cover percentage. The accuracy of the predictedT. grandiscanopy cover (%) by the PLSR model approach was 77.8 +/- 0.09%. The results indicate that a PLS model calibrated with 28 HP sample images can accurately estimate the percentage canopy cover for a continuous area ofT. grandisplantations and facilitate mapping of canopy heterogeneity to monitor threats of diseases, mortality, fires, pests and other disturbances.

TI  - [Clinical study of exploring new axillary zone in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua yi xue za zhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the application of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and to collect and record patient's data during operation. Through the specific experimental data, the anatomical location and morphology of the intercostal brachial nerve (ICBN) and the anatomic relationship of the axillary lymph nodes were analyzed to accurately locate the anatomical division of the axillary fossa of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and ARM lymph nodes. Methods: The technique of methylene blue staining for SLN combined with indocyanine green fluorescent staining for axillary reverse mapping was used to analyze the patients of Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics from June 2017 to June 2018. The clinical data of 35 patients with T1-2N0M0 breast cancer were analyzed. Results: Of the 35 patients, two cases were excluded from metastatic carcinoma of the SLN. Thirty-three cases were included in the data analysis. Three cases of ICBN were located 0-2.0 cm (9.09%) from the lower edge of the iliac vein, 27 cases were located at 2.0-4.0 cm (81.82%), and 3 cases of ICBN were located greater than 4.0 cm (9.09%). In the region of 0-2.0 cm from the lower edge of the iliac vein, 1-2 ARM lymph nodes were found in 5 cases; in the 2.0-4.0 cm area, SLN was found in 33 cases, 4 of which found 1 coincident lymph node; at>4.0 cm ARM lymph nodes and overlapping lymph nodes were not found in the cm region, and 1-2 SLNs were found in 3 cases. Conclusions: Individual ICBNs vary greatly, with different shapes and distances from the lower edge of the axillary vein. The axillary region below the iliac vein can be divided into three regions: ARM region (0-2.0 cm); SLN region (2.0-4.0 cm); and sentinel gate region (>4.0 cm). The position 2.0 cm from the lower edge of the iliac vein can be used as the boundary between the ARM lymph node and the SLN. 4. There is a certain proportion of coincidence rate between SLN and ARM lymph nodes.
AB  - 目的： 探索腋窝逆行淋巴示踪技术（ARM）在乳腺癌前哨淋巴结活检术（SLNB）中的应用，精准定位前哨淋巴结（(SLN)和ARM淋巴结在腋窝的解剖分区。 方法： 将亚甲蓝染色法示踪SLN技术与吲哚菁绿荧光染色法ARM相结合，分析天津市中心妇产科医院乳腺外科2017年6月至2018年6月期间收治的35例术前临床分期为T(1-2)N(0)M(0)乳腺癌患者的临床资料，对术中收集并记录患者资料，并通过具体的试验数据，分析肋间臂神经（ICBN）的解剖学定位及学形态与腋窝淋巴结的解剖关系，精准定位SLN和ARM淋巴结在腋窝的解剖分区。 结果： 35例患者，2例因SLN有转移癌被排除。33例纳入数据分析。3例ICBN位于距腋静脉下缘0~2.0 cm（9.09%）（ARM区），27例位于2.0~4.0 cm（81.82%）（SLN区），3例ICBN位于>4.0 cm（9.09%）（前门哨区）。在距离腋静脉下缘0~2.0 cm区域内，5例找到1~2枚ARM淋巴结；在2.0~4.0 cm区域内，33例均找到SLN，其中4例各发现1枚重合淋巴结；在>4.0 cm区域内均未找到ARM淋巴结和重合淋巴结，3例找到1~2枚SLN。 结论： ICBN个体差异大，形体各异，距离腋静脉下缘的距离不等。腋静脉以下的腋窝区域可分成3个区域；距离腋静脉下缘2.0 cm的位置可作为ARM淋巴结和SLN的分界线，且SLN和ARM淋巴结存在一定比例的重合率。.

TI  - The hemispheric contrast in cloud microphysical properties constrains aerosol forcing
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in planetary albedo due to aerosol-cloud interactions during the industrial era is the leading source of uncertainty in inferring Earth's climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gases from the historical record. The variable that controls aerosol-cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm(-3) and 24 cm(-3). By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol-cloud interactions is constrained to be -1.2 W.m(-2) to -0.6 W.m(-2). The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol-cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.

TI  - Assessment of the Myitnge River flow responses in Myanmar under changes in land use and climate
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Watershed hydrology changes are mostly influenced by changes in climate and land use and understanding of the interaction between these changes is required for the sustainable water management of water resources. In this study, an integrated approach of land-use modelling, downscaling climate data, and river flow simulation is carried out to detect hydrologic responses of the Myitnge River basin in Myanmar under land use and climate changes. A set of Landsat satellite images (2010, 2011, and 2017) are classified, and Land Change Modeller (LCM) module in the TerrSet model is used to simulate land-use maps for 2030 and 2050. The CanESM2 large-scale general circulation model (GCM) is used to project the near future (2020-2059) climate data. Then, future river flow changes are simulated using the SWAT hydrologic model under changing future climate and land-use conditions. The results of the study show that the annual mean river flow will slightly increase under future climate change, and the changes will be exaggerated when the land-use change occurred simultaneously. This study offers a perspective on the possible hydrologic alteration in the Myitnge River basin under future land use and climate conditions, which can be beneficial for formulating adaption strategies.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdowns cause global air pollution declines
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The lockdown response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic and transport activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations, using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find declines in the population-weighted concentration of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 60% with 95% CI 48 to 72%), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: 31%; 95% CI: 17 to 45%), with marginal increases in ozone (O-3: 4%; 95% CI: -2 to 10%) in 34 countries during lockdown dates up until 15 May. Except for ozone, satellite measurements of the troposphere indicate much smaller reductions, highlighting the spatial variability of pollutant anomalies attributable to complex NOx chemistry and long-distance transport of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). By leveraging Google and Apple mobility data, we find empirical evidence for a link between global vehicle transportation declines and the reduction of ambient NO2 exposure. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings allude to the potential for mitigating public health risk by reducing "business as usual" air pollutant emissions from economic activities.

TI  - Factors that promote successful endoscopic management of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy leaks
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Staple line leaks following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Endoluminal techniques, including stent placement and endoluminal vacuum therapy (EVAC), have become viable options to treat these patients without the need for additional surgery. The purpose of this study was to define the conditions where certain endoscopic therapies are most likely to succeed compared to surgery. Methods An IRB approved prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed for all patients treated for gastrointestinal leaks from July 2013 to March 2019. All patients who were treated for gastrointestinal leaks following LSG were included. Endpoints include success of leak closure and hospital-related morbidity for the patients treated solely by endoscopic only methods (EP) compared to the additional surgery group (SP). Results There were 39 patients (33 females; 6 males) with a median age of 45.9 years. The EP group included 23 patients (59%), whereas SP included 16 patients (31%). On average, the SP had longer days from sentinel surgery to our hospital admission (70 vs 41), a higher percentage of previous bariatric surgery prior to sentinel LSG (50% vs 17%), and a higher readmission rates following discharge (50% vs 39%). Total length of stay was also higher in the SP compared to the EP (45.4 vs 11). Using this data, a treatment algorithm was developed to optimally treat future patients who suffer from gastrointestinal leaks following LSG. Conclusions Endoscopic therapies, such as EVAC, stent placement, internal drainage, and over-the-scope clips, have a higher chance of success if performed earlier to their sentinel surgery and if patients have had no prior bariatric surgeries. Patients who require additional surgery tend to have longer hospital stays and readmission rates. Using the treatment algorithm provided can help determine when endoscopic therapies are likely to succeed.

TI  - Comparison of identifying land cover tempo-spatial changes using GlobCover and MCD12Q1 global land cover products
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover (GLC) products have been widely used in land use and land cover change (LUCC). It is an urgent need to investigate the harmonization and comparative methods for different products derived from various satellite imagery and classification schemes. MCD12Q1 and GlobCover were comparatively used to identify the changes of land cover at a provincial scale in China. The European Space Agency (ESA) GlobCover and the Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) datasets of 2005 and 2009 were used and compared comprehensively. The two products were harmonized and reclassified into six types at 500-m resolution, namely, forestland, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial area, and others. Four aspects of land cover changing rate (K), land use integrated index (L-d), land use dynamic degree (LUDD), and transfer analysis were respectively identified and analyzed. The analysis results show that the two datasets have similar mapping capabilities in monitoring the LUCC, but there are also obvious differences due to the classification schemes, especially for the forestland and grassland. TheKof forestland and grassland for GlobCover is respectively - 4.94 and 2.90%, while they are 7.63 and - 47.73% for MCD12Q1. TheL(d)difference is, respectively, 10 and 1 for MCD12Q1 and GlobCover. TheLUDDin Anhui Province from 2005 to 2009 is 3.06% for MCD12Q1 and 0.90% for GlobCover. Additionally, the transfer matrix is also constructed to explore the land cover changes. The significant differences between the two datasets are attributed to forestland and grassland. We conclude that the differences are primarily ascribed to the classification systems. The study provides an important reference for identifying provincial LUCC by jointly using different GLC products.

TI  - Effects of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions on the estimation of wheat and barley leaf area index using multi- and hyper-spectral data (case study: Karaj, Iran)
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter for the calculation of crop biophysical and biochemical processes. Therefore, the accurate estimates of LAI has been always of great importance for agricultural researchers. Remote sensing has shown enormous potential in LAI estimation, however, more evaluations are necessary on choosing the best type of data. In this study, the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions of different remotely sensed data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, MODIS, and also field hyperspectral data) were evaluated for LAI estimation of wheat and barley. First, the 30-m Landsat 8, 10-m Sentinel-2, 250-m MODIS, and field-based point data were taken into account for assessing the goodness of the relationship between field LAI (collected using LAI-2200c) and Vegetation Indices (VIs) to investigate the effect of a difference in spatial resolution. Afterward, to assess the temporal resolution effects, the Sentinel-2 images were resampled to 30 m and were combined with Landsat 8 data. Also, hyperspectral VIs (HNDVI, HDVI, and HSR) were calculated using field data to evaluate the effects of spectral resolution. Results showed that the difference in spatial and temporal resolutions of the data did not have any considerable effect on improving the LAI-VI relationship. Nevertheless, there were some particular portions of the spectrum which had R(2)of more than 0.8 which was a great improvement compared to multispectral data with R(2)between 0.6 and 0.69. The best HNDVI and HSR were calculated from the 10-nm bands centered at 1 115 nm and 1 135 nm.

TI  - The Unintended Impact of Colombia's Covid-19 Lockdown on Forest Fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The covid-19 pandemic led to rapid and large-scale government intervention in economies and societies. A common policy response to covid-19 outbreaks has been the lockdown or quarantine. Designed to slow the spread of the disease, lockdowns have unintended consequences for the environment. This article examines the impact of Colombia's lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombia's lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombia's regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research.

TI  - 57% decline in Rhode Island invasive breast cancer mortality between 1987 and 2017: mammography predominates in preventing mortality
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Controversy exists regarding proportional contributions of mammographic screening versus systemic therapy to declining disease-specific mortality of female invasive breast cancer (IBC) in the United States. Understanding relative contributions may help address allocation of medical resources. Methods A 31-year (1987-2017) review of Rhode Island (RI) Cancer Registry data of female IBC was carried out in a state with high rates of mammographic screening. Results Over 31 years in RI, statistically significant improvements occurred at initial diagnosis of IBC: mean and median maximum cancer diameters decreased by 21% and 30% respectively. Despite 1997 introduction of more accurate sentinel lymph node biopsy, the proportion of patients with axillary lymph node metastases (LNM) decreased by 27%. Extent of LNM also decreased as patients with over three node metastases decreased 67%. By 2017, 53% of all patients with LNM had only one. Poorly differentiated cancers decreased 50%. Disease-specific mortality decreased 57%. Discussion Improvements in initial presentation of IBC are consistent with most having progressive growth, from cellular origin to palpable mass, the currently accepted biological model. Breast cancers identified earlier at initial diagnosis through screening mammography are characterized by smaller size, fewer axillary LNMs, better grade differentiation, and decreased mortality. Statistical analysis from these improved diagnostic parameters indicate that the majority of mortality decline from invasive breast cancer in RI can be attributed to earlier detection. Thus, mammography predominates in preventing mortality.

TI  - [Predictive ability of risk assessment tool regarding HIV infection for men who have sex with men].
T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the predictive ability of HIV infection risk assessment tool for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sentinel surveillance data of MSM in Taizhou prefecture of Zhejiang province was used. Methods: MSM involved in AIDS sentinel surveillance program in Taizhou from 2013 to 2017 were included in the study and items listed in the HIV infection risk assessment tool for MSM was revised. Related data on questions and options involved in sentinel surveillance was collected and individual risk scores were calculated. We determined the predictive ability of this tool by comprehensive analyzing the HIV infection status and individual risk scores. Results: A total of 1 944 MSM were included in the study, with an average age of (35.04±13.28)years old. Most of them were recruited from the venues (55.7%) and 48.2% were never married. Among these MSM, HIV infection rate was 12.6%(245/1 944) with the median of risk score as 23.99, versus 20.36 from the HIV negative ones. Significant differences appeared on the risk scores between the target populations that with different HIV status (Mann-Whitney test, P=0.007). According to the principle of decision tree, MSM were divided into two groups according to risk scores: ≤18.66 and >18.66. It appeared that the risk scores were in parallel with the rates of HIV infection (chi(2)=13.102, P<0.001). Results from the multivariate analysis showed that MSM with higher risk score were more likely to be infected with HIV (>18.66 vs. ≤18.66: aOR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.27-2.32, P<0.001). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for HIV infection was 0.553 (95%CI: 0.516-0.590, P=0.007). At the point of risk score 19.01, Youden's index appeared the maximum, with sensitivity as 0.69 and specificity as 0.43, of this tool. Conclusions: The HIV infection risk assessment tool for MSM developed based on Delphi method can predict the risk of HIV infection in MSM to some extent. MSM with higher risk score seemed likely to be infected with HIV. Items of this tool need to be adjusted for the verification of the tool through cohort studies in the near future.
AB  - 目的： 通过浙江省台州市MSM哨点监测数据，评估MSM个体HIV感染风险评估工具的预测能力。 方法： 根据MSM个体HIV感染风险评估工具条目，对2013-2017年台州市MSM哨点监测数据中的相关问题与选项进行重新修订，计算个体风险得分，结合个体HIV感染情况，分析该工具的预测能力。 结果： MSM研究对象1 944人，年龄（35.04±13.28）岁，未婚者占48.2%，多为场所招募（55.7%）。HIV阳性率为12.6%（245/1 944），HIV阳性者风险得分的中位数为23.99；HIV阴性者风险得分的中位数为20.36，不同HIV感染状态的研究对象风险得分差异有统计学意义（Mann-Whitney检验，P=0.007），HIV阳性者风险得分显著高于HIV阴性者。依据决策树原理，将研究对象按风险得分分为2类：≤18.66、>18.66，风险得分越高，HIV感染率越高（chi(2)=13.102，P<0.001）。多因素logistic回归分析显示，个体风险得分越高，感染HIV的风险也越高（>18.66分与≤18.66分相比：aOR=1.72，95%CI：1.27~2.32，P<0.001）。对HIV感染预测的ROC曲线下的面积为0.553（95%CI：0.516~0.590，P=0.007），约登指数最大的点是风险得分为19.01的点，此时风险评估工具的灵敏度为0.69，特异度为0.43。 结论： 基于德尔菲法建立的MSM个体HIV感染风险评估工具可以在一定程度上预测个体HIV感染风险，风险得分越高，感染HIV的实际风险也越高。但还需要设计更加科学严谨的队列研究进行验证和相应调整评估工具条目。.

T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leonardo has been involved in the realization of several infrared payloads for Earth observation since 1990. Among the currently in-orbit operative instruments are the two Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometers (SLSTRs) and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, meaning Hyperspectral Italian Pre-cursor of Operational mission). The SLSTRs are high-accuracy radiometers that provide sea surface temperature data continuity with respect to previous (A)ATSRs in order to serve climatology over the next 20 years, and exist within the framework of the European Space Agency Sentinel-3 mission, which is part of the Copernicus program. The PRISMA program is the first Agenzia Spaziale Italiana optical hyperspectral mission for Earth observation. It is based on a high spectral resolution spectrometer operating in the visible-short wave infrared channels optically integrated with a panchromatic camera. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America.

TI  - Metastatic head and neck cutaneous basal cell carcinomas: a retrospective observational study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous basal cell carcinoma is usually an indolent and slow-growing tumor with potential for local invasion and recurrence; however, metastatic events are exceedingly rare. The annual incidence of metastasis is estimated to range between 0.00281 and 0.05%. A retrospective search in the pathology database of a single tertiary institution was performed in the period between 1999 to 2019. Primary cutaneous metastatic basal cell carcinomas had paraffin blocks and glass slides retrieved. A total of 8673 cases was identified. The overall prevalence of metastatic tumors was 0.05% (4/8673). The median patient's age at diagnosis was 61 years old (range 52-79). The most common primary site of tumor was nose (2/4) and the most common histological subtype was infiltrative. The sampled lymph nodes were identified during primary tumor resection, except for 1 patient who had a sentinel lymph node biopsy performed as a surgeon individual decision. One patient had hematogenous spread to the pleura, diagnosed 5 years after diagnosis. In summary, this study adds new data to the current literature in metastatic primary cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate surgical excision in an effort to prevent local advanced disease, recurrence and lymphovascular dissemination.

TI  - Coeruptive and posteruptive crustal deformation associated with the 2018 Kusatsu-Shirane phreatic eruption based on PALSAR-2 time series analysis
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coeruptive deformation helps to interpret physical processes associated with volcanic eruptions. Because phreatic eruptions cause small, localized coeruptive deformation, we sometimes fail to identify plausible deformation signals. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data allow us to identify extensive deformation fields with high spatial resolutions. Herein, we report coeruptive crustal deformation associated with the 2018 Kusatsu-Shirane phreatic eruption detected by time series analyses of L-band satellite SAR (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) data. Cumulative deformation maps derived from SAR time series analyses show that subsidence and eastward displacement dominate the southwestern side of an eruptive crater with a spatial extent of approximately 2 km in diameter. Although we were unable to identify any significant deformation signals before the 2018 eruption, posteruptive deformation on the southwestern side of the crater has been ongoing until the end of 2019. This prolonged deformation implies the progression of posteruptive physical processes within a confined hydrothermal system, such as volcanic fluid discharge, similar to the processes observed during the 2014 Ontake eruption. Although accumulated snow and dense vegetation hinder the detection of deformation signals on Kusatsu-Shirane volcano using conventional InSAR data, L-band SAR with various temporal baselines allowed us to successfully extract both coeruptive and posteruptive deformation signals. The extracted cumulative deformation is well explained by a combination of normal faulting with a left-lateral slip component along a southwest-dipping fault plane and an isotropic deflation. Based on the geological background in which the shallow hydrothermal system develops across Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, the inferred dislocation plane can be considered as a degassing pathway from the shallow hydrothermal system to the surface due to the phreatic eruption. We reconfirmed that SAR data are a robust tool for detecting coeruptive and posteruptive deformations, which are helpful for understanding shallow physical processes associated with phreatic eruptions at active volcanoes.

TI  - Wild rats as urban detectives for latent sources of asbestos contamination
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a large body of evidence asbestos minerals have been classified as carcinogens. Despite the Italian ban on asbestos in 1992 and the subsequent remediation activities, latent sources of contamination may still represent a hazard where asbestos were particularly used. Using wild rats as sentinel animals, this study aimed at uncovering sites with the greatest potential for non-occupational exposure to asbestos in the city of Casale Monferrato (Piedmont Region, Italy), where the largest Italian manufacturing plant of asbestos-cement had been active.During the study period (2013-2015) a total of 40wild ratswere captured from16 sampling capture points. The lungs of wild rats have been investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM-EDS detected the presence of asbestos fibers (tremolite/actinolite, amosite, and chrysotile) in rats' lungs from 11 sampling points. The hypothetical rats' home-range and the observed sitespecific concentration of asbestos fibers per gram of dry lung tissue were used to identify areas to be targeted by additional search of latent sources of asbestos.In conclusion, our results showed that the use ofwild rats as sentinel animals may effectively integrate the strategies currently in use to reduce the exposure to asbestos.

TI  - A new infrared volcano monitoring using GCOM-C (SHIKISAI) satellite: applications to the Asia-Pacific region
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The GCOM-C (SHIKISAI) satellite was developed to understand the mechanisms of global climate change. The second-generation global imager (SGLI) onboard GCOM-C is an optical sensor observing wavelengths from 380 nm to 12.0 mu m in 19 bands. One of the notable features is that the resolution of the 1.63, 10.8, and 12.0 mu m bands is 250 m, with an observation frequency of 2-3 days. To investigate the effective use and potential of the 250 m resolution of these SGLI bands in the study of eruptive activities, we analyzed four practical cases. As an example of large-scale effusive activity, we studied the 2018 Kilauea eruption. By analyzing the series of 10.8 mu m band images using cumulative thermal anomaly maps, we could observe that the lava effused on the lower East Rift Zone, initially flowed down the southern slope to the sea, and then moved eastward. As an example of lava dome growth and generation of associated pyroclastic flows, the activity at Sheveluch between December 2018 and December 2019 was analyzed. The 1.63 and 10.8 mu m bands were shown to be suitable for observing growth of the lava dome and occurrence of pyroclastic flows, respectively. We found that the pyroclastic flows occurred during periods of rapid lava dome expansion. For the study of an active crater lake, the activity of Ijen during 2019 was analyzed. The lake temperature was found to rise rapidly in mid-May and reach 38 degrees C in mid-June. We also analyzed the intermittent activities of small-scale vulcanian eruptions at Sakurajima in 2019. The 1.63 mu m band was useful for detecting activities that are associated with vulcanian eruptions. Analytical results for these case studies demonstrated that the GCOM-C SGLI images are beneficial for observing various aspects of volcanic activity, and their real-time use may contribute to reducing eruption-related disasters.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lockdown period in India due to COVID-19 came into effect from 25 March 2020 onwards. The present study analyses the changes and trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) levels during the last few months and particularly during lockdown period. MODIS observations showed an average reduction of 20-37% in aerosol loading during the lockdown period (25 March-3 May 2020), compared to 2017-2019 across India. A clear-cut and drastic reduction in AOD (which includes both PM2.5 and PM10) was observed at many places across India, in particular over North India (46%), eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (42%) and peninsular India (30%). Maximum decrease in AOD was seen during 25 March to 5 April 2020 with values as low as 0.18-0.22, which are 72-87% lower than the February-March 2020 level. AOD then slightly increased in the third week of April due to stubble burning and a few cloudy days, and then fell subsequently. Ground measurements on air pollutants at selected Indian cities revealed reduction of 40-50% in surface concentration prior to the lockdown period. Thus, study shows a clear-cut improvement in air quality leading to significant improvement in visibility and more blue skies.

TI  - Geochemical characterization of modern aeolian dust over the Northeastern Arabian Sea: Implication for dust transport in the Arabian Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Sea, one of the most biologically productive oceanic regions, receive significant amount of nutrients through aeolian dust depositionwhich have potential tomodulate surfacewater biogeochemical processes. Identification of dust sources is important to assess role of dust deposition to surfacewater biogeochemistry. Herewe report geochemical characteristics (major elements and trace metals composition, clay mineralogy and radiogenic isotopes of Sr and Nd) of aeolian dust, derived fromdust storms inMiddle East and SouthWest Asia, to decipher its sources and possible transport pathways over the Arabian Sea. Twelve bulk aerosol samples were collected, during dusty period, at a coastal station (Goa; 15.4 degrees N, 73.8 degrees E) located in the Northeastern Arabian Sea, spanning over three years in different seasons. A preliminary estimation of sources for dust storms was done using satellite imagery and airmass back trajectory analyses. Major element and trace metal compositions of storm derived dust samples indicate insignificant contribution from anthropogenic sources. Illite and chlorite are major clay minerals found in all dust samples, however, high palygorskite content were observed for dust sourced from the Arabian Peninsula. A more uniform Sr-Nd signature is found for those derived from Arabia, however, highly variable Sr-Nd isotope signatures were observed for those derived from the South West Asia (Iran and Makran coast). The reported comprehensive data set on geochemical characteristics of mineral dust, is the first attempt that provides important information to understand present and past dust emission and deposition over the Arabian Sea.

TI  - The Effects of Land Indices on Thermal State in Surface Urban Heat Island Formation: A Case Study on Agra City in India Using Remote Sensing Data (1992-2019)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth of populations coupled with industrial and economic development has led to conversion of natural environment to urbanized regions of high built-up areas and infrastructure. The natural space is transforming to built-up set up rigorously which is not only intensifying the thermal state but also changing the climate dynamics. This has resulted in an increase in Land Surface Temperature (LST) leading to critical consequences on the climate and human life. In this study, spatiotemporal imageries of Landsat (1992-2019) are analysed for carrying out the analysis of land indices [Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Enhanced Built-up Bareness Index (EBBI)], LST and surface urban heat Island (SUHI) formation for Agra City in India using summer season (April-May) data. The main focus of the present work is the study of spatial pattern of LST and land indices (i.e. NDVI, NDBI and EBBI) and their interrelationship dynamics over the city landscape in directional profiling. The results of SUHI reveal that city center has experienced 0.5-3.5 degrees C of higher LST than urban periphery. The NDVI vs. LST relationship is found negative, whereas both NDBI vs. LST and EBBI vs. LST relationships are found positive in selected four summer time points of 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2019. The NDVI dynamics results indicate that the forest area (viz. 3-4 km and 10-12 km from city center) experienced 3-5 degrees C lower LST than other parts of the city landscape. The NDBI dynamics results indicate that in built-up area (from city center to 7 km in all eight directions) experienced 2-4 degrees C higher LST than other parts of the city landscape (except barren soils area). The EBBI dynamics results indicate that barren soils (viz. 8-10 km of North-East direction, 14-15 km of North-West direction and 7-9 km of South-West direction) have experienced 2-5 degrees C of higher LST than other part of the city landscape. The purpose of is to help in enriching the knowledge base for not only understanding the dynamics of the thermal state but also in knowing the composition of the landscape for enhancing environmental sustainability and carrying capacity for Agra city.

TI  - Oncologic Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been well studied. However, outcomes data addressing the oncologic safety of this technique are sparse. This study aimed to evaluate use of SLN surgery versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for clinically node-positive patients treated with NAC and to report outcomes. Methods The study identified patients at the authors' institution with biopsy proven clinically node-positive (cN1-cN3) breast cancer undergoing axillary surgery after NAC from 2009 to 2019. Practice patterns and outcomes were evaluated. Results Of 602 patients, 52.3% underwent SLN surgery. Use of SLN surgery increased significantly over time, reaching 75.3% during 2015-2019. For 52.5% of the patients who had an SLN identified, ALND was not used. Use of ALND (+/- SLN surgery) decreased from 100% in 2009 to 57.2% in 2015-2019. The nodal positivity rate of patients who proceeded directly to ALND was 64.5% (185/287), increasing significantly over time. Factors significantly associated with performing SLN surgery on multivariable analysis were lower presenting clinical T category, lower presenting clinical N category (cN1 vs cN2-3) and HER2-positive status. During the median 34-month follow-up period, 17 regional recurrences were observed (16/443 with ALND; 1/159 with SLN surgery alone), for a 2-year freedom-from-regional-recurrence rate of 99.1% among the SLN surgery patients and 96.4% among the ALND patients (p = 0.10). Conclusions For cN1-3 breast cancer treated with NAC, SLN surgery has been incorporated into clinical practice at the authors' institution. In this study, selection for SLN surgery was based on clinical factors and tumor biology. More than half of the patients who were selected for SLN surgery were spared ALND, with a low nodal failure rate and no recurrence-free survival disadvantage at 2 years.

TI  - Inferencing the land subsidence in the Nile Delta using Sentinel-1 satellites and GPS between 2015 and 2019
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nile Delta is home to half of Egypt's population and has ample agricultural, industrial, and cultural resources, yet the land subsides in response to many natural and anthropogenic impacts.We report the recent subsidence rate and patterns in the Nile Delta using the synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 data of 144 images obtained between 2015 and 2019, based on coherence small baseline subset interferometry of similar to 2900 interferograms. We distinguished three patterns of deformation due to three different physical mechanisms: 1) The land subsides with rates ranging from -12 to -20 mm/year in major cities (such as Zagazig, Mit Ghamr, Tanta, Mansoura and Mahla) due to urban-induced loading; 2) A subsidence rate ranges between -3 and -8 mm/year along the coastal margins due to natural sediment dewatering and compaction. This rate is consistent with the global positioning system rate of -3.5 mm/year and 3) A subsidence rate ranges from -20 to -16 mm/year and -6 to -12 mm/year in newly reclaimed lands on the west and east of the delta's flood plains, respectively, due to groundwater overexploitation. Our findings, in contrast with results from previous studies of regional deformation mainly felt to be controlled by natural processes, demonstrate a localized subsidence and predominant anthropogenic control on the land deformation and call for revisiting sea level rise-related flooding models in the Nile Delta. In light of the new findings, the authorities should take necessary measures to reduce the ongoing land subsidence through enforcement of urban planning policies in the delta's flood plain and development of a sustainable management strategy for groundwater extraction.

TI  - Resource use by marten at fine spatial extents
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Martens (Martesspp.) occupy areas with complex forest structure that can exhibit patchy distribution, particularly in managed forest landscapes. These structures (e.g., downed wood) are often difficult to reliably sample so more easily acquired surrogates may better describe marten habitat. Recent advances in global positioning system (GPS) collars combined with integrated (i.e., imagery with geospatial modeling), resolute, remotely sensed maps offer a potentially efficient means of understanding marten space use. We placed GPS collars on 13 American marten (M. americana), attempted to acquire a locational fix every 15 min, and calculated adaptive kernel home ranges from successful locations. We modeled probability of marten use as a function of covariates derived from remotely sensed data that included proportion of vegetation cover types, and distances to maintained roads and hydrographic features at 2.5, 4.5, and 7.1 ha extents. Average cover type values varied minimally across spatial extents we evaluated, indicating fine-scale homogenization. Amount of tall (> 10 m) deciduous forest, tall and short conifer forests, and riparian forests had positive effects on marten use, whereas distance to maintained roads had a weak negative effect. Broad riparian areas (e.g., scrub-shrub swamps that occur in broad topographic depressions), not necessarily associated with mapped hydrographic lines, were heavily used by marten. We found that core use areas for marten could reliably be predicted from 30 m remotely sensed maps summarized at relatively small extents (2.4-7.1 ha).

TI  - Survival Outcomes Following Lymph Node Biopsy in Thin Melanoma-A Propensity-Matched Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with T1 melanoma <= 1 mm has not been reported in a prospective clinical trial setting, so these clinical outcomes remain understudied. This study seeks to evaluate overall survival (OS) with and without lymph node biopsy (LNB) in patients with clinical T1N0M0 melanoma (0.5-1.0 mm). Patients and Methods Patients were identified using the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2012). After stratification into 0.5-0.7-mm and 0.8-1.0-mm groups, patients undergoing LNB were propensity score-matched 1:1 to patients not undergoing LNB. OS was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and the stratified log-rank test. Results Resection was performed in 28,846 patients, and LNB in 14,028 (49%); 15,194 were included in propensity score-matched analysis. The LNB and no-LNB groups were well balanced on all studied covariates (standardized mean difference < 0.10). Among patients with tumors 0.5-0.7 mm, 5- and 10-year OS were 94.7% and 82.7%, respectively, for the LNB group compared with 94.3% and 84.4% for the no-LNB group (p = 0.35). Among patients with tumors 0.8-1.0 mm in thickness, 5- and 10-year OS were 93.9% and 81.6%, respectively, for the LNB group compared with 90.3% and 74.3% for the no-LNB group (p < 0.0001). Conclusions There was no difference in OS by LNB status in patients with lesions 0.5-0.7 mm, consistently with recommendations against its routine use in this group. In lesions 0.8-1.0 mm, receipt of LNB was associated with a clinically small but significant improvement in OS. Further study is warranted to better understand this outcome difference.

TI  - Relationship Between Field Measurement of Soil Moisture in the Effective Depth of Sugarcane Root Zone and Extracted Indices from Spectral Reflectance of Optical/Thermal Bands of Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil moisture variables is very important in agriculture studies such as precision irrigation and its management, so knowledge of the variation would be highly beneficial. Effective irrigation is possible with regular monitoring of soil and plant water conditions and with the forecasting of future crop water requirement. This study explored the capability of indices for estimating soil moisture as an indicator of detection irrigation time in sugarcane farms located in the southwest of Iran. For this goal, Landsat 8 satellite images were got from May until September 2015. Concurrent with the satellite pass times, field measurements include soil moisture (SM) and canopy temperature was done at the predefined points in sugarcane farms. These farms were selected with different age and irrigation days. Various indices were calculated using the combination of optical and thermal infrared wavelengths, and their relationship to the amount of SM was studied. According to the results of this research, vegetation indices based on optical bands do not show a good coefficient of determination (R-2). Results showed that soil moisture computed by crop water stress index (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have a similar trend, which showed that both indices can be used for irrigation scheduling, although they had some differences for computed soil moisture, TVDI had better correlation than to CWSI. TVDI indicated a good correlation with SM measurement data whichR(2)values range from 0.35 to 0.66, as well as inharmonious with the spatial distribution of (SM). It showed (RMSE) less than 0.2. Comparing recorded irrigation and (SM) in the farms shows that (SM) can be classified into three classes: low soil moisture (0.1 < SM <= 0.15), medium soil moisture (0.15 < SM <= 0.2) and high soil moisture (0.2 < SM <= 0.25). This classification can be utilized for precision irrigation scheduling in soils with heavy and semi-heavy texture (silty clay and silty clay loam). All of the results demonstrated that the TVDI can be utilized for assessment SM and determine irrigation time in agriculture lands, without each other in situ measurement of data.

TI  - High-resolution digital mapping of soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen using DEM derivatives, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data based on machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) are important indicators of soil health and play a key role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. High-resolution radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images have the potential to investigate soil spatial distribution information over a large area, although Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data have rarely been combined to map either SOC or STN content. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to map both SOC and STN content in the southern part of Central Europe using digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, and evaluated the potential of different remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) to predict SOC and STN content. Four machinelearners including random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), support vector machine (SVM) and Bagged CART were used to construct predictive models of SOC and STN contents based on 179 soil samples and different combinations of environmental covariates. The performance of these models was evaluated based on a 10-fold cross-validationmethod by three statistical indicators. Overall, the BRT model performed better than RF, SVMand Bagged CART, and thesemodels yielded similar spatial distribution patterns of SOC and STN. Our results showed that multi-source sensor methods provided more accurate predictions of SOC and STN contents than individual sensors. The application of radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images proved useful for predicting SOC and STN. A combination of Sentinel-1/2-derived predictors and DEMderivatives yielded the highest prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy changedwith andwithout the Sentinel-1/2-derived predictors, with the R-2 for estimating both SOC and STN content using the BRT model increasing by 12.8% and 18.8%, respectively. Topographic variables were the main explanatory variables for SOC and STN predictions, where elevation was assigned as the variable with the most importance by the models. The results of this study illustrate the potential of free high-resolution radar Sentinel-1 andmultispectral Sentinel-2 data as inputwhen developing SOC and STN prediction models.

T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a multilayer perception convolutional neural network (MPCNct) was proposed for the pixel-level classification of multispectral remote sensing images, which combines the spectral information and spatial structure features of pixels. The performance of a land-cover-classification algorithm was tested based on the Jilin-1 spectral satellite (Jilin-1GP) images in the Nashik research area, India. To ensure high reliability of the experiment, the Landsat8, Sentinel-2A, and HJ-1A images were used within the same time interval for synchronized classification to perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, three current popular algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), LightGBM, and shallow convolutional neural network (CNN), were selected to compare the algorithm performance. The experimental results indicate that the overall classification accuracy on the Jilin-1GP images can reach 94.0%-95.8%, and the Kappa coefficient can reach 0.932-0.948. The overall classification accuracy of the MPCNet increase by 3.7 percentage compared with that of the shallow CNN, which exhibits high accuracy.

TI  - Adjuvant endocrine therapy is associated with improved overall survival in elderly hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose There is controversy regarding the survival benefit of endocrine therapy (ET) in elderly patients with early invasive hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. In this study, we characterize a single institution's practice patterns using adjuvant ET for these patients and evaluated the effect of ET on outcomes.Methods A review of a prospectively maintained database identified 483 women >= 70 years old who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for stage I-III HR+ tumors from 2004-2013. We compared clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in patients who did and did not receive ET.Results Compared to patients who did not get ET, patients who received ET were younger (median age 76 vs 78 years,p = 0.006), had larger tumors (median size 15 vs 14 mm,p = 0.016), underwent sentinel lymph node (LN) biopsy (83.7 vs 67.8%,p < 0.001), had positive LNs (25.5 vs 9.8%,p = 0.008), and received radiation (XRT, 76 vs 43%,p < 0.001). After adjusting for ASA score, age, LN status, tumor grade, and XRT, receipt of ET was associated with improved OS (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25-0.77;p = 0.004) and DFS (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.28-0.64;p < 0.01). Receipt of ET was associated with improved LRR on univariate analysis (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.70;p = 0.008); however, after adjusting for grade and XRT, this was not statistically significant on multivariable analysis (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.13-1.08;p = 0.069) and was not associated with BCSS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.16-2.16;p = 0.43).Conclusions ET was associated with significant improvements in OS and DFS, regardless of clinicopathological features; however, receipt of ET did not impact LRR and BCSS.

TI  - Critical success factors for food tourism destinations: Asocio-culturalperspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eating the food of other cultures is fraught with many problems underpinned by many factors chief among them being sociocultural background. The study, therefore, through a socio-cultural perspective, examines the factors necessary for food tourism development and promotion from tourists' perspectives. Using the tenets of grounded theory, 40 international tourists were interviewed at Cape Coast, Ghana. It was found that sensory characteristics and mediated by factors such as cultural/worldviews influence local food consumption. The findings support the position that the socio-cultural background of tourists affects their evaluation of a destination's food, hence consumption. Implications of the study are also drawn.

TI  - Coal fire detection and evolution of trend analysis based on CBERS-04 thermal infrared imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fire hazards not only causes loss of coal resources but also induces serious geological hazards and environmental degeneration. Wuda Coalfield (China), known for its widespread coal fires, was used as the study area for this study. Owing to an inherent noise problem, CBERS (China & Brazil Earth Resource Satellite)-04 thermal infrared images have not been explored and applied in the field of coal fire detection. An adaptive-edge-threshold (AET) method was proposed to delineate coal fire maps based on nighttime CBERS-04 data from 2015 to 2020. Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) was employed to cluster coal fire spots into different classes, then coal fire propagation directions were generated by connecting the clustering centers of the same class in chronological order. The results of quantitative analysis of coal fires showed that AET method achieved the highest accuracy among four coal fire recognition algorithms; the accuracy of AET in field verification reached 81.25%. The total area of coal fires increased by 137%, while the total intensity of coal fires decreased by 18% from 2015 to 2020. Overall accuracies of ISODATA clustering coal fire spots were between 90.25% and 100.00%, the Kappa coefficients were between 0.82 and 1.00. The evolution trend of coal fires obtained based on this clustering accuracy is reliable. The evolution trend of coal fires is as follows: coal fires of Class I spread to the northwest; coal fires of Class II first propagated to the northwest, then to the south and then to the west; coal fires of Class III essentially stayed in the same place; coal fires of Class IV spread to the northwest; coal fires of Class V spread to the southeast and then to the northeast.

TI  - β3 integrin immunohistochemistry as a method to predict sentinel lymph node status in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of noncovalently linked alpha and beta subunits which are essential for a wide range of normal physiology and also play prominent roles in cancer. Here we tested whether integrin expression in diagnostic skin biopsies is associated with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Methods We utilized a cohort of 854 consecutive patients with primary cutaneous melanoma to quantify the expression of beta integrin subunits by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, we quantified the expression of beta 3 integrin by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a subset of 271 patients by H score. Outcome of interest was SLN biopsy metastasis within 90 days of melanoma diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses were used to develop models for the likelihood of SLN metastasis from molecular, clinical, and histologic variables. Results beta 3 integrin expression quantified by IHC or RT-qPCR was associated with SLN metastasis. beta 1, beta 5, beta 6, and beta 8 integrin expression was not associated with SLN metastasis. The incremental gain in performance of a predictive model which included beta 3 integrin expression as quantified by IHC in combination with established clinicopathologic variables (Breslow depth and patient age) was limited. Conclusions beta 3 integrin is the principal integrin subunit associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNb) metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma. However, beta 3 integrin H score does not significantly improve models for the likelihood of SLN metastasis over Breslow depth and patient age.

TI  - Fracture network mapping using Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2A, ASTER, and ASTER-GDEM data, in the Rich area (Central High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping using remote sensing is one of the most important applied methods in natural resources exploration. The objectives of this study are mapping and analyzing of fractures distribution in the Rich area in order to understand the influence of lithology and geodynamics on fracture density. For this purpose, we relied on automatic lineament extraction using four types of satellite imagery: Landsat OLI, Sentinel 2A, ASTER L1B, and ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) in order to extract the maximum of lineaments affirmed significative in structural interpretations. After image corrections, the processing of these images is based on the highlighting of structural lineaments and their automatic extraction using the algorithm line of Geomatica software. The validation of linear structures was made based on existing data. The finding showed that each produced map shows systematically a similarity in terms of concentration and orientation with three preferential system-oriented NE-SW, NEE-SSW, E-W, and NNE-SSW. Lineaments mainly follow that of major fault zones, with a high concentration in the North-East part of the study area. This might be due to the importance of the Alpine orogeny deformation as well as the diapirism phenomenon of the Triassic formations in the hiner zone of the Atlas belt. However, the observation shows that the number and total length of structural lineaments could be extracted by using the sentinel 2A then Landsat OLI, ASTER-GDEM, and ASTER L1B set. The automatic extraction allows better mapping of structural lineaments. It shows a good agreement and more information compared with previous geological data, confirming the efficiency of applied techniques in geological studies.

TI  - Joseph Conrad and Scientific Naturalism: Revolutionising Epistemology in<i>The Secret Agent</i>
T2  - ENGLISH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article approaches Joseph Conrad'sThe Secret Agent(1907) as an epistemologically Janus-faced text that retrospectively parodies the material-empiricist worldview of scientific naturalism while also anticipating the absolute limits of knowledge dealt with in quantum physics. While the novel depicts the sensationalism and pervasive influence of scientific naturalism in the latter half of the nineteenth century, Conrad uses such characterisations to implicitly critique the movement as a systemic cultural and epistemological form of imperialism. His reaction to scientific naturalism and its position in society, however, causes him to confront the existence and influence of things that are completely beyond the human capacity to know. In rebuffing the growing cultural authority of science inThe Secret Agent, Conrad establishes a narrative framework for understanding the collapse of Victorian scientific epistemologies and probes the possibility of artistically representing a revolutionary form of knowledge centred on that which cannot be known.

TI  - Analysis of geo-spatiotemporal data using machine learning algorithms and reliability enhancement for urbanization decision support
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present systematic analyses of the temporal dynamics of the growth of Kumasi, the fastest growing city in Ghana using 20-year Landsat time-series data from 2000 to 2020 (with 1986 Landsat image as a baseline). Two classification algorithms - random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) - were used to produce binary (built-up / non-built up) maps for all years within the temporal span. We further implemented an anomaly detection and temporal consistency algorithm followed by a changing logic to correct the classification anomalies due to image contamination from the cloud and other sources. The mean overall accuracies obtained for RF and SVM were 94.9% (kappa = 0.90) and 95.5% (kappa = 0.91), respectively. Our results reveal that the mean built-up area percentages of the metropolis are approximately 74, 65, 47, and 23 for the years 2020, 2010, 2000, and 1986, respectively, representing a mean annual change of 3.5% over the 34 years. With the present lack of labeled data in Ghana for in-depth analyses of the evolution of land use, we believe that this study serves as an initial attempt to a better understanding of the effects of increasing anthropogenic activities due to urbanization, on human and environment health.

TI  - Estimation of vegetation stress in the mangrove forest using AVIRIS-NG airborne hyperspectral data
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the potential and demonstrated the applicability of hyperspectral images from AVIRIS-NG data in mapping the health condition of the Lothian Island estuarine mangrove forest with rich floral diversity for the years 2016 and 2018. Nine vegetation indices covering every aspect of the health status were considered and a weighted overlay analysis was performed to generate health maps from AVIRIS-NG data. Discriminant Normalized Vegetation Index (DNVI) was produced from Sentinel-2 data for both the years 2016 and 2018 to validate the results from AVIRIS-NG data. The analysis showed considerable negative trends in plant pigment contents indicating poor vegetation health and increased stress in the entire mangrove forest of the Lothian Island. Furthermore, red-edge analysis at four specific points helped in validating our health maps generated from both AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 data. Nearly 56% of the total area exhibits evidence of increasing stress within the span of the study years. 35% of the area has shown no change in the existing stress conditions in 2018. Both new plantation and species-specific resilience to stress appear to be the key factors for the sustenance of the existing mangrove population in the Lothian Island of the Indian Sundarbans.

TI  - Embedded systems and the Internet of Things: Can low-cost gas sensors be used in risk assessment of occupational exposure?
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) explores new perspectives and possible improvements in risk assessment practices and shows potential to measure long-term and real-time occupational exposure. This may be of value when monitoring gases with short-term maximum levels and for time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations used in standard measuring practices. A functional embedded system was designed using low-cost carbon monoxide (CO) electrochemical sensors and long-range-wide-area-network radio communication technology (LoRaWAN) was used to enable internet connectivity. This system was utilized to monitor gas levels continuously in the working atmosphere of an incineration plant over a 2-month period.The results show that stable and long-term continuous data transfer was enabled by LoRaWAN, which proved useful for detecting rapid changes in gas levels. However, it was observed that raw data from the low-cost sensors did not meet the NIOSH accuracy criteria of 25% of the estimated true concentration based on field data from a co-located gas detector that met the NIOSH accuracy criteria. The new IoT technologies and CO sensor networks shows potential for remote monitoring of exposure in order to: (1) detect rapid changes in CO and other possible hazardous airborne gases; and (2) show the dynamic range of real-time data that may be hazardous for workers in the sampled areas. While the IoT low-cost sensors appear to be useful as a sentinel for monitoring hazardous atmospheres containing CO, the more useful finding may be showing real-time changes and the dynamic range of exposures, thus shedding light on the transient and toxic nature of airborne hazards. More importantly, the low-cost CO sensors are not a clear substitute for the more costly real-time gas detectors that perform within the NIOSH accuracy criteria.

TI  - Spatial distribution of precipitable water in Iran using MODIS aqua data
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its adjacency to seas in the north and the south, Iran suffers from relatively low humidity. Spatial distribution of the atmospheric humidity across Iran is a function of altitude, distance to water bodies, and moisture advection. The analysis of the daily data on precipitable water from the MODIS Aqua sensor for a period of 15 years shows that average precipitable water across Iran is 12 mm. This quantity is maximal near the coasts, with the coasts of the Oman Sea exhibiting the highest values of precipitable water. In the vicinity of the Caspian Sea, the maximum precipitable water is observed at about 4 km to the shoreline, while it is 11 km away from the shoreline when it comes to southern coasts of Iran. In the areas far from the sea where the altitude exceeds 366 m, the precipitable water is mainly affected by the altitude and decreases logarithmically with the altitude.

AB  - Physically based distributed hydrologic modeling, rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model is used to evaluate runoff uncertainty on different topography data using five DEM products such as ASTER GDEM, SRTM, GMTED2010, HydroSHEDS, and GTOPO30. The five DEM products are input to the RRI model for the case study on the Nan River basin (13,000 km(2)of the watershed area) in Thailand. The performance of the DEM products, on runoff and inundation area, was evaluated from storm event in 2011 using statistical and detection analysis, compared with observation data. Overall of the DEM products evaluated with both analyses, the SRTM performed the best to compare with average observed data. For the simulated runoff of GMTED2010 firstly closed to the observed runoff to provide the highest correlation and smallest Root Mean Square Error values. The inundation resulted from SRTM was the highest accuracy to compare with the RADARSAT-2 product from GISTDA Thailand. The study presents that uncertainty of DEM produced from satellite and their potential a sensor and system developers to create better products for improving runoff and improved flood analysis for disaster mitigation approach.

TI  - Facies detection of surge-type glaciers, Karakoram Himalaya using Sentinel-1 images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier facies or radar glacier zones (RGZs) of the surge-type glaciers of the Karakoram Himalaya were classified based on the differences in the backscatter values utilizing multi-temporal SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellite of the years 2018 and 2019. Distinct zones of glaciers such as dry snow zones, percolation zones, wet snow zone, bare ice zone and debris-covered area can be discernible on the false-color composite image made from the early summer-late summer-winter (R-G-B) of SAR images obtained from Sentinel-1. The result suggests an interesting blended pattern of facies distribution on surge-type glaciers showing the impression of accumulation zones at the lower most parts of the glaciers contrary to typical non surge-type glaciers. We found that the facies of the surge-type glaciers of the Karakoram Himalaya did not follow the relationship with the elevation in terms of their distribution on the surface of glaciers. We also compared our results with the surface temperature of the glaciers derived from the thermal band of Landsat ETM+.

TI  - Development of international mirroring system for real-time web of meteorological satellite data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The third-generation meteorological satellites equipped with highly-improved imagers provide a huge amount of Earth observation data. Himawari-8 is the first unit of the Japan Meteorological Agency's third generation of geostationary satellites. After its starting operation in 2015, there are several websites that provide remotely sensed images in real time. However, it is hard to develop a real-time and full-resolution website, due to the large amount of data to be handled. Himawari-8 real-time web is only one website that provides full-resolution remotely sensed images in real time. To reduce network traffic and increase the access speed of it from other countries out of Japan, mirror websites of each country are needed. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective mirroring system for the Himawari-8 real-time web. A mirroring model is introduced to avoid the problem of big data processing in the mirror websites. We adopt a file copy tool based on high-performance and flexible protocol (HpFP) to transfer meteorological satellite data from the Himawari-8 real-time web to the mirror websites. Our first target is Thailand, one of the most disaster-prone countries in South-East Asia. The mirror website is set up at an institution in Thailand connected via collaborative international networks, e.g., Japan Gigabit Network (JGN) and Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN). The results show that the proposed mirroring system is able to overcome the big data issue by reducing the central processing unit (CPU) usage in the mirror website and transferring remotely sensed image files at high speed over international networks even under packet loss conditions. This suggests that our mirroring system has a potential for deployment in other Asian and Oceanian countries.

TI  - Ultrasound visibility of select breast biopsy markers for targeted axillary node localization following neoadjuvant treatment: simulation using animal tissue models
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To compare ultrasound visibility of selected biopsy markers in animal tissue models simulating axillary echotexture. Methods Four breast biopsy markers were selected based on size, shape, and composition and compared to an institutional standard for testing in beef steak and pork loin phantoms. BD (R) UltraCor (TM) Twirl (TM); Hologic (R) Tumark (R) Professional series Q, Vision, and X; and BD (R) UltraClip (TM) Dual Trigger wing-shaped (institutional standard) biopsy markers were deployed at superficial (0-2.0 cm) and deep (2.1-4.0 cm) depths in the animal models. An animal model without a biopsy marker served as control. Four participating breast imagers blinded to marker shape and location assessed ultrasound visibility of each biopsy marker using a handheld 5-12 MHz linear array transducer with a 4-point grading system (0, not visible; 1, unsure if visible; 2, visible with difficulty; 3, definite visibility). Each breast imager was asked to select the three most easily visualized biopsy markers. Results Total visibility scores with the four-point grading system demonstrate highest score for the Twirl (TM) (48/48 points), followed by the Tumark (R) Q (42/48) and Tumark (R) Vision (41/48) biopsy markers. Overall individual accuracy scores across all biopsy marker types ranged from 83.3 to 95.8%. Visibility scores based on subjective radiologist assessment also demonstrate the highest vote for the Twirl (TM) (11), followed by the Tumark (R) Vision (7) and Tumark (R) Q (6) biopsy markers. The wing-shaped biopsy marker had the lowest visibility and voter score. Conclusion The Twirl (TM) followed by the Tumark (R) Q and Vision biopsy markers demonstrates the highest visibility scores using a four-point grading system and by radiologist vote.

TI  - Terra MODIS: 20 years of on-orbit calibration and performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch in December 1999, Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has successfully operated for more than 20 years, with its observations generating a broad range of science data products that have greatly enabled the remote sensing community and users worldwide in their studies of many key geophysical parameters of the Earth's systems. MODIS collects data in 36 spectral bands, covering wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.4 pm, which are calibrated by a set of onboard calibrators (OBCs). Also contributing to the sensor's mission-long on-orbit calibration and characterization are near-monthly scheduled lunar observations and multiple time series of the sensor's responses over select ground targets at a variety of scan angles. To a large extent, the quality of MODIS data products relies strongly on the dedicated efforts to operate and calibrate the instrument, to derive and update calibration parameters, and to develop and implement new calibration strategies and algorithms in response to on-orbit changes of the sensor's characteristics and its OBC functions. We provide an over- view of the Terra MODIS on-orbit operation and calibration activities over the last 20 years, including changes made to extend and preserve the instrument and OBC functions and their operation strategies. It also illustrates the sensor's on-orbit performance with results derived from its OBC, lunar observations, and select ground targets and discusses major changes in sensor characteristics and corrections applied to the L1B algorithms as well as calibration lookup table updates. To date, the Terra MODIS instrument and its OBCs continue to operate and function normally. Except for those identified prelaunch, most spectral bands and detectors continue to meet their specified calibration requirements. Also discussed in our paper are lessons learned from Terra MODIS operation and calibration, as well as future efforts to further extend and maintain the quality of its long-term data records.

TI  - Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System strategy for intercalibrating the new-generation geostationary visible imagers
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced baseline imager (ABI) instrument onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 is the first of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA' s) new-generation geostationary earth orbiting (GEO) imagers that provides high-quality calibrated and geolocated Earth observations in six reflective solar bands (RSBs). The spectral similarity between the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and ABI RSB offers an opportunity for deriving VIIRS-quality cloud retrievals from the ABI radiances. NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project utilizes GEO imager (including ABI) radiances to retrieve clouds and derive broadband fluxes that are used to account for the regional diurnal flux variation between the CERES measurements and to convert the CERES observed radiances into fluxes. In order to derive a seamless cloud and flux datasets for CERES, it is important that the GEO, MODIS, and VIIRS imagers are all placed on the same radiometric scale. We describe an absolute radiometric intercomparison between the NOAA-20 VIIRS and GOES-16 ABI RSB using ray-matched radiance/reflectance pairs over all-sky tropical ocean scenes as well as a deep convective cloud invariant target calibration algorithm. Results indicate that the ABI and VIIRS RSB calibration are within 5%, except for the 0.47-mu m band, for which the radiometric inconsistency is found to be similar to 7%. The GOES-16 radiometric scaling factors referenced to NOAA-20 VIIRS were computed from the two independent calibration methods to agree within 1% for ABI bands 1 to 4, and within 3% for bands 5 and 6. Results from this study were used to propose a future CERES GEO intercalibration algorithm referenced to NOAA-20 VIIRS, given the eventual demise of the Terra and Aqua satellites.

TI  - Total column water vapor retrieval for Global Ozone Monitoring Experience-2 (GOME-2) visible blue observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new total column water vapor (TCWV) retrieval algorithm in the visible blue spectral band for the Global Ozone Monitoring Experience 2 (GOME-2) instruments on board the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Metop satellites. The blue band algorithm allows the retrieval of water vapor from sensors which do not cover longer wavelengths, such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Copernicus atmospheric composition missions Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P), Sentinel-4 (S4) and Sentinel-5 (S5). The blue band algorithm uses the differential optical absorption spectroscopic (DOAS) technique to retrieve water vapor slant columns. The measured water vapor slant columns are converted to vertical columns using air mass factors (AMFs). The new algorithm has an iterative optimization module to dynamically find the optimal a priori water vapor profile. This makes it better suited for climate studies than usual satellite retrievals with static a priori or vertical profile information from the chemistry transport model (CTM). The dynamic a priori algorithm makes use of the fact that the vertical distribution of water vapor is strongly correlated to the total column. The new algorithm is applied to GOME-2A and GOME-2B observations to retrieve TCWV. The data set is validated by comparing it to the operational product retrieved in the red spectral band, sun photometer and radiosonde measurements. Water vapor columns retrieved in the blue band are in good agreement with the other data sets, indicating that the new algorithm derives precise results and can be used for the current and forthcoming Copernicus Sentinel missions S4 and S5.

TI  - A single-center, randomized, non-inferiority study evaluating seroma formation after mastectomy combined with flap fixation with or without suction drainage: protocol for the <i>S</i>eroma reduction and dr<i>A</i>in f<i>R</i>ee m<i>A</i>stectomy (SARA) trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: eroma formation is a common complication after breast cancer surgery and can lead to delayed wound healing, infection, patient discomfort and repeated visits to the outpatient clinic. Mastectomy combined with flap fixation is becoming standard practice and is currently combined with closed-suction drainage. There is evidence showing that closed-suction drainage may be insufficient in preventing seroma formation. There is reasonable doubt whether there is still place for closed-suction drainage after mastectomy when flap fixation is performed.We hypothesize that mastectomy combined with flap fixation and closed suction drainage does not cause a significant lower incidence of seroma aspirations, when compared to mastectomy and flap fixation alone. Furthermore, we expect that patients without drainage will experience significantly less discomfort and comparable rates of surgical site infections.Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial in female breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and flap fixation using sutures with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they are older than 18 years, have an indication for mastectomy with or without sentinel procedure. Exclusion criteria are modified radical mastectomy, direct breast reconstruction, previous history of radiation therapy of the unilateral breast, breast conserving therapy and inability to give informed consent. A total of 250 patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: mastectomy combined with flap fixation and closed-suction drainage or mastectomy combined with flap fixation without drainage. Follow-up will be conducted up to six months postoperatively. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients undergoing one or more seroma aspirations. Secondary outcome measures consist of the number of invasive interventions, surgical site infection, quality of life measured using the SF-12 Health Survey, cosmesis, pain and number of additional outpatient department visits.Discussion: To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted comparing flap fixation with and without closed-suction drainage with seroma aspiration as the primary outcome. This study could result in finding evidence that supports performing mastectomy without closed-suction drainage.

TI  - Sentinel Node Status is the Most Important Prognostic Information for Clinical Stage IIB and IIC Melanoma Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for melanoma patients has been questioned. We aimed to study high-risk stage II melanoma patients who underwent SNB to determine what the prognostic factors regarding recurrence and mortality were, and evaluate how relevant SNB status is in this scenario. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of clinical stage IIB/IIC melanoma patients who underwent SNB from 2000 to 2015 in a single institution. Prognostic factors related to distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were assessed from multiple Cox regression. Relevant variables were used to create risk predictor nomograms for DRFS and MSS. Results From 1213 SNB, 259 were performed for clinical stage IIB/IIC melanoma patients. SNB status was the most important variable for both endpoints. Patients with positive SNB presented median DRFS of 35.73 months (95% CI 21.38-50.08, SE 7.32) and median MSS of 66.4 months (95% CI 29.76-103.03, SE 18.69), meanwhile both median DRFS and MSS were not achieved for those with negative SNB (logrank < 0.0001). Both nomograms have been internally validated and presented adequate calibration (C-index was 0.734 for DRFS and 0.718 for MSS). Conclusions SNB status was the most important risk factor in our cohort of clinical stage IIB and IIC patients and, in conjunction with well-established primary tumor characteristics, should not be abandoned. Their use in prognosis for these patients remains extremely useful for daily practice.

TI  - Revisiting the global hydrological cycle: is it intensifying?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of technological advances in monitoring atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and biosphere, as well as in data management and processing, several databases have become freely available. These can be exploited in revisiting the global hydrological cycle with the aim, on the one hand, to better quantify it and, on the other hand, to test the established climatological hypotheses according to which the hydrological cycle should be intensifying because of global warming. By processing the information from gridded ground observations, satellite data and reanalyses, it turns out that the established hypotheses are not confirmed. Instead of monotonic trends, there appear fluctuations from intensification to deintensification, and vice versa, with deintensification prevailing in the 21st century. The water balance on land and in the sea appears to be lower than the standard figures of literature, but with greater variability on climatic timescales, which is in accordance with Hurst-Kolmogorov stochastic dynamics The most obvious anthropogenic signal in the hydrological cycle appears to be the over-exploitation of groundwater, which has a visible effect on the rise in sea level. Melting of glaciers has an equal effect, but in this case it is not known which part is anthropogenic, as studies on polar regions attribute mass loss mostly to ice dynamics.

TI  - Spatial patterns of logging-related disturbance events: a multi-scale analysis on forest management units located in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Selective logging has been commonly mapped using binary maps, representing logged and unlogged forests. However, binary maps may fall short regarding the optimum representation of this type of disturbance, as tree harvest in tropical forests can be highly heterogeneous. Objectives The objective of this study is to map forest disturbance intensities in areas of selective logging located in the Brazilian Amazon.Methods Selective logging activities were mapped in ten forest management units using Sentinel-2 data at 10 mresolution. A spatial pattern analysis was applied to the logging map, using a moving window approach with different window sizes. Two landscape metrics were used to derive a forest disturbance intensity map. This map was then compared with actual disturbances using field data and a post-harvest forest recovery analysis.Results Disturbed areas were grouped into five distinct disturbance intensity classes, from very low to very high. Classes high and very high were found to be related to log landings and large felling gaps, while very low intensities were mainly related to isolated disturbance types. The post-harvest forest recovery analysis showed that the five classes can be clearly distinguished from one another, with the clearest differences in the year of logging and one year after it.Conclusions The approach described represents an important step towards a better mapping of selectively logged areas, when compared to the use of binary maps. The disturbance intensity classes could be used as indicators for forest monitoring as well as for further evaluation of areas under forest management.

TI  - The Second Generation Canadian Wetland Inventory Map at 10 Meters Resolution Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been a significant increase in efforts to better inventory and manage important ecosystems across Canada using advanced remote sensing techniques. In this study, we improved the method and results of our first-generation Canadian wetland inventory map at 10-m resolution. Iin order to increase wetland classification accuracy, the main contributions of this new study are adding more training data to the classification process and training Random Forest (RF) models on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform within the boundaries of ecozones rather than provinces. A considerable effort has been devoted to data collection, preparation, standardization of datasets for each ecozone. The data cleaning reveals a data gap in several Northern ecozones. Accordingly, high-resolution optical data, from Worldview-2 and Pleiades, were acquired to delineate wetland training data based on visual interpretation in those regions. By using this well-distributed training data, this second generation wetland inventory map represents an improvement of 7% compared to the first generation map. Accuracy varied from 76% to 91% in different ecozones depending on available resources. Furthermore, the results of RF variable importance, which was carried out for each ecozone, demonstrate that vertical bar S-VV vertical bar(2)/S-VH vertical bar(2) and NDVI extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively, were the most important features for wetland mapping.

TI  - German anthropology, nationalism and imperialism: Georg von Neumayer's <i>Anleitung zu wissenschaftlichen Beobachtungen auf Reisen</i>
T2  - HISTORY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Georg von Neumayer's Anleitung zu wissenschaftlichen Beobachtungen auf Reisen (Guide to scientific observations on travels), published in three editions from 1875 to 1906, provided instructions to German travellers on the collection of scientific data, including anthropological data. This paper explores the origins of the Anleitung by looking to its editor's scientific experience in colonial Australia in the 1850s and 1860s and to his adherence to a national liberal worldview. It then examines the evolution of the Anleitung through its three editions, from the period post-unification to the era of colonial expansion and rivalry. In paying close attention to the chapters on anthropology and how they changed over a period of some three decades, the paper argues that the Anleitung not only sought to harness popular enthusiasm for science but also served German national and imperial interests through a formative period in the development of German anthropology.

TI  - Empirical vs. light-use efficiency modelling for estimating carbon fluxes in a mid-succession ecosystem developed on abandoned karst grassland
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst systems represent an important carbon sink worldwide. However, several phenomena such as the CO(2)degassing and the exchange of cave air return a considerable amount of CO(2)to the atmosphere. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the contribution of the ecosystem to the carbon budget of karst areas. In this study conducted in a mid-succession ecosystem developed on abandoned karst grassland, two types of model were assessed, estimating the gross primary production (GPP) or the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) based on seven years of eddy covariance data (2013-2019): (1) a quadratic vegetation index-based empirical model with five alternative vegetation indices as proxies of GPP and NEE, and (2) the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) which is a light use efficiency model to estimate only GPP. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was the best proxy for NEE whereas SAVI performed very similarly to EVI in the case of GPP in the empirical model setting. The empirical model performed better than the VPM model which tended to underestimate GPP. Therefore, for this ecosystem, we suggest the use of the empirical model provided that the quadratic relationship observed persists. However, the VPM model would be a good alternative under a changing climate, as it is rooted in the understanding of the photosynthesis process, if the scalars it involves could be improved to better estimate GPP.

TI  - Remote Sensing Assessment of the Impact of Land Use and Land Cover Change on the Environment of Barddhaman District, West Bengal, India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land transformation is caused by natural as well as anthropogenic driving forces and its impact on the regional environment is a key issue in understanding the relationship between society and the environment. Here, we investigate Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change over four decades, based on Landsat satellite imagery for 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, for the Barddhaman district of West Bengal, India. In total, six land use and land cover types have been identified. Over the period in question, there are notable increases in the area under built-up land, plantations and water bodies, whereas there has been a marked decrease in forest cover, agricultural land, and in bare land. The diverse effects of land transformation on the natural environment have been assessed using Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Effective Roughness Length (ERL), and Surface Albedo (SA). Overall, mean annual LST increased by 2.91 degrees C during the study period, while there were reduced values for vegetation indices and an increase in the water index over the period 1987-2017. LAI and ERL both exhibit notable decreases, although the pattern was not uniform across the study area. For example, LAI values increased over time in the Kalna, Memari, Jamalpur, Ausgram, and Kanksa regions. In Faridpur-Durgapur, Raniganj, Asansol, and Raina, increases in surface albedo and ERL were more marked than in other regions. Negative correlations are found between LST-NDVI and NDVI-NDWI, while there is no correlation between LST and NDWI. During the period 1987-2017, NDVI values have declined, although the NDWI shows no clear trend. LULC change is shown to have had a series of negative impacts on the environment of the Barddhaman district. In response, technological, economic, policy, or legislation measures are needed to restore degraded ecosystem services in the district as well as other areas where similar impacts are experienced.

TI  - Regional variation in habitat matrix determines movement metrics in Baudin's cockatoos in southwest Western Australia
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology.Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data.Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates.Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape.Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species.Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products are the most used in burned-area monitoring, on regional and global scales. This research aims to evaluate the accuracy of the MODIS burned-area and active-fire products to describe fire patterns in Brazil in the period 2001-2015. The accuracy analysis, in the year 2015, compared the MODIS products (MCD45/MCD64) and the burned areas extracted by the visual interpretation of the LANDSAT/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from the confusion matrix. The accuracy analysis of the active-fire products (MOD14/MYD14) in the year 2015 used linear regression. We used the most accurate burned-area product (MCD64), in conjunction with environmental variables of land use and climate. The MCD45 product presented a high error of commission (>36.69%) and omission (>77.04%) for the whole country. The MCD64 product had fewer errors of omission (64.05%) compared with the MCD45 product, but increased errors of commission (45.85%). MCD64 data in 2001-2015 showed three fire domains in Brazil determined by the climatic pattern. Savanna and grassy areas in semi-humid zones are the most prone areas to fire, burning an average of 25% of their total area annually, with a fire return interval of 5-6 years.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of gross primary productivity in moist and dry deciduous plant functional types of Northwest Himalayan foothills of India using temperature-greenness model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to estimate the spatio-temporal variability of gross primary productivity (GPP) in moist and dry deciduous plant functional types (PFTs) of northwest Himalayan foothills of India using remote sensing-based Temperature-Greenness (TG) model and to study the response of GPP to environmental variables. TG model was implemented in Google Earth Engine platform using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index (MOD13A2) and land surface temperature (MOD11A2) from 2001 to 2018. The mean monthly GPP ranged from 1.80 to 18.57 gCm(-2)day(-1)in moist deciduous and from 0.20 to 12.06 gCm(-2)day(-1)in dry deciduous PFTs. On site-scale validation with eddy covariance flux tower GPP, the modelled GPP showed R-2=0.79 for moist deciduous and R-2=0.77 for dry deciduous PFT. Leaf area index showed the highest correlation with the predicted GPP (r = 0.74 for moist and 0.83 for dry deciduous PFTs). The study revealed that TG model could predict the long-term forest GPP with minimum in-situ inputs.

TI  - Theology in the age of cognitive science
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cognitive science of religion sets out a naturalistic account of religion, in which religious phenomena are grounded in evolved cognitive and moral intuitions. This has important implications for understanding religious systems and the practice of theology. Religions, it is argued, are moral worldviews; theology, rather than a rational justification/explication of the truth of a religion, is an elaboration and/or defense a particular moral worldview, which itself is a particular construction of evolved cognitive and moral intuitions. The philosophical, social, and moral implications of this, which are far reaching, will be explored.

TI  - Asynchrony among insect pollinator groups and flowering plants with elevation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountains influence species distribution through differing climate variables associated with increasing elevation. These factors determine species niche ranges and phenology. Although the distribution patterns of some specific insect groups relative to elevation have been determined, how differing environmental conditions across elevation zones differentially influence the phenology of various insect groups is largely unknown. This is important in this era of rapid climate change. We assess here how species composition and seasonal peaks in abundance among different insect pollinator groups and flowering plants differ across four floristically distinct elevation zones up a sentinel mountain subject to strong weather events. We sampled insect pollinators in four major groups (bees, wasps, beetles and flies) over two spring seasons. Pollinator species composition across all elevation zones tracks flowering plant species composition. In terms of abundance, beetles were the dominant group across the three lower zones, but declined greatly in the summit zone, where flies and bees were more abundant. Bee abundance peaked earlier than the other groups across all four elevation zones, where there were significant peaks in abundance. Bee abundance peaked earlier than flowering plants at the middle zone and slightly later than flowering plants at the base zone, suggesting a mismatch. We conclude that, while elevation shapes species distribution, it also differentially influences species phenology. This may be of great significance in long-term assessment of species distribution in sensitive mountain ecosystems.

TI  - Neo-Adjuvant chemotherapy and its affects to the axilla-Can we safely downgrade axillary surgery to mirror the approach in the breast
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to downgrade surgery in the breast from mastectomy to breast-conserving surgery is well-established. In certain patients, the use of adjuvant axillary radiotherapy can be safe and effective in place of axillary node clearance. What remains less clear are the alternative surgical options to the axilla following NACT. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of NACT in the axilla and whether downgrading axillary node clearance to axillary conserving surgery to mirror the approach in the breast may be a viable and safe practice. Patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were identified over a seven-year period between 2010 and 2017. Surgical plans were compared with pre- and post-chemotherapy. Histological information at the time of diagnosis was compared to surgical excision specimens. 349 patients were included for analysis, and 264 had axillary status documented at diagnosis. The average patient age was 51 years, and Grade 3, ER-positive, and Her2-negative cancers made the biggest histological subgroups. Complete pathological response (CPR) was seen in the breast in 27% of cases. 19% of patients requiring mastectomy had their surgery downgraded. Following NACT, axillary CPR was seen in 42% of patients and residual axillary nodal burden was limited to four nodes in 73% of patients. Axillary conserving surgery may be a safe alternative surgical approach in the downstaged axilla following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Advances in perioperative identification of suspicious nodes may be needed to facilitate progress.

TI  - Mapping the fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation and its spatiotemporal variations in the Xilingol grassland using MODIS imagery (2000-2019)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate information on the fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) (f(NPV)) on grasslands is essential for monitoring soil erosion risk, assessing grassland productivity and managing grassland ecosystems. However, few studies have monitoredf(NPV)in the Xilingol grassland region (XGR) and its spatiotemporal variations based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. In this study, we determined the upper dead fuel index (DFI) threshold for NPV in the XGR. Then, a remote-sensing inversion model forf(NPV)was established based on the ground-measuredf(NPV)and the DFI derived from MODIS images. Based on the inversion model, we obtained the spatial distribution and spatiotemporal variations inf(NPV)from 2000 to 2019. The results indicated that the DFI can reflect the NPV in the XGR with an upper threshold of 27.2. The DFI-f(NPV)linear regression model showed a good performance, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.60 and a root mean square error of leave-one-out cross-validation (RMSECV) of 0.1574. Furthermore, the spatial distribution off(NPV)exhibited significant heterogeneity, andf(NPV)decreased from the northeastern XGR to the southwestern XGR. The overall trend of the interannualf(NPV)in the XGR increased in a fluctuating manner during 2000-2019. Thef(NPV)increased in 66.92% of the XGR and decreased in a relatively small proportion (18.21%) of the XGR.

TI  - Brazilian Students Studying in the United States: Perceptions of Their Lived Experiences 6 Months After Returning Home
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge for international students in the United States is a readiness to study and live in a culture that is vastly different from their own. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the lived experiences of Brazilian students studying in the United States 6 months after returning home. Thirty-three Brazilian students responded to an open-ended, self-reflective online questionnaire focusing on their lived experience in the U.S. Three major themes emerged from the data based on the interactions between the multiple systems Brazilian students lived in the U.S.: personal growth and development, perspective transformation, and change in worldview. Participants claimed that they perceived their experiences influenced their perceptions about their own country and culture and gave them a new perspective expanding their horizons about themselves and their role in the world. The article concludes with practical implications, study limitations, and suggestions for future research.

TI  - The association between upper limb function and variables at the different domains of the international classification of functioning, disability and health in women after breast cancer surgery: a systematic review
T2  - DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To investigate the variables per International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)-domain that are associated with upper limb (UL) function in women after breast cancer surgery. Materials and Methods PubMed and Web of Science were searched until 7 January 2020. Eligibility criteria were: prospective investigation of an association between one or more variables of the ICF model and UL function in women after breast cancer surgery. PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct and report the systematic review. The Quality In Prognosis Studies tool (QUIPS) was used to evaluate risk of bias. Results Twelve studies were included (2244 participants). Risk of bias of the included studies was low to moderate. Variables at the ICF-function level that were systematically associated with decreased UL function across multiple included papers were: increased UL pain, decreased shoulder range of motion, decreased handgrip strength and a higher number of comorbidities. Results on the association between UL function and variables at other ICF-domains were conflicting. Conclusion UL function was associated with certain variables at the ICF-function level. Variability in disease stages, treatment and measurement methods might explain inconsistent associations with other variables. Only limited studies investigated associations between UL function and psychosocial factors.

TI  - The relationship between seasonal influenza and telephone triage for fever: A population-based study in Osaka, Japan
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Replacing traditional surveillance with syndromic surveillance is one of the major interests in public health. However, it is unclear whether the number of influenza patients is associated with the number of telephone triages in Japan. Methods This retrospective, observational study was conducted over the six-year period between January 2012 to December 2017. We used the dataset of a telephone triage service in Osaka, Japan and the data on influenza patients published from the Information Center of Infectious Disease in Osaka prefecture. Using a linear regression model, we calculated Spearman's rank-order coefficient and R(2)of the regression model to assess the relationship between the number of telephone triages for fever and the number of influenza patients in Osaka. Furthermore, we calculated Spearman's rank-order coefficient and R(2)between the predicted weekly number of influenza patients from the linear regression model and the actual weekly number of influenza patients for influenza outbreak season (December-April). Results There were 465,971 patients with influenza, and the number of telephone triages for fever was 420,928 among 1,065,628 total telephone triages during the study period. Our analysis showed that the Spearman rank-order coefficient was 0.932, and R(2)and adjusted R(2)were 0.869 and 0.842, respectively. The Spearman rank-order coefficient was 0.923 (P<0.001) and R(2)was 0.832 in December-April (P<0.001). Conclusion We revealed a positive relationship in this population between the number of influenza patients and the number of telephone triages for fever.

TI  - A Platelet Function Modulator of Thrombin Activation Is Causally Linked to Cardiovascular Disease and Affects PAR4 Receptor Signaling
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces ischemic events in cardiovascular disease, but it increases bleeding risk. Thrombin receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are drug targets, but the role of thrombin in platelet aggregation remains largely unexplored in large populations. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of platelet aggregation in response to full-length thrombin, followed by clinical association analyses, Mendelian randomization, and functional characterization including iPSC-derived megakaryocyte and platelet experiments. We identified a single sentinel variant in the GRK5 locus (rs10886430-G, p = 3.0 x 10(-42)) associated with increased thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (beta = 0.70, SE = 0.05). We show that disruption of platelet GRK5 expression by rs10886430-G is associated with enhanced platelet reactivity. The proposed mechanism of a GATA1-driven megakaryocyte enhancer is confirmed in allele-specific experiments. Utilizing further data, we demonstrate that the allelic effect is highly platelet- and thrombin-specific and not likely due to effects on thrombin levels. The variant is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes in UK BioBank, most strongly with pulmonary embolism. The variant associates with increased risk of stroke in the MEGASTROKE, UK BioBank, and FinnGen studies. Mendelian randomization analyses in independent samples support a causal role for rs10886430-G in increasing risk for stroke, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism through its effect on thrombin-induced platelet reactivity. We demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) promotes platelet activation specifically via PAR4 receptor signaling. GRK5 inhibitors in development for the treatment of heart failure and cancer could have platelet off-target deleterious effects. Common variants in GRK5 may modify clinical outcomes with PAR4 inhibitors, and upregulation of GRK5 activity or signaling in platelets may have therapeutic benefits.

TI  - The response of canopy height diversity to natural disturbances in two temperate forest landscapes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Structural diversity strongly influences habitat quality and the functioning of forest ecosystems. An important driver of the variation in forest structures are disturbances. As disturbances are increasing in many forest ecosystems around the globe, it is important to understand how structural diversity responds to (changing) disturbances.Objectives Our aim was to quantify the relationship between forest disturbances and structural diversity with a focus on diversity in canopy height.Methods We assessed diversity in canopy height for two strictly protected Central European forest landscapes using lidar data. We used a multi-scale framework to quantify within-patch (alpha), between-patch (beta), and overall (gamma) diversity. We then analysed the variation in canopy height diversity over an extensive gradient of disturbance rates.Results Diversity in canopy height was strongly driven by disturbance rate, with highest overall diversity between 0.5 and 1.5% of the forest area disturbed per year. The unimodal responses of overall diversity to disturbance emerged from contrasting within- and between-patch responses, i.e., a decrease in within-patch diversity and an increase in between-patch diversity with increasing disturbance. This relationship was consistent across study landscapes, spatial scales, and diversity indicators.Conclusion The recent wave of natural disturbances in Central Europe has likely fostered the structural diversity of forest landscapes. However, a further increase in disturbance could result in the crossing of a tipping point (at similar to 1.5% of forest area disturbed per year), leading to substantial structural homogenization.

TI  - The Migration of the Warming Center and Urban Heat Island Effect in Shanghai During Urbanization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the monthly air temperature data from 11 national meteorological stations of Shanghai, the construction land areas derived from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data and population density data, the migration of urban warming centers in different decades since 1980s and their possible causes were analyzed, and the temporal and spatial variation characters of urban heat island (UHI) were investigated. The location of warming centers migrated from Baoshan to Pudong and then moved toward Songjiang and Nanhui. The shifting of the location of the warming center mainly depends on the growth of metropolitan construction land area and population density. The intensity of UHI displayed three stages successively: slow growth stage (1961-1986) with a growth rate of 0.13 degrees C/10a, rapid growth (1987-2204) stage with a growth rate of 0.60 degrees C/10a, and obvious deceleration stage (2005-2017) with a decline rate 0.43 degrees C/10a. In the past 57 years, the intensity of UHI in the nighttime was 0.4 degrees C greater than that of the daytime. With the accelerating process of urbanization, the UHI in Shanghai gradually expanded from the urban areas to the surrounding suburbs and even began to expand radially toward the southwest of the rural regions in the 21st century. The results can provide references for urban heatwave prediction and mitigation of the UHI effect in Shanghai.

TI  - Assessment of natural and anthropogenic aerosol air pollution in the Middle East using MERRA-2, CAMS data assimilation products, and high-resolution WRF-Chem model simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications v.2 (MERRA-2), Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Operational Analysis (CAMS-OA), and a high-resolution regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) were used to evaluate natural and anthropogenic particulate matter (PM) air pollution in the Middle East (ME) during 2015-2016. Two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals - combined product Deep Blue and Deep Target (MODIS-DB&DT) and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) - and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations as well as in situ PM measurements for 2016 were used for validation of the WRF-Chem output and both assimilation products.MERRA-2 and CAMS-OA assimilate AOD observations. WRF-Chem is a free-running model, but dust emission in WRF-Chem is tuned to fit AOD and aerosol volume size distributions obtained from AERONET. MERRA-2 was used to construct WRF-Chem initial and boundary conditions both for meteorology and chemical and aerosol species. SO2 emissions in WRF-Chem are based on the novel OMI-HTAP SO2 emission dataset.The correlation with the AERONET AOD is highest for MERRA-2 (0.72-0.91), MAIAC (0.63-0.96), and CAMS-OA (0.65-0.87), followed by MODIS-DB&DT (0.56-0.84) and WRF-Chem (0.43-0.85). However, CAMS-OA has a relatively high positive mean bias with respect to AERONET AOD. The spatial distributions of seasonally averaged AODs from WRF-Chem, assimilation products, and MAIAC are well correlated with MODIS-DB&DT AOD product. MAIAC has the highest correlation (R = 0.8), followed by MERRA-2 (R = 0.66), CAMS-OA (R = 0.65), and WRFChem (R = 0.61). WRF-Chem, MERRA-2, and MAIAC underestimate and CAMS-OA overestimates MODIS-DB&DT AOD.The simulated and observed PM concentrations might differ by a factor of 2 because it is more challenging for the model and the assimilation products to reproduce PM concentration measured within the city. Although aerosol fields in WRF-Chem and assimilation products are entirely consistent, WRF-Chem is preferable for analysis of regional air quality over the ME due to its higher spatial resolution and better SO2 emissions. The WRF-Chem' s PM background concentrations exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines over the entire ME. Mineral dust is the major contributor to PM (approximate to 75 %-95 %) compared to other aerosol types. Near and downwind from the SO2 emission sources, nondust aerosols (primarily sulfate) contribute up to 30 % to PM2.5. The contribution of sea salt to PM in coastal regions can reach 5 %. The contributions of organic matter, black carbon and organic carbon to PM over the Middle East are insignificant. In the major cities over the Arabian Peninsula, the 90th percentile of PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with diameters less than 10 and 2.5 mu m, respectively) daily mean surface concentrations exceed the corresponding Kingdom of Saudi Arabia air quality limits The contribution of the nondust component to PM2.5 is < 25 %, which limits the emission control effect on air quality. The mitigation of the dust effect on air quality requires the development of environment-based approaches like growing tree belts around the cities and enhancing in-city vegetation cover. The WRF-Chem configuration presented in this study could be a prototype of a future air quality forecast system that warns the population against air pollution hazards.

TI  - Identification of Remote Sensing-Based Land Cover Types Combining Nearest-Neighbor Classification and SEaTH Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of spaceborne remote sensing has greatly facilitated the land cover mapping at various spatial scales. Classification accuracy, however, is usually affected by the heterogeneous spectra of different land cover types for medium-low-spatial-resolution images. The study is aimed at improving the classification accuracy at a city scale by proposing a hierarchical classification method. Time-series Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager remote sensing images of 4 years were used as the classified images. A total of six first-class land cover types were determined, namely woodland, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial surface and others. The object-based image analysis was chosen over pixel-based approaches. More specifically, the nearest-neighbor (NN) classification and SEparability and THresholds (SEaTH) algorithm were combined to produce a hierarchical classification method (NN-SEaTH). SEaTH algorithm was first used to extract the wetland after performing image segmentation in eCognition Developer. Then, the non-wetland was further classified to vegetation and non-vegetation by using a normalized difference vegetation index image. Finally, the other types were then obtained using the NN classification. To validate the proposed method, the NN classifier and NN-SEaTH method were compared. The proposed technique is shown to increase the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (k) for the 4 years. The OA andkare, respectively, 96.46% and 0.9231, 96.63% and 0.9269, 96.88% and 0.9394, 95.22% and 0.9239 that are much larger than 88.13% and 0.7503, 88.83% and 0.7660, 88.64% and 0.7630, 87.33% and 0.7371 derived from the NN approach. The study provides a reference for medium-resolution-based land cover mapping by a hierarchical classification.

TI  - Urban Sprawl Evaluation Using Landscape Metrics and Black-and-White Hypothesis (Case Study: Urmia City)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing population growth has caused a phenomenon called urban sprawl in most cities in the world. Urban sprawl has imposed adverse economic and environmental impacts on cities. Therefore, study, measurement and recognition of this phenomenon are essential. The purpose of this study is the identification and measurement of urban sprawl intensity in the Urmia city (capital of West Azerbaijan Province of Iran). It causes urban planners and managers to better plan for the future growth of the Urmia and achieve sustainable urban development with greater awareness and understanding. The present research is a theoretical-applied research purpose and is descriptive-analytic in terms of research nature. Several methods have been used for measuring urban sprawl. Nowadays, landscape metrics and spatial data are widely used worldwide because they detected urban sprawl with great detail and accuracy. Thus, in the present research, in order to measure urban sprawl in Urmia city, the black-and-white hypothesis and satellite imagery and integration of these data with landscape metrics have been used for the first time in Iran. In this regard, satellite images of 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 were collected with the help of Landsat satellite. These images were classified using an artificial neural network in two classes: built and non-built. Then the detection of changes was done using ENVI 5.3 software and also using landscape metrics (fractal dimension index, largest patch index, contiguity index, number of patches index and shape index) by Fragstats 4.2 software in order to measure urban sprawl in Urmia city. The results of this study indicate that urban sprawl in Urmia during the period of 1991-2011 had a decreasing rate and from then until now has been increasing and it will be continued.

TI  - Accumulation of organic matter in a mesotidal Mediterranean lagoon (Boughrara, Tunisia)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the frame of the COZOMED project, concentrations of organic matter (TOC, DOC, POC) were monitored during two seasonal field campaigns (autumn, October 2016 and spring, April 2017) in the Boughrara Lagon, Tunisia. Results indicate strong influence of the seawater exchange and circulation, on the organic matter accumulation inside the lagoon, visible through a significant correlation between TOC and salinity in both seasons. Two times higher concentration of TOC (up to 5.5 mg/l) was recorded in autumn, when high salinity water (46 ps mu) was present in the lagoon. POC made a relatively small percentage of TOC in autumn samples when high accumulation of TOC, especially its DOC fraction can be related to remineralization processes and zooplankton-mediated release of DOC. Indeed, PCA analysis identified DOC as the most significant factor influencing the observed variability in autumn samples, and correlated to NH4+ thorn (p < 0.05) in surface waters, while POC was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to chlorophyll a. During spring, organic matter in the lagoon was depth-dependent and under the high influence of salinity and temperature, and in the surface correlated to NO3-. Satellite data on lagoon water optical properties appear to support changes in measured organic matter concentrations indicating different optical properties of the water inside the lagoon during spring and autumn seasons. The ocean color remote sensing, with properly validated and tested robust algorithms, accommodating optically shallow waters, can provide valuable tools for monitoring and timely detection of possibly detrimental changes inside the lagoon.

TI  - Cloud/haze detection in airborne videos using a convolutional neural network
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In airborne videos surveillance, moving object detection and target tracking are the key steps. However, under bad weather conditions, the presence of clouds and haze or even smoke coming from buildings can make the processing of these videos very challenging. Current cloud detection or classification methods only consider a single image. Moreover, the images they use are often captured by satellites or planes at high altitudes with very long ranges to clouds, which can help distinguish cloudy regions from non-cloudy ones. In this paper, a new approach for cloud and haze detection is proposed by exploiting both spatial and temporal information in airborne videos. In this method, several consecutive frames are divided into patches. Then, consecutive patches are collected as patch sets and fed into a deep convolutional neural network. The network is trained to learn the appearance of clouds as well as their motion characteristics. Therefore, instead of relying on single frame patches, the decision on a patch in the current frame is made based on patches from previous and subsequent consecutive frames. This approach, avoids discarding the temporal information about clouds in videos, which may contain important cues for discriminating between cloudy and non-cloudy regions. Experimental results show that using temporal information besides the spatial characteristics of haze and clouds can greatly increase detection accuracy.

TI  - NIGHT LIGHTS IN ECONOMICS: SOURCES AND USES<SUP>1</SUP>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Night lights, as detected by satellites, are increasingly used by economists, typically as a proxy for economic activity. The growing popularity of these data reflects either the absence, or the presumed inaccuracy, of more conventional economic statistics, like national or regional GDP. Further growth in use of night lights is likely, as they have been included in theAidDatageoquery tool for providing subnational data, and in geographic data that the Demographic and Health Survey links to anonymized survey enumeration areas. Yet, this ease of obtaining night lights data may lead to inappropriate use, if users fail to recognize that most of the satellites providing these data were not designed to assist economists, and have features that may threaten validity of analyses based on these data, especially for temporal comparisons, and for small and rural areas. In this paper, we review sources of satellite data on night lights, discuss issues with these data, and survey some of their uses in economics.

TI  - Generating annual estimates of forest fire disturbance in Canada: the National Burned Area Composite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining burned area in Canada across fire management agencies is challenging because of different mapping scales and methods. The inconsistent removal of unburned islands and water features from within burned polygon perimeters further complicates the problem. To improve the determination of burned area, the Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation and the Canadian Forest Service developed the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC). The primary data sources for this tool are an automated system to derive fire polygons from 30-m Landsat imagery (Multi-Acquisition Fire Mapping System) and high-quality agency polygons delineated from imagery with spatial resolution <= 30 m. For fires not mapped by these sources, the Hotspot and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Differencing Synergy method was used with 250-1000-m satellite data. From 2004 to 2016, the National Burned Area Composite reported an average of 2.26 Mha burned annually, with considerable interannual variability. Independent assessment of Multi-Acquisition Fire Mapping System polygons achieved an average accuracy of 96% relative to burned-area data with high spatial resolution. Confidence intervals for national area burned statistics averaged +/- 4.3%, suggesting that NBAC contributes relatively little uncertainty to current estimates of the carbon balance of Canada's forests.

TI  - Extraction of Four Types of Urban Ground Objects Based on a Newly Created WorldView-2 Multi-colour Spectral Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate extraction of urban ground objects can ensure timely urban environmental monitoring. However, the current technology used to extract urban ground objects has many steps, slow speed and low practicality. In view of the shortcomings of current research, this study takes WorldView-2 as an example, collects typical image categories of urban imagery, conducts spectral curve fitting and characteristic analysis, uses a combination of the addition, subtraction and multiplication operations in some key bands to enhance the information of the target objects and constructs some spectral indices that are beneficial to the extraction of urban red, white, blue and cyan ground objects using the threshold method. The newly created spectral indices can effectively extract four colours of urban ground objects. Among them, the red and blue ground objects have good extraction results, whereas the white and cyan ground objects have poor extraction results. Results show that the new spectral index threshold method can rapidly extract the target ground objects in urban images by colour, which has good practicability.

TI  - Prognostic significance of acral lentiginous histologic type in T1 melanoma
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a rare type of cutaneous melanoma with a poor prognosis. It is unclear whether the poor outcome of ALM is due to its inherent disease characteristics or advanced stage at initial diagnosis. To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic factors of 828 thin (T1; Breslow thickness <= 1.0 mm) melanomas [129 (15.6%) ALMs and 699 (84.4%) non-ALMs] and their nodal and distance metastases and local recurrence rates and determined their relationship with the disease-specific (DSS), overall (OS), and recurrence-free survivals (RFS) at the pathologic stages T1, T1a, and T1b with a median follow-up time of 84.5 months. With the exception of OS at T1b stage, ALM patients showed significantly lower 5- and 10-year DSS, OS, and RFS rates at every pathologic stage when compared with non-ALM. In multivariable analysis, ALM histologic type, SLN positivity, age, and the use of systemic therapy were detected as independent poor prognostic factors associated with significantly lower survival rates. ALM histologic type was associated with lower DSS and OS rates at T1 and T1a stages and lower RFS rates at T1b stage. SLN positivity was associated with lower DSS, OS, and RFS rates at T1, T1a, and T1b stages. Age was associated with lower OS rates at T1 and T1b stages. Whereas the use of systemic therapy was associated with lower DSS rates at T1a stage and RFS rates at T1b stage. In addition, the ALM group showed significantly older median age patients and higher rates of female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, nevoid cytology, non-brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, nodal metastasis, and local recurrence at every pathologic stage of thin melanoma. Our findings suggest that ALM is inherently more aggressive than other types of cutaneous melanoma. This information may be useful for prognostic stratification of patients with thin melanomas, especially to help guide the clinical decision-making for SLN biopsy and patients entering clinical trials.

TI  - Estimating Grassland Parameters from Sentinel-2: A Model Comparison Study
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland plays an important role in German agriculture. The interplay of ecological processes in grasslands secures important ecosystem functions and, thus, ultimately contributes to essential ecosystem services. To sustain, e.g., the provision of fodder or the filter function of soils, agricultural management needs to adapt to site-specific grassland characteristics. Spatially explicit information derived from remote sensing data has been proven instrumental for achieving this. In this study, we analyze the potential of Sentinel-2 data for deriving grassland-relevant parameters. We compare two well-established methods to calculate the aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), first using a random forest regression and second using the soil-leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Field data were recorded on a grassland area in Brandenburg in August 2019, and were used to train the empirical model and to validate both models. Results confirm that both methods are suitable for mapping the spatial distribution of LAI and for quantifying aboveground biomass. Uncertainties generally increased with higher biomass and LAI values in the empirical model and varied on average by a relative RMSE of 11% for modeling of dry biomass and a relative RMSE of 23% for LAI. Similar estimates were achieved using SLC with a relative RMSE of 30% for LAI retrieval, and a relative RMSE of 47% for the estimation of dry biomass. Resulting maps from both approaches showed comprehensible spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass distributions. Despite variations in the value ranges of both maps, the average estimates and spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass were very similar. Based on the results of the two compared modeling approaches and the comparison to the validation data, we conclude that the relationship between Sentinel-2 spectra and grassland-relevant variables can be quantified to map their spatial distributions from space. Future research needs to investigate how similar approaches perform across different grassland types, seasons and grassland management regimes.

TI  - Understanding the spring phenology of Arctic tundra using multiple satellite data products and ground observations
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is highly sensitive to climate change, and the rise in its near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice the global average. The increased growth of the Arctic tundra and its changing seasonality have been observed, largely in response to the impacts of climate change. In this study, we investigated the temporal and spatial variations of the start of the growing season (SOS) using various remote sensing indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, and Normalized Difference Snow Index from 2000 to 2018 in Arctic tundra regions. The SOS was derived at 29 sites from ground observations, including CO(2)flux data, phenological images, and field records that were used to validate the SOS from remote sensing indices. Our results revealed that the SOS was delayed by approximately 3.86 days per degree of latitude along the northward latitudinal gradient. From 2000 to 2018, the start of the growing season and the interannual variability differed greatly among tundra types. Although the overall trends were not significant from 2000 to 2018, the start of the growing season in different plant communities was consistently delayed after 2016. High Arctic vegetation, including (1) low wetland complexes (5-10 cm) dominated by sedges, grasses, and mosses, and (2) slightly higher prostrate and hemi-prostrate shrubs (< 15 cm), experienced a delayed start of the growing season. The start of the growing season of Low Arctic vegetation, comprising (1) wetland complexes (10-40 cm) dominated by sedges, grasses, mosses, and dwarf shrubs, (2) moist tundra (20-50 cm) dominated by tussock cottongrass and dwarf shrubs, and (3) transition zones containing tundra and taiga, displayed no obvious trend.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the most important challenges facing watersheds. In this study, the effects of climate change in the Karkheh River Basin (KRB), located in the Iranian plateau, have been investigated. The temperature and precipitation, as significant climatic parameters, have been investigated using the observed data (1980-2017), as a baseline period, and the projected data (2020-2090) which can be regarded as the output of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) model based on RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios. The status of the snow cover changes was evaluated using MODIS TERRA satellite sensors. The results show that there has been a downward trend in the precipitation amount in most of the KRB, at 95% confidence level. The projected results also show that the amount of annual precipitation will decrease with the deviation from the baseline period. According to RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios, the amount of annual precipitation will decrease by 88.2 and 56.1 mm, respectively, as compared with the baseline period. Moreover, the air temperature trend in the future period will be increased by deviation from the baseline period. Thus, by the end of this century and according to RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios, the minimum temperatures will rise by 4.5 and 2.5 degrees C, respectively. Evaluation of the snow cover status of the study area, based on the MODIS sensor over the last two decades, shows that the amount of snow covers has been decreasing, reflecting global warming in recent years. Therefore, long-term planning and water resources management, considering the climate change condition, are considered significant in this basin.

TI  - Estimation of High-Resolution Global Monthly Ocean Latent Heat Flux from MODIS SST Product and AMSR-E Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of satellite-derived ocean latent heat flux (LHF) at high spatial resolution remains a major challenge. Here, we estimate monthly ocean LHF at 4 km spatial resolution over 5 years using bulk algorithm COARE 3.0, driven by satellite data and meteorological variables from reanalysis. We validated the estimated ocean LHF by multiyear observations and by comparison with seven ocean LHF products. Validation results from monthly observations at 96 widely distributed buoy sites from three buoy site arrays (TAO, PIRATA, and RAMA) indicated a bias of less than 7 W/m(2) with R-2 of more than 0.80 (p < 0.01) and with a King-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of over 0.84. Our estimated ocean LHF also performs well in simulating annual variability and predicting between-site variability, as indicated by a bias of lower than 6 W/m(2) and an R-2 of more than 0.84 (p < 0.01). Overall, the average KGE for estimated ocean LHF increased by 18%-23% compared to other LHF products, indicating robust LHF estimation performance. Importantly, our estimated annual ocean LHF has similar global spatial distribution compared to other LHF products, although there are general differences in LHF values due to the difference in the models and the spatial resolution.

TI  - Primary Productivity Determinants of Different Land Uses in Humid Subtropical Ecosystems: From Native Forests to Tree Plantations
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes in forest ecosystems may alter the amount of carbon sequestration. The main objective of this study was to characterize the impact of different land-use practices on structure and functioning of humid subtropical forests that are under severe threat. We emphasize the characterization of canopy photosynthetic activity, assessed by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), using a combination of ground base measurements and remote sensing data on native well-preserved forests, impacted forests by selective logging and pine plantations in NE Argentina. Even though selective timber extraction resulted in a substantial decrease in stand's tree density, EVI values were as high as those from preserved forests. In these forests, an increase in the understory cover appears to compensate the response of stand's EVI to timber extraction. Removal of canopy trees enhances incoming solar radiation, allowing active growth of understory vegetation. The pine plantations exhibited the lowest values of LAI, fPAR and EVI. However, when EVI was normalized by LAI, the pine plantations exhibited the highest EVI/LAI values. Our results suggest that after 15 years of forest recovery from selective timber extraction, photosynthetic capacity was similar to that of preserved forests. Increases in the understory cover may compensate the potential decrease in the canopy photosynthetic activity. Pine plantations resulted in substantially lower productivity as depicted by lower EVI and LAI but exhibited higher growth efficiency than native forests.

TI  - Discovery of new colonies by Sentinel2 reveals good and bad news for emperor penguins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of emperor penguins is circumpolar, with 54 colony locations currently reported of which 50 are currently extant as of 2019. Here we report on eight newly discovered colonies and confirm the rediscovery of three breeding sites, only previously reported in the era before Very High Resolution satellite imagery was available, making a total of 61 breeding locations. This represents an increase of similar to 20% in the number of breeding sites, but, as most of the colonies appear to be small, they may only increase the total population by around 5-10%. The discoveries have been facilitated by the use of Sentinel2 satellite imagery, which has a higher resolution and more efficient search mechanism than the Landsat data previously used to search for colonies. The small size of these new colonies indicates that considerations of reproductive output in relation to metabolic rate during huddling is likely to be of interest. Some of the colonies exist in offshore habitats, something not previously reported for emperor penguins. Comparison with recent modelling results show that the geographic locations of all the newly found colonies are in areas likely to be highly vulnerable under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, suggesting that population decreases for the species will be greater than previously thought.

TI  - A novel method to improve vertical accuracy of CARTOSAT DEM using machine learning models
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High quality, accessible Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets play a major role in monitoring the changes in the Earth's surface. This study proposes a novel method to increase the vertical precision of CARTOSAT 10 m DEM by blending it with publicly available SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM using machine learning methods. Machine learning methods such as Genetic Programming (GP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to the SRTM-1 DEM and the CARTOSAT DEM in India to generate DEM of improved vertical accuracy. Quantifiable results show that proposed approach improve the vertical accuracy, considering the reference as Ground control Points (GCPs) elevation from Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) survey data. Significant improvements of 47 and 35% in RMSE are offered by generated DEMs compared to the SRTM-1 and CARTOSAT respectively.

TI  - Drought severity classification based on threshold level method and drought effects on NPP
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Threshold level method is well-known for drought identification with the advantage of its simplicity. However, there is no criterion for classification of drought classes in this method. Therefore, a K index based on threshold level method was proposed and verified to perform well in drought assessment in the Luanhe River basin, China. Meteorological data and remote sensing data were used to calculate the net primary productivity (NPP) of the basin by the CASA model. Results showed that the model had a good performance in comparison with the downloaded yearly remote sensing NPP and monthly PsnNet. The NPP in the basin tended to increase slowly during the year of 2000-2010, and the NPP in the downstream was generally larger than upstream. In three selected representative drought years, drought reduced NPP by about 15-25%, and during the growth season, drought may reduce NPP by about 4.6%, 2.7%, and 1.9% in July, August, and September, respectively, due to reduced precipitation. NPP on grasslands and agricultural land were more susceptible to drought than forests. The result of gray incidence analysis showed that the effects of drought on NPP had a certain delay with about 5 months.

TI  - Automated detection of archaeological mounds using machine-learning classification of multisensor and multitemporal satellite data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan). The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km(2). The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small (<5 ha) to large mounds (>30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.

TI  - Integrating land development size, pattern, and density to identify urban-rural fringe in a metropolitan region
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Located between urban area and rural area, urban-rural fringe is challenged with urbanization related social-ecological problems. Accurately identifying the urban-rural fringe can help to integrated urban-rural development planning, especially in metropolitan region. Among the various case studies to identify the urban-rural fringe, land use degree and impervious surface area are widely used. However, both indexes are only focused on land development size, resulting in coarse identifying results. Objectives It is aimed to propose a three-dimensional approach to integrating land development size, pattern and density, in order to accurately identifying the urban-rural fringe. Methods Landsat TM and DMSP/OLS datasets were used to establish a three-dimensional index system consisting of land development size (LDS), land development pattern (LDP) and land development density (LDD). Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) was applied to identify the urban-rural fringe of Beijing City, China. Results From 2001 to 2009, the inner boundary of the urban-rural fringe had expanded to outside the fifth ring road. Likewise, the outer boundary moved from the fifth to the sixth ring road. The new urban development zone was the main area of urban expansion controlled by urban planning, where the increments of urban-rural fringe was 1273.5 km(2), accounting for 75.24% of the whole city. Partial correlation analysis indicated that LDS played a leading role in SOFM clustering, but the spatial continuity of the urban-rural fringe was the best when it was integrated with LDP and LDD, especially the latter to comprehensively define and quantify land development intensity. Conclusions The integration of land development size, pattern and density is effective to quantify land development intensity, and thus to identify the urban-rural fringe in metropolitan regions.

TI  - Impact assessment of urban development patterns on land surface temperature by using remote sensing techniques: a case study of Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan district
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) is related to the theory of higher atmosphere and surface temperature taking place in the city area as compared to the nearby rural areas. The study results explain the advantages of green spaces in urban areas. Landsat TM/OLI concept of 1998 and 2017 years was attained from USGS for this work. To find out the land-use and land cover pattern supervised classification, the maximum prospect process is adopted. A total of four classes were mapped for the study area which includes built-up, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies. Effective sensor brightness temperature has been acquired from spectral radiance by using Plank's reverse function. On the basis of surface emissivity, Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classes are used to find out the ultimate temperature of the land surface (LST). The maximum temperature was recorded in the built-up area and barren land of the city and minimum temperatures were noted in areas with a greater cover of vegetation. The presence of UHI temperature is obvious from the land surface temperature views. An increase of 2 degrees C in surface temperature is recorded in district Lahore during the last two decades. Rise of 2.2 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C surface temperature has taken place in Faisalabad and Multan Districts in the last 19 years, respectively. In the establishment of a correlation among the LST, built-up, and vegetation, there is a positive sign present in their relation. With the increase in the built-up area, LST does increase as well. Moreover, with the reduction in vegetation cover, the LST is also raised. The study has revealed that there is a need for proper planning for the durable management of urbanization.

TI  - Do surface lateral flows matter for data assimilation of soil moisture observations into hyperresolution land models?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is expected that hyperresolution land modeling substantially innovates the simulation of terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. The major advantage of hyperresolution land models against conventional 1-D land surface models is that hyperresolution land models can explicitly simulate lateral water flows. Despite many efforts on data assimilation of hydrological observations into those hyperresolution land models, how surface water flows driven by local topography matter for data assimilation of soil moisture observations has not been fully clarified. Here I perform two minimalist synthetic experiments where soil moisture observations are assimilated into an integrated surface-groundwater land model by an ensemble Kalman filter. I discuss how differently the ensemble Kalman filter works when surface lateral flows are switched on and off. A horizontal background error covariance provided by overland flows is important for adjusting the unobserved state variables (pressure head and soil moisture) and parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity). However, the non-Gaussianity of the background error provided by the nonlinearity of a topography-driven surface flow harms the performance of data assimilation. It is difficult to efficiently constrain model states at the edge of the area where the topography-driven surface flow reaches by linear-Gaussian filters. It brings the new challenge in land data assimilation for hyperresolution land models. This study highlights the importance of surface lateral flows in hydrological data assimilation.

TI  - Woody cover mapping in the savanna ecosystem of the Kruger National Park using Sentinel-1 C-Band time series data
T2  - KOEDOE
M3  - Article
AB  - The savanna ecosystems in South Africa, which are predominantly characterised by woody vegetation (e.g. shrubs and trees) and grasslands with annual phenological cycles, are shaped by ecosystem processes such as droughts, fires and herbivory interacting with management actions. Therefore, monitoring of the intra- and inter-annual vegetation structure dynamics is one of the essential components for the management of complex savanna ecosystems such as the Kruger National Park (KNP). To map the woody cover in the KNP, data from European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar satellite (C-Band vertical-vertical [VV]/vertical-horizontal [VH]) for the years 2016 and 2017, at 10 m spatial resolution and repeated acquisitions every 12 days, were utilised. A high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data set was reclassified to produce woody cover percentages and consequently used for calibration and validation. Woody cover estimation for different spatial resolutions was carried out by fitting a random forest (RF) model. Model accuracy was assessed via spatial cross-validation and revealed an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 22.8% for the product with a spatial resolution of 10 m and improved with spatial averaging to 15.8% for 30 m, 14.8% for 50 m and 13.4% for 100 m. In addition, the product was validated against a second LiDAR data set, confirming the results of the spatial cross-validation of the model. The methodology of this study is designed for savanna vegetation structure mapping based on height estimates by using open-source software and open-access data, to allow for a continuation of woody cover classification and change monitoring in these types of ecosystems.Conservation implications: Information about the state and changes in woody cover are important for park management and conservation efforts. Both increasing (e.g. because of atmospheric carbon fertilisation) and decreasing (e.g. because of elephant impact) woody cover patterns will have cascading effects on other ecosystem processes such as fire and herbivory.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coarse resolution soil moisture (SM) data from NASA SMAP mission have been steadily produced with the expected performance since April 2015. These coarse resolution observations could be downscaled to fine resolution using fine scale observations of SM sensitive quantities from existing satellite sensors. For operational users who need near-real-time (NRT) high resolution SM data, the downscaling approach should be feasible for operational implementation, requiring limited ancillary information and primarily depending on readily available satellite observations. Based on these principles, nine potential candidate downscaling schemes were selected for developing an optimal downscaling strategy. Using remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) observations, the optimal downscaling approach was tested for operational producing a NRT 1 km SM data product from SMAP. Comprehensive assessments on the 1 km SM product were conducted based on agreement statistics with in-situ SM measurements. Statistical results show that the accuracy of the original coarse spatial resolution SMAP SM product can be significantly improved by 8% by the downscaled 1 km SM. With respect to the in-situ measurements, the 1 km SM mapping capability developed here presents a clear advantage over the SMAP/Sentinel SM data product; and it also provides better data availability for users. This study suggests that a NRT 1 km SMAP SM data product could be routinely generated from SMAP at the centre for Satellite Applications and Research of NOAA NESDIS for operational users.

TI  - Freezing and thawing of lakes on the Nelson and King George Islands, Antarctic, using Sentinel 1A synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to analyze the dynamics of freezing and thawing of Antarctic lakes located in ice-free areas on Nelson Island and Fildes Peninsula, where response to changes in air temperature and precipitation rates occur rapidly, during the period from July 2016 to December 2018. In these places, which are difficult to access, remote sensing is an important alternative, especially considering the use of active remote sensors such as the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which has less restriction regarding the presence of clouds over the study area. Three backscatter thresholds were defined (sigma) for the identification of the physical state of the water of the lakes of the study region, applied in Sentinel 1A SAR (S1A) images under Horizontal Horizontal (HH) polarization and Interferometric Wide (IW) imaging mode. These images, along with the air temperature data obtained by the Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) atmospheric reanalysis model, provided the evidence for the interpretation of the freezing and thawing periods of the lakes. The thresholds applied for the definition of the physical state of the lake water were greater than - 14 dB for frozen water, between - 14 and - 17 dB for the surface, with up to 60% of their frozen area, and less than - 17 dB for open water. The temporal analysis revealed that the lakes start to thaw in October, become completely thawed in February, and freeze again in March. Nevertheless, it can be said that the S1A satellite allows a satisfactory identification of the liquid and solid phases of the water in the lakes of the study region.

TI  - Global declines in human-driven mangrove loss
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mangrove loss has been attributed primarily to human activity. Anthropogenic loss hotspots across Southeast Asia and around the world have characterized the ecosystem as highly threatened, though natural processes such as erosion can also play a significant role in forest vulnerability. However, the extent of human and natural threats has not been fully quantified at the global scale. Here, using a Random Forest-based analysis of over one million Landsat images, we present the first 30 m resolution global maps of the drivers of mangrove loss from 2000 to 2016, capturing both human-driven and natural stressors. We estimate that 62% of global losses between 2000 and 2016 resulted from land-use change, primarily through conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Up to 80% of these human-driven losses occurred within six Southeast Asian nations, reflecting the regional emphasis on enhancing aquaculture for export to support economic development. Both anthropogenic and natural losses declined between 2000 and 2016, though slower declines in natural loss caused an increase in their relative contribution to total global loss area. We attribute the decline in anthropogenic losses to the regionally dependent combination of increased emphasis on conservation efforts and a lack of remaining mangroves viable for conversion. While efforts to restore and protect mangroves appear to be effective over decadal timescales, the emergence of natural drivers of loss presents an immediate challenge for coastal adaptation. We anticipate that our results will inform decision-making within conservation and restoration initiatives by providing a locally relevant understanding of the causes of mangrove loss.

TI  - The state of rock debris covering Earth's glaciers
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock debris can accumulate on glacier surfaces and dramatically reduce glacier melt. The structure of a debris cover is unique to each glacier and sensitive to climate. Despite this, debris cover has been omitted from global glacier models and forecasts of their response to a changing climate. Fundamental to resolving these omissions is a global map of debris cover and an estimate of its future spatial evolution. Here we use Landsat imagery and a detailed correction to the Randolph Glacier Inventory to show that 7.3% of mountain glacier area is debris covered and over half of Earth's debris is concentrated in three regions: Alaska (38.6% of total debris-covered area), Southwest Asia (12.6%) and Greenland (12.0%). We use a set of new metrics, which include stage, the current position of a glacier on its trajectory towards reaching its spatial carrying capacity of debris cover, to quantify the state of glaciers. Debris cover is present on 44% of Earth's glaciers and prominent (>1.0 km(2)) on 15%. Of Earth's glaciers, 20% have a substantial percentage of debris cover for which the net stage is 36% and the bulk of individual glaciers have evolved beyond an optimal moraine configuration favourable for debris-cover expansion. Use of this dataset in global-scale models will enable improved estimates of melt over 10.6% of the global glacier domain.A global map of rock-debris cover on mountain glaciers shows its spatial distribution and evolution.

TI  - Aggressive Digital Papillary Adenocarcinoma Mimicking a Giant Cell Tumour - A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPAca) is a rare, underreported, and often misdiagnosed malignant tumour of the eccrine sweat gland, with high recurrence and metastatic potential. We present a case of a painless mass over the middle phalanx of the dominant index finger in a 51-year-old man. The mass was present for over 20 years, which had slowly increased in size. The patient only presented when it began to interfere with his profession as an electrician. The clinical presentation was consistent with a giant cell tumour. Histological diagnosis was of an ADPAca. Staging investigations were negative and he subsequently went on to have a ray amputation. The importance of high clinical suspicion of digit lesions is highlighted. No specific histologic features have been identified to predict recurrence or metastasis. We review the merits of performing sentinel node biopsy and alternative treatment options such as Moh's micrographic surgery. We review the international literature to assess metastatic potential and follow-up requirements.

TI  - Serological Evidence of West Nile Virus Infection in White-Tailed Deer in Central Texas
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - White-tailed deer (WTD) are abundant mammals widely distributed across the United States. As a result, WTD are considered to be excellent sentinels for detecting arboviral activity in certain geographic areas. Evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) antibody in WTD has been reported previously in several states. However, WNV infection in WTD has not been reported from Texas, where the incidence of human West Nile (WN) cases is among the highest in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of WNV antibody in WTD in central Texas. Sera samples (n = 644) were collected from deer during the fall and winter in western Travis County, Texas from 2014 to 2018 and tested for WNV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA antibody-positive samples were further tested for WNV and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) antibodies by an 80% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT80). Overall, 9% (n = 58) and 0.31% (n = 2) of the deer samples had serological evidence of WNV and SLEV infections, respectively. WNV seroprevalence differed significantly by age (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between sex. Interestingly, 3.1% (n = 20) of the samples were positive for Flavivirus IgG antibody by ELISA, but negative for SLEV and WNV antibodies, suggesting that other Flaviviruses may be circulating among WTD in Texas. Finally, these results supported WNV infection among WTD and highlight their potential role as sentinels for the detection of WNV in Texas and warrant further studies to determine the role WTD play in the maintenance and transmission of WNV.

TI  - Remote sensing of methane leakage from natural gas and petroleum systems revisited
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - ( )The switch from the use of coal to natural gas or oil for energy generation potentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus the impact on global warming and climate change because of the higher energy creation per CO2 molecule emitted. However, the climate benefit over coal is offset by methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas and petroleum systems, which reverses the climate impact mitigation if the rate of fugitive emissions exceeds the compensation point at which the global warming resulting from the leakage and the benefit from the reduction of coal combustion coincide. Consequently, an accurate quantification of CH4 emissions from the oil and gas industry is essential to evaluate the suitability of natural gas and petroleum as bridging fuels on the way to a carbon-neutral future.We show that regional CH4 release from large oil and gas fields can be monitored from space by using dense daily recurrent measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite to quantify emissions and leakage rates. The average emissions for the time period 2018/2019 from the five most productive basins in the United States, the Permian, Appalachian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Anadarko, are estimated to be 3.18 +/- 1.13, 2.36 +/- 0.88, 1.37 +/- 0.63, 0.89 +/- 0.56, and 2.74 +/- 0.74 Mt yr(-1), respectively. This corresponds to CH4 leakage rates relative to the associated production between 1.2 % and 1.4 % for the first four production regions, which are consistent with bottom-up estimates and likely fall below the break-even leakage rate for immediate climate benefit. For the Anadarko Basin, the fugitive emission rate is larger and amounts to 3.9 +/- 1.1 %, which likely exceeds the breakeven rate for immediate benefit and roughly corresponds to the break-even rate for a 20-year time horizon. The deter- mined values are smaller than previously derived satellite-based leakage rates for the time period 2009-2011, which was an early phase of hydraulic fracturing, indicating that it is possible to improve the climate footprint of the oil and gas industry by adopting new technologies and that efforts to reduce methane emissions have been successful. For two of the world's largest natural gas fields, Galkynysh and Dauletabad in Turkmenistan, we find collective methane emissions of 3.26 +/- 1.17 Mt yr(-1), which corresponds to a leakage rate of 4.1 +/- 1.5 %, suggesting that the Turkmen energy industry is not employing methane emission avoidance strategies and technologies as successfully as those currently widely used in the United States. The leakage rates in Turkmenistan and in the Anadarko Basin indicate that there is potential to reduce fugitive methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems worldwide. In particular, relatively newly developed oil and gas plays appear to have larger leakage rates compared to more mature production areas.

TI  - Dendritic cell biology and its role in tumor immunotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As crucial antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) play a vital role in tumor immunotherapy. Taking into account the many recent advances in DC biology, we discuss how DCs (1) recognize pathogenic antigens with pattern recognition receptors through specific phagocytosis and through non-specific micropinocytosis, (2) process antigens into small peptides with proper sizes and sequences, and (3) present MHC-peptides to CD4(+)and CD8(+)T cells to initiate immune responses against invading microbes and aberrant host cells. During anti-tumor immune responses, DC-derived exosomes were discovered to participate in antigen presentation. T cell microvillar dynamics and TCR conformational changes were demonstrated upon DC antigen presentation. Caspase-11-driven hyperactive DCs were recently reported to convert effectors into memory T cells. DCs were also reported to crosstalk with NK cells. Additionally, DCs are the most important sentinel cells for immune surveillance in the tumor microenvironment. Alongside DC biology, we review the latest developments for DC-based tumor immunotherapy in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Personalized DC vaccine-induced T cell immunity, which targets tumor-specific antigens, has been demonstrated to be a promising form of tumor immunotherapy in patients with melanoma. Importantly, allogeneic-IgG-loaded and HLA-restricted neoantigen DC vaccines were discovered to have robust anti-tumor effects in mice. Our comprehensive review of DC biology and its role in tumor immunotherapy aids in the understanding of DCs as the mentors of T cells and as novel tumor immunotherapy cells with immense potential.

TI  - Sentinel-2 based prediction of spruce budworm defoliation using red-edge spectral vegetation indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research compares the capabilities of various Sentinel-2-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) in particular red-edge SVIs to detect and classify spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) (SBW) defoliation using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. The results showed the superiority of RF in model building for defoliation detection and classification into three classes (nil, light, and moderate) with overall errors of 17% and 32%, respectively. The most important variables for the best model were Enhanced Vegetation Index 7 (EVI7), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI), Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index 11 (NDII11) and Modified Simple Ratio (MSR). Red-edge SVIs were more effective variables for light defoliation detection compared to traditional SVIs such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and EVI8. These findings can help improve current remote sensing-based SBW defoliation detection and monitoring.

TI  - Are extreme soil moisture deficits captured by remotely sensed data retrievals?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil moisture (SM) data are key for climate and surface-atmosphere simulations associated with prediction and analysis of weather and climate variability. Here, we assessed in situ vs. remotely sensed SM discrepancies in a humid watershed during an extreme drought and an arid watershed under peak dry-season conditions. Using in situ SM measurements from the Soil and Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) we compared timeseries data with two remotely sensed data sources: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) radiometers. Over a nearly three-year period (31 March, 2015 to 31 December, 2017), SMAP timeseries had a higher correlation with SCAN data (R-2 = 0.24 to 0.75) compared to SMOS estimates (R-2 = 0.04 to 0.68) with lower average RMSE (0.03 vs. 0.19 cm(3) cm(-3)). Possible sources of error were identified related to underlying assumptions in the SM retrieval algorithm, principally that soil and vegetation canopy temperatures are in equilibrium during satellite retrievals and that vegetation scattering and attenuation may be accurately represented when using static, long-term averages of NDVI. We concluded that although SMAP SM retrievals reflect dry periods observed in in situ SM timeseries, the magnitude of extreme conditions were underestimated.

TI  - Land use/land cover change dynamics and their effects on land surface temperature in the western region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the impacts associated with changes in land use and land cover (LULC) over natural processes have received attention. Examining these changes can assist in urban/rural planning activities, temperature change analysis, and environmental monitoring. Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the main physical parameters used to measure the impacts proportioned by LULC changes. Several studies have investigated the implications of LULC changes over LST variations using remote sensing data. However, this dynamic remains unknown in multiple environmentally important areas, like the western region of Sao Paulo state, Brazil, where one last remnant of the Atlantic Forest biome is located. This paper demonstrates that significant LST differences exist in distinct LULC classes. Results indicated that bare soil and pasture areas contribute to increasing LST values, while water bodies and arboreous vegetation attenuate them. As the LULC pattern changes, it reflects on both LST and air temperature. Over a 30-year analysis in the studied area, the LST increased 3.50 degrees C (0.117 degrees C per year). This multi-temporal analysis was based on four winter/autumn periods: 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, using images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper sensor for 1987 to 2007 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor sensors for 2017. A supervised classification was applied to create LULC maps for each period. These findings bring a multi-temporal environmental diagnosis to the region, which is important to optimize future environmental planning actions like the restoration of degraded areas. It is inferred that continuous monitoring of LULC dynamics is required to devise sustainable land use policies in favor of environmental protection and regional economic development.Graphical abstract

TI  - An unambiguous moving target imaging method for maritime surveillance in high-resolution wide-swath mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective method to achieve high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging simultaneously. Many algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct stationary targets. However, moving targets cannot be well reconstructed through traditional reconstruct algorithm for static scenes and the ghost targets of the moving targets will have a great influence on SAR image interpretation, especially in maritime scenes. This paper proposed an unambitious imaging method for moving targets in maritime scenes. Firstly, the slant-range velocity of the moving target is estimated through maximizing the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer output in the image domain. Secondly, the phase introduced by the slant-range velocity is compensated before reconstruction. Finally, the Chirp Scaling (CS) algorithm is used to image the full scene and the moving targets can be refocused separately after image formation. The proposed method has the advantage of estimating the slant-range velocity without search or redundant channels. The performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation experiments and real data of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR sensor.

TI  - Transforming sustainability science for practice: a social-ecological systems framework for training sustainability professionals
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - New applied approaches are needed to address urgent, global environmental issues. Practitioners, scholars, and policy makers alike call for increased integration of natural and social sciences to develop new frameworks for better addressing the range of contemporary environmental issues. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological systems (SES) offers a novel approach for enhancing sustainability science and for improving the practice of environmental management. To translate SES theory into action, education and training programs are needed that focus on the application of SES approaches across the education and professional spectrum, from K-12 to graduate training to agency management. We developed a training framework that serves sustainability practitioners by building their capacity to apply SES approaches to real world problems and decision-making. The framework uses a SES-based environmental management approach based on a systemic worldview, transdisciplinary thinking, co-development of knowledge, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance. The social-ecological systems training and education program (SESTEP or "see-step") framework was designed to provide SES training opportunities as a response to the need expressed by senior directors of US federal land management agencies. The core of the framework is a 12-step SES heuristic that provides a diagnostic tool for practitioners as they work through a SES case-study issue or problem. The curriculum provides adaptable and tailored professional development training for sustainability professionals to enhance sustainability science in practice. The evaluation of the inaugural course indicates achievement of positive course learning outcomes consistent with advancing sustainability science in practice.

TI  - Thrice-belovedBelly of Naples: Nostalgia and privation in George Gissing and Matilde Serao
T2  - LITERATURE COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - During visits to Italy between 1888 and 1890, George Gissing immersed himself in fictions by Matilde Serao, a journalist, editor, and leading practitioner ofverismo(Italian realism), whose stories focused on the travails of the poor of Naples. Partly as a means of practicing his Italian and partly for his own pleasure, Gissing read serial installments of her novelsAddio, Amore!(1890) andIl Paese di Cuccagna(1891). The latter novel, translated into English asThe Land of Cockayne(or, The Land of Milk and Honey) in 1901, dramatized the damage wrought upon Naples' social and economic life by its state lottery. Swept up by lottery fever, locals forfeit their savings, exploit each other for loans, and ruin one another's lives.Cockayneinvites comparisons with Gissing'sThe Whirlpool(1897), which captured a culture preoccupied with precarious financial investments, andIn the Year of Jubilee(1894), which famously satirized the frenzy of the crowd. Yet, upon closer look, these comparisons do not fully hold. Serao's characters are city people, but they are strongly imprinted by a lingering peasant consciousness. Earnest in their domestic roles, these wives and daughters feel none of the troubling temptations of modernity. All of Serao's men and women hold an enduring folk belief in dreams and premonitions, the means by which they choose their lottery numbers. This was likely the source of Gissing's pleasure in the book. While aspects ofCockaynemirror the modernity of his fictions, Serao's Neapolitans evince an older worldview that intrigues him.

TI  - Improving the estimation of soil-available nutrients soil available nutrients estimation at the sub-field scale using time-series UAV observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-available nutrients (SANs)are essential for crop growth and yield formation. Appropriate variable rate fertilization (VRF) can control SAN at a normal level to avoid unnecessary damage to sustainable production capacity. The precondition of optimizing the application of VRF is obtaining the real-time status of SAN. A new method for SAN estimation has been proposed by integrating modified World Food Studies (WOFOST) and time-series satellite remote sensing (RS) data. This method can provide field scale SAN estimations with high accuracy. However, the estimation accuracy at a subfield scale was low for VRF application because of the poor spatial resolution of common satellite imagery. In this letter, the subfield SAN estimations were optimized to ensure the VRF value. Time-series multispectral images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to replace common satellite data, and the SAN values for haplic phaeozem in selected spring maize plot in Hongxing Farm (48 degrees 09MODIFIER LETTER PRIME N, 127 degrees 03MODIFIER LETTER PRIME E) were estimated. Based on the field SAN data, the estimation accuracies using satellite data and UAV data were analyzed. The results show that the UAV data improved SAN estimations at the subfield scale).

TI  - Vulnerability assessment of an aquifer in the basement complex terrain of Nigeria using 'LAHBUD' model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We integrated hydrogeological and hydrogeophysical parameters to evaluate aquifer vulnerability to contamination in a basement complex terrain in Nigeria. Aeromagnetic and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data were used to generate the composite lineament density map. Lithology information was obtained from the existing geological map, while land-use and land-use changes were derived from the Landsat 8 imagery. We also acquired 216 vertical electrical soundings (VES) to estimate the geoelectric parameters including depth to aquifer, hydraulic conductivity, and bedrock relief maps. The information obtained from geoelectric parameters, lithology, lineament density, and land use were used as the parameters in assessing the aquifer vulnerability using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the context of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The assigned weights for the various aquifer vulnerability indices are 0.4569, 0.2482, 0.1469, 0.0775, 0.0402 and 0.0303 respectively for lithology (L), depth to aquifer (A), hydraulic conductivity (H), bedrock relief (B), land-use (U) and lineament density (D). These values were normalized and used in establishing a consistency ratio of 6.94%, which is lower than 10% (recommended limit). The MCDA was used to develop the aquifer vulnerability ('LAHBUD') model which was used to classify the study area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high aquifer vulnerability zones. Geochemical parameters obtained from water samples were used to validate the 'LAHBUD' model, and gave 81% agreement in predicting the risk level of possible contaminant influence with the conceptual model, and thus confirm the reliability of the model adopted for this study.

TI  - What we talk about when we talk about new media: digital subjectivity and Tao Lin's<i>Taipei</i>
T2  - TEXTUAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - New media studies has often focused on the difference between traditional and new media objects while neglecting the perspectival difference in worldview and subjectivity concomitant with the becoming-ubiquitous of the digital. In this paper, I first illustrate with some examples from science fiction the complex relation between difference in kind and difference in degree. This allows me to examine why some well-known demarcations between traditional and new media seem blurry and untenable. There is, however, one line of cleavage that does hold water: the binary of analogue and digital proposed by N. Katherine Hayles. To see why, I compare works of fiction that present media technologies via analogue subjectivity with Tao Lin'sTaipei, a novel that presents lived experience through digital subjectivity, thereby revealing the continuing potential of new media studies for literature.

TI  - FORSAT: a 3D forest monitoring system for cover mapping and volumetric 3D change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A 3D forest monitoring system, called FORSAT (asatellite very high resolution image processing platform forforest assessment), was developed for the extraction of 3D geometric forest information from very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and the automatic 3D change detection. FORSAT is composed of two complementary tasks: (1) the geometric and radiometric processing of satellite optical imagery and digital surface model (DSM) reconstruction by using a precise and robust image matching approach specially designed for VHR satellite imagery, (2) 3D surface comparison for change detection. It allows the users to import DSMs, align them using an advanced 3D surface matching approach and calculate the 3D differences and volume changes (together with precision values) between epochs. FORSAT is a single source and flexible forest information solution, allowing expert and non-expert remote sensing users to monitor forests in three and four (time) dimensions. The geometric resolution and thematic content of VHR optical imagery are sufficient for many forest information needs such as deforestation, clear-cut and fire severity mapping. The capacity and benefits of FORSAT, as a forest information system contributing to the sustainable forest management, have been tested and validated in case studies located in Austria, Switzerland and Spain.

TI  - Monitoring interannual dynamics of desertification in Minqin County, China, using dense Landsat time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Minqin County in northwestern China is highly affected by desertification. Campaigns have been initiated in recent decades to combat desertification in Minqin. To assess the effectiveness of these campaigns, this study used a dense Landsat time series from 1987 to 2017 to investigate the interannual dynamics of vegetation coverage and greenness over the past 31 years. First, this study applied an advanced technology to reconstruct a high-quality Landsat annual time series. Specifically, one image in the vegetation-peak season was selected as the base image in each year, and then problematic pixels were interpolated by the neighborhood similar pixel interpolator using ancillary images in the same year. Second, the land cover map and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were derived from all reconstructed images. Third, the change of vegetation coverage and EVI values over the 31 years were analyzed. The results show that the total vegetation coverage and greenness increased during the 31 years. Linking this change trend to other factors suggests that vegetation in Minqin County is highly affected by agriculture and groundwater supply rather than by climate. To mitigate desertification in a sustainable way, agriculture should be well managed to avoid overconsumption of natural resources such as underground water.

TI  - Use of optical and radar remote sensing satellites for identifying and monitoring active/inactive landforms in the driest desert in Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing Earth from the space is key for monitoring land-surface dynamics and probing near-surface geomorphic and geological features, including those obscured by sand sheets/dunes and human activity. The hyper-arid area of the Arabian Peninsula was selected for detecting and extracting obscure paleohydrological systems and modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of sand dunes using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical high-resolution remote sensing images. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD) using Sentinel-1 imagery was performed, revealing subtle changes in the surficial landforms of the study area. These images also discriminated between active and inactive geomorphic features. In addition, low-frequency L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data revealed the details of paleochannels in the basins that drain into the Arabian Gulf. These ephemeral rivers are the source of sand that was later reshaped into dunes by aeolian processes. The results also revealed that the morphology and extension of dunes were dearly influenced by topography, slope, and wind velocity and direction, rather than human activities. Knowledge gained by exploring desert features is essential for planning settlements and development, and integrated approaches using a variety of remote sensing datasets are key for enhancing Earth observation across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - A comparison between day and night land surface temperatures using acquired satellite thermal infrared data in a winter wheat field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a crucial role in many scientific applications, including climatology, hydrology, ecology, and agriculture. Multiple studies have successfully utilized daytime thermal infrared (TIR) data obtained from satellite platforms to retrieve LST data over agricultural lands for irrigation planning and monitoring plant health status. Yet, to our knowledge, the retrieval of nighttime LST over agricultural lands has not been investigated using high-resolution satellite TIR data. This study aims to examine the spatial variation of LST over a winter wheat crop field by using day and night-acquired satellite TIR data from Landsat-8 and ASTER L1T, respectively. In parallel with the LST data, we calculated spectral indices related to vegetation health and greenness (NDVI) and water-related indices (NDWI) from multi-source satellite platforms (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). Also, we calculated canopy biophysical and biochemical properties such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy water content (CWC) from Sentinel-2 data. We assessed which spectral indices and canopy properties have a strong correlation with LST during the day and night using the Pearson correlation coefficient and ANOVA analysis. Results demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) between day and night LST over the winter wheat field. We also found that calculated spectral indices have a weak negative correlation with the daytime LST and a moderate positive relationship with the night LST, particularly the water-related index (NDWI) and canopy biophysical and biochemical properties (LAI and CWC). The results of this study demonstrate the enormous potential of night satellite TIR data in retrieving LST data, with positive implications for agricultural practices, particularly for irrigation and plant health monitoring.

TI  - Detection of unregistered electric distribution transformers in agricultural fields with the aid of Sentinel-1 SAR images by machine learning approaches
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Electric Distribution Transformers (EDTs) are used in many areas for converting the voltage used in the transmission lines to a suitable voltage. One of the specific use areas of EDTs is to provide irrigation of agricultural areas. However, there is a great difficulty in detection of unregistered EDTs in these fields. The illegal usage of them damages the electric distribution companies and cause serious damages by disrupting the electricity grid system. To overcome these problems, Sentinel-1 SAR images give good results when used together with machine learning approaches. This work was carried out on agricultural lands in Diyarbakir province, Turkey and it consists of several stages. In first place, GPS coordinates of 178 sample points were recorded and 32 Sentinel-1 SAR images were obtained between March-May & 2016-2018. In the second phase, backscattering coefficients in different polarizations were generated for each point in these dates. The features obtained from 32 Sentinel-1 SAR images were then added successively and a feature vector with a total length of 64 was produced for each sample point. After that, different machine learning techniques [Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes Algorithm (NBA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)] were applied to the obtained datasets and ELM was determined as best machine learning approach. A machine learning based feature selection (ELM-FS) method was then applied to all feature vectors and the most relevant features were determined according to their impact values. In the last stage, feature sets obtained from ELM-FS method were used separately as inputs of ELM technique and the unregistered EDTs were successfully detected with 85.47% mean accuracy.

TI  - Impairing Land Registry: Social, Demographic, and Economic Determinants of Forest Classification Errors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the social, demographic, and economic factors determining differences between forest identification based on remote sensing techniques and land registry. The Database of Topographic Objects and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data from 2018 were used to train a forest detection supervised machine learning model. Results aggregated to communes (NUTS-5 units) were compared to data from land registry delivered in Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland. The differences identified between above mentioned sources were defined as errors of land registry. Then, geographically weighted regression was applied to explain spatially varying impact of investigated errors' determinants: Urbanization processes, civic society development, education, land ownership, and culture and quality of spatial planning. The research area covers the entirety of Poland. It was confirmed that in less developed areas, local development policy stimulating urbanization processes does not respect land use planning principles, including the accuracy of land registry. A high education level of the society leads to protective measures before the further increase of the investigated forest cover's overestimation of the land registry in substantially urbanized areas. Finally, higher coverage by valid local spatial development plans stimulate protection against forest classification errors in the land registry.

TI  - Human-induced land degradation dominance in the Nigerian Guinea Savannah between 2003 - 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation poses a persistent challenge to ecosystems and sustainable livelihoods in the Nigerian Guinea Savannah (NGS). While both human activity and climate variability have been implicated as degradation drivers, the lack of research fuels dispute over the causes and status of land degradation in the Savannah. Detailed evidence on the contributions of both rainfall and human activities can, however, help identify appropriate measures to address land degradation. MODIS vegetation "greenness" and TAMSAT rainfall data were employed to achieve the following objectives: (i) provide empirical insights on the pattern of savannah vegetation dynamics; (ii) control for rainfall effects in Savannah degradation; and (iii) characterize the extent, severity and geography of human-induced land degradation. The selected statistical techniques proved useful for highlighting the spatio-temporal dynamics of degradation in the NGS. Controlling for the effect of rainfall on vegetation greenness produces a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) residual that allows to us estimate the human impact on land degradation. Despite no indication of a worsening rainfall regime, inter-annual variation in vegetation greenness exhibits a consistently negative, declining trend. This continuous, negative, declining trend in the NDVI residual strongly suggests ongoing biomass loss in the NGS is the result of unsustainable human activity. Observed improvement is attributable to existing land management programmes (afforestation and the planting of drought tolerant species) initiated by states in the zone. In sum, approximately 38% of the NGS land area, including protected areas such as Kainji Lake National Park, are becoming more degraded, while 14% and 48% of the remaining area shows either improvement or no real change, respectively. These results serve as a baseline information resource for tracking future land use activities, land degradation and potential pathways for achieving more sustainable land management.

TI  - Effect of land cover composition and building configuration on land surface temperature in an urban-sprawl city, case study in Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Thailand
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bangkok Metropolitan Area is an example of urban sprawl that has undergone rapid expansion and major changes in urban composition and building configuration. This city is now faced with the urban heat island phenomenon. Initial observations of land surface temperature (LST) in recent years have indicated that LST has tended to increase in both urban and suburban areas. The purposes of this study were to: (1) assess different land cover types and combinations of land cover composition along an LST gradient, and (2) investigate effect of building configuration types on the LST in densely urban areas. We analyzed the urban composition variation of 4,960 land cover samples using a 500 m x 500 m grid and configuration metrics in spatial patterns from Landsat 8 data and a high-resolution database of buildings obtained from GIS data of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The results indicated that the fraction of land cover composition was strongly related to LST. Our results suggested that LST can be effectively mitigated by using below green (shrubs, grasses, and yards), above green (trees, orchards, mangroves, and perennial plants) and water land cover. By increasing tree canopy to around 20%, water body to around 30% or green yard/shrub to around 40% of the built-up areas, it is possible to reduce LST significantly. Urban configurations (edge density, patch density, large patch, mean patch size, building height, compactness of building, building type, and building use) affecting on LST were studied. Increased edge density, patch density of buildings, and building height caused reductions in LST. Distribution of LST patterns can be significantly related with urban composition or land configuration features. The results of this study can increase understanding of the interaction between urban composition and configuration metrics. Moreover, our findings may be useful in the mitigation of the impact of LST in urban-sprawl cities.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the parameters in water quality is total suspended solids (TSS). TSS consists of mud and microorganisms caused by erosion of soil flowed into water bodies. This study aimed to detect suspended sediments in Bekasi coastal water by comparing empirical and semi-analytic models. Landsat 8 was used for analysis of suspended solids using the Google Earth Engine platform. The workflow of this study consisted of land masking by area delineation using surface reflectance image data, TSS analysis, and visualization. Then validation was done with in situ data, model selection and time series implementation. TSS detection results were displayed with a different color display according to the concentration. Validation test results with in situ data showed that the value of the Semi-Analytical Absolute Error (NMAE) model was closer to the minimum requirement of 66.8%, far different from the empirical model of 43768%. The value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also showed that the semi-analytic model produced a much smaller value of 51.4 and the empirical model of 58577.2. This showed that the semi-analytic model has a better value in detecting the distribution of TSS. Time series analysis showed that the distribution of MPT in 2015-2019 in coastal waters had a very high TSS distribution, due to the number of ponds and river estuaries. Therefore, semi-analytical model was more recommended for estimating TSS concentrations than empirical model.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of Indocyanine Green Plus Methylene Blue Versus Radioisotope Plus Methylene Blue Dye Method for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Node-Negative Early Breast Cancer
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by dual-dye method (radioisotope plus blue) is the gold standard for axillary staging in patients with breast cancer, but in developing countries, logistic issues and financial constraint play a vital role. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) has emerged as an alternative to radioisotope (technetium-99 [Tc-99]) for SLNB in breast cancer. This study compared the diagnostic performance of Tc-99 plus methylene blue (MB) dye versus ICG + MB dye SLNB.METHODS Two hundred seven patients with early breast cancer (T1-3N0) were included in the study from 2017 to 2019. SLNB was done either with Tc-99 + MB or with ICG + MB as per availability of radioisotope. SLN identification rate (IR), SLN positivity rate, and metastatic SLN counts were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS IR was 199 (96%) of 207. IR was 95% in Tc-99 + MB compared with 97% with ICG + MB. The mean number of SLNs identified were 3.17 (standard deviation [SD], 1.84), with > 1 SLN identified in 87% patients by Tc-99 + MB. SLN was positive in 31.3% of patients with a metastatic SLN count of 0.37 (SD, 0.76). With ICG + MB, the number of SLNs was 2.73 (SD, 1.55), with > 1 SLN identified in 79% of patients. Twenty-eight percent of patients had positive SLNs, with a metastatic SLN count of 0.41 (SD, 0.77). A sharp decline in the availability of Tc-99 was observed, with 58% of patients in 2014 and only 12% of patients in 2018.CONCLUSION ICG is equivalent to Tc-99 for SLNB in early breast cancer and has a good potential to be adopted by surgeons in resource-constrained setups.

AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) mapping has immerged as a useful and important Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technique for improving the management of natural resources for the progress of a country like Pakistan. Therefore, a research study was conducted to develop LULC maps for the District of Multan, Pakistan. For this purpose, economically available multi temporal (time series) images with acceptable resolution from satellite (LANDSAT 7 ETM+) were obtained for Rabi and Kharif season of 2011-12 to perform supervised classification and identification of crops in the study area. Image Processing was performed in ERDAS Imagine 2011 version for obtaining the high-class time series normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) for each LANDSAT 7 imagery. Four classes were targeted for crops out of the seven clusters created using target crop signatures with 95% maximum likely-hood. The resulting crop types were validated by 86 ground truthing points. Over all 74 % efficiency was found using error matrix technique. The regional irrigation water requirements of specific crops were estimated using the generated LULC maps of exerted crop area. The calculated cropped areas through ArcGIS 9.3 version were of 0.226 Mha for cotton, 0.207 Mha for wheat, 0.014 Mha for rice and 0.007 Mha for sugarcane. The total regional crop water requirement of the study area was of 1653.62 Mm(3) for cotton, 911.25 Mm(3) for wheat, 97.93 Mm(3) for rice and 112.25 Mm(3) for sugarcane. The LULC mapping technique should be used to develop a decision support system for water, land and other natural resources at scale for efficient resource utilization and sustainable development.

M3  - Article
AB  - An approach engaging Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and remote sensing data was carried out with a view to developing groundwater potential and aquifer vulnerability maps of the study area. One hundred and one (101) depth sounding data were acquired using Schlumberger array, with half maximum current electrode separation (AB/2) of 100 m. The VES were quantitatively interpreted using partial curve matching and computer aided iteration to determine the geoelectrical parameters of each station. The remote sensing data were processed using the application of Geographic Information System-based multi-criteria technique ArcGIS software. Eight (8) parameters namely lineament density, drainage density, slope, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, coefficient of anisotropy, aquifer thickness and resistivity were used to produce the groundwater potential model while five (5) parameters namely, lineament density, slope, longitudinal conductance, hydraulic conductivity and thickness of layer overlying the delineated aquifer were also used to produce the vulnerability model. The final output of overlay parameters for estimating the groundwater potential gave an index that ranged from 1-5. The zone categorised as low groundwater potential covered about 80% of the area. The majority of the area falls within low (about 80%) vulnerability and low groundwater potential rating while being relatively protected from potential contaminants infiltrating from the surface. The prediction accuracy of the groundwater potential model was established via existing hand-dug well correlation analysis.

TI  - InSAR Time-Series Analysis for Monitoring Ground Displacement Trends in the Western Hellenic Arc: The Kythira Island, Greece
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Kythira Island is situated at the western Hellenic Arc, which is a region of very high seismicity and tectonic activity. On 8 January 2006, a large seismic event of M-w= 6.7 occurred close to Kythira, in association with the Hellenic subduction zone. We present an extensive multi-temporal interferometry study of ground displacements in Kythira Island exploiting SAR data of a decade, from 2003 to 2009, and from 2015 to 2019. The line-of-sight displacement field for the 2003-2009 time period presents small-scale displacements that do not exceed -3 mm/y, identified to the East of Kythira's airport, and 3 mm/y in the central part of the island. We exploit then Sentinel-1 data from 2015 to 2019, of both descending and ascending Sentinel-1 SAR imaging modes to decompose the line-of-sight measured deformation to vertical and east-west motion components. Higher vertical displacement rates characterize the central part of the island, with a maximum value of 5 mm/y. This short-term uplift rate exceeds by an order of magnitude the long-term geologic uplift rate of similar to 0.13 mm/y found in the island during the Quaternary. We discuss possible regional geophysical explanations for this discrepancy. Strike-slip components are detected in the N-E coast of the Potamos village, where horizontal displacements occur, with an east-ward trend and a maximum value of -3 mm/y. These insights are valuable input for the systematic monitoring of this high seismic risk island and the dynamic assessment of its hazard potential.

More importantly, crop biomass estimations by components are essential for crop growth monitoring as the yield formation of crops results from the accumulation and transportation of substances between different organs. Retrieval of crop biomass from synthetic aperture radar SAR or optical imagery is of paramount importance for in-season monitoring of crop growth. A combination of optical and SAR imagery can compensate for their limitations and has exhibited comparative advantages in biomass estimation. Notably, the joint estimations of biophysical parameters might be more accurate than that of an individual parameter. Previous studies have attempted to use satellite imagery to estimate aboveground biomass, but the estimation of biomass for individual organs remains a challenge. Multi-target Gaussian process regressor stacking (MGPRS), as a new machine learning method, can be suitably utilized to estimate biomass components jointly from satellite imagery data, as the model does not require a large amount of data for training and can be adjusted to the required degrees of relationship exhibited by the given data. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the biomass of individual organs by using MGPRS in conjunction with optical (Sentinel-2A) and SAR (Sentinel-1A) imagery. Two hybrid indices, SAR and optical multiplication vegetation index (SOMVI) and SAR and optical difference vegetation index (SODVI), have been constructed to examine their estimation performance. The hybrid vegetation indices were used as input for the MGPRS and single-target Gaussian process regression (SGPR). The accuracy of the estimation methods was analyzed by in situ measurements of aboveground biomass (AGB) and organ biomass conducted in 2018 and 2019 over the paddy rice fields of Xinghua in Jiangsu Province, China. The results showed that the combined indices (SOMVI and SODVI) performed better than those derived from either the optical or SAR data only. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by the MGPRS using SODVI as input (r(2)= 0.84, RMSE = 0.4 kg/m(2) for stem biomass; r(2) = 0.87, RMSE = 0.16 kg/m(2) for AGB). This was higher than using SOMVI as input for the MGPRS (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 1.12 kg/m(2) for stem biomass; r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 0.56 kg/m(2) for AGB) or SGPR (r(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 1.08 kg/m(2) for stem biomass; r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 1.08 kg/m(2) for AGB). Relatively, higher accuracy for leaf biomass was achieved using SOMVI (r(2) = 0.83) than using SODVI (r(2) = 0.73) as input for MGPRS. Our results demonstrate that the combined indices are effective by integrating SAR and optical imagery and MGPRS outperformed SGPR with the same input variable for estimating rice crop biomass. The presented workflow will improve the estimation of crops biomass components from satellite data for effective crop growth monitoring.

TI  - Land surface black-sky alb e do at a fixed solar zenith angle and its relation to forest structure during peak growing season based on remote sensing data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Satellite data provide the opportunity to explore different land surface properties, such as albedo (reflectivity) and forest structure, for multidisciplinary purposes. We estimated land surface black-sky albedo at shortwave, near-infrared and visible spectral regions at a fixed solar zenith angle (i.e., 38.) during peak growing season in 2005 on a global scale. In addition, we estimated the links between albedo and forest structure variables including forest density [the number of trees/km(2)], tree cover [percent], and leaf area index [m(2)/m(2)] over pure forest pixels during peak growing season in 2005 on a global scale. We acquired and processed remotely sensed variables from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite images. This article provides 1) dataset of black-sky albedo at fixed solar zenith angle at a 1-km spatial resolution, 2) comparison between black-sky albedos at fixed solar zenith angle and local noon at a 1-km spatial resolution that are grouped based on forest types with the classes of evergreen needle-leaf, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, mixed and woody savannah forests, and also the major biome zones including boreal, mediterranean, temperate and tropical region. 3) the links between black-sky albedo at fixed solar zenith angle and forest structure using generalized additive models at a 0.5-degree spatial resolution during peak growing season in 2005. The pre-processing steps to enhance the accuracy of these datasets include: (1) identifying pure forest pixels, (2) excluding high slope pixels and those covered partially by water in the albedo product using high spatial resolution water (i.e., 30-m spatial resolution) and slope (i.e., 90-m spatial resolution) masks, and (3) using the most recent collection (collection 6) of MODIS satellite images.

TI  - A New Approach for Understanding Urban Microclimate by Integrating Complementary Predictors at Different Scales in Regression and Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a major contemporary phenomenon with multiple consequences. In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.

TI  - Performance of GLASS and MODIS Satellite Albedo Products in Diagnosing Albedo Variations during Different Time Scales and Special Weather Conditions in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a crucial parameter in accurately and quantitatively estimating energy and water budget on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and is also one of the largest radiative uncertainties in land surface modelling attempts. Based on an 8-year ground-based observation of the surface albedo over typical alpine meadows at Maqu and Maduo sites in the eastern TP, the performance of surface albedo products of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in describing albedo variations at daily, 8-day, seasonal timescales, and during different special weather conditions were analyzed. Compared with the ground-based observation in Maqu, the 8-day albedo products from GLASS and MCD43B3 present maximum negative biases of -0.030 and -0.027 at Maqu, respectively. The black-sky albedo (BSA) of GLASS product coincides well with the ground-based observation in Maduo, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.092 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.833, whereas that of MCD43B3 had an RMSE of 0.072 and R of 0.752. However, they are underestimated when the albedo is greater than 0.4. At the seasonal timescale, the BSA of GLASS and MCD43B3 underestimated the ground-based observation of Maqu by 0.015 in summer, while their white-sky albedo (WSA) are slightly overestimated and closer to the ground-based observation. In daily timescale, the response of surface albedo to soil moisture is different in semihumid and semiarid areas in summer. For both sites, the blue-sky-albedo of MCD43A3 has better agreement with the ground-based observation than GLASS and MCD43B3, as it improves the temporal resolution and calculates the albedo by weighting multiple observations within 16 days to be closer to the actual surface. However, even MCD43A3 could not capture the slowdown processes of albedo changes resulted by small snowfall processes or the snow aging due to cloud cover and inversion algorithms.

TI  - The Theory of the Unconscious in Russian Philosophy and Psychoanalysis
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a comparative analysis of the theories of the unconscious in Russian religious philosophy and Western psychoanalysis. The author describes the ontological, moral and spiritual aspects of the unconscious, reveals the sociocultural and value-ideological differences in the understanding of the unconscious in the theories of Russian religious philosophers Fyodor Dostoevsky and Vladimir Solovyov and Western psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Erich Fromm, shows the shortcomings of the scientific analytical approach to the unconscious, and considers the specificity of the metaphysical and religious understanding of the unconscious. The main problem of the article is that today, against the background of the popularity of the psychoanalytic approach to the unconscious, the value of the philosophical approach remains insufficiently clarified and recognized. In the context of this problem, Russian religious philosophy, which has a deeper understanding of the essence and nature of the unconscious, acquires special relevance. To solve this problem, the author refers to historical, logical, comparative methods and to philosophical and cultural analysis. The comparative analysis of Dostoevsky's philosophy and Freud's psychoanalytic concept showed that the scientific psychological approach to the unconscious that Freud founded is limited by the worldview of physicalism and materialism. The religious aspect of the unconscious that Dostoevsky and Solovyov discovered made it possible to understand the unconscious in a broader and more diverse context of the spiritual world of man, which includes all possible aspects of human life. The comparative analysis also helped to find differences between Russian philosophers and Western psychoanalysts in their theories about love. The physiological aspect of love revealed by Freud, as well as the social and creative aspects of love revealed by Fromm, showed their insufficient character in comparison with the spiritual context of love proposed by Dostoevsky and Solovyov. The spiritual context of love allowed Russian philosophers to understand the unconscious at all levels of human existence, not limited to specific aspects, as well as to show its metaphysical and spiritual depth. This point leads to the conclusion that, in the understanding of the unconscious, Russian philosophers were able to overcome the fragmentation, physicalism and reductionism inherent in Western psychoanalysts. Thus, they made a great contribution to the cognition of the unconscious and once again proved the scientific value and creative fruitfulness of Russian philosophical thought.

TI  - On-Orbit Calibration of Terra MODIS VIS Bands Using Polarization-Corrected Desert Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the Terra spacecraft is completing two decades of successful Earth observations, providing the scientific community with numerous products and supporting applications, such as land surface cover, sea surface temperature, aerosol properties, and vegetation. The 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) cover a wavelength range from 0.41 to 2.1 mu m and are calibrated primarily using a solar diffuser (SD), with lunar measurements and Earth-view (EV) response trends from desert sites used for the response versus scan-angle (RVS) characterization. Prelaunch analysis showed that a few short-wavelength RSBs of Terra MODIS are particularly sensitive to the polarization of the incident light, with on-orbit results further indicating that the polarization sensitivity has experienced changes that are wavelength, mirror side (MS), and scan-angle dependent. Although the primary calibrator, the SD, should provide an unpolarized light, supplemental inputs from the EV response trends used in the RVS characterization are impacted by the Earth scene polarization. The EV trends, uncorrected for polarization, pose a significant challenge in the RVS characterization for the short wavelength bands (3, 8, 9, and 10), therefore impacting the long-term trends and uncertainty characterization. Previous studies from the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) have independently estimated the polarization correction to be applied on the calibrated products to mitigate the impacts to some extent. In this article, the RVS is characterized using the EV response trends after correcting for the polarization effects. Results indicate a significant improvement in the long-term trending, reduced uncertainties in the forward prediction, and a more accurate per-pixel uncertainty provided by the uncertainty index (UI) in the MODIS L1B. This enhanced approach will, therefore, be considered for implementation in the future L1B reprocessing efforts. The enhanced approach also vastly simplifies the process of adding long-term trend corrections on top of the MODIS L1B, which should streamline the science data production in the future.

TI  - Processes of Forest Cover Change since 1958 in the Coffee-Producing Areas of Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the spatial relations of ecological and social processes to point at how state policies, population density, migration dynamics, topography, and socio-economic values of 'forest coffee' together shaped forest cover changes since 1958 in southwest Ethiopia. We used data from aerial photos, Landsat images, digital elevation models, participatory field mapping, interviews, and population censuses. We analyzed population, land cover, and topographic roughness (slope) data at the 'sub-district' level, based on a classification of the 30 lowest administrative units of one district into the coffee forest area (n = 17), and highland forest area (n = 13). For state forest sites (n = 6) of the district, we evaluated land cover and slope data. Forest cover declined by 25% between 1973 and 2010, but the changes varied spatially and temporally. Losses of forest cover were significantly higher in highland areas (74%) as compared to coffee areas (14%) and state forest sites (2%), and lower in areas with steeper slopes both in coffee and highland areas. Both in coffee and highland areas, forest cover also declined during 1958-1973. People moved to and converted forests in relatively low population density areas. Altitudinal migration from coffee areas to highland areas contributed to deforestation displacement due to forest maintenance for shade coffee production in coffee areas and forest conversions for annual crop production in highland areas. The most rapid loss of forest cover occurred during 1973-1985, followed by 2001-2010, which overlapped with the implementations of major land and forest policies that created conditions for more deforestation. Our findings highlight how crop ecology and migration have shaped spatial variations of forest cover change across different altitudinal zones whilst development, land, and forest policies and programs have driven the temporal variations of deforestation. Understanding the mechanisms of deforestation and forest maintenance simultaneously and their linkages is necessary for better biodiversity conservation and forest landscape management.

TI  - Global positioning system interferometric reflectometry for accurate tide gauge measurement: Insights from South Beach, Oregon, United States
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global positioning system (GPS) stations located along coastal areas have the ability to measure tide gauge records by reflected signal reception from the sea water surface. In this study we used the GPS signal-to-noise ratio data from the GPS station (44.6257 N-0, 124.0455 W-0) located at South Beach, Oregon, United States, to estimate the tide gauge records using seasonal measurements. First, we derived the tide gauge record from the station and used traditional tide gauge data from the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) sentinel station (Station ID: 9435380) located in Oregon for validation purposes because it was closest to the GPS station. Our results show that the GPS tide gauge and NWLON tide gauge correlate well with the correlation coefficient of 0.942 and the root mean square of their residuals was about 12.90 cm. The corresponding tide gauge prediction by auto-regressive moving average and singular spectrum analysis models are evaluated for their effectiveness over the station. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the GPS tide gauge has improved correlation with auto-regressive moving average predicted tide gauge (correlation coefficient of similar to 0.981 and root mean square of similar to 4.80 cm), and singular spectrum analysis predicted tide gauge (correlation coefficient of similar to 0.998 and root mean square of similar to 0.88 cm) compared to the NWLON tide gauge (correlation coefficient of similar to 0.942 and root mean square of similar to 12.90 cm) values. We believe the outcomes from this study contribute to a better understanding of the numerical modeling of tide gauge records as well as other measurements based on reflectometry techniques.

M3  - Article
AB  - The origin of human language is one of the most difficult issues of human sciences. The uniqueness of the language puts the natural-science worldview, in which the language appears to be an unprecedented evolutionary phenomenon, in a vulnerable position. At the moment, there is no answer to the question of which of the functions of the language - communicative or cognitive - played a key role in the evolution of human thinking? The main difficulty is that human language, the language of everyday communication, is used both to describe oneself and to describe the world of which one is a part. In terms of the logical doctrine defended by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Tarski, paradoxes are inevitable in the language used to describe oneself. The relativization of objects of cognition fixed in a semantically closed language makes any judgment about such a system of meanings unlawful. Thus, purely logical problems extend to the fundamental sections of philosophy, and the question of the origin of language is transformed into the question of the boundaries of reality and cognition. This article discusses the practical applicability of abstract knowledge in ordinary language at the intersection of epistemology, the foundations of mathematics, and psychopathology. The main aim of the work is to answer the question of how much the ideals of a pure theory meet the demands of everyday life, and whether they meet them at all. The contextualism of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein leads to the question of the abstract nature of metacommunicative statements. The logico-epistemological foundations of Gregory Bateson's theory of communication and psychopathology are explicated. The paradox of a negative self-referential meta-statement and ways to overcome it are analyzed. The impossibility of the principles of a hierarchical approach in the application to the tasks of ordinary communication is demonstrated. The conclusion is made about the inapplicability of the hierarchical model of metalanguages to the structuring of ordinary language and thinking.

TI  - Deformation monitoring with adaptive integration of multi-source InSAR data based on variance component estimation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has shown great potentiality in land subsidence monitoring. However, due to the limitation of repeat cycle and one-dimensional line-of-sight (LOS) deformation measuring capability, it is difficult to use only one data stack collected by a single satellite to characterize the real surface deformation and evolution regularity. The continuously increasing number of SAR satellite systems makes it possible to fuse multi-source InSAR data in different bands and orbits with overlap in spatial and temporal domain. The integration methods currently used are more suitable for large-scale deformation monitoring, or neglecting the north-south deformation and even the horizontal deformation, which usually leads to misjudgment. Therefore, in this paper the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) deformation inversion model is modified by incorporating horizontal deformation parameters in east-west and north-south directions. The posterior variance of multi-source data is determined by the Variance Component Estimation (VCE) method to iteratively refine the estimated weight matrices, leading to the optimal estimation of deformation parameters. Experiments were conducted with ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR data over Southern California, USA. Measurements at 9 GPS stations located in the study area were used to perform validation, and the results show that the fused deformation measurement accurately reflect the surface deformation fluctuation in vertical direction and the periodicity is largely identical as GPS observations. While, the fused deformation field illustrates horizontal deformation trend in this area cannot be ignored, and the displacement measurement accuracy along east-west direction is better than that along north-south direction. Therefore, the proposed multi-source InSAR fusion method based on VCE can not only improve continuity of time series deformation monitoring, but can also characterize the 3-D deformation field of the study area accurately.

TI  - Image Restoration based on Maximum Entropy Method with Parameter Estimation by Means of Annealing Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image restoration based on Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) with parameter estimation by means of annealing method is proposed. The proposed method allows spatial resolution enhancement. Using overlap sampling with a low resolution of sensor, high spatial resolution (corresponding to the sampling interval) can be achieved through ground data processing with image restoration methods. Through the experiments with simulation imagery data derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, it was found that spatial resolution enhancement can be achieved, MEM is superior to the others when S/N ratio is poor (less than 33) while Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) is superior when the S/N ratio is higher than 33. It was also found that the CGM is superior to the proposed method for the existing sampling jitter.

TI  - Relationship between groundwater level variations using Grace satellite data and rainfall
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellite and stations were used to estimate variations of the monthly groundwater level in the Zayanderud basin, Iran, over the period 2000-2018. In addition, the annual and seasonal storage of groundwater in this basin was estimated and verified using Grace satellite data, and compared with data from the previous rainfall. The results showed that the current groundwater level depends on the amount of rainfall in past years. When rainfall is on a downtrend, the trend of underground water storage fluctuations is affected by rainfall to a greater extent. In addition to the time trend, the pattern of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) depends on the amount of groundwater storage variations in the Zayanderud basin. The lowest NDVI (0.078) in 2016 coincided with the lowest amount of underground water storage and recharge rate (27.36 cm). Statistical correlation analysis of Grace satellite data and recorded data from wells indicated a root mean square error of 2.23 cm, a mean absolute error of 3.28 cm and a mean bias error of 1.02 cm on the seasonal scale. The results show that Grace data can provide a good understanding of long-term variations when studying the relationship between groundwater level and rainfall, especially in large basins.

TI  - Serendipitous Discovery of a Novel Murine Astrovirus Contaminating a Murine Helper T-cell Line and Incapable of Infecting Highly Immunodeficient Mice
T2  - COMPARATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The unexpected seroconversion of sentinel mice in our facility to murine T lymphotrophic virus (MTLV) positivity led to our identification of a novel murine astrovirus that we designated murine astrovirus 2 (MuAstV-2). During our investigation, MuAstV-2 was found to be a contaminant of the T helper cell line (D10.G4.1) that was used to generate the MTLV antigen that we included in the multiplex fluorometric immunoassay (MFIA) that we used for sentinel screening. We eventually determined that cross-reactivity with the astrovirus generated a positive result in the MTLV assay. A confirmatory immunofluorometric assay (IFA) using the same MTLV-infected cell line yielded a similar result. However, the use of antigen prepared from MTLV-infected neonatal mouse thymus did not reproduce a positive result, leading us to suspect that the seroreactivity we had observed was not due to infection with MTLV. A mouse antibody production test showed that mice inoculated with naive D10.G4.1 cells and their contact sentinels tested positive for MTLV using cell-line generated antigen, but tested negative in assays using MTLV antigen produced in mice. Metagenomic analysis was subsequently used to identify MuAstV-2 in feces from 2 sentinel mice that had recently seroconverted to MTLV. Two closely related astrovirus sequences (99.6% capsid identity) were obtained and shared 95% capsid amino acid identity with the MuAstV-2 virus sequenced from the D10.G4.1 cell line. These viruses are highly divergent from previously identified murine astroviruses, displaying <30% capsid identity, yet were closely related to murine astrovirus 2 (85% capsid identity), which had recently been isolated from feral mice in New York City. A MuAstV-2 specific PCR assay was developed and used to eradicate MuAstV-2 from the infected colony using a test and cull strategy. The newly identified MuAstV2 readily transmits to immunocompetent mouse strains by fecal-oral exposure, but fails to infect NOD-Prkdc(em26Cd52)Il2rg(em26Cd22)/NjuCrl (NCG) mice, which have significantly impaired adaptive and innate immune systems. Neither immunocompetent nor immunodeficient mice showed any astrovirus-associated pathology. MuAstV-2 may provide a valuable model for the study of specific aspects of astrovirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF SHORELINE DYNAMICS FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN PARIAMAN, WEST SUMATERA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dynamics have a significant effect on the use of coastal resources where more than 60 percent of cities in the world develop in this region and use it for urban infrastructure, settlements, and economic development. shoreline change is one of many indicators of coastal dynamics which is the result of interaction between biotic, abiotic and human activities which further influences policy and management practices for coastal areas. This paper presents the results of study on shoreline dynamics in Pariaman, West Sumatra using vector analysis in DSAS 4.3 between 1988-2003 and 2003-2018. The shoreline is interpreted from three Landsat images, namely Landsat 5 TM 1988, Landsat 7 ETM + 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS 2018 that have been corrected (radiometric and geometric). The shorelines derived from Landsat combined with shoreline from topographic map by Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG) as baseline for net shoreline movement (NSM) and end point rate (EPR) analysis. Then, The data of shoreline changes is used as a basis for qualitative analysis of local government policies on coastal management. The results show that shoreline changes occur dynamically wherein 1988-2003 abrasion occurred with an average rate of 2.88 m/yr and accretion of 1.64 m/ yr while in the 2003-2018 an abrasion rate of 2.76 m/yr occurred and accretion rate 1.12 m/ yr. This condition occurs along with the increase of longshore current speed. Some of the locations also have faster abrasion and accretion rates due to structural built.

TI  - 30 Years of Land Cover Change in Connecticut, USA: A Case Study of Long-Term Research, Dissemination of Results, and Their Use in Land Use Planning and Natural Resource Conservation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed land cover data can be a tremendous resource to land use decision makers, yet there is often a disconnect between the worlds of remote sensing and local government. The Connecticut's Changing Landscape project is focused on bridging this gap. The project analyzes changes to the state's landscape using Landsat-derived 30-m land cover and cross-correlation analysis. It includes seven dates spanning 30 years, from 1985 to 2015. During this period an additional 4.7 percent of the state was converted to development-related land covers, with corresponding losses to forest and agricultural land. New development was for the most part in attenuated patterns rather than concentrated near existing developed areas. Additional land cover analyses were conducted of agricultural areas, riparian corridors, core forest, and watershed imperviousness, to more closely examine issues of sustainability. Particular care is taken to make research findings accessible, understandable, and usable for the public through traditional outreach methods, and increasingly through internet mapping technology. As a result, the project has become a widely used resource informing the work of state, regional and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and researchers. A more concerted effort to integrate research and outreach is needed to ensure that land cover research has an impact on issues of land use and sustainability.

TI  - CHANNELING THE CINEMATIC IN MANUEL PUIG'S <i>BETRAYED BY RITA HAYWORTH</i>
T2  - KRITIKA KULTURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between literature and cinema has grown more extensive in recent decades, not only due to the immense popularity of hook-movie tie-ins and their intertextual relationship with other narrative genres like online games and literary adaptations on Netflix, but also because of developments in adaptation studies itself. However, there had been a concentration of studies on novel-to-film adaptations or the wholesale transpositions of literary works onto another medium. Still in the developing stage is the academic analysis of adaptations as a site for literary liquidity. Not only do novels, for instance, become source texts for films, there are occasions when novelists appropriate the cinematic into their characters, themes, narrative techniques, and plot structure. Beyond the adaptation discourse, how do contexts like the prevailing media culture, the realities of the author's literary environment, and the character of the literary and film industries affecting the text being investigated inform an interpretation of a particular novel and its eventual place in the literary world?In view of the above, this study seeks to answer the following questions:1. How does Manuel Puig's Betrayed by Rita Hayworth appropriate cinematic devices in its themes, characters, plot structure, narrative devices, and narrative voice?2. How does the novel represent Puig's worldview both as a film artist and a novelist?3. How does the modern Latin American literary landscape inform the novel's composition?4. How does cinema culture become a novelistic trope in Betrayed by Rita Hayworth?5. How does the novel constitute an occasion for literary liquidity through a new sense of Latin American reality and linguistic play?

TI  - Pixel-based and object-oriented approaches in segregating cocoa from forest in the Juabeso-Bia landscape of Ghana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A wall-to-wall Earth Observation (EO) data is required, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, private sector organizations and major development partners, to allow for the implementation of forest monitoring commitments, and also to monitor commodity-led deforestation. However, a major limitation associated with the use of optical EO data in the High Forest Zone of Ghana is the presence of persistent cloud cover and the spectral limitations of segregating agroforestry cocoa (AFC) from open canopy forest (OCF) cover. The aim of the study was to investigate the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) EO data to produce a land use/land cover map which shows AFC and OCF as different land cover classes. It was hypothesized that, a hybrid method of spectral, radar and image objects will accurately segregate the different cocoa systems from forest and other land use classes. The research was conducted in the Juaboso-Bia REDD+ Hotspot Intervention Area in the cocoa-forest mosaic landscape within the High Forest Zone of Ghana. The S1 and S2 datasets were freely acquired for the periods January to March 2018. The S1 datasets were pre-processed from backscatter intensity values to the VV and VH bands. The S2 datasets were corrected for atmospheric effects, and cloud pixels were masked and filled using a temporal gap-filling method. Six vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted, and the Multiresolution Segmentation algorithm was used to derive image objects (IOs). The S2 bands, the six VIs, the S1 VV + VH data, and the IOs were stacked into 3 different multi-layer image dataset denoted with D (i.e. D1 = S2 + VIs; D2 = S2 + VIs + S1; and D3 = S2+VIs + S1+IOs). The three datasets were classified using Random Forest and 1228 training points. Overall accuracy (OA) and kappa (k) were calculated for the classification outcome using 615 independent validation points. McNemar's test (chi) was used to access the statistically significant difference between D1, D2 and D3. The results of the study show that, D3 significantly improved the overall classification output (OA = 89.76%, k = 0.877) compared to D1 (OA = 79.02%, k = 0.748; chi = 5.56, p-value = 0.018) and D2 (OA = 80.49%, k = 0.765; chi = 5.50, p-value = 0.019). Combining spectral pixels with image objects increases overall classification accuracy and specifically, the accuracy of isolating AFC from OCF. This research is significant because it will provide an improved decision support to government-led monitoring and the private sector's commitment to halt cocoa-driven deforestation. Furthermore, and most importantly, the map shows agroforestry cocoa separated from monoculture cocoa, which provides a tremendous boost to monitoring landscape-level improvements associated with the promotion and adoption of agroforestry in cocoa landscapes, as a climate-smart practice and also for monitoring various off-reserve landscape forest restoration activities.

TI  - A novel method for automatic potato mapping using time series of Sentinel-2 images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop maps produced by remote sensing data play an important role in agricultural crop studies. Most of the crop mapping methods rely on field samples to train a model, which is a costly and time-consuming process. On the other hand, automatic crop mapping methods which are based on unique spectral characteristics are independent of ground truth data. Since most crops have specific spectral and temporal features during the growing season, this research aims at developing a new automatic method to discriminate potato from other crops using Sentinel-2 time series imageries. In this research, Crop type data of three study sites in Iran consisting of 2019 fields of potato and other crops, which were sampled by a GPS receiver were used. Moreover, an additional site in the United States comprised of 880 fields from Cropland Data Layer (CDL) in raster format, was also utilized. We employed 50% (2 9 2) of the Hamedan fields to train the model and the remaining 2607 fields from other sites and 50% from Hamedan were used to validate the model. Then, the temporal reflectance spectra of various crops and potato were extracted and considered. Results show that potato has four unique spectral characteristics which can be utilized to distinguish potato fields. These include the near-infrared reflectance values at the cultivation and harvest dates, variations of the near-infrared reflectance at the greenness peak time and the ratio of the near-infrared reflectance values to the red reflectance values at the greenness peak. Therefore, a novel feature was proposed based on a combination of the above spectral characteristics for discrimination of potato fields with a kappa coefficient of higher than 0.8 and an overall accuracy of better than 90%, in the four study sites.

TI  - Ecological complexity effects on thermal signature of different Madeira island ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - From a systemic perspective, evolution and natural succession promote the creation of efficient biological structures and processes that capture and dissipate the solar energy, maximizing the entropy production. This ecological complexification results in better ecosystem thermodynamic performance indicated by lower temperature.In a brief period of evolutionary time human-induced disturbance has altered profoundly the structure and functioning of the Earth System, i.e. ecological simplification.The objective is to understand whether remote sensing data can be considered appropriate proxy indicators to test if more mature and complex ecosystems have higher entropy production rates which lead to lower and attenuated ecosystem temperatures.Simple remote sensing measurements of Madeira Island for Thermal Infrared Radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used to analyse the surface temperature and biomass cover of Madeira ecosystems spectrum of different states of human-induced disturbance.The findings revealed it was possible to distinguish between ecosystem types using thermodynamic indicators, where older ecosystems with more complex structures exhibit more attenuated lower average temperatures. It was also found that habitat heterogeneity can represent either artificial (human) or natural disturbance with opposite consequences in the ecosystem thermal signature, i.e. lower temperature when natural disturbance and higher if anthropogenic disturbance.Simple thermal remote sensing data can be used as systemic indicator of ecosystem health by reflecting it levels of eco-exergy, i.e the available work energy in the ecosystem.

TI  - A Method to Suppress False Alarms of Sentinel-1 to Improve Ship Detection
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based ship detection application, false alarms frequently occur due to various noises caused by the radar imaging process. Among them, radio frequency interference (RFI) and azimuth smearing produce substantial false alarms; the latter also yields longer length estimation of ships than the true length. These two noises are prominent at cross-polarization and relatively weak at co-polarization. However, in general, the cross-polarization data are suitable for ship detection, because the radar backscatter from background sea surface is much less in comparison with the co-polarization backscatter, i.e., higher ship-sea image contrast. In order to improve the ship detection accuracy further, the RFI and azimuth smearing need to be mitigated. In the present letter, Sentinel-1 VV- and VH-polarization intensity data are used to show a novel technique of removing these noises. In this method, median image intensities of noises and background sea surface are calculated to yield arithmetic tendency. A band-math formula is then designed to replace the intensities of noise pixels in VH-polarization with adjusted VV-polarization intensity pixels that are less affected by the noises. To verify the proposed method, the adaptive threshold method (ATM) with a sliding window was used for ship detection, and the results showed that the 74.39% of RFI false alarms are removed and 92.27% false alarms of azimuth smearing are removed.

TI  - Precise Three-Dimensional Deformation Retrieval in Large and Complex Deformation Areas via Integration of Offset-Based Unwrapping and Improved Multiple-Aperture SAR Interferometry: Application to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake
T2  - ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) has been successfully used to precisely measure surface deformation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, while multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) has provided precise surface deformation in the along-track (AT) direction. Integration of the InSAR and MAI methods enables precise measurement of the two-dimensional (2D) deformation from an interferometric pair; recently, the integration of ascending and descending pairs has allowed the observation of precise three-dimensional (3D) deformation. Precise 3D deformation measurement has been applied to better understand geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The surface deformation related to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake was large and complex near the fault line; hence, precise 3D deformation retrieval had not yet been attempted. The objectives of this study were to (1) perform a feasibility test of precise 3D deformation retrieval in large and complex deformation areas through the integration of offset-based unwrapped and improved multiple-aperture SAR interferograms and (2) observe the 3D deformation field related to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, even near the fault lines. Two ascending pairs and one descending the Advanced Land Observing Satellite2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) pair were used for the 3D deformation retrieval. Eleven in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements were used to validate the 3D deformation measurement accuracy. The achieved accuracy was approximately 2.96, 3.75, and 2.86 cm in the east, north, and up directions, respectively. The results show the feasibility of precise 3D deformation measured through the integration of the improved methods, even in a case of large and complex deformation. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Estimating Regional Soil Moisture Distribution Based on NDVI and Land Surface Temperature Time Series Data in the Upstream of the Heihe River Watershed, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture has an important impact on hydrological processes in mountainous areas. Understanding such variability requires soil moisture datasets at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Remote sensing is a very effective method to obtain surface (similar to 5 cm depth) soil moisture at the regional scale but cannot directly measure soil moisture at deep soil layers (>5 cm depth) currently. This study chose the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed in the Qilian Mountain Ranges in Northwest China as the study area to estimate the profile soil moisture (0-70 cm depth) at the regional scale using satellite Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products. The study area was divided into 31 zones according to the combination of altitude, vegetation and soil type. Long-term in situ soil moisture observation stations were set up at each of the zones. Soil moisture probe, ECH2O, was used to collect soil moisture at five layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 and 50-70 cm) continuously. Multiple linear regression equations of time series MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI, LST and soil moisture were developed for each of the five soil layers at the 31 zones to estimate the soil moisture (0-70 cm) on a regional scale with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2)and a temporal resolution of 16-d from October, 2013 to September, 2016. The correlation coefficient R of the regression equations was between 0.47 and 0.94, the RMSE was 0.03, indicating that the estimation method based on the MODIS NDVI and LST data was suitable and could be applied to alpine mountainous areas with complex topography, soil and vegetation types. The overall pattern of soil moisture spatial distribution indicated that soil moisture was higher in the eastern region than in the western region, and the soil moisture content in the whole study area was 14.5%. The algorithm and results provide novel applications of remote sensing to support soil moisture data acquisition and hydrological research in mountainous areas.

TI  - Development and application of a new mangrove vegetation index (MVI) for rapid and accurate mangrove mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancement in Remote Sensing allows rapid mangrove mapping without the need for data-intensive methodologies, complex classifiers, and skill-dependent classification techniques. This study proposes a new index, the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI), to rapidly and accurately map mangroves extent from remotely-sensed imageries. The MVI utilizes three Sentinel-2 bands green, Near Infrared (NIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) in the form vertical bar NIR-Green vertical bar/vertical bar SWIR-Green vertical bar to discriminate the distinct greenness and moisture of mangroves from terrestrial vegetation and other land cover. Spectral band analysis shows that the vertical bar NIR-Green vertical bar part of MVI captures the differences of greenness between mangrove forests and terrestrial vegetation. The vertical bar SWIR-Green vertical bar part of the index expresses the distinct moisture of mangroves without the need for additional intertidal data and water indices. The MVI value increases with the increasing probability of a pixel being classified as mangroves. Eleven mangrove forests in the Philippines and one mangrove park in Japan were then mapped using MVI. Accuracy assessment was done using field inventory data and high-resolution drone orthophotos. MVI have successfully separated the mangroves from other cover especially terrestrial vegetation, with an overall index accuracy of 92%. The MVI was applied to Landsat 8 images using the equivalent bands to test the universality of the index. Comparable MVI mangrove maps were produced between Sentinel-2 and Landsat images, with an optimal minimum threshold of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. MVI can effectively highlight the greenness and moisture information in mangroves as reflected by its moderate to high correlation value (r = 0.63 and 0.84, alpha = 0.05) with the Sentinel-derived chlorophyll-a (C-a) and canopy water (C-w) biophysical products. This study developed and implemented two automated platforms: an offline IDL-based 'MVI Mapper' and an online Google Earth Engine-based MVI mapping interface. The MVI implemented in Google Earth Engine was used in generating the latest mangrove extent map of the Philippines. Additionally, the application of MVI were tested to four additional mangrove forests in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia; and to selected mangroves forests in South America, Africa and Australia.

TI  - New GEO paradigm: Re-purposing satellite components from the GEO graveyard
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising production rate of space debris poses an increasingly severe threat of collision to satellites in the crowded Geostationary Orbit (GEO). It also presents a unique opportunity to make use of a growing supply of inspace resources for the benefit of the satellite community. "The Recycler" is a mission proposed to source replacements for failed components in GEO satellites by extracting functioning components from non-operational spacecraft in the GEO graveyard. This paper demonstrates a method of analyzing in-space re-purposing missions such as the Recycler, using real satellite data to provide a strong platform for accurate performance estimates. An inventory of 1107 satellites in the extended GEO region is presented, and a review into past GEO satellite anomalies is conducted to show that solar arrays would be in the greatest demand for re-purposing. This inventory is used as an input to a greedy selection algorithm and trajectory simulation to show that the Recycler spacecraft could harvest components for 67 client satellites with its allotted fuel budget. This capacity directly meets the levels of customer demand estimated from the GEO satellite anomaly data, placing the Recycler as a strong contender in a future second-hand satellite-component industry. Propellant mass is found to be a greater restriction on the Recycler mission than its 15-year lifetime - a problem which could be solved by on-orbit refueling.

TI  - Water Mass Properties Derived From Satellite Observations in the Barents Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Barents Sea is a region of deep water formation where Atlantic Water is converted into cooler, fresher Barents Sea Water. Barents Sea Water properties exhibit variability at seasonal, interannual, and decadal timescales. This variability is transferred to Arctic Intermediate Water, which eventually contributes to the deeper branch of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Variations in Barents Sea Water properties are reflected in steric height (contribution of density to sea-level variations) that depends on heat and freshwater contents and is a quantity usually derived from in situ observations of water temperature, salinity, and pressure that remain sparse during winter in the Barents Sea. This analysis explores the utility of satellite observations for representing Barents Sea Water properties and identifying trends and sources of variability through novel methods. We present our methods for combining satellite observations of eustatic height (the contribution of mass to sea-level variations), sea surface height, and sea surface temperature, validated by in situ temperature and salinity profiles, to estimate steric height. We show that sea surface temperature is a good proxy for heat content in the upper part of the water column in the southeastern Barents Sea and that freshwater content can be reconstructed from satellite data. Our analysis indicates that most of the seasonality in Barents Sea Water properties arises from the balance between ocean heat transport and atmospheric heat flux, while its interannual variability is driven by heat and freshwater advection.Plain Language Summary The Barents Sea is an Arctic continental shelf sea where inflowing warm salty water from the Atlantic Ocean loses heat to the atmosphere, gains freshwater from sea ice melt and rivers, and transforms into a water mass called Barents Sea Water. Variability and vertical structure of ocean temperature and salinity can be measured from ships, buoys, and gliders that profile the ocean from surface to bottom but are costly and to some degree limited by sea ice and weather. Satellites observe the ocean more frequently, and cover larger parts of it, but cannot measure below the surface. We combine different satellite measurements with novel physical and statistical techniques to infer ocean heat and freshwater contents, integrated over the upper part of the water column. Using our satellite-based reconstruction of upper ocean heat, we determine that the seasonal ocean heat import is balanced by the warming of the atmosphere by the ocean. These results increase the utility of the available satellite measurements and demonstrate their potential for providing insight that can improve predictions about sea ice and ocean properties in this changing Arctic region.

TI  - Towards Circumpolar Mapping of Arctic Settlements and Infrastructure Based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrastructure expands rapidly in the Arctic due to industrial development. At the same time, climate change impacts are pronounced in the Arctic. Ground temperatures are, for example, increasing as well as coastal erosion. A consistent account of the current human footprint is needed in order to evaluate the impact on the environments as well as risk for infrastructure. Identification of roads and settlements with satellite data is challenging due to the size of single features and low density of clusters. Spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data are the main issues regarding their separation. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 and -2 missions recently provided good spatial coverage and at the same time comparably high pixel spacing starting with 10 m for modes available across the entire Arctic. The purpose of this study was to assess the capabilities of both, Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Sentinel-2 multispectral information for Arctic focused mapping. Settings differ across the Arctic (historic settlements versus industrial, locations on bedrock versus tundra landscapes) and reference data are scarce and inconsistent. The type of features and data scarcity demand specific classification approaches. The machine learning approaches Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation have been tested. Records for the Alaskan North Slope, Western Greenland, and Svalbard in addition to high-resolution satellite data have been used for validation and calibration. Deep learning is superior to GBM with respect to users accuracy. GBM therefore requires comprehensive postprocessing. SAR provides added value in case of GBM. VV is of benefit for road identification and HH for detection of buildings. Unfortunately, the Sentinel-1 acquisition strategy is varying across the Arctic. The majority is covered in VV+VH only. DL is of benefit for road and building detection but misses large proportions of other human-impacted areas, such as gravel pads which are typical for gas and oil fields. A combination of results from both GBM (Sentinel-1 and -2 combined) and DL (Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1 optional) is therefore suggested for circumpolar mapping.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Vegetation Dynamic and Persistence under Climatic and Anthropogenic Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation reflected by vegetation is a commonly used practice to monitor desertification. To retrieve important information for ecosystem management accurate assessment of desertification is necessary. The major factors that drive vegetation dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions are climate and anthropogenic activities. Progression of desertification is expected to exacerbate under future climate change scenarios, through precipitation variability, increased drought frequency and persistence of dry conditions. This study examined spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics in arid regions of Sindh, Pakistan, using annual and growing season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 2000 to 2017, and explored the climatic and anthropogenic effects on vegetation. Results showed an overall upward trend (annual 86.71% and growing season 82.7%) and partial downward trend (annual 13.28% and growing season 17.3%) in the study area. NDVI showed the highest significant increase in cropland region during annual, whereas during growing season the highest significant increase was observed in savannas. Overall high consistency in future vegetation trends in arid regions of Sindh province is observed. Stable and steady development region (annual 48.45% and growing 42.80%) dominates the future vegetation trends. Based on the Hurst exponent and vegetation dynamics of the past, improvement in vegetation cover is predicted for a large area (annual 44.49% and growing 30.77%), and a small area is predicted to have decline in vegetation activity (annual 0.09% and growing 3.04%). Results revealed that vegetation growth in the study area is a combined result of climatic and anthropogenic factors; however, in the future multi-controls are expected to have a slightly larger impact on annual positive development than climate whereas positive development in growing season is more likely to continue in future under the control of climate variability.

TI  - Historical (1850-2014) Aerosol Evolution and Role on Climate Forcing Using the GISS ModelE2.1 Contribution to CMIP6
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth's climate is rapidly changing. Over the past centuries, aerosols, via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds, played an important role in counterbalancing some of the greenhouse gas (GHG) caused global warming. The multicentury anthropogenic aerosol cooling effect prevented present-day climate from reaching even higher surface air temperatures and subsequent more dramatic climate impacts. Trends in aerosol concentrations and optical depth show that in many polluted regions such as Europe and the United States, aerosol precursor emissions decreased back to levels of the 1950s. More recent polluting countries such as China may have reached a turning point in recent years as well, while India still follows an upward trend. Here we study aerosol trends in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations of the GISS ModelE2.1 climate model using a fully coupled atmosphere composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based (One-Moment Aerosol, OMA) aerosol module. Results show that whether global aerosol radiative forcing is already declining depends on the aerosol scheme used. Using the aerosol microphysical scheme, where the aerosol system reacts more strongly to the trend in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, global peak direct aerosol forcing was reached in the 1980s, whereas the mass-based scheme simulates peak direct aerosol forcing around 2010.

TI  - Estimates of Conservation Tillage Practices Using Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The USDA Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial assistance to encourage producers to adopt conservation practices. Historically, one of the most common practices is conservation tillage, primarily the use of no-till planting. The objectives of this research were to determine crop residue using remote sensing, an indicator of tillage intensity, without using training data and examine its performance at the field level. The Landsat Thematic Mapper Series platforms can provide global temporal and spatial coverage beginning in the mid-1980s. In this study, we used the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), which has proved to be robust and accurate in studies built upon training datasets. We completed 10 years of residue maps for the 150,000 km(2)study area in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota and validated the results against field-level survey data. The overall accuracy was between 64% and 78% with additional improvement when survey points with suspect geolocation and satellite tillage estimates with fewer than four dates of Landsat images were excluded. This study demonstrates that, with Landsat Archive available at no cost, researchers can implement retrospective, untrained estimates of conservation tillage with sufficient accuracy for some applications.

TI  - Comparative Quality and Trend of Remotely Sensed Phenology and Productivity Metrics across the Western United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology and productivity play a crucial role in surface energy balance, plant and animal distribution, and animal movement and habitat use and can be measured with remote sensing metrics including start of season (SOS), peak instantaneous rate of green-up date (PIRGd), peak of season (POS), end of season (EOS), and integrated vegetation indices. However, for most metrics, we do not yet understand the agreement of remotely sensed data products with near-surface observations. We also need summaries of changes over time, spatial distribution, variability, and consistency in remote sensing dataset metrics for vegetation timing and quality. We compare metrics from 10 leading remote sensing datasets against a network of PhenoCam near-surface cameras throughout the western United States from 2002 to 2014. Most phenology metrics representing a date (SOS, PIRGd, POS, and EOS), rather than a duration (length of spring, length of growing season), better agreed with near-surface metrics but results varied by dataset, metric, and land cover, with absolute value of mean bias ranging from 0.38 (PIRGd) to 37.92 days (EOS). Datasets had higher agreement with PhenoCam metrics in shrublands, grasslands, and deciduous forests than in evergreen forests. Phenology metrics had higher agreement than productivity metrics, aside from a few datasets in deciduous forests. Using two datasets covering the period 1982-2016 that best agreed with PhenoCam metrics, we analyzed changes over time to growing seasons. Both datasets exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity in the direction of phenology trends. Variability of metrics increased over time in some areas, particularly in the Southwest. Approximately 60% of pixels had consistent trend direction between datasets for SOS, POS, and EOS, with the direction varying by location. In all ecoregions except Mediterranean California, EOS has become later. This study comprehensively compares remote sensing datasets across multiple growing season metrics and discusses considerations for applied users to inform their data choices.

TI  - Lineage and Virtue in Josephus: The Respective Roles of Priestly Worldview and Roman Culture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANCIENT JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article assesses the importance of lineage and virtue in Josephus' notions of Jewish nobility and the Jewish people. Furthermore, it investigates the respective roles of Josephus' priestly education and his exposition to Roman culture in his use of such concepts. I argue that while Josephus adopted some aspects of Roman or Greco-Roman discourses on nobility, such as the notion that true nobility goes along with virtue, he resisted the Roman sociopolitical view of nobility, because he tended to identify Jewish aristocracy with the priesthood and thus stuck to a genealogical model. By contrast, Josephus' definition of the kinship (oikeiotes) that unites the members of the Jewish people as based either on birth/common ancestors or on choice (the choice to live under Jewish laws, implicitly characterized as virtuous) in Against Apion reflects the impact on the Judean historian of Roman citizenship grants and the pro-Roman discourses that praised this policy.

TI  - Open Source Riverscapes: Analyzing the Corridor of the Naryn River in Kyrgyzstan Based on Open Access Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In fluvial geomorphology as well as in freshwater ecology, rivers are commonly seen as nested hierarchical systems functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Thus, for a comprehensive assessment, information on various scales is required. Over the past decade, remote sensing-based approaches have become increasingly popular in river science to increase the spatial scale of analysis. However, data-scarce areas have been widely ignored so far, even if most remaining free flowing rivers are located in such areas. In this study, we suggest an approach for river corridor mapping based on open access data only, in order to foster large-scale analysis of river systems in data-scarce areas. We take the more than 600 km long Naryn River in Kyrgyzstan as an example, and demonstrate the potential of the SRTM-1 elevation model and Landsat OLI imagery in the automated mapping of various riverscape parameters, like the riparian zone extent, distribution of riparian vegetation, active channel width and confinement, as well as stream power. For each parameter, a rigor validation is performed to evaluate the performance of the applied datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach to riverscape mapping is capable of providing sufficiently accurate results for reach-averaged parameters, and is thus well-suited to large-scale river corridor assessment in data-scarce regions. Rather than an ultimate solution, we see this remote sensing approach as part of a multi-scale analysis framework with more detailed investigation in selected study reaches.

TI  - Suffering the Sons of Eve: Animal Ethics in al-Ma?arri's<i>Epistle of the Horse and the Mule</i>
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the year 1021 CE, blind author and skeptic Abu l-?AlaMODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RING al-Ma?arri (d. 1057 CE) wrote Risalat al-sahil wa-l-shahij (The Epistle of the Horse and the Mule), a winding prose work populated by animal characters who talk about poetry, grammar, riddles, and Syrian society on the eve of the crusades. Traditionally forgotten as a source for al-Ma?arri's pacifism, and his vegan worldview, the Sahil lets readers see his thinking on animals more than most other works. After a brief survey of animals in Islam, which shows a mainstream desire for balance between human and non-human needs, as well as exceptional cases that strongly uphold animals as subjects per se and which stand as key inter-texts for al-Ma?arri, this paper considers how the Sahil champions non-human creatures through images of animal cruelty deployed to shock readers into compassion, and through poetry and popular sayings (amthal) recast in a zoocentric mold. It, therefore, advocates with more fervor than anthropocentric Islamic writings on animals, such as Kalilah wa-Dimnah or the letters of the Ikhwan al-SafaMODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RING. However, this happens in a way that makes it hard to pin down the sources of al-Ma?arri's thought. Furthermore, al-Ma?arri seems to contradict himself when, for example, he employs literal meaning when it comes to animal justice, even as he avoids literalism in other contexts. This calls his concern for animals into question in one sense, but in another, it affirms such concern insofar as his self-contradictions show an active mind working through animal ethics in real time.

TI  - Experimental inoculation and nose-to-nose transmission of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> between weaned piglets
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In piglets, Clostridioides (C.) difficile infection presents mostly subclinical manifestation. As this agent became important in veterinary medicine due to a hypothesis of zoonosis, the objective of this study was to evaluate the transmission of C. difficile by nose-to-nose contact in young piglets. Six 20-day-old piglets were separated into three groups (infected, sentinel and control), and distributed in different isolation cabinets which allowed nose-to-nose contact only between infected and sentinel groups. The challenged group received an inoculum 10(6) CFU/mL of C. difficile 096 by oropharyngeal route. Rectal swab samples were daily collected for microbiological and molecular analysis. Euthanasia of all piglets was performed 18 days after challenge to evaluate anatomical, histological and microbiological lesions of the organs of these animals. The challenged and sentinel groups showed clinical signs of infection and genes encoding TcdB were detected by conventional PCR in both groups, confirming the transmission of the pathogen from the challenged to the sentinel piglets. At necropsy, tonsil, liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, ileocolic lymph nodes, jejunum, ileum, proximal colon, distal colon and cecum were collected for microbiological analysis; lesions were observed varying in degree and intensity. This study demonstrated a novel route of transmission of C. difficile between young piglets, which was proven to occur by nose-to-nose contact.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The use of satellite imagery to quantify forest metrics has become popular because of the high costs associated with the collection of data in the field.Methods: Multiple linear regression (MLR) and regression kriging (RK) techniques were used for the spatial interpolation of basal area (G) and growing stock volume (GSV) based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. The performance of the models was tested using the repeated k-fold cross-validation method.Results: The prediction accuracy of G and GSV was strongly related to forest vegetation structure and spatial dependency. The nugget value of semivariograms suggested a moderately spatial dependence for both variables (nugget/sill ratio similar to 70%). Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 based RK explained approximately 52% of the total variance in G and GSV. Root-mean-square errors were 7.81 m(2) ha(-1) and 19.68 m(2) ha(-1) for G and GSV, respectively.Conclusions: The diversity of stand structure particularly at the poorer sites was considered the principal factor decreasing the prediction quality of G and GSV by RK.

TI  - Reassessing the Quality of Sea-Ice Deformation Estimates Derived From the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System and Its Impact on the Spatiotemporal Scaling Statistics
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We reassess the trajectory errors inherent to sea-ice deformation estimates with a new propagation of uncertainty derivation and show that previous formulations applied to deformation estimates from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) are either too high due to incorrect assumptions or too low due to neglected terms in certain cases. We show that when the resulting signal-to-noise ratios are used to discriminate the deformation estimates based on their quality, as done for buoy records, the spatiotemporal scaling exponents for the mean total deformation rate increase, especially at smaller scale, such that a space-time coupling of the scaling-which is otherwise absent-emerges from the RGPS deformation data set, in accord with previous analyses performed with buoy observations. We also show that the preprocessing method used to reduce the effects of irregular sampling of the Lagrangian deformation fields can significantly impact the value of the deformation statistics and could possibly explain part of previous discrepancies between deformation statistics obtained with buoy records and large-scale synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Specifically, we show that spurious lines of deformation appear when interpolating RGPS trajectories that presenttemporal sampling inconsistencies. In the context of using observed sea-ice deformation statistics to constrain and improve the performance of sea-ice models, high confidence in the observed deformation field statistics is necessary. Using appropriate, well-documented, methods to derive the set of statistics to be reproduced by models therefore becomes crucial.Plain Language Summary Sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean deforms in well-defined lines. These linear deformation features are important for the climate system because they regulate the interaction between the ocean beneath the ice and the atmosphere above the ice. It is therefore of interest to know the statistical properties of these deformation features in order to reproduce them with sea-ice models that are used for climate studies. We show in this study that the statistical properties of sea-ice deformations obtained from satellite observations and used to evaluate sea-ice models are very sensitive to the methods applied to obtain the deformation fields. Depending on the method used, artificial behaviors can appear in the observed deformation statistics, which then have no physical meaning. As such, care must be taken when analyzing the statistical properties of the observed deformation fields for them to have a physical significance. Our analysis also allows us to explain differences in previous studies that used different methods to analyze the statistical properties of the observed deformation fields.

TI  - Estimating chlorophyll-A concentration in the Caspian Sea from MODIS images using artificial neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, due to various pollution sources, it is essential for environmental scientists to monitor water quality. Phytoplanktons form the end of the food chain in water bodies and are one of the most important biological indicators in water pollution studies. Chlorophyll-A, a green pigment, is found in all phytoplankton. Chlorophyll-A concentration indicates phytoplankton biomass directly. Therefore, Chlorophyll-A is an indirect indicator of pollutants, including phosphorus and nitrogen, and their refinement and control are important. The present study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images were used to estimate the chlorophyll-A concentration in southern coastal waters in the Caspian Sea. For this purpose, Multi-layer perceptron neural networks (NNs) were applied which contained three and four feed-forward layers. The best three-layer NN has 15 neurons in its hidden layer and the best four-layer one has 5 in each. The three- and four- layer networks both resulted in similar root mean square errors (RMSE), 0.1(mu g/l.), however, the four-layer NNs proved superior in terms of R-2 and also required less training data. Accordingly, a four-layer feed-forward NN with 5 neurons in each hidden layer, is the best network structure for estimating Chlorophyll-A concentration in the southern coastal waters of the Caspian Sea.

TI  - UAV-based canopy textures assess changes in forest structure from long-term degradation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Degraded tropical forests dominate agricultural frontiers and their management is becoming an urgent priority. This calls for a better understanding of the different forest cover states and cost-efficient techniques to quantify the impact of degradation on forest structure. Canopy texture analyses based on Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) optical imagery provide proxies to assess forest structures but the mechanisms linking them with degradation have rarely been investigated. To address this gap, we used a lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to map 739 ha of degraded forests and acquire both canopy VHSR images and height model. Thirty-three years of degradation history from Landsat archives allowed us to sample 40 plots in undisturbed, logged, over-logged and burned and regrowth forests in tropical forested landscapes (Paragominas, Para, Brazil). Fourier (FOTO) and lacunarity textures were used to assess forest canopy structure and to build a typology linking degradation history and current states. Texture metrics capture canopy grain, heterogeneity and openness gradients and correlate with forest structure variability (R2 = 0.58). Similar structures share common degradation history and can be discriminated on the basis of canopy texture alone (accuracy = 55%). Over-logging causes a lowering in forest height, which brings homogeneous textures and of finer grain. We identified the major changes in structures due to fire following logging which changes heterogeneous and intermediate grain into coarse textures. Our findings highlight the potential of canopy texture metrics to characterize degraded forests and thus be used as indicators for forest management and degradation mitigation. Inexpensive and agile UAV open promising perspectives at the interface between field inventory and satellite characterization of forest structure using texture metrics.

TI  - Assessing the effect of spatial resolution on the delineation of management zones for smallholder farming in southern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimates of cover-crop aboveground biomass (AGB) have been used to delineate management zones for smallholder farming in southern Brazil. In this study, we investigated the spatial resolution influence on the AGB estimates of rye, calculated from regression relationships with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and on the subsequent delineation of management zones using the Management Zone Analyst (MZA) software. Data acquired by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Parrot Sequoia camera (0.20 m spatial resolution) in Brazil were compared with observations from the PlanetScope (PS) satellite constellation (3 m) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 (30 m). A three-endmember mixture model (green vegetation, soil, and shadow) was applied to surface reflectance data of these instruments for evaluating the cover-crop development at two dates in August 2017. Because of the differences in the technical specifications of the sensors, we resampled the UAV dataset into four levels of spatial resolution (1, 3, 10, and 30 m). Using the UAV map (0.20 m) as a reference, we obtained confusion matrices for the original and resampled data. The results showed that the increasing amounts of rye AGB from the beginning to the end of August promoted significant changes in surface reflectance and in soil-green vegetation fractions calculated at variable spatial resolution. The performance of the regression models to estimate cover-crop AGB was approximately similar in the transition from the sub-metric (0.20 m) to the metric (3 m) spatial resolutions, or from the UAV camera to the PS data. For all datasets, the MZA detected two management zones with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB than zone 1. When compared to the UAV management zone map (reference), the PS map had a moderate-to-substantial agreement, while the OLI/Landsat-8 map had a fair-to-moderate concordance. Substantial agreements with the reference map were observed at simulated 1 m and 3 m data, as indicated by Kappa coefficients of 0.73 and 0.63 and overall accuracies of 86.40% and 81.40%, respectively. We conclude that the 3 m spatial resolution data of the PS comprise an alternative to delineate management zones for smallholder farming in southern Brazil when compared to the very-high spatial resolution observations of the UAV cameras.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Event on the Air Quality in Iran
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first novel coronavirus case was confirmed in Iran in mid-February 2020. This followed by the enforcement of lockdown to tackle this contagious disease. This study aims to examine the potential effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on air quality in Iran. From 21st March to 21st April in 2019 and 2020, The Data were gathered from 12 air quality stations to analyse six criteria pollutants, namely O-3, NO2, SO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5. Due to the lack of ground-level measurements, using satellite data equipped us to assess changes in air quality during the study on Iranian megacities, especially in Tehran, i.e., the capital of Iran. In this city, concentrations of primary pollutants (SO2 5-28%, NO2 1-33%, CO 5-41%, PM10 1.4- 30%) decreased with spatial variations. Although, still SO2, NO2, and PM10 exceeded the WHO daily limit levels for 31 days, 31 days, and four days, respectively. Conversely, O-3 and PM2.5 increased by 0.5-103% and 2-50%. In terms of the national air quality, SO2 and NO2 levels decreased while AOD increased during the lockdown. Unfavourable meteorological conditions hindered pollutant dispersion. Moreover, reductions in the height of planetary boundary layer and rainfall were observed during the lockdown period. Despite the adverse weather conditions, a decrease in primary pollutant levels, confirms the possible improvements on the air quality in Iran.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Images for Estimating Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Lake Chad, Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Much effort has been applied in estimating the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in lakes. The optical complexity and lack of in situ data complicate estimating Chlain such water bodies.We compared four established satellite reflectance algorithms-the two-band and three-band algorithms (2BDA, 3BDA), fluorescence line height (FLH), and normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI)-to estimate Chlaconcentration in Lake Chad. We evaluated the performance and applicability of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images with the four Chlaestimation algorithms. For accuracy, we compared the concentration levels from the four algorithms to those from Worldview-3 (WV3) images. We identified two promising algorithms that could be used alongside L8 and S2 satellite images to monitor Chlaconcentrations in Lake Chad. With an averaged R(2)of 0.8, the 3BDA and NDCI Chlaalgorithms performed accurately with S2 and L8 images. For the S2 and L8 images, 3BDA had the highest performance when compared to the WV3 estimates. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensor images in improving water quality information for areas that are difficult to access or when conventional data are limited.

TI  - Atmospheric Simulations of Total Column CO<sub>2</sub> Mole Fractions from Global to Mesoscale within the Carbon Monitoring System Flux Inversion Framework
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the uncertainty of inversion-derived CO2 surface fluxes and attributing the uncertainty to errors in either flux or atmospheric transport simulations continue to be challenges in the characterization of surface sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2). Despite recent studies inferring fluxes while using higher-resolution modeling systems, the utility of regional-scale models remains unclear when compared to existing coarse-resolution global systems. Here, we present an off-line coupling of the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to optimized biogenic CO2 fluxes and mole fractions from the global Carbon Monitoring System inversion system (CMS-Flux). The coupling framework consists of methods to constrain the mass of CO2 introduced into WRF, effectively nesting our regional domain covering most of North America (except the northern half of Canada) within the CMS global model. We test the coupling by simulating Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (XCO2) over North America for 2010. We find mean model-model differences in summer of similar to 0.12 ppm, significantly lower than the original coupling scheme (from 0.5 to 1.5 ppm, depending on the boundary). While 85% of the XCO2 values are due to long-range transport from outside our North American domain, most of the model-model differences appear to be due to transport differences in the fraction of the troposphere below 850 hPa. Satellite data from GOSAT and tower and aircraft data are used to show that vertical transport above the Planetary Boundary Layer is responsible for significant model-model differences in the horizontal distribution of column XCO2 across North America.

TI  - Evidence of exposure to zoonotic flaviviruses in zoo mammals in Spain and their potential role as sentinel species
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A serosurvey was carried out to assess emerging flavivirus exposure in zoo mammals in Spain and to determine the dynamics of seropositivity in species that were longitudinally sampled during the study period. Sera from 570 zoo animals belonging to 120 mammal species were collected at ten zoos (A-J) in Spain between 2002 and 2019. Twenty-one of these animals, belonging to ten different species, were sampled longitudinally at four of the zoos during the study period. Antigenically-related flavivirus antibodies were detected in 19 (3.3 %; 95 %CI: 2.0-5.2) of the 570 animals analyzed using bELISA. Seropositivity was observed in ten (8.3 %) of the 120 species tested. Five (23.8 %) of the 21 animals sampled more than once presented seropositivity in all samplings whereas seroconversion was only observed in one white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). Flavivirus antibodies were found at six of the ten sampled zoos and in consecutive years between 2008 and 2018. Virus neutralization tests confirmed West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in ten (1.8 %; 95 %CI: 0.7-2.8), five (0.9 %; 95 %CI: 0.1-1.6) and one (0.2 %; 95 %CI: 0.0-0.5) animal, respectively. Antibodies against Meaban virus (0 %; 95 %CI: 0.0-0.7 %) were not found in the tested sera. The results demonstrate WNV, USUV and TBEV exposure in zoo mammals, which may be of public health and conservation concern. Seropositivity to WNV and USUV was detected in regions where these viruses have not been reported previously. Anti-WNV antibodies found in zoo animals sampled in 2009 point to WNV circulation at least one year before the first outbreaks were reported in horses and humans in Spain. Our results indicate that zoo mammals could be useful sentinel species for monitoring emerging flavivirus activity in urban areas.

TI  - Psychopathological and psychiatric evaluation of patients affected by lipodystrophy
T2  - EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lipodystrophy is a collection of rare disorders defined by complete or partial loss of adipose tissue, due to abnormal adipocyte production, function, or distribution; it shares the main metabolic complications with obesity. Aims of the present study were to investigate the psychopathological characteristics of non-HIV lipodystrophic patients in comparison with a group of obese patients, a group of patients affected by oncologic chronic illness, and a control group of healthy subjects. Methods All participants were female: 16 non-HIV lipodystrophic women (mean age 42 +/- 12 years), 20 women with breast cancer (adenocarcinoma with a positive sentinel lymph node in outpatients awaiting chemotherapy, mean age 44 +/- 5 years), 20 obese women (mean age 40 +/- 3 years), and 20 healthy women (mean age 40 +/- 2 years). Each lipodystrophic patient received a psychiatric assessment, following the diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. Patients and controls received a battery of self-report instruments measuring general psychopathology, body image concerns, eating habits and food craving, and pain concerns. The following psychopathological rating scales were used: SCL-90-R (Symptom Check List) for general psychopathology, BUT (Body Uneasiness Test) for body image, FCQ-T (Food Cravings Questionnaire Trait) for food craving, and WHYMPI (West Haven Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory) for multidimensional pain inventory. Results The psychiatric assessment of the 16 lipodystrophic patients revealed: three lifetime mood disorder, six current mood disorder, six lifetime anxiety disorder, five current anxiety disorder, four current somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain, six current binge eating disorder, 11 eating disorder not otherwise specified, two borderline personality disorder, one obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, one avoidant personality disorder, and five personality disorder not otherwise specified. In SCL-90-R scale, the subscale sensitivity showed a significantly higher score in the lipodystrophic and oncologic groups compared to healthy subjects. The subscale paranoid ideation showed a significantly higher score in the lipodystrophic group vs all the other groups. The total score of BUT scale was significantly higher in the lipodystrophic compared to healthy subjects. In WHYMPI scale, the scores of pain interference and family support were significantly higher in the lipodystrophic group. The scores of negative responses were significantly higher in the lipodystrophic group vs healthy subjects. In FCQ-T scale, the score of Cues dimension in lipodystrophic patients was significantly lower as compared with all the other groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that lipodystrophic patients have an increased prevalence of mood, anxiety, pain, and eating disorders.

TI  - A multi-sensor, multi-scale approach to mapping tree mortality in woodland ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Woodland ecosystems, dominant on nearly 4% of all terrestrial land globally, are faced with a variety of threats, including increasingly prolonged and severe droughts, invasive insect outbreaks, and the rapid spread of pathogens. While many remote sensing methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of mortality in forested environments, woodland ecosystems present unique challenges to accurately mapping tree die-off due to relatively lower canopy covers, smaller and irregularly-shaped tree crowns, and greater influence of understory vegetation and soil cover on reflectance. To address these challenges, we developed a multi-sensor, multi-scale approach combining the analytical strengths of centimeter-resolution unmanned aerial system imagery for interpreting individual tree-level mortality, airborne lidar for crown mapping and quantifying percent canopy mortality, and Landsat imagery for upscaling mortality estimates to a regional scale. This approach utilizes a new algorithm for delineating the shapes of small, irregular woodland tree crowns using lidar. To demonstrate the application of this method, we map the extent and severity of a recent tree mortality event in pinon-juniper (PJ) woodlands of southeastern Utah. Our results suggest that 39% of PJ in this region has experienced some level of mortality, with patches exceeding 50% mortality. An analysis of potential mortality drivers revealed that canopy cover, terrain, and recent winter precipitation conditions are most directly linked with mortality, although the explanatory power of the mortality driver model was low. Our approach demonstrates a methodology that could be used for tree mortality mapping and scaling in a variety woodland ecosystems, and can provide a strong basis for further ecophysiological, ecological, and carbon cycle studies involving woodland tree mortality.

TI  - Area and Mass Changes of Glaciers in the West Kunlun Mountains Based on the Analysis of Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images and DEMs from 1970 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's glaciers have retreated significantly against the background of recent climate warming, while reports have indicated that the glaciers in the West Kunlun Mountains (WKL) may be in a relatively stable state, although there are some gaps in previous research. Based on Landsat series data, topographic maps, SRTM and TanDEM-x data, this paper extracts detailed glacial area information and glacial mass balance during different time periods from 1970 to 2018. We found that, the total area of glaciers in the WKL decreased by 8.0 km(2)from 1972 to 2018. The area decreased by 12.0 km(2)from 1972 to 1991 and increased by 4.7 km(2)from 2010 to 2018. Glacier surface elevation change results in the WKL showed that the overall glacier thickness slightly decreased from 1970 to 2016, with an average of 1.9 +/- 1.0 m. The glaciers thinned by approximately 2.5 +/- 1.0 m from 1970 to 2000, while from 2000 to 2016, the glaciers thickened approximately by 0.6 +/- 1.0 m. Overall, the glaciers in the WKL showed very slight retreat. In addition, the mass changes of glaciers were affected by glacial surging.

TI  - Damage evaluation of soybean chilling injury based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and crop modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent chilling injury has serious impacts on national food security and in northeastern China heavily affects grain yields. Timely and accurate measures are desirable for assessing associated large-scale impacts and are prerequisites to disaster reduction. Therefore, we propose a novel means to efficiently assess the impacts of chilling injury on soybean. Specific chilling injury events were diagnosed in 1989, 1995, 2003, 2009, and 2018 in Oroqen community. In total, 512 combinations scenarios were established using the localized CROPGRO-Soybean model. Furthermore, we determined the maximum wide dynamic vegetation index (WDRVI) and corresponding date of critical windows of the early and late growing seasons using the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, then constructed 1600 cold vulnerability models on CDD (Cold Degree Days), the simulated LAI (Leaf Area Index) and yields from the CROPGRO-Soybean model. Finally, we calculated pixel yields losses according to the corresponding vulnerability models. The findings show that simulated historical yield losses in 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2009 were measured at 9.6%, 29.8%, 50.5%, and 15.7%, respectively, closely (all errors are within one standard deviation) reflecting actual losses (6.4%, 39.2%, 47.7%, and 13.2%, respectively). The above proposed method was applied to evaluate the yield loss for 2018 at the pixel scale. Specifically, a sentinel-2A image was used for 10-m high precision yield mapping, and the estimated losses were found to characterize the actual yield losses from 2018 cold events. The results highlight that the proposed method can efficiently and accurately assess the effects of chilling injury on soybean crops.

TI  - Representation, conceptualization and positioning in Critical Discourse Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PRAGMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper explores the current nexus between Cognitive Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), focusing on theories of conceptual positioning, distancing and perspective-taking in discourse space. It assesses the strengths, limitations, and prospects for further operationalization of positioning as a valid methodology in CDA, and political discourse studies in particular. In the first part, I review the cognitive models of positioning that have made the most significant contribution to CDA. Discussing Deictic Space Theory and Text World Theory, among others, I argue that these models reveal further theoretical potential which has not been exploited yet. While they offer a comprehensive and plausible account of how representations and ideologically charged worldviews are established, they fail to deliver a pragmatic explanation of how addressees are made to establish a worldview, in the service of speaker's goals. The second part of the paper outlines Proximization Theory, a discursive model of crisis and conflict construction in political discourse. I argue that, unlike the other models, it fully captures the complex geopolitical and ideological positioning in political discourse space, providing a viable handle on the dynamics of conflict between the opposing ideologies of the space.

TI  - A closer look at anthropogenic fiber ingestion in <i>Aristeus antennatus</i> in the NW Mediterranean Sea: Differences among years and locations and impact on health condition
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine litter is one of the most concerning threats for marine wildlife especially regarding plastics and their micro-sized forms, widely known as microplastics. The present study evaluates mesoscale spatial (230 km, Catalan coast) and temporal (2007 vs 2017-2018, Barcelona area) differences on the ingestion of anthropogenic fibers in the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus in the NW Mediterranean Sea and its relation with shrimp's health condition. Synthetic fibers with lengths ranging between 0.16 and 37.9 mm were found in both stomach (where sometimes they were tangled up in balls) and intestine contents. The percentage of fiber occurrence was >65% at each sampling point. Tangled balls of fibers observed in stomach contents exhibited a wide range of sizes (up to a diameter of 1 cm) and were usually composed of fibers of different polymers, sizes and colours. Differences between locations (2018) were found, with greater fiber loads towards the south during spring and a great variability in summer, as shrimps caught off Barcelona showed a nearly thirty-times higher fiber load compared to shrimps from other localities. Highest concentrations were more likely to be related to major sources of fibers and currents in the area. Fiber load in shrimps from 2007 was comparable to that of shrimps captured in 2017 and 2018 (spring) yet a shift in the proportion of acrylic and polyester polymers was detected. No consistent effect on shrimp's health condition was found, with only a significant negative correlation found between gonadosomatic index and fibers for those shrimps with the highest values of fiber load (caught off Barcelona, summer 2018). Our findings contribute to the knowledge on plastic pollution for the NW Mediterranean Sea and highlight the potential use of this species as a sentinel species for plastic fiber contamination.

TI  - Geophysical and Sedimentological Investigations Integrate Remote-Sensing Data to Depict Geometry of Fluvial Sedimentary Bodies: An Example from Holocene Point-Bar Deposits of the Venetian Plain (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few millennia, meandering fluvial channels drained coastal landscapes accumulating sedimentary successions that today are permeable pathways. Propagation of pollutants, agricultural exploitation and sand liquefaction are the main processes of environmental interest affecting these sedimentary bodies. The characterization of these bodies is thus of utmost general interest. In this study, we particularly highlight the contribution of noninvasive (remote and ground-based) investigation techniques, and the case study focuses on a late Holocene meander bend of the southern Venetian Plain (Northeast Italy). Electromagnetic induction (EMI) investigations, conducted with great care in terms of sonde stability and positioning, allowed the reconstruction of the electrical conductivity 3D structure of the shallow subsurface, revealing that the paleochannel ranges in depth between 0.8 and 5.4 m, and defines an almost 260 m-wide point bar. The electrical conductivity maps derived from EMI at different depths define an arcuate morphology indicating that bar accretion started from an already sinuous channel. Sedimentary cores ensure local ground-truth and help define the evolution of the channel bend. This paper shows that the combination of well-conceived and carefully performed inverted geophysical surveys, remote sensing and direct investigations provides evidence of the evolution of recent shallow sedimentary structures with unprecedented detail.

TI  - A New Algorithm to Estimate Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient from Secchi Disk Depth
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(PAR) is used for calculating the euphotic zone, the first optical depth that is important for primary productivity models. Currently, K-d (PAR)can be estimated using an irradiometer or a Secchi disk (SD). The main objective of this work is to define a model that can be applied to a wide range of optical marine conditions to estimate K-d (PAR) by SD. We used irradiance profiles and SD depth (ZSD) from 679 stations in various marine regions. Three parametric models were developed, and their statistical performance was evaluated in view of previous approaches reported and remote sensing data. The best results were obtained with an adaptive model representing three cases: clear-water, turbid-water, and a transition zone (R-2 = 0.965, MAE = 0.083, RMSD = 0.239, BIAS = 0.01, and MPI = 0.854). Previous models considering a single optical depth figure at which the SD disappears did not capture the marine optical complexity. Our classification of 113 stations with spectral absorption data into Jerlov water types indicated that no unique correspondence existed between estimated K-d(PAR) and water type, making it ambiguous to associate compatible inherent optical properties and chlorophyll with ZSD. Although obtaining K-d(PAR) from ZSD is simple/low-cost, care should be taken in the methodology used to measure ZSD to ensure consistent results across different optical marine conditions.

TI  - Machine Learning Nowcasting of PV Energy Using Satellite Data
T2  - NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-measured radiances are obviously of great interest for photovoltaic (PV) energy prediction. In this work we will use them together with clear sky irradiance estimates for the nowcasting of PV energy productions over peninsular Spain. We will feed them directly into two linear Machine Learning models, Lasso and linear Support Vector Regression (SVR), and two highly non-linear ones, Deep Neural Networks (in particular, Multilayer Perceptrons, MLPs) and Gaussian SVRs. We shall also use a simple clear sky-based persistence model for benchmarking purposes. We consider prediction horizons of up to 6 h, with Gaussian SVR being statistically better than the other models at each horizon, since its errors increase slowly with time (with an average of 1.92% for the first three horizons and of 2.89% for the last three). MLPs performance is close to that of the Gaussian SVR for the longer horizons (with an average of 3.1%) but less so at the initial ones (average of 2.26%), being nevertheless significantly better than the linear models. As it could be expected, linear models give weaker results (in the initial horizons, Lasso and linear SVR have already an error of 3.21% and 3.46%, respectively), but we will take advantage of the spatial sparsity provided by Lasso to try to identify the concrete areas with a larger influence on PV energy nowcasts.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Trends of Burnt Area in Angola: Implications for Natural Vegetation and Protected Area Management
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a key driver of natural ecosystems in Africa. However, human activity and climate change have altered fire frequency and severity, with negative consequences for biodiversity conservation. Angola ranks among the countries with the highest fire activity in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal trends of the annual burnt area in Angola, from 2001 to 2019, and their association with terrestrial ecoregions, land cover, and protected areas. Based on satellite imagery, we analyzed the presence of significant trends in burnt area, applying the contextual Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen slope estimator. Data on burnt areas were obtained from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product and the analyses were processed in TerrSet. Our results showed that ca. 30% of the country's area burned every year. The highest percentage of annual burnt area was found in northeast and southeast Angola, which showed large clusters of decreasing trends of burnt area. The clusters of increasing trends were found mainly in central Angola, associated with savannas and grasslands of Angolan Miombo woodlands. The protected areas of Cameia, Luengue-Luiana, and Mavinga exhibited large areas of decreasing trends of burnt area. Conversely, 23% of the Bicuar National Park was included in clusters of increasing trends. Distinct patterns of land cover were found in areas of significant trends, where the clusters of increasing trends showed a higher fraction of forest cover (80%) than the clusters of decreasing trends (55%). The documentation of burnt area trends was very important in tropical regions, since it helped define conservation priorities and management strategies, allowing more effective management of forests and fires in countries with few human and financial resources.

TI  - Estimation of Seasonal Evapotranspiration for Crops in Arid Regions Using Multisource Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) from crops is crucial in irrigation management, crop yield assessment, and optimal allocation of water resources, particularly in arid regions. This study explores the estimation of seasonal evapotranspiration for crops using multisource remote sensing images. The proposed estimation framework starts with estimating daily evapotranspiration (ETd) values, which are then used to calculate ET estimates during the crop growing season (ETs). We incorporated Landsat images into the surface energy balance algorithm over land (SEBAL) model, and we used the trapezoidal and sinusoidal methods to estimate the seasonal ET. The trapezoidal method used multitemporal ET(d)images, while the sinusoidal method employs time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and multitemporal ET(d)images. Experiments were implemented in the agricultural lands of the Kai-Kong River Basin, Xinjiang, China. The experimental results show that the obtained ET(d)estimates using the SEBAL model are comparable with those from the Penman-Monteith method. The ET(s)obtained using the trapezoidal and sinusoidal methods both have a relatively high spatial resolution of 30 m. The sinusoidal method performs better than the trapezoidal method when using low temporal resolution Landsat images. We observed that the omission of Landsat images during the middle stage of crop growth has the greatest impact on the estimation results of ET(s)using the sinusoidal method. Based on the results of the study, we conclude that the proposed sinusoidal method, with integrated multisource remote sensing images, offers a useful tool in estimating seasonal evapotranspiration for crops in arid regions.

TI  - Mapping the Essential Urban Land Use in Changchun by Applying Random Forest and Multi-Source Geospatial Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding urban spatial pattern of land use is of great significance to urban land management and resource allocation. Urban space has strong heterogeneity, and thus there were many researches focusing on the identification of urban land use. The emergence of multiple new types of geospatial data provide an opportunity to investigate the methods of mapping essential urban land use. The popularization of street view images represented by Baidu Maps is benificial to the rapid acquisition of high-precision street view data, which has attracted the attention of scholars in the field of urban research. In this study, OpenStreetMap (OSM) was used to delineate parcels which were recognized as basic mapping units. A semantic segmentation of street view images was combined to enrich the multi-dimensional description of urban parcels, together with point of interest (POI), Sentinel-2A, and Luojia-1 nighttime light data. Furthermore, random forest (RF) was applied to determine the urban land use categories. The results show that street view elements are related to urban land use in the perspective of spatial distribution. It is reasonable and feasible to describe urban parcels according to the characteristics of street view elements. Due to the participation of street view, the overall accuracy reaches 79.13%. The contribution of street view features to the optimal classification model reached 20.6%, which is more stable than POI features.

TI  - Assessing spatial and temporal variability in water consumption and the maintainability oasis maximum area in an oasis region of Northwestern China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water consumption is a key role in improving the efficiency and sustainability of water management in arid environments. In this study, we explored an approach based on meta-analysis, MODIS NDVI products, land-use spatial distribution, and soil water physical parameters to gain insight into long-term and large scale distribution of land use and water consumption, maintain maximum Zhangye Oasis area according to Heihe River runoff and suitable water resource management in Zhangye Oasis. This approach was initiated in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation and water resource management in arid regions Results showed that Heihe River runoff can maintain a maximum Zhangye Oasis area of 22.49x10(4) hm(2). During the 2000-2016 growing seasons, actual oasis water consumption ranged from 11.35 x10(8) m(3) to 13.73 x10(8) with a mean of (12.89 +/- 0.60) x10(8) m(3); if maintaining agricultural production and oasis stability was chosen, oasis water consumption ranged from 10.24 x10(8) m(3) to 12.37 x 10(8) m(3), with a mean of (11.62 +/- 0.53)x10(8) m(3). From the perspective of water resources management and ecosystem stability, it is necessary to reduce the area of Zhangye Oasis or choose the minimum water consumption method to manage the oasis, to ease the pressure of water shortage and maintain stable and sustainable development of the Zhangye Oasis. These results can provide future practical guidance for water resource management of coordinated development of the economy and the environment in an arid area.

TI  - Estimation of all-sky all-wave daily net radiation at high latitudes from MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface all-wave net radiation (R-n) plays an important role in various land surface processes, such as agricultural, ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes. Recently, remote sensing of R-n at regional and global scales has attracted considerable attention and has achieved significant advances. However, there are many issues in estimating all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes, such as posing greater uncertainty by surface and atmosphere satellite products at high latitudes, and unavailability of real-time and accurate cloud base height and temperature parameters. In this study, we developed the LRD (length ratio of daytime) classification model using the genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) to estimate all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. With a very high temporal repeating frequency (similar to 6 to 20 times per day) at high latitudes, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to test the proposed method. R-n measurements at 82 sites and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data of MODIS from 2000 to 2017 were matched for model training and validation. Two models for estimating daily average R-n were developed: model I based on instantaneous daytime MODIS observation and model II based on instantaneous nighttime MODIS observation. Validation results of model I showed an R-2 of 0.85, an RMSE of 23.66 W/m(2), and a bias of 0.27 W/m(2), whereas these values were 0.51, 15.04 W/m(2), and -0.08 W/m(2) for model II, respectively. Overall, the proposed machine learning algorithm with the LRD classification can accurately estimate the all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. Mapping of R-n over the high latitudes at 1 km spatial resolution showed a similar spatial distribution to R-n estimates from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. This method has the potential for operational monitoring of spatio-temporal change of R-n at high latitudes with a long-term coverage of MODIS observations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Northern Limit of Winter Wheat in China Using MODIS Time Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatiotemporal changes of the northern limit of winter wheat (NLWW) in China is important to ensure regional food security and deal with the effects of climate change. Previous studies mainly used climate indicators to analyze the variation of the potential NLWW in different historical periods, while little attention has been paid to the actual migrations and changes of the NLWW. The objectives of the present study were three-fold: (i) to map the spatial distribution of winter wheat in northern China in 2001, 2007, 2014 and 2019; (ii) to extract the actual NLWW; and (iii) to quantitatively explore the dynamics of the NLWW. First, we adopted the "combining variations before and after estimated heading dates" method to map the winter wheat in northern China based on time series MODIS EVI2 data. Second, we used the kernel density estimation algorithm to extract the actual NLWW in four historical periods. Finally, the fishnet method was utilized to quantitatively analyze the direction and distance of the spatiotemporal changes of the NLWW. The results demonstrated that the NLWW has exhibited a marked fluctuating trend of migration southward, with a 37-km shift in latitude over the past 20 years. The elevation limit of winter wheat planting was around 1600 m; however, the centroid of winter wheat planting has shifted slowly to lower elevations. There was a gap between the actual NLWW and the potential NLWW. The reason for this gap was that the actual NLWW moved southward under the interacting effects of human activities and climate change, while the potential NLWW moved northward due to climate change. The results of this study are of great scientific value in the formulation of winter wheat planting strategies in climate-sensitive areas to respond to climate change and ensure food security.

TI  - A Novel Classification Extension-Based Cloud Detection Method for Medium-Resolution Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cloud detection using medium-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (such as Landsat and Sentinel data) is always difficult due to the complex land surfaces, diverse cloud types, and limited number of available spectral bands, especially in the case of images without thermal bands. In this paper, a novel classification extension-based cloud detection (CECD) method was proposed for masking clouds in the medium-resolution images. The new method does not rely on thermal bands and can be used for masking clouds in different types of medium-resolution satellite imagery. First, with the support of low-resolution satellite imagery with short revisit periods, cloud and non-cloud pixels were identified in the resampled low-resolution version of the medium-resolution cloudy image. Then, based on the identified cloud and non-cloud pixels and the resampled cloudy image, training samples were automatically collected to develop a random forest (RF) classifier. Finally, the developed RF classifier was extended to the corresponding medium-resolution cloudy image to generate an accurate cloud mask. The CECD method was applied to Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to test the performance for different satellite images, and the well-known function of mask (FMASK) method was employed for comparison with our method. The results indicate that CECD is more accurate at detecting clouds in Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery, giving an average F-measure value of 97.65% and 97.11% for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery, respectively, as against corresponding results of 90.80% and 88.47% for FMASK. It is concluded, therefore, that the proposed CECD algorithm is an effective cloud-classification algorithm that can be applied to the medium-resolution optical satellite imagery.

TI  - An Efficient Local Search Heuristic for Earth Observation Satellite Integrated Scheduling
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation satellites (EOSs) are taking a large number of pictures with increasing resolution which produce massive image data. Satellite data transmission becomes the bottleneck part in the process of EOS resource management. In this paper, we study the earth observation satellite integrated scheduling problem (EOSIS) where the imaging activities and download activities are considered integratively. We propose an integer linear programming model to formulate the problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose an efficient local search heuristic (ELSH) to solve problems of large size. ELSH uses a dedicated local search method to guarantee algorithm performance and efficient constraint handling mechanisms to guarantee algorithm efficiency. Numerical experimental results show that the algorithm demonstrates excellent performance on a set of benchmark instances. The ELSH achieves optimal results for all small-size instances (with 50 targets, two satellites, and three ground stations), and is very robust for large instances with up to 2000 targets. Moreover, the proposed ELSH easily dominates the state-of-the-art algorithm.

TI  - Relationships of ozone formation sensitivity with precursors emissions, meteorology and land use types, in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the influences of precursors emissions, meteorology, geography and other factors, ozone formation sensitivity (OFS) is generally spatially and temporally heterogeneous. This study characterized detailed spatial and temporal variations of OFS in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2012 to 2016 based on OMI satellite data, and analyzed the relationships of OFS with precursors emissions, meteorology and land use types (LUTs). From 2012 to 2016, the OFS tended to be NOx-limited in GBA, with the value of FNR (HCHO/NO2) increasing from 2.04 to 2.22. According to the total annual emission statistics of precursors, NOx emissions decreased by 33.1% and VOCs emissions increased by 35.2% from 2012 to 2016, directly resulting in OFS tending to be NOx-limited. The Grey Relation Analysis results show that total column water (TCW), surface net solar radiation (SSR), air temperature at 2 m (T2) and surface pressure (SP) are the top four meteorological factors with the greatest influences on OFS. There are significant positive correlations between FNR and T2, SSR, TCW, and significant negative correlations between FNR and SP. In GBA, the OFS tends to be NOx-limited regime in wet season (higher T2, SSR, TCW and lower SP) and VOCs-limited regime in dry season (lower T2, SSR, TCW and higher SP). The FNR displays obvious gradient variations on different LUTs, with the highest in "Rural areas", second in "Suburban areas" and lowest in "Urban areas".

TI  - Use of public Earth observation data for tracking progress in sustainable management of coastal forest ecosystems in Belize, Central America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 15 addresses the protection of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable forest management, and Target 15.2 encourages countries to sustainably manage forests, and halt deforestation by 2020. SDG indicator 15.1.1 proposes tracking forest area as an indicator for achieving that SDG. Though mangrove forests represent only about 5% of Belize's overall forest cover, the critical ecosystem services they provide are recognized in the country's Forests Act, which regulates the modification of mangrove ecosystems. Preceding the SDGs, from 2008 to 2009, the Government of Belize piloted a complete moratorium on mangrove removal, building on the Forests Act. As Earth Observation (EO) systems provide a means to track effectiveness of Belize's management of its mangrove forests, this paper examines historic and recent changes in mangrove cover across all of Belize, applying statistical adjustments to rates of change derived from Landsat satellite data. Particular attention was paid to the country's only World Heritage Site, the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System (BBRRS), where mangrove clearing was prohibited since the site's designation in December 1996. The data indicate that within the BBRRS, approximately 89 ha of mangroves were lost from 1996 to 2017, compared to the estimated loss of 2703 ha outside the BBRRS during the same period, and nationwide loss of almost 4100 ha from 1980 to 2017. Thus, compared to the mangroves outside of the BBRRS, the annual rate of mangrove loss within the BBRRS over the period 1996-2017 was merely 4.24 ha per year, versus 129.11 ha per year outside the BBRRS. Furthermore, almost 75% of the 1996-2017 mangrove loss outside the BBRRS were concentrated in three particular geographic zones associated with tourism infrastructure. It was also estimated that Belize's overall mangrove cover declined 5.4% over 36 years, from 76,250 ha in 1980 to 72,169 ha in 2017. In terms of its implications, in addition to contributing to SDG 15, this work also addresses SDG Target 14.2 regarding sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems. This study serves as a use case of how EO data can contribute to monitoring changes in baseline data and thus tracking of progress toward SDG Targets.

TI  - Urban Tree Health Classification Across Tree Species by Combining Airborne Laser Scanning and Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining urban tree health can affect critical ecosystem services, such as air quality improvement, temperature moderation, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation. The application of state-of-the-art remote sensing data to characterize tree health has been widely examined in forest ecosystems. However, such application to urban trees has not yet been fully explored-due to the presence of heterogeneous tree species and backgrounds, severely complicating the classification of tree health using remote sensing information. In this study, tree health was represented by a set of field-assessed tree health indicators (defoliation, discoloration, and a combination thereof), which were classified using airborne laser scanning (ALS) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with a Random Forest classifier. Different classification scenarios were established aiming at: (i) Comparing the performance of ALS data, HSI and their combination, and (ii) examining to what extent tree species mixtures affect classification accuracy. Our results show that although the predictive power of ALS and HSI indices varied between tree species and tree health indicators, overall ALS indices performed better. The combined use of both ALS and HSI indices results in the highest accuracy, with weighted kappa coefficients (Kc) ranging from 0.53 to 0.79 and overall accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. Overall, the most informative remote sensing indices indicating urban tree health are ALS indices related to point density, tree size, and shape, and HSI indices associated with chlorophyll absorption. Our results further indicate that a species-specific modelling approach is advisable (Kc points improved by 0.07 on average compared with a mixed species modelling approach). Our study constitutes a basis for future urban tree health monitoring, which will enable managers to guide early remediation management.

TI  - UAV-Based Multispectral Phenotyping for Disease Resistance to Accelerate Crop Improvement under Changing Climate Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerating crop improvement for increased yield and better adaptation to changing climatic conditions is an issue of increasing urgency in order to satisfy the ever-increasing global food demand. However, the major bottleneck is the absence of high-throughput plant phenotyping methods for rapid and cost-effective data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding. Traditional phenotyping methods that rely on trained experts are slow, costly, labor-intensive, subjective, and often require destructive sampling. We explore ways to improve the efficiency of crop phenotyping through the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remotely sensed data in maize (Zea maysL.) varietal response to maize streak virus (MSV) disease. Twenty-five maize varieties grown in a trial with three replications were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Ground scoring for MSV infection was carried out at mid-vegetative, flowering, and mid-grain filling on a scale of 1 (resistant) to 9 (susceptible). UAV-derived spectral data were acquired at these three different phenological stages in multispectral bands corresponding to Green (0.53-0.57 mu m), Red (0.64-0.68 mu m), Rededge (0.73-0.74 mu m), and Near-Infrared (0.77-0.81 mu m). The imagery captured was stitched together in Pix4Dmapper, which generates two types of multispectral orthomosaics: the NoAlpha and the transparent mosaics for each band. The NoAlpha imagery was used as input into QGIS to extract reflectance data. Six vegetation indices were derived for each variety: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), Rededge NDVI (NDVIrededge), Simple Ratio (SR), green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen), and Rededge Chlorophyll Index (CIrededge). The Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to evaluate UAV-derived spectral and VIs with and without variable optimization. Correlations between the UAV-derived data and manual MSV scores were significant (R = 0.74-0.84). Varieties were classified into resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible with overall classification accuracies of 77.3% (Kappa = 0.64) with optimized and 68.2% (Kappa = 0.51) without optimized variables, representing an improvement of similar to 13.3% due to variable optimization. The RF model selected GNDVI, CIgreen, CIrededge, and the Red band as the most important variables for classification. Mid-vegetative was the most ideal phenological stage for accurate varietal phenotyping and discrimination using UAV-derived multispectral data with RF under artificial MSV inoculation. The results provide a rapid UAV-based remote sensing solution that offers a step-change towards data availability at high spatial (submeter) and temporal (daily/weekly) resolution in varietal analysis for quick and robust high-throughput plant phenotyping, important for timely and unbiased data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding programs, especially as climate change accelerates.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Remote sensing data and methods are increasingly being embedded into assessments of volcanic processes and risk. This happens thanks to their capability to provide a spectrum of observation and measurement opportunities to accurately sense the dynamics, magnitude, frequency, and impacts of volcanic activity in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and microwave domains. Launched in mid-2018, the Special Issue "Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk" ofRemote Sensinggathers 19 research papers on the use of satellite, aerial, and ground-based remote sensing to detect thermal features and anomalies, investigate lava and pyroclastic flows, predict the flow path of lahars, measure gas emissions and plumes, and estimate ground deformation. The strong multi-disciplinary character of the approaches employed for volcano monitoring and the combination of a variety of sensor types, platforms, and methods that come out from the papers testify the current scientific and technology trends toward multi-data and multi-sensor monitoring solutions. The research advances presented in the published papers are achieved thanks to a wealth of data including but not limited to the following: thermal IR from satellite missions (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, TET-1) and ground-based stations (e.g., FLIR cameras); digital elevation/surface models from airborne sensors (e.g., Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), or 3D laser scans) and satellite imagery (e.g., tri-stereo Pleiades, SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope); airborne hyperspectral surveys; geophysics (e.g., ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, magnetic survey); ground-based acoustic infrasound; ground-based scanning UV spectrometers; and ground-based and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging (e.g., TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2). Data processing approaches and methods include change detection, offset tracking, Interferometric SAR (InSAR), photogrammetry, hotspots and anomalies detection, neural networks, numerical modeling, inversion modeling, wavelet transforms, and image segmentation. Some authors also share codes for automated data analysis and demonstrate methods for post-processing standard products that are made available for end users, and which are expected to stimulate the research community to exploit them in other volcanological application contexts. The geographic breath is global, with case studies in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Hawai'i, Alaska, Kamchatka, Japan, Indonesia, Vanuatu, Reunion Island, Ethiopia, Canary Islands, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. The added value of the published research lies on the demonstration of the benefits that these remote sensing technologies have brought to knowledge of volcanoes that pose risk to local communities; back-analysis and critical revision of recent volcanic eruptions and unrest periods; and improvement of modeling and prediction methods. Therefore, this Special Issue provides not only a collection of forefront research in remote sensing applied to volcanology, but also a selection of case studies proving the societal impact that this scientific discipline can potentially generate on volcanic hazard and risk management.

TI  - Machine Learning for Cloud Detection of Globally Distributed Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a number of different procedures have been proposed for segmentation of remote sensing images, basing on spectral information. Model-based and machine learning strategies have been investigated in several studies. This work presents a comprehensive overview and an unbiased comparison of the most adopted segmentation strategies: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Neural networks, Sen2Cor, FMask and MAJA. We used a training set for learning and two different independent sets for testing. The comparison accounted for 135 images acquired from 54 different worldwide sites. We observed that machine learning segmentations are extremely reliable when the training and test are homogeneous. SVM performed slightly better than other methods. In particular, when using heterogeneous test data, SVM remained the most accurate segmentation method while state-of-the-art model-based methods such as MAJA and FMask obtained better sensitivity and precision, respectively. Therefore, even if each method has its specific advantages and drawbacks, SVM resulted in a competitive option for remote sensing applications.

TI  - The Way of the Livingness and Universal Medicine
T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Universal Medicine, founded by Serge Benhayon (b. 1964), is an Australian movement offering a distinct style of alternative therapies. It is supported by an esoteric worldview called The Way of the Livingness. Occult beliefs and practices are poorly understood in Western cultures such as Australia, and Benhayon has encountered sustained criticism on a range of issues commonly faced by other new religions. Public reaction betrays fears of secretive and inappropriate activities, which are amplified by the Australian media's penchant for targeting cult activities. While Universal Medicine pursues practices that would pass without comment in other national contexts, its organization, visibility, and esoteric pursuits make it an easy target for polemics in Australia. This article explores key aspects of The Way of the Livingness and outlines Universal Medicine's founding and organizational structure. The movement is further contextualized within the Theosophical tradition following Alice A. Bailey (1880-1849), ideas from the New Age, and Australian culture.

TI  - Macrophytes' abundance changes in eutrophicated tropical reservoirs exemplified by Salto Grande (Brazil): Trends and temporal analysis exploiting Landsat remotely sensed data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - River damming for electric power production generally triggers a set of anthropic activities that strongly impact on aquatic ecosystem, especially in small reservoirs located in urbanized and industrialized areas. Among the possible adverse effects is the over-abundance of aquatic macrophytes resulting from the input of high concentration of nutrients in the ecosystem that can affect the health of the ecosystem. In these situations, macrophytes are treated as weeds that need to be continuously monitored and analysed over time. Historically, remote sensing has played a prominent role in change detection studies and, nowadays, considering the open data sources of multi-temporal images and the high computational performance that allows for larger volumes of historical images to be mined, water monitoring is a recurrent object of analysis. The Salto Grande reservoir is a small water body located in the metropolitan region of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, characterized by high rates of urbanization and industrialization. The intense anthropic occupation around the reservoir triggered the degradation of the landscape and the decrease of water quality. This study explored the potential of image-attributes' time series to monitor the spatio-temporal behavior of aquatic macrophytes in the Salto Grande Reservoir. Our assumption was that the combination of techniques for analyzing large multi-temporal datasets enables us to understand the trends and changes in the macrophytes occurrence in this small reservoir. To achieve this, quarterly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series based on Landsat data imagery from 1984 to 2017 were built to analyze the occurrence and persistence of these aquatic plants in the reservoir. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the NDVI time series, which allowed us to identify typical years in the abundance of macrophytes and twelve regions of greater and lesser temporal variability in its abundance, by a K-means aggregation of the first principal component scores. For these regions, the Breaks for Additive and Seasonality Trend (BFAST) algorithm was used to analyze the trend, cyclic behaviour, and changes in the time series of the average NDVI. BFAST was able to detect gradual and abrupt changes for each of the twelve areas by searching for breakpoints in the temporal series. It was observed that the regions near the dam and where the conditions of the river are still maintained are most affected by the occurrence of macrophytes, characterized by an average NDVI greater than 0.4. Although subject to more subtle seasonal variations, all these regions defined at least one breakpoint, suggesting abrupt changes such as sharp interventions to control the overabundance of macrophytes at specific time. The regions located in the middle of the reservoir, with a more lacustrine influence, had lower average NDVI and small variations over time. Thus, it was possible to identify the critical regions of the studied reservoir with excess of growing macrophytes through the applied method, which also can be applied to similar areas.

TI  - A Simplified Framework for High-Resolution Urban Vegetation Classification with Optical Imagery in the Los Angeles Megacity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution maps of Los Angeles, California are needed to capture the heterogeneity of urban land cover while spanning the regional domain used in carbon and water cycle models. We present a simplified framework for developing a high spatial resolution map of urban vegetation cover in the Southern California Air Basin (SoCAB) with publicly available satellite imagery. This method uses Sentinel-2 (10-60 x 10-60 m) and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) (0.6 x 0.6 m) optical imagery to classify urban and non-urban areas of impervious surface, tree, grass, shrub, bare soil/non-photosynthetic vegetation, and water. Our approach was designed for Los Angeles, a geographically complex megacity characterized by diverse Mediterranean land cover and a mix of high-rise buildings and topographic features that produce strong shadow effects. We show that a combined NAIP and Sentinel-2 classification reduces misclassified shadow pixels and resolves spatially heterogeneous vegetation gradients across urban and non-urban regions in SoCAB at 0.6-10 m resolution with 85% overall accuracy and 88% weighted overall accuracy. Results from this study will enable the long-term monitoring of land cover change associated with urbanization and quantification of biospheric contributions to carbon and water cycling in cities.

TI  - Training data requirements for fire severity mapping using Landsat imagery and random forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to map fire severity is a requirement for fire management agencies worldwide. The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes, to set priorities for post-fire management responses, and for research applications. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest, have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery. However, an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking. This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest, woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine how sample size (i.e. number of training points and fire events) and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy; (ii) to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions; and (iii) to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires. We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019, to derive an extensive dataset (n = 25, 350 points) suitable for model training and validation. Five fire severity classes were mapped across the forest, woodland and shrubland communities. Using independent spatial cross validation of wildfires, we found that a minimum of 300 sample points per severity class, sampled across at least ten independent fires, was sufficient to reach the upper threshold of classification accuracy for the five severity classes. Training datasets derived across broad environmental space or close (<= 100 km) to the target fire (i.e. fire to be mapped) produced better predictions than those derived regionally and far (> 100 km) from the target fire. Models trained on data derived from both wildfires and prescribed burns had similar overall accuracy as those trained only on data from the fire type being predicted. However, there were significant differences in accuracy between the models trained with wildfires, prescribed burns and combined datasets within some severity classes. The random forest classifier had an overall accuracy of similar to 88% for wildfires and similar to 68% for prescribed burns across the study fires. The discrepancy in accuracy between wildfires and burns was likely due to the poorer classification performance for low fire severity classes, the dominant severity classes in prescribed burns. Overall classification accuracy was relatively consistent across forest, woodland and shrubland communities within the study fires, indicating that the method is robust across the temperate forest biome of southern Australia. Our results demonstrate that consideration of training data properties, specifically the number of points and fires sampled, sample balance and the geographic source of sample data, will be important considerations for the automated mapping of fire severity using random forest classification and Landsat imagery.

TI  - Imaging Predictors for Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastases in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:The relationship between imaging features and nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis is not clear.Objectives:To determine whether imaging features could predict NSLN metastasis in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive breast cancer patients and to provide new clues for avoiding unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection.Method:171 patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes and a pathologically positive SLN were recruited between January 2007 and January 2014. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), the effects of clinicopathological factors, especially imaging features, on NSLN metastases were assessed by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.Results:The average number of dissected SLNs was 2.11 (range, 1-6); 56 of the 171 (32.75%) patients exhibited NSLN metastases. In univariate analysis, tumor size, number of positive SLNs, ratio of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins, ultrasonographic mass margins, and ultrasonographic vascularity were significantly correlated with NSLN involvement. Furthermore, through multivariate analysis, tumor size, number of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins, and ultrasonographic vascularity were still independent predictors of NSLN involvement. Additionally, in SLN-positive patients, number of positive SLNs and ultrasonographic vascularity could also predict the tumor burden in NSLN.Conclusions:In addition to tumor size and the number of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins and ultrasonographic vascularity were also independent predictors of NSLN metastases in SLN-positive patients of breast cancer. The number of positive SLNs and ultrasonographic vascularity could also predict the tumor burden in NSLN.

TI  - High-resolution optical remote sensing for coastal benthic habitat mapping: A case study of the Suape Estuarine-Bay, Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits of high resolution remote sensing techniques and data for the mapping of coastal environments include their ability to capture the spatial variability of the rich and diverse sedimentary landforms and habitats of coastal systems as well as gather and manage different types of data and information using the same platform for multi-scale and multi-layer analysis. This work analyses the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery for mapping benthic habitat and the seascape characteristics of a coastal lagoon (Suape Bay - 40 km south of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil) subjected to high anthropogenic impact and exposed to different conditions of tides, suspended sediment regime, and wave dynamics, using different types of processing and classification methods. We analyzed two World View 2 images acquired in 2010 and 2015 in similar tidal conditions and low water turbidity. Preprocessing included the application of radiometric and atmospheric correction, sunglint removal, and land/sea areas masking. To extract the depth information, a Band Ratio and Simple Radiative Transfer Model were employed. The model was corrected and calibrated by using a set of 150 control points collected by echo sounding surveying. A benthic terrain model was developed to identify and map topographic features at broad and fine scales. Supervised Pixel and Object-Based classification methods were applied to visible bands of WV2 and bathymetric data to produce benthic habitat maps of the lagoon area. The analyses were validated by ground truthing based on bottom sediment sampling, underwater photographs, and side scan sonar surveys.

TI  - A global cloud free pixel- based image composite from Sentinel-2 data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Large-scale land cover classification from satellite imagery is still a challenge due to the big volume of data to be processed, to persistent cloud-cover in cloud-prone areas as well as seasonal artefacts that affect spatial homogeneity. Sentinel-2 times series from Copernicus Earth Observation program offer a great potential for fine scale land cover mapping thanks to high spatial and temporal resolutions, with a decametric resolution and five-day repeat time. However, the selection of best available scenes, their download together with the requirements in terms of storage and computing resources pose restrictions for large-scale land cover mapping. The dataset presented in this paper corresponds to global cloud-free pixel based composite created from the Sentinel-2 data archive (Level L1C) available in Google Earth Engine for the period January 2017- December 2018. The methodology used for generating the image composite is described and the metadata associated with the 10 m resolution dataset is presented. The data with a total volume of 15 TB is stored on the Big Data platform of the Joint Research Centre. It can be downloaded per UTM grid zone, loaded into GIS clients and displayed easily thanks to pre-computed overviews. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Landscape Dynamics in an Iconic Watershed of Northwestern Mexico: Vegetation Condition Insights Using Landsat and PlanetScope Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural vegetation in arid and semi-arid environments of Northwestern Mexico has been subject to transformation due to extensive and intensive human occupation related mostly to primary activities. Keystone habitats such as riparian ecosystems are extremely sensitive to land use changes that occur in their surrounding landscape. In this study, we developed remote sensing-based land cover classifications and post-classification fragmentation analysis, by using data from Landsat's moderate resolution sensors Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager (TM and OLI) to assess land use changes and the shift in landscape configuration in a riparian corridor of a dynamic watershed in central Sonora during the last 30 years. In addition, we derived a high spatial resolution classification (using PlanetScope-PS2 imagery) to assess the "recent state" of the riparian corridor. According to our results, riparian vegetation has increased by 40%, although only 9% of this coverage corresponds to obligate riparian species. Scrub area shows a declining trend, with a loss of more than 17,000 ha due to the expansion of mesquite and buffelgrass-dominated areas. The use of moderate resolution Landsat data was essential to register changes in vegetation cover through time, however, higher resolution PlanetScope data were fundamental for the detection of limited aerial extent classes such as obligate riparian vegetation. The unregulated development of anthropogenic activities is suggested to be the main driver of land cover change processes for arid ecosystems in this region. These results highlight the urgent need for alternative management and restoration projects in an area where there is almost a total lack of protection regulations or conservation efforts.

TI  - Ideological (A)symmetries in prejudice and intergroup bias
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The traditional perspective on the political ideology and prejudice relationship holds that political conservatism is associated with prejudice, and that the types of dispositional characteristics associated with conservatism (e.g. low cognitive ability, low Openness) explain this relationship. This conclusion is limited by the limited number and types of groups studied. When researchers use a more heterogeneous array of targets, people across the political spectrum express prejudice against groups with dissimilar values and beliefs. Evidence for this worldview conflict perspective emerges in both politics and religion, as well as individual differences such as Openness, disgust sensitivity and cognitive ability. Although these two perspectives differ substantially, there is some identifiable common ground between them, particularly the assumption of some psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. We discuss some remaining open questions related to worldview conflict reduction, causal processes, the robustness of the assumptions of the traditional perspective, and differences between political elites and the public.

TI  - Mapping within-field leaf chlorophyll content in agricultural crops for nitrogen management using Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information on crop nutrient status is central for monitoring vegetation health, plant productivity and managing nutrient optimization programs in agricultural systems. This study maps the spatial variability of leaf chlorophyll content within fields with differing quantities of nitrogen fertilizer application, using multispectral Landsat-8 OLI data (30 m). Leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index measurements were collected at 15 wheat (Triticum aestivum) sites and 13 corn (Zea mays) sites approximately every 10 days during the growing season between May and September 2013 near Stratford, Ontario. Of the 28 sites, 9 sites were within controlled areas of zero nitrogen fertilizer application. Hyperspectral leaf reflectance measurements were also sampled using an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpecPro spectroradiometer (400-2500 nm). A two-step inversion process was developed to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from Landsat-8 satellite data at the sub-field scale, using linked canopy and leaf radiative transfer models. Firstly, at the leaf-level, leaf chlorophyll content was modelled using the PROSPECT model, using both hyperspectral and simulated mulitspectral Landsat-8 bands from the same leaf sample. Hyperspectral and multispectral validation results were both strong (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 13.62 mu g/cm(2)and R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 9.45 mu g/cm(2), respectively). Secondly, leaf chlorophyll content was estimated from Landsat-8 satellite imagery for 7 dates within the growing season, using PROSPECT linked to the 4-Scale canopy model. The Landsat-8 derived estimates of leaf chlorophyll content demonstrated a strong relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll values (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 16.18 mu g/cm(2)), and compared favourably to correlations between leaf chlorophyll and the best performing tested spectral vegetation index (Green Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, GNDVI; R-2 = 0.59). This research provides an operational basis for modelling within-field variations in leaf chlorophyll content as an indicator of plant nitrogen stress, using a physically-based modelling approach, and opens up the possibility of exploiting a wealth of multispectral satellite data and UAV-mounted multispectral imaging systems.

TI  - Retrieval of Vertical Foliage Profile and Leaf Area Index Using Transmitted Energy Information Derived from ICESat GLAS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical foliage profile (VFP) and leaf area index (LAI) are critical descriptors in terrestrial ecosystem modeling. Although light detection and ranging (lidar) observations have been proven to have potential for deriving the VFP and LAI, existing methods depend only on the received waveform information and are sensitive to additional input parameters, such as the ratio of canopy to ground reflectance. In this study, we proposed a new method for retrieving forest VFP and LAI from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data over two sites similar in their biophysical parameters. Our method utilized the information from not only the interaction between the laser and the forest but also the sensor configuration, which brought the benefit that our method was free from an empirical input parameter. Specifically, we first derived the transmitted energy profile (TEP) through the lidar 1-D radiative transfer model. Then, the obtained TEP was utilized to calculate the vertical gap distribution. Finally, the vertical gap distribution was taken as input to derive the VFP based on the Beer-Lambert law, and the LAI was calculated by integrating the VFP. Extensive validations of our method were carried out based on the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) simulation data, ground-based measurements, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product. The validation based on the DART simulation data showed that our method could effectively characterize the VFP and LAI under various canopy architecture scenarios, including homogeneous turbid and discrete individual-tree scenes. The ground-based validation also proved the feasibility of our method: the VFP retrieved from the GLAS data showed a similar trend with the foliage distribution density in the GLAS footprints; the GLAS LAI had a high correlation with the field measurements, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.79, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.49, and bias of 0.17. Once the outliers caused by low data quality and large slope were identified and removed, the accuracy was further improved, with R-2= 0.85, RMSE = 0.35, and bias = 0.10. However, the MODIS LAI product did not present a good relationship with the GLAS LAI. Relative to the GLAS LAI, the MODIS LAI showed an overestimation in the low and middle ranges of the LAI and a saturation at high values of approximately LAI = 5.5. Overall, this method has the potential to produce continental- and global-scale VFP and LAI datasets from the spaceborne lidar system.

TI  - A two-step fusion framework for quality improvement of a remotely sensed soil moisture product: A case study for the ECV product over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High quality remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) with high temporal coverage, high variation capturing ability and high accuracy, is very important to agricultural, hydrological and environmental applications. The Essential Climate Variable (ECV) SM dataset is the first product attempting to address the continuity and reliability issues of individual SM sensors by using multi-satellite observations, but limitations in quality still persist. This study proposes a two-step fusion framework to obtain high temporal coverage, high variation capturing ability and high accuracy remotely sensed SM. The first step aims to improve the temporal coverage by filling the gaps of remotely sensed SM with a machine learning method. The second step aims to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage SM from first step using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching based fusion method. We chose the ECV and Fengyun (FY) SM products as an algorithm WA to improve the quality of ECV SM over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Results suggest that the two-step SM fusion framework improved the original ECV SM temporal coverage from 30.84% to 78.12% for the entire TP. The variation capturing ability, here expressed in terms of correlation coefficient (R), was also improved by 6% and 49% at Naqu and Maqu, respectively, compared with the high temporal coverage ECV SM. The accuracy, measured in terms of unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), was also improved. Hence, the fusion framework and the FY SM could effectively improve the quality of ECV SM. The high quality fused SM is expected to help us better understand the role of SM in the water and energy cycles under global change.

TI  - Epithelioid Sarcoma-From Genetics to Clinical Practice
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Epithelioid sarcoma is a mesenchymal soft tissue sarcoma often arising in the extremities, usually in young adults with a pick of incidence at 35 years of age. Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is characterized by the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 (integrase interactor 1) or other proteins of the SWI/SNF complex. Two distinct types, proximal and distal, with varying biology and treatment outcomes, are distinguished. ES is known for aggressive behavior, including a high recurrence rate and regional lymph node metastases. An optimal long-term management strategy is still to be defined. The best treatment of localized ES is wide surgical resection. Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy may be recommended, as it reduces the local recurrence rate. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered in ES patients. Patients with metastatic ES have a poor prognosis with an expected median overall survival of about a year. Doxorubicin-based regimens are recommended for advanced ES. Tazemetostat, an EZH2 methyltransferase, has shown promising results in ES patients. Novel therapies, including immunotherapy, are still needed.

TI  - Simulating multispectral MSI bandsets (Sentinel-2) from hyperspectral observations via spectroradiometer for identifying soybean cultivars
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring soybean areas by remote sensing is extremely useful, especially in Brazil, which has a large territorial extension and where soybean cultivation has spread to all regions of the country. In this sense, the development of remote sensing techniques that enable the quantification and discrimination of soybean areas and now in cultivated cultivar level is of crucial importance for the soybean production chain in Brazil. This study aimed to discriminate soybean cultivars as a function of different hyperspectral bands using the sensor-system MSI-Sentinel-2 (Vis-NIR-SWIR) as a simulation and sample sizes using multivariate statistics to determine if the specific bands of this sensor are capable of performing such discrimination. Four soybean cultivation areas in the Midwest region cultivated with four cultivars (BMX Potencia, NA5909, Don Mario, and FT Campo Mourao) were assessed. Spectral readings from each sample soybean leaf were performed, and a total of 2400 vegetation spectral readings were obtained. Data were composed of 28 bands and 22 reflectance factor height (RID) values for each soybean cultivar. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to verify the association between soybean cultivars and their relationship with hyperspectral bands, as well as to verify the possibility of cultivar differentiation based on hyperspectral bands. The results obtained demonstrated to be possible discriminate soybean cultivars by using multivariate techniques applied to multi and hyperspectral data. The bands that contributed significantly (>5%) to cultivar differentiation in order of importance were: B26, B27, A17, A21, A20 and A14. Discriminant analysis was efficient in the cultivar classification, and canonical variable analysis revealed bands associated with specific discrimination of each cultivar. Bands that most contributed to cultivar discrimination were also identified for MSI orbital sensor.

TI  - Pilot monitoring of caatinga spatial-temporal dynamics through the action of agriculture and livestock in the brazilian semiarid
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga biome is one of the most threatened in Brazil because most of the native forest has been deforested for land use, mainly with pasture, for animal production. The objective of this research was to evaluate the changes caused by agricultural and livestock activities in a region with a predominance of the Caatinga biome, using remote sensing techniques. The study area comprised the municipality of Capoeiras-PE, where the main economic activity is dairy farming. 16 images covering the period from 1998 to 2018 of the Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellites were used, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, in which intense agricultural and livestock activity and degradation of the biome were observed in the boundaries of the municipality, through the index of normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI). NDVI lower than 0.264 was found associated with areas occupied by agriculture or by cattle, which became more evident over the years (1998-2018). In areas of intense agricultural and livestock activity, the LAI ranged from 0.00 to 0.51 m(2) m(-2), due to the infestation of the cochineal carmine pest and the soil compaction caused by trampling animal between the years 2008-2010. The substitution of pest-tolerant crops and the increase in the cattle herd led to the expansion of agriculture and livestock, resulting in the degradation of areas of the Caatinga biome.

TI  - SATVeg: A web-based tool for visualization of MODIS vegetation indices in South America
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of satellite images have been widely used in a range of applications, specially involving the green biomass monitoring in the Earth surface. A set of land surface products, including images of vegetation indices (VI), is derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor since 2000. This paper reports the development of the Temporal Vegetation Analysis System (SATVeg), a free web-based tool designed to provide instantaneous access to temporal profiles of MODIS VI in South America. The system's architecture is based on a geospatial database specially modeled to store the time series of images and ensure instantaneous queries and efficient updating. The results of the geospatial database modelling and respective response time for queries and updates, as well as the main functionalities of the system, are presented and discussed. Instantaneous reconstruction of time series provided by a set of filtering procedures is also related. Application examples of VI temporal profiles generated by SATVeg are presented and the system's limitations are also discussed. Our results show the potential of the web-system for supporting a set of land use and land cover monitoring activities in South America through a simple and friendly user interface.

TI  - Causes of man-Elephant conflicts and its impact on livelihood in fringe villages of Moman Reserve Forest, Kamrup district, Assam, India.
T2  - Ecology Environment and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - In India about 60 per cent of wild Asian Elephants are found. Elephants have a very significant and respected position in Indian societies since ancient periods. For the protection of this mammal the government of India has adopted the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (Schedule I and Part I), 1972. Inspite of such protection and value of this animal in Indian culture, human- elephant conflict is found to be common in India and is increasing in recent times. Due to rapid growth of human population and subsequent reduction of natural habitat this problem has become more acute. Within a span of 10 years, 1991-1999 elephant habitat of over 3000 km2 was lost from North-east India (Baskaran et al., 2011). Moreover, there is an increase in the total elephant population of Assam from 5,246 to 5,719 in 2002 - 2017(Government of Assam, 2017). The fringe areas of Moman Reserve forest, located at southern part of Kamrup district of Assam face the same problem. The main economic activity of these fringe villages is rice cultivation which is adversely affected during the harvesting season due to the herds of elephants coming in search of food. This has immense impact on the livelihood of the villagers. This study is an attempt to find the specific causes of the problem in the area and to search for a sustainable management approach to the problem. To assess the habitat loss satellite imageries of Landsat 2, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 for the years 1977, 2000 and 2019 respectively are being processed in ERDAS Imagine software. Primary household survey using random sampling technique is being conducted in 50 households in Moman, Sijubari, Jarapara and Pakharapara to find the beginning, frequency and extent of damage of the conflict and its impact on their livelihood. Secondary data are also collected from different sources like government records, reports, websites, etc. There is loss of human life, public and private properties and huge crop loss every year in the study area.

TI  - Land use-land cover (LULC) transformation and its relation with land surface temperature changes: A case study of Barrackpore Subdivision, West Bengal, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urban growth and changes of Land-use land cover (LULC) is the warning scenario for towns and cities in world wide. The transformation of natural land to impervious areas has induced in local microclimate variations and changes the surface energy budget. The main objective of the present study is to delineate land-use/land-cover changes and its relation to increases Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Barrackpore Subdivisional area, West Bengal using multi-spectral satellite data. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETMthorn) data were used in seasons wise (January, April, and November) to analyze LST variations for two different periods of 1990 and 2016. According to the current census report, 40 lakh people live in the study area, out of which 95% of people habitat in urban areas. The growth rate of urban land was 162% during 26 years of the time period. Non-built-up lands have encroached by more than 50% of land loss. The outcome result shows that mean LST has growth 3 degrees C and 4 degrees C in winter and summer seasons as well. It is founded that built-up areas are radiated the highest temperature in all seasonal phases which is followed by fallow land, agricultural land, vegetation, and water surfaces. Urban land converted from other evaporating land has raised in mean LST with 3.1 degrees C-3.2 degrees C in winter seasons; 4.22 degrees C-4.4 degrees C in summer seasons; and lastly 4.36 degrees C-4.57 degrees C in autumn season. Different indices, e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were derived to analysis and validate the relationship between LST and different land-use classes. The liner negative regression slope has found between NDVI and LST with a correlation coefficient (R-2) varies from 0.429 to 0.67 from 1990 to 2016. R-2 values have increased from 1990 to 2016 for every season that indicates the control of vegetation on LST. Seasons statistical relationship between LST and NDBI has exhibited a positive correlation that confirmed impervious surface has strongly influenced to upsurge the surface temperature. Water Surfaces are radiated mean 1 degrees C less temperature than other land use categories. The regression line is showing the negative relationship between LST-Wetland and Water Bodies which shows the LST effects are very less over extreme humid or moisture areas. The concentration of hotspot and cold spot areas was delineating using the spatial autocorrelation method of Getis-Ord Gi* formula, as the result shows that increased of hotspot areas from 19.9% to 35.3% in January month, 10.25%-16.40% in April month and 15.38%-37.4% in November month during the entire study periods. So, the municipal authority can take new decision policies and management to reduce the effects of LST for sustainable development in the further future.

The Mursidabad district in West Bengal (India) is situated in the floodplain of the Ganga-Padma and Bhagirathi rivers. The region is characterized by diverse types of wetlands; however, the wetlands are getting depredated day-by-day due to hydro-ecological changes, uncontrolled human activities and rapid urbanization. This study attempted to explore the health status of the wetland ecosystem in 2013 and 2020 at the block level in the Mursidabad district, using the pressure-state-response model. Based on wetland ecosystem health values, we categorized the health conditions and identified the blocks where the health conditions are poor. A total of seven Landsat ETM+ spaceborne satellite images in 2001, 2013 and 2020 were selected as the data sources. The statistical data included the population density and urbanization increase rate, for all administrative units, and were collected from the census data of India for 2001 and 2011. We picked nine ecosystem indicators for the incorporated assessment of wetland ecosystem health. The indicators were selected considering every block in the Mursidabad district and for the computation of the wetland ecosystem health index by using the analytical hierarchy processes method. This study determined that 26.92% of the blocks fell under the sick category in 2013, but increased to 30.77% in 2020, while the percentage of blocks in the very healthy category has decreased markedly from 11.54% to 3.85%. These blocks were affected by higher human pressure, such as population density, urbanization growth rate and road density, which resulted in the degradation of wetland health. The scientific protection and restoration techniques of these wetlands should be emphasized in these areas.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Deep Convolutional Autoencoders with Different Patch Sizes for Change Detection from Burnt Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the primary sources of damages to natural environments globally. Estimates show that approximately 4 million km(2)of land burns yearly. Studies have shown that such estimates often underestimate the real extent of burnt land, which highlights the need to find better, state-of-the-art methods to detect and classify these areas. This study aimed to analyze the use of deep convolutional Autoencoders in the classification of burnt areas, considering different sample patch sizes. A simple Autoencoder and the U-Net and ResUnet architectures were evaluated. We collected Landsat 8 OLI+ data from three scenes in four consecutive dates to detect the changes specifically in the form of burnt land. The data were sampled according to four different sampling strategies to evaluate possible performance changes related to sampling window sizes. The training stage used two scenes, while the validation stage used the remaining scene. The ground truth change mask was created using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral index through a thresholding approach. The classifications were evaluated according to theF1 index,Kappaindex, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) value. Results have shown that the U-Net and ResUnet architectures offered the best classifications with averageF1,Kappa, andmIoUvalues of approximately 0.96, representing excellent classification results. We have also verified that a sampling window size of 256 by 256 pixels offered the best results.

TI  - Rice Crop Detection Using LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Machine Learning Models from Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series allows describing the rice phenological cycle by the backscattering time signature. Therefore, the advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 program expands studies of radar data (C-band) for rice monitoring at regional scales, due to the high temporal resolution and free data distribution. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model has reached state-of-the-art in the pattern recognition of time-sequenced data, obtaining a significant advantage at crop classification on the remote sensing images. One of the most used approaches in the RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and its improvements, such as Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM models are more effective as their output depends on the previous and the next segment, in contrast to the unidirectional LSTM models. The present research aims to map rice crops from Sentinel-1 time series (band C) using LSTM and Bi-LSTM models in West Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). We compared the results with traditional Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Normal Bayes (NB). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following steps: (a) acquisition of the Sentinel time series over two years; (b) data pre-processing and minimizing noise from 3D spatial-temporal filters and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter; (c) time series classification procedures; (d) accuracy analysis and comparison among the methods. The results show high overall accuracy and Kappa (>97% for all methods and metrics). Bi-LSTM was the best model, presenting statistical differences in the McNemar test with a significance of 0.05. However, LSTM and Traditional Machine Learning models also achieved high accuracy values. The study establishes an adequate methodology for mapping the rice crops in West Rio Grande do Sul.

TI  - Fundamentals for graphic design criticism
T2  - NOESIS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES Y HUMANIDADES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike other disciplines, Graphic Design lacks criticism, which is reduced only to the description of the work, without an explanation of the relationships between the products and society. A critique model built is proposed in six stages: 1. Stage of functional judgment: indicates if the project accomplishes the objective of communication. 2. Stage of formal description: based on six variables: composition, illustration, geometric shapes, typography, color, and photography. 3. Stage of conceptual description: revision and valorization of three variables: aesthetics, innovation, and abstraction. 4. Stage of analysis of the relations between the product and society, and connections between each other. Determined by the mental structures from the critic. 5. Redaction process. 6. Diffusion process. If Graphic Design criticism is finalized, we may take another step in the creation of the Designer-scholar, who could take the position of an organic intellectual in the disciplines of Design. This proposal covers a need since there is no criticism of Graphic Design as such. It also enriches the designer's exegesis capacity, in addition to opening new lines of research in Design criticism.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation dashboard evaluation using the think aloud protocol
T2  - BMJ HEALTH & CARE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia which is a major risk factor for stroke, transient ischaemic attacks and increased mortality. Primary care management of AF can significantly reduce these risks. We carried out an evaluation to asses the usability of an AF dashboard developed to improve data quality and the quality of care.Method We developed an online dashboard about the quality of AF management for general practices of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre network. The dashboard displays (1) case ascertainment, (2) a calculation of stroke and haemorrhage risk to assess whether the benefits of anticogulants outweigh their risk, (3) prescriptions of different types of anticoagulant and (4) if prescribed anticoagulant is at the correct dose. We conducted the think aloud evaluation, involving 24 dashboard users to improve its usability.Results Analysis of 24 transcripts received produced 120 individual feedback items (ie, verbalised tasks) that were mapped across five usability problem classes. We enhanced the dashboard based on evaluation feedback to encourage adoption by general practices participating in the sentinel network.Conclusions The think aloud evaluation provided useful insights into important usability issues that require further development. Our enhanced AF dashboard was acceptable to clinicians and its impact on data quality and care should be assessed in a formal study.

TI  - Integrating molecular point-of-care testing for influenza into primary care: a mixed-methods feasibility study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMolecular pant-of-care testing (POCT) for influenza in primary care could influence clinical care and patient outcomes.AimTo assess the feasibility of incorporating influenza POCT into general practice in England.Design and settingA mixed-methods study conducted in six general practices that had not previously participated in respiratory virology sampling, which are part of the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre English sentinel surveillance network, from February 2019 to May 2019.MethodA sociotechnical perspective was adopted using the Public Health England POCT implementation toolkit and business process modelling notation to inform qualitative analysis. Quantitative data were collected about the number of samples taken, their representativeness, and the virology results obtained, comparing them with the rest of the sentinel system over the same weeks.ResultsA total of 312 POCTs were performed; 276 were used for quantitative analysis, of which 60 were positive for influenza and 216 were negative. The average swabbing rate was 0.4 per 1000 population and swab positivity was between 163% (n = 14/84) and 41.4% (n = 12/29). Given a positive influenza POCT result, the odds ratio of receiving an antiviral was 14.1 195% confidence intervals (CI) = 2.9 to 70.0. P<0.001) and of receiving an antibiotic was 0.4 (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.8. P= 0.01), compared with patients with a negative result. Qualitative analysis showed that it was feasible for practices to implement POCT, but there is considerable variation in the processes used.ConclusionTesting for influenza using POCT is feasible in primary care and may improve antimicrobial use. However, further evidence from randomised trials of influenza POCT in general practice is needed.

TI  - Internal Wave Dark-Band Signatures in ALOS-PALSAR Imagery Revealed by the Standard Deviation of the Co-Polarized Phase Difference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in L-band of short-period internal waves (IWs), and classification of their radar signatures is presented by means of a polarimetric data set from ALOS-PALSAR mission. We choose the polarimetric feature named standard deviation(std) of the co-polarized phase difference (CPD) to identify fundamental differences in SAR signatures of internal waves, and divided them into three different classes, according to their backscattered modulation depths and morphology as well as the std CPD, namely: double-signed, single-negative, and single-positive signatures, for IW normalized image transects that display, respectively, signatures in the form of bright/dark, dark, and bright bands that correspond to positive/negative, negative, or positive variations of radar backscatter. These radar power types of signatures have a counterpart in the std CPD normalized transects, and in this paper we discuss those correlations and decorrelations. We focus in the single-negative type of signature, that is dark bands on gray background, and show that the std CPD is greatly enhanced over the troughs and rear slopes of those IWs. It is suggested that such behavior is consistent with the presence of surface slicks owing to enhanced surfactant concentration. Furthermore, those single-negative SAR signatures appear at locations where and when biological productivity is enhanced. It is found that the modulation depths associated to the std CPD is higher than the one associated to the HH-polarized radar backscatter for single-negative signatures propagating in the range direction, while the reverse occurs for the other types of signatures.

TI  - Evapotranspiration and Precipitation over Pasture and Soybean Areas in the Xingu River Basin, an Expanding Amazonian Agricultural Frontier
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion from primary forest to agriculture drives widespread changes that have the potential to modify the hydroclimatology of the Xingu River Basin. Moreover, climate impacts over eastern Amazonia have been strongly related to pasture and soybean expansion. This study carries out a remote-sensing, spatial-temporal approach to analyze inter- and intra-annual patterns in evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (PPT) over pasture and soybean areas in the Xingu River Basin during a 13-year period. We used ET estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and PPT estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite. Our results showed that the annual average ET in the pasture was similar to 20% lower than the annual average in soybean areas. We show that PPT is notably higher in the northern part of the Xingu River Basin than the drier southern part. ET, on the other hand, appears to be strongly linked to land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns in the Xingu River Basin. Lower annual ET averages occur in southern areas where dominant LULC is savanna, pasture, and soybean, while more intense ET is observed over primary forests (northern portion of the basin). The primary finding of our study is related to the fact that the seasonality patterns of ET can be strongly linked to LULC in the Xingu River Basin. Further studies should focus on the relationship between ET, gross primary productivity, and water-use efficiency in order to better understand the coupling between water and carbon cycling over this expanding Amazonian agricultural frontier.

TI  - Rapid Recent Deforestation Incursion in a Vulnerable Indigenous Land in the Brazilian Amazon and Fire-Driven Emissions of Fine Particulate Aerosol Pollutants
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is related to the use of fire to remove natural vegetation and install crop cultures or pastures. In this study, we evaluated the relation between deforestation, land-use and land-cover (LULC) drivers and fire emissions in the Apyterewa Indigenous Land, Eastern Brazilian Amazon. In addition to the official Brazilian deforestation data, we used a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach to perform the LULC mapping in the Apyterewa Indigenous Land, and the Brazilian biomass burning emission model with fire radiative power (3BEM_FRP) to estimate emitted particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), a primary human health risk. The GEOBIA approach showed a remarkable advancement of deforestation, agreeing with the official deforestation data, and, consequently, the conversion of primary forests to agriculture within the Apyterewa Indigenous Land in the past three years (200 km(2)), which is clearly associated with an increase in the PM(2.5)emissions from fire. Between 2004 and 2016 the annual average emission of PM(2.5)was estimated to be 3594 ton year(-1), while the most recent interval of 2017-2019 had an average of 6258 ton year(-1). This represented an increase of 58% in the annual average of PM(2.5)associated with fires for the study period, contributing to respiratory health risks and the air quality crisis in Brazil in late 2019. These results expose an ongoing critical situation of intensifying forest degradation and potential forest collapse, including those due to a savannization forest-climate feedback, within "protected areas" in the Brazilian Amazon. To reverse this scenario, the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices and development of conservation policies to promote forest regrowth in degraded preserves are essential.

TI  - Using UAV Collected RGB and Multispectral Images to Evaluate Winter Wheat Performance across a Site Characterized by Century-Old Biochar Patches in Belgium
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data play a crucial role in monitoring crop dynamics in the context of precision agriculture by characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of crop traits. At present there is special interest in assessing the long-term impacts of biochar in agro-ecosystems. Despite the growing body of literature on monitoring the potential biochar effects on harvested crop yield and aboveground productivity, studies focusing on the detailed crop performance as a consequence of long-term biochar enrichment are still lacking. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate crop performance based on high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery considering both crop growth and health through RGB and multispectral analysis, respectively. More specifically, this approach allowed monitoring of century-old biochar impacts on winter wheat crop performance. Seven Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and six multispectral flights were executed over 11 century-old biochar patches of a cultivated field. UAV-based RGB imagery exhibited a significant positive impact of century-old biochar on the evolution of winter wheat canopy cover (p-value = 0.00007). Multispectral optimized soil adjusted vegetation index indicated a better crop development over the century-old biochar plots at the beginning of the season (p-values < 0.01), while there was no impact towards the end of the season. Plant height, derived from the RGB imagery, was slightly higher for century-old biochar plots. Crop health maps were computed based on principal component analysis and k-means clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify century-old biochar effects on crop performance during the entire growing period using remotely sensed data. Ground-based measurements illustrated a significant positive impact of century-old biochar on crop growth stages (p-value of 0.01265), whereas the harvested crop yield was not affected. Multispectral simplified canopy chlorophyll content index and normalized difference red edge index were found to be good linear estimators of harvested crop yield (p-value((Kendall))of 0.001 and 0.0008, respectively). The present research highlights that other factors (e.g., inherent pedological variations) are of higher importance than the presence of century-old biochar in determining crop health and yield variability.

TI  - Integration of multi-sensor analysis and decision tree for evaluation of dual and quad-Pol SAR in L- and C-bands applied for marsh delineation
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh is a wetland type characterized by hydromorphic soils, herbaceous vegetation, aquatic and emergent vegetation; usually, the apparent water surface does not exceed 25% of the area. Multi-polarized active remote sensors with different frequencies have characteristics that make them ideal for mapping and delineating marsh areas since they provide information on canopy roughness, vegetation moisture and amount of biomass. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop a method based on multi-frequency radar satellites images to delineate marsh areas using decision tree classification. In order to reach this objective, we sought to answer the following questions: (1) Are L-band SAR images more efficient for marshes delineation than C-band SAR images? (2) Is multi-sensor (L and C-band) integration more accurate for marsh areas delineation than a single sensor? and (3) What are the most efficient channels for marshes delineation? Our findings showed that L-band images present greater proportion correct (PC) for marshes delineation compared to C-band images. However, the greatest PC was found using integration of Alos Palsar 1 and Sentinel 1 satellites images, reaching more than 72% of correctness. Regarding the polarization importance to Alos Palsar 1 image, HVVH presented the highest importance, with 29%, followed by VH and HV polarizations, both with 28%. For Sentinel 1 image, the most important polarization was VH, with 22%, followed by VV + VH that presented 20%. HVVH polarization was the most important in Alos and Sentinel images integration, with 35%, followed by Alos Palsar HV and VH, with 34 and 33%, respectively. Thus, we concluded that the method based on SAR multi-frequency data integration used in this study can be easily applied by other researchers interested in marsh delineation since the radar images used are freely available and can be processed and manipulated in free GIS software.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island is a hot social issue during the construction of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The study of the driving factors for the heat island is an important scientific issue. Based on satellite remote sensing data, we quantitatively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of urban heat islands in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Marco Greater Bay Area. The driving factors of urban heat islands were analyzed by the multiple regression. The results showed that the urban heat island effect in Greater Bay Area increased significantly from 2003 to 2018 , with an annual increase of the heat island intensity of 0.05 degrees C and an annual increase of the heat island area of 0.18%. For seasonal variation of urban heat islands , the intensity was the strongest in summer and the weakest in winter. The heat island area was the largest in summer, and second largest in winter. The heat island area was mainly distributed in Dongguan, Shenzhen, the junction of Guangzhou and Foshan, the north of Zhongshan, and the central part of Huizhou. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that the altitude had the most significant impact on urban heat islands , followed by the light index , normalized vegetation index , and aerosol optical thickness in a descending order. The light index was a positive driving factor, whereas the rest were negative driving factors.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY & HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review To provide an overview of recently published articles covering melanoma management of the head and neck region. Recent findings Melanoma management represents a rapidly evolving field. The advent of immunotherapy has led to significant changes in diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance for these patients. Invasive interventions including completion lymph node dissection have been largely replaced with increased surveillance driven by robust data showing no significant difference in overall survival. Studies have explored various treatment regimens that offer improved outcomes with the least adverse events, with a recent trend towards neoadjuvant therapy. Research has also shifted towards better understanding genetics and biomarkers that influence response to these medications. The best means to both identify and monitor these changes is being explored. As our understanding of this complex disease process continues to grow, prognosis in patients suffering with melanoma should continue to improve. The expansion of immunotherapy use in melanoma management has led to significantly improved prognosis in diagnosed patients. Present research is largely focused on better understanding the ideal patient populations, dosing, and surveillance for these therapies. Data from these studies will be crucial in better staging and treating patients with melanoma.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment of Wildfire Burnt Areas through Earth-Observation Techniques and a Machine Learning-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment.

TI  - Imaging and immunometabolic phenotyping uncover changes in the hepatic immune response in the early phases of NAFLD
T2  - JHEP REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & aims: The precise determination of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset is challenging. Thus, the initial hepatic responses to fat accumulation, which may be fundamental to our understanding of NAFLD evolution and clinical outcomes, are largely unknown. Herein, we chronologically mapped the immunologic and metabolic changes in the liver during the early stages of fatty liver disease in mice and compared this with human NAFLD samples.Methods: Liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD (NAFLD activity score [NAS] 2-3) were collected for gene expression profiling. Mice received a high-fat diet for short periods to mimic initial steatosis and the hepatic immune response was investigated using a combination of confocal intravital imaging, gene expression, cell isolation, flow cytometry and bone marrow transplantation assays.Results: We observed major immunologic changes in patients with NAS 2-3 and in mice in the initial stages of NAFLD. In mice, these changes significantly increased mortality rates upon drug-induced liver injury, as well as predisposing mice to bacterial infections. Moreover, deletion of Toll-like receptor 4 in liver cells dampened tolerogenesis, particularly in Kupffer cells, in the initial stages of dietary insult.Conclusion: The hepatic immune system acts as a sentinel for early and minor changes in hepatic lipid content, mounting a biphasic response upon dietary insult. Priming of liver immune cells by gut-derived Toll-like receptor 4 ligands plays an important role in liver tolerance in initial phases, but continuous exposure to insults may lead to damage and reduced ability to control infections.

TI  - Recording Urban Land Dynamic and Its Effects during 2000-2019 at 15-m Resolution by Cloud Computing with Landsat Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities, the core of the global climate change and economic development, are high impact land cover land use change (LCLUC) hotspots. Comprehensive records of land cover land use dynamics in urban regions are essential for strategic climate change adaption and mitigation and sustainable urban development. This study aims to develop a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application for high-resolution (15-m) urban LCLUC mapping with a novel classification scheme using pan-sharpened Landsat images. With this approach, we quantified the annual LCLUC in Changchun, China, from 2000 to 2019, and detected the abrupt changes (turning points of LCLUC). Ancillary data on social-economic status were used to provide insights on potential drivers of LCLUC by examining their correlation with change rate. We also examined the impacts of LCLUC on environment, specifically air pollution. Using this approach, we can classify annual LCLUC in Changchun with high accuracy (all above 0.91). The change detection based on the high-resolution wall-to-wall maps show intensive urban expansion with the compromise of cropland from 2000 to 2019. We also found the growth of green space in urban regions as the result of green space development and management in recent years. The changing rate of different land types were the largest in the early years of the observation period. Turning points of land types were primarily observed in 2009 and 2010. Further analysis showed that economic and industry development and population migration collectively drove the urban expansion in Changchun. Increasing built-up areas could slow wind velocity and air exchange, and ultimately led to the accumulation of PM2.5. Our implement of pan-sharpened Landsat images facilitates the wall-to-wall mapping of temporal land dynamics at high spatial resolution. The primary use of GEE for mapping urban land makes it replicable and transferable by other users. This approach is a first crucial step towards understanding the drivers of change and supporting better decision-making for sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Minireview Exploring the Biological Cycle of Vitamin B3 and Its Influence on Oxidative Stress: Further Molecular and Clinical Aspects
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Vitamin B3, or niacin, is one of the most important compounds of the B-vitamin complex. Recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of vitamin B3 in a number of pivotal functions which ensure that homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the intriguing nature of its synthesis and the underlying mechanism of action of vitamin B3 have encouraged further studies aimed at deepening our understanding of the close link between the exogenous supply of B3 and how it activates dependent enzymes. This crucial role can be attributed to the gut microflora and its ability to shape human behavior and development by mediating the bioavailability of metabolites. Recent studies have indicated a possible interconnection between the novel coronavirus and commensal bacteria. As such, we have attempted to explain how the gastrointestinal deficiencies displayed by SARS-CoV-2-infected patients arise. It seems that the stimulation of a proinflammatory cascade and the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species culminates in the subsequent loss of host eubiosis. Studies of the relationhip between ROS, SARS-CoV-2, and gut flora are sparse in the current literature. As an integrated component, oxidative stress (OS) has been found to negatively influence host eubiosis, in vitro fertilization outcomes, and oocyte quality, but to act as a sentinel against infections. In conclusion, research suggests that in the future, a healthy diet may be considered a reliable tool for maintaining and optimizing our key internal parameters.

TI  - Monitoring Pasture Aboveground Biomass and Canopy Height in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System Using Textural Information from PlanetScope Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate quantification of the available pasture biomass is essential to support grazing management decisions in intensively managed fields. The increasing temporal and spatial resolutions offered by the new generation of orbital platforms, such as Planet CubeSat satellites, have improved the capability of monitoring pasture biomass using remotely sensed data. Here, we assessed the feasibility of using spectral and textural information derived from PlanetScope imagery for estimating pasture aboveground biomass (AGB) and canopy height (CH) in intensively managed fields and the potential for enhanced accuracy by applying the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Our results demonstrated that the texture measures enhanced AGB and CH estimations compared to the performance obtained using only spectral bands or vegetation indices. The best results were found by employing the XGBoost models based only on texture measures. These models achieved moderately high accuracy to predict pasture AGB and CH, explaining 65% and 89% of AGB (root mean square error (RMSE) = 26.52%) and CH (RMSE = 20.94%) variability, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of using texture measures to improve the prediction accuracy of AGB and CH models based on high spatiotemporal resolution PlanetScope data in intensively managed mixed pastures.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessment of the Oasis Ecological Resilience Improved by Rational Water Dispatching Using Multiple Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of the Heihe River Basin, Silk Road
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The suboptimal management and utilization of water resources from the "Asian water towers" contributed to serious ecological crises in river basins along the arid Silk Road, such as the Aral Sea and the Heihe River in the 20th century. To improve the ecological resilience of the Ejina Oasis in the Heihe River downstream basin, the Chinese government implemented the 'Ecological water dispatching project' in 2000. However, it is still unclear what the optimal rational water allocation is for the sustainable development of economic, social, and ecological environments (so called "triple bottom line") in these inland river basins. This study presents a decision-tree-based methodology for ecological monitoring and restoration strategies for Silk Road's oasis eco-system. Using Landsat TM/OLI data as well as meteorological, hydrological, and water utilization data, we show that similar to 69% of the originally degraded land has been restored since 2000. Previously dry tail-end lakes in the Heihe River downstream basin have been rejuvenated, and the precipitation has also significantly improved (rho = 0.047). We propose that the downstream water allocation should be no more than similar to 11 x 10(8) m(3) and that the optimal ratio between downstream and midstream allocation is 0.4-1.7. This study provides an excellent example for ecological monitoring and assessment in the optimization of strategies for the restoration of Silk Road's oasis eco-system.

TI  - Influence of adjacency effect on high-spatial-resolution thermal infrared imagery: Implication for radiative transfer simulation and land surface temperature retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of adjacency effect on high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery in the visible and near infrared region has been studies since the 1980s. However, the adjacency effect is usually neglected in the thermal infrared (TIR) region. The conventional TIR radiative transfer equation (RTE) only takes into account radiance from target pixel and neglects radiance contribution from surrounding background pixels. In this study, two TIR RTEs taking into account the adjacency effect for uniform and non-uniform Lambertian surfaces were deduced based on the radiative transfer theory. In terms of the TIR RTEs, we analyze the dominating influence factors of the adjacency effect and quantify the magnitude of the adjacency effect in the TIR region using simulation and actual satellite data. Two different definitions of the adjacency effect are presented in this study: (1) the effect due to radiance from background pixels scattered into sensor's instantaneous field of view, and (2) the effect due to apparent thermal contrast between target and background pixels. The results show that atmospheric visibility, water vapor content, sensor spectral band, and background pixel land surface temperature (LST) have significant influence on the adjacency effect. For a specific simulation scene, the magnitude of the first definition of the adjacency effect is larger than 0.5 K when atmospheric visibility is lower than 23 km. This magnitude is as much as 2 K under haze weather conditions with atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results indicate that the adjacency effect should be taken into account in the radiative transfer simulation. The magnitude of the second definition of the adjacency effect is less than 0.3 K, even at atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results reveal that the accuracy of the TIR RTE for a uniform Lambertian surface is enough for the development of LST retrieval algorithm under relatively haze weather conditions. In situ LST measurements collected at the Hailar, Urad Front Banner, and Wuhai sites in China were used to validate the accuracies of the LST retrieved by the RTE-based single channel algorithm with/without adjacency effect correction. There are nearly no discrepancies between the LST retrieved with/without adjacency effect correction when aerosol optical depth (AOD) is low than 0.3. However, the RMSE of the differences between the retrieved LST and the in situ LST decreases from approximately 1.4 K for the LST retrieved without adjacency effect correction to approximately 0.6 K for the LST retrieved with adjacency effect correction when AOD is high than 0.3.

TI  - Monitoring Approach for Tropical Coniferous Forest Degradation Using Remote Sensing and Field Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current estimates of CO(2)emissions from forest degradation are generally based on insufficient information and are characterized by high uncertainty, while a global definition of 'forest degradation' is currently being discussed in the scientific arena. This study proposes an automated approach to monitor degradation using a Landsat time series. The methodology was developed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and applied in a pine forest area of the Dominican Republic. Land cover change mapping was conducted using the random forest (RF) algorithm and resulted in a cumulative overall accuracy of 92.8%. Forest degradation was mapped with a 70.7% user accuracy and a 91.3% producer accuracy. Estimates of the degraded area had a margin of error of 10.8%. A number of 344 Landsat collections, corresponding to the period from 1990 to 2018, were used in the analysis. Additionally, 51 sample plots from a forest inventory were used. The carbon stocks and emissions from forest degradation were estimated using the RF algorithm with an R(2)of 0.78. GEE proved to be an appropriate tool to monitor the degradation of tropical forests, and the methodology developed herein is a robust, reliable, and replicable tool that could be used to estimate forest degradation and improve monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems under the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) mechanism.

T2  - REVISTA ON LINE DE POLITICA E GESTAO EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Antonio Gramsci's ideas about common sense, this article presents an analysis of obscurantist neoliberal common sense and its impacts on Brazilian contemporary society and education. Contrary to some interpretations that separate political-cultural obscurantism from neoliberalism, it is argued in this article that they are two sides of the same coin. The neoliberal worldview, connecting the idea of freedom to the assumption that social evolution should be ruled by the free market's logic, contains a kind of rationality that leads to the most irrational forms of thought and sociability, becoming a fertile ground for the spread of belligerent obscurantism.

TI  - Utility of emergency call centre, dispatch and ambulance data for syndromic surveillance of infectious diseases: a scoping review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Syndromic surveillance can supplement conventional health surveillance by analyzing less-specific, near-real-time data for an indication of disease occurrence. Emergency medical call centre dispatch and ambulance data are examples of routinely and efficiently collected syndromic data that might assist in infectious disease surveillance. Scientific literature on the subject is scarce and an overview of results is lacking. Methods: A scoping review including (i) review of the peer-reviewed literature, (ii) review of grey literature and (iii) interviews with key informants. Results: Forty-four records were selected: 20 peer reviewed and 24 grey publications describing 44 studies and systems. Most publications focused on detecting respiratory illnesses or on outbreak detection at mass gatherings. Most used retrospective data; some described outcomes of temporary systems; only two described continuously active dispatch- and ambulance-based syndromic surveillance. Key informants interviewed valued dispatch- and ambulance-based syndromic surveillance as a potentially useful addition to infectious disease surveillance. Perceived benefits were its potential timeliness, standardization of data and clinical value of the data. Conclusions: Various dispatch- and ambulance-based syndromic surveillance systems for infectious diseases have been reported, although only roughly half are documented in peer-reviewed literature and most concerned retrospective research instead of continuously active surveillance systems. Dispatch- and ambulance-based syndromic data were mostly assessed in relation to respiratory illnesses; reported use for other infectious disease syndromes is limited. They are perceived by experts in the field of emergency surveillance to achieve time gains in detection of infectious disease outbreaks and to provide a useful addition to traditional surveillance efforts.

TI  - Pathologic Protocols for Sentinel Lymph Nodes Ultrastaging in Cervical Cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Context.-Ultrastaging of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is a crucial aspect in the approach to SLN processing. No consensual protocol for pathologic ultrastaging has been approved by international societies to date.Objective.-To provide a review of the ultrastaging protocol and all its aspects related to the processing of SLNs in patients with cervical cancer.Data Sources.-In total, 127 publications reporting data from 9085 cases were identified in the literature. In 24% of studies, the information about SLN processing is entirely missing. No ultrastaging protocol was used in 7% of publications. When described, the differences in all aspects of SLN processing among the studies and institutions are substantial. This includes grossing of the SLN, which is not completely sliced and processed in almost 20% of studies. The reported protocols varied in all aspects of SIN processing, including the thickness of slices (range, 1-5 mm), the number of levels (range, 0-cut out until no tissue left), distance between the levels (range, 40-1000 pm), and number of sections per level (range, 1-5).Conclusions.-We found substantial differences in protocols used for SLN pathologic ultrastaging, which can impact sensitivity for detection of micrometastases and even small macrometastases. Since the involvement of pelvic lymph nodes is the most important negative prognostic factor, such profound discrepancies influence the referral of patients to adjuvant radiotherapy and could potentially cause treatment failure. It is urgent that international societies agree on a consensual protocol before SLN biopsy without pelvic lymphadenectomy is introduced into routine clinical practice.

TI  - Land cover maps of Antananarivo (capital of Madagascar) produced by processing multisource satellite imagery and geospatial reference data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We describe a reference spatial database and four land use maps of Antananarivo city produced over 2017 reference year using a methodology combining machine learning and object based image analysis (OBIA). These maps are produced by processing satellite images using the Moringa land cover processing chain developed in our laboratory. We use a single very high spatial resolution (VHSR) Pleiades image, a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the aforementioned reference database. According to the Moringa workflow, the Pleiades image is used to generate a suitable object layer at VHSR using a segmentation algorithm. Each object is then classified using variables from the time series and information from the DTM. The reference database used to train the supervised classification algorithm is here described, as well as the 4 land cover maps produced at four different hierarchically nested nomenclature levels. For a number of classes going from 2 to 20, overall accuracies range from 94% to 74%. Such land cover products are very rare in Madagascar, so we have decided to make them openly accessible and usable by land managers and researchers. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - OCULAR ONCOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose:To report a case of local metastasis of conjunctival melanoma, which may occur via extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM), and discuss its clinical relevance in conjunctival melanoma tumor staging and possible management implications.Methods:Retrospective chart review of a single clinical case with clinicopathologic correlation.Results:A 65-year-old male referred due to local recurrence of conjunctival melanoma at the caruncle was successfully treated after two excisional procedures with negative sentinel lymph node biopsies. Forty-eight months after initial presentation, the patient developed a nodular lesion representing local recurrence in the ipsilateral upper tarsal conjunctiva, distant from the primary tumor site. Histopathology showed nodules in the substantia propria in the absence of primary acquired melanosis. The tumor cells were found along the extravascular surface without intralymphatic or intravascular tumor cells consistent with local metastasis. One possible mechanism is angiotropic microsatellitosis leading to local EVMM. Additional neck CT imaging showed no lymphadenopathy.Conclusion:EVMM via angiotropic microsatellitosis is another possible mechanism of noncontiguous local recurrence of conjunctival melanoma. Angiotropic microsatellitosis may represent a high-risk finding possibly related to increased melanoma-related mortality.

TI  - Selective Predation by Owls on Infected Bank Voles (Myodes glareolus) as a Possible Sentinel of Tularemia Outbreaks.
T2  - Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Tularemia is a widely spread zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. In humans, tularemia is an acute febrile illness with incidence peaks in late summer to early autumn of outbreak years, but there is no early warning system in place that can reduce the impact of disease by providing timely risk information. In this study, we revisit previously unpublished data on F. tularensis in water, sediment, soil, and small mammals from 1984 in northern Sweden. In addition, we used human case data from the national surveillance system for tularemia in the same year. In the environmental and small mammal material, bank vole (Myodes glareolus) samples from urine and bladder were the only samples that tested positive for F. tularensis. The prevalence of F. tularensis among trapped bank voles was 13.5%, although all six bank voles that were retrieved from owl nest boxes in early May tested positive. Forty-two human tularemia cases were reported from August to December in 1984. Based on these results, we encourage investigating the potential role of tularemia-infected bank voles retrieved from owl nest boxes in spring as an early warning for outbreaks of tularemia among humans in summer and autumn of the same year.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resource scarcity and climate change impacts are putting pressure on Egyptian government to achieve the water, energy and food security nexus in order to find optimized choices compromising between environmental ecosystems and the society. Despite of being considered as an ecological restoration success, Wadi El-Rayan (WR) wetlands is becoming a depleted ecosystem due to water resources vulnerability. The primary objective of this study is to apply remote sensing (RS) data and GIS methods to the various components of the WR wetland ecosystem, including vegetation, water and soil, and to assess their recent status over the previous three decades. Four multi-temporal/multi-spectral Landsat were analyzed, including TM (1990, 1999 and 2010) and OLI-TIRS (2019). Vegetation and water indices were employed to extract the vegetation, water and soil features in order to assess the change scenarios. The results showed that open soil increased significantly during the study period, particularly during the past ten years, with a concomitant decrease in the vegetation and water body areas. The study therefore indicates that the protection of the existing wetland resources for sustainable use for the next generation must be urgently considered.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing in Comprehending the Influence of Urban Landscape's Composition and Configuration on Land Surface Temperature at Neighbourhood Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial composition and configuration of land use land cover (LULC) in the urban landscape impact the land surface temperature (LST). In this study, we assessed such impacts at the neighbourhood level of the City of Edmonton. In doing so, we employed Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) satellite images to derive LULC and LST maps, respectively. We used three classification methods, such as ISODATA, random forest, and indices-based, for mapping LULC classes including built-up, water, and green. We obtained the highest overall accuracy of 98.53 and 97.90% with a kappa value of 0.96 and 0.92 in the indices-based method for the 2018 and 2015 LULC maps, respectively. Besides, we estimated the LST map from the brightness temperature using a single-channel algorithm. Our analysis showed that the highest contributors to LST were the industrial (303.51 K in 2018 and 295.99 K in 2015) and residential (303.47 K in 2018 and 296.56 K in 2015) neighbourhoods, and the lowest contributor was the riverine/creek (298.77 K in 2018 and 292.89 K in 2015) during the 2018 late summer and 2015 early spring seasons. We also found that the residential neighbourhoods exhibited higher LST in comparison with the industrial with the same LULC composition. The result was also supported by our surface albedo analysis, where industrial and residential neighbourhoods were giving higher and lower albedo values, respectively. This indicated that the rooftop materials played further role in impacting the LST. In addition, our spatial autocorrelation (local Moran'sI) and proximity (near distance) analyses revealed that the structural configurations would additionally play an important role in contributing to the LST in the neighbourhoods. For example, the cluster pattern with a small gap of minimum 2.4 m between structures in the residential neighbourhoods were showing higher LST in compared with the sparse pattern, with large gaps between structures in the industrial areas. The wide passages for wind flow through the large gaps would be responsible for cooling the LST in the industrial neighbourhoods. The outcomes of this study would help planners in planning and designing urban neighbourhoods, and policymakers and stakeholders in developing strategies to balance surface energy and mitigate local warming.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of ecosystem health of coastal urban wetlands in Ghana
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health of wetlands is needed to guide protection and restoration activities. However, the conventional methods used in evaluating ecosystem health of wetlands largely rely on field observational data which often do not provide spatio-temporal perspectives to the assessment. Geospatial assessment of remotely sensed data has enormous potentials for assessing ecosystem health of wetlands at different temporal and spatial scales. This study employed geospatial techniques to assess ecosystem health of Densu Delta, Sakumo II and Muni-Pomadze Ramsar Sites over a 32-year period using structure, function and resilience indicators. Landsat satellite images of 1985, 2002 and 2017 were obtained for this study. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to weight the indicators. The importance of the ecosystem health indicators in decreasing order was as follows: Structure > Resilience > Function. The findings of the study also indicated that ecosystem health of the wetlands progressively deteriorated in 2002 and 2017 compared to the reference year of 1985. In 2002, the Densu Delta experienced the least decline (11.8%) from the 1985 state among the three wetlands and Sakumo II recorded the highest deterioration (38.0%). Unlike 2002, in 2017 the health of the Densu Delta experienced the worse deterioration (46.3%) whereas Sakumo II recorded the least decline (26.2%). Ecosystem health of Muni-Pomadze Ramsar Site deteriorated at a similar magnitude, 27.0% and 29.1% in 2002 and 2017, respectively. The critical underlying factor for the degradation of the wetlands is urbanization largely due to increase in human population which led to the expansion of built-up areas in the wetlands, fragmentation of natural land use and land cover (LULC) classes and reduction of vegetation cover.

TI  - SAR Sentinel 1 Imaging and Detection of Palaeo-Landscape Features in the Mediterranean Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite radar in landscape archaeology offers great potential for manifold applications, such as the detection of ancient landscape features and anthropogenic transformations. Compared to optical data, the use and interpretation of radar imaging for archaeological investigations is more complex, due to many reasons including that: (i) ancient landscape features and anthropogenic transformations provide subtle signals, which are (ii) often covered by noise; and, (iii) only detectable in specific soil characteristics, moisture content, vegetation phenomenology, and meteorological parameters. In this paper, we assessed the capability of SAR Sentinel 1 in the imaging and detection of palaeo-landscape features in the Mediterranean area of Tavoliere delle Puglie. For the purpose of our investigations, a significant test site (larger than 200 km(2)) was selected in the Foggia Province (South of Italy) as this area has been characterized for millennia by human frequentation starting from (at least) the Neolithic. The results from the Sentinel 1 (S-1) data were successfully compared with independent data sets, and the comparison clearly showed an excellent match between the S-1 based outputs and ancient anthropogenic transformations and landscape features.

AB  - Monitoring of flashflood consequences in arid environments can be realized by using either active or passive remote sensing data based mostly on the acquisition circumstances and the tackled objectives. Mapping of sediment in shorelines is a practical example where both remote sensing data can be combined to obtain robust results. The study area located on the west coast for Saudi Arabia where the shoreline of Umluj city was under investigation after a significant flash flood took place. Remote sensing images comprise of synthetic aperture radar were utilized to map the sedimentation extent with the study area process that took place after a flash flood within the designated study area. Both images were analyzed and processed using change detection techniques to quantify the sedimentation process. The late image was registered in August 2018 while the recent image was registered in March 2019 following an unusual flash flood event that occurred within the vicinity of the study area. Sediment deposits along the shoreline of the study area increased by nearly 171% and cover sea surface area closely to 4,500 km(2). Consequently, the temporal monitoring of shorelines to map the sedimentation process thematically should be nature conservation priorities specifically in fragile ecosystems.

AB  - Water quality parameters help to decide the further use of water-based on its quality. Changes in water surface area in the lake shall affect the water quality. Chlorophyll a, nitrate concentration and water turbidity were extracted from satellite images to record each variation on these parameters caused by the water amount in the lake changes. Each water quality measures have been recorded with its surface area reading to analyses the effects. Water quality parameters were estimated from the Sentinel-2 sensor based on the satellite temporal resolution for the years 2017-2018. Data were pre-processed then processed to estimate the maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). The normalized difference water index (NDWI), was used to calculate and record the changes in the water surface area in Baysh Dam Lake. Results showed different correlation coefficients between the lake surface area and the water quality parameters estimated remote sensing data. The response of the water quality parameters to surface water changes was expressed in four different surface water categories. MCI is more sensitive to surface water changes rather than GNDVI and NDTI. Neural network analysis showed a resemblance between GNDVI and NDTI expressed in sigmoidal function while MCI showed a different behavior expressed in exponential behavior. Therefore, monitoring of the surface water area of the lack is essential in water quality monitoring.

AB  - A valuable source of astrometric data for studying the dynamics of natural satellites of planets are photometric observations of satellites during their mutual occultations and eclipses. Worldwide photometric campaigns are organized in order to observe as many events as possible. For the events that took place in 1985 and 1990-1992, the results of photometric observations of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter were published as timings of minimum light flux and values of flux drop expressed in magnitudes. These data were not suitable to refine the theory of motion of these satellites. This paper presents the results of a new reduction of the satellite astrometric coordinate differences deduced from the photometric observations of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter during their mutual occultations and eclipses in 1985 and 1990-1992. An original method of reduction that has been earlier developed by the authors was applied. This provides a significant portion of new high quality data for the general database of existing observations. The internal accuracy of obtained astrometric results is 16 mas for the observations made in 1985 and 28 mas for those made in 1990-1992. The data are included into the Natural Satellite Data Base and are available at http://nsdb.imcce.fr/obspos/bjupogae.htm.

TI  - A Systematic Approach to Hydrogeological Conceptual Model Testing, Combining Remote Sensing and Geophysical Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual uncertainty is considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow modeling. Hypothesis testing is essential to increase system understanding by analyzing and refuting alternative conceptual models. We present a systematic approach to conceptual model testing aimed at finding an ensemble of conceptual understandings consistent with prior knowledge and observational data. This differs from the traditional approach of tuning the parameters of a single conceptual model to conform with the data through inversion. We apply this approach to a simplified hydrogeological characterization of the Wildman River area (Northern Territory, Australia) and evaluate the connectivity of sinkhole-type depressions to groundwater. Alternative models are developed representing the process structure (i.e., different fluxes representing interactions between surface water and groundwater) and physical structure (i.e., different lithologies underlying the depressions) of the conceptual model of the depressions. Remote sensing data are used to test the process structure, while geophysical data are used to test the physical structure. Both data types are used to remove inconsistent models from an ensemble of 16 models and to update the probability of the remaining alternative conceptual models. Three out of five depressions that are used as a test case are conditionally confirmed to act as conduits for recharge, while for the last two depressions, the data are inconclusive. Although the framework is not directly prediction oriented, the testing of plausible conceptual models will ultimately lead to increased confidence of any groundwater model based on accepted posterior conceptualizations.

TI  - Lithological and Structural Lineament Mapping from Landsat 8 OLI Images in Ras Kammouna Arid Area (Eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area is located in the southern part of the M'aider Paleozoic basin in the Moroccan Eastern Anti-Atlas. It is an arid region, characterized by minimal vegetation cover, which can provide an ideal environment to apply remote sensing. In this study, remote sensing and field investigations were integrated for lithological and structural lineaments mapping. The Landsat 8 OLI data were processed in order to understand the role of lithology and geological structures in the distribution of mineral deposits in the study area. To achieve this purpose, the Color Composite (CC), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Band Rationing transformation (BR) tests were performed. The results of remote sensing techniques coupled with field investigations have shown that the zones of high lineaments densities are highly correlated with the occurrences of barite mineralization. These findings depict a spatial relationship between structural lineaments and the mineralization distribution zones. Therefore, the barite and Iron oxides mineralization veins, which occur mainly in the Ras Kammouna district, seem to have a structural control. The methodological approach used in this study examining lithological mapping and lineament extractions can be used to explore mineral deposits in arid regions to a high degree of efficiency.

TI  - Towards a Large-Scale 3D Modeling of the Built Environment-Joint Analysis of TanDEM-X, Sentinel-2 and Open Street Map Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental to global scale mapping of the human settlement extent based on earth observation satellite data has made considerable progress. Nevertheless, the current approaches only provide a two-dimensional representation of the built environment. Therewith, a full characterization is restricted in terms of the urban morphology and built-up density, which can only be gained by a detailed examination of the vertical settlement extent. This paper introduces a methodology for the extraction of three-dimensional (3D) information on human settlements by analyzing the digital elevation and radar intensity data collected by the German TanDEM-X satellite mission in combination with multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and data from the Open Street Map initiative and the Global Urban Footprint human settlement mask. The first module of the underlying processor generates a normalized digital surface model from the TanDEM-X digital elevation model for all regions marked as a built-up area by the Global Urban Footprint. The second module generates a building mask based on a joint processing of Open Street Map, TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X radar images, the calculated normalized digital surface model and Sentinel-2 imagery. Finally, a third module allocates the local relative heights of the normalized digital surface model to the building structures provided by the building mask. The outcome of the procedure is a 3D map of the built environment showing the estimated local height for all identified vertical building structures at 12 m spatial resolution. The results of a first validation campaign based on reference data collected for the seven cities of Amsterdam (NL), Indianapolis (US), Kigali (RW), Munich (DE), New York (US), Vienna (AT), and Washington (US) indicate the potential of the proposed methodology to accurately estimate the distribution of building heights within the built-up area.

TI  - An Intercomparison Study of Algorithms for Downscaling SMAP Radiometer Soil Moisture Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, a variety of algorithms have been introduced to downscale passive microwave soil moisture observations. Some exploit the soil moisture information from optical/thermal sensing of land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation dynamics while others use active microwave (radar) observations. In this study, downscaled soil moisture data at 9- or 1-km resolution from several algorithms are intercompared against in situ soil moisture measurements to determine their reliability in an operational system. The finescale satellite data used here for downscaling the coarse-scale SMAP data are observations of LST from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and vegetation index (VI) from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the warm seasons in 2015 and 2016. Three recently developed downscaling algorithms are evaluated and compared: a simple regression algorithm based on 9-km thermal inertial data, a data mining approach called regression tree based on 9- and 1-km LST and VI, and the NASA SMAP enhanced 9-km soil moisture product algorithm. Seven sets of in situ soil moisture data from intensive networks were used for validation, including 1) the CREST-SMART network in Millbrook, New York; 2) Walnut Gulch Watershed in Arizona; 3) Little Washita Watershed in Oklahoma; 4) Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma; 5) Little River Watershed in Georgia; 6) the Tibetan Plateau network in China, and 7) the OzNet in Australia. Soil moisture measurements of the in situ networks were upscaled to the corresponding SMAP reference pixels at 9 km and used to assess the accuracy of downscaled products at a 9-km scale. Results revealed that the downscaled 9-km soil moisture products generally outperform the 36-km product for most in situ datasets. The linear regression algorithm using the thermal sensing based evaporative stress index (ESI) had the best agreement with the in situ measurements from networks in the contiguous United States according to the site-by-site comparison. In addition, the inertial thermal linear regression method demonstrated the lowest unbiased RMSE when comparing to the matched-up in situ datasets as well. In general, this method is promising for operational generation of fine-resolution soil moisture data product.

TI  - Glacier Surface Motion Estimation from SAR Intensity Images Based on Subpixel Gradient Correlation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the current extensive availability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) datasets with high temporal (e.g., a repeat cycle of a few or a dozen days) and spatial resolution (e.g., in the order of similar to 1 m), radar remote sensing possesses an increasing potential for the monitoring of glacier surface motion thanks to the nearly weather and time-independent advantages. This paper proposes a robust subpixel frequency-based image correlation method for dense matching and integrates the improved matching into a workflow of glacier surface motion estimation using SAR intensity images with specific pre-processing and post-processing steps. The proposed matching method combines complex edge maps and local upsampling in the frequency domain for subpixel intensity tracking, which ensure the accuracy and robustness of glacier surface motion estimation. Experiments were carried out with TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 images covering two glacier areas in pole and alpine regions. The results of the monitoring and investigation of glacier motion validate the feasibility and reliability of the presented motion estimation method based on subpixel gradient correlation. The comparative results using both simulated and real SAR data indicate that the proposed matching method outperforms commonly used correlation-based matching methods in terms of matching accuracy and the ability to obtain correct matches.

TI  - The Classification Performance and Mechanism of Machine Learning Algorithms in Winter Wheat Mapping Using Sentinel-2 10 m Resolution Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning algorithms are crucial for crop identification and mapping. However, many works only focus on the identification results of these algorithms, but pay less attention to their classification performance and mechanism. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-2 10 m resolution images during a specific phenological period of winter wheat were obtained. Then, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning algorithms were employed to identify and map winter wheat in a large-scale area. The hyperparameters of the three machine learning algorithms were tuned by grid search and the 5-fold cross-validation method. The classification performance of the three machine learning algorithms were compared, the results of which demonstrate that SVM achieves best performance in identifying winter wheat, and its overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa) are 0.94, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively. Moreover, 50 various combinations of training and validation sets were used to analyze the generalization ability of the algorithms, and the results show that the average OA of SVM, RF, and CART are 0.93, 0.92, and 0.88, respectively, thus indicating that SVM and RF are more robust than CART. To further explore the sensitivity of SVM, RF, and CART to variations of the algorithm parameters-namely, (C and gamma), (tree and split), and (maxD and minSP)-we employed the grid search method to iterate these parameters, respectively, and to analyze the effect of these parameters on the accuracy scores and classification residuals. It was found that with the change of (C and gamma) in (0.01 similar to 1000), SVM's maximum variation of accuracy score is up to 0.63, and the maximum variation of residuals is 76,215 km(2). We concluded that SVM is sensitive to the parameters (C and gamma) and presents a positive correlation. When the parameters (tree and split) change between (100 similar to 600) and (1 similar to 6), respectively, the RF's maximum variation of accuracy score is 0.08, and the maximum variation of residuals is 1157 km(2), indicating that RF is low in sensitivity toward the parameters (tree and split). When the parameters (maxD and minSP) are between (10 similar to 60), the maximum accuracy change value is 0.06, and the maximum variation of residuals is 6943 km(2). Therefore, compared to RF, CART is sensitive to the parameters (maxD and minSP) and has poor robustness. In general, under the conditions of the hyperparameters, SVM and RF exhibit optimal classification performance, while CART has relatively inferior performance. Meanwhile, SVM, RF, and CART have different sensitivities toward the algorithm parameters; that is, SVM and CART are more sensitive to the algorithm parameters, while RF has low sensitivity toward changes in the algorithm parameters. The different parameters cause great changes in the accuracy scores and residuals, so it is necessary to determine the algorithm hyperparameters. Generally, default parameters can be used to achieve crop classification, but we recommend the enumeration method, similar to grid search, as a practical way to improve the classification performance of the algorithm if the best classification effect is expected.

TI  - Assessing the Usefulness of Iceberg Electromagnetic Backscatter Modeling Using a C-Band SAR Classifier
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents the validation of an electromagnetic (EM) backscatter model of icebergs at C-band by comparing the performances of target classifiers trained with both modeled and real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Simulated SAR data were obtained in a combination of imaging beam modes and scene parameters to produce 216 simulated Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images. Parameters consisted of Sentinel-1 IW1 (33.1 degrees) and IW3 (43.1 degrees) beam modes with varying wind speed (5 and 10 m/s), wind direction (0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees), and target orientation (0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees). Simulations were created from an EM SAR simulator called GRECOSAR, which took 3-D profiles of iceberg and ship targets and parameters necessary to closely mimic the real scenes. 3-D models of three icebergs were captured in a field study off the coast of Bonavista, Newfoundland, and Labrador, Canada in June 2017. Three generic ship models were sourced from an online inventory and scaled to a size equivalent to that of the iceberg targets. Real SAR image data were drawn from in-house data set collected from a complementary research program. Classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RanFor), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and neural network (NN) were trained with targets from modeled SAR data and then gradually mixed with real SAR data. Target classifier performance from the modeled target data was shown to be similar to classifiers trained entirely from real SAR data. The similarity in accuracy provides an indication of the validity of the modeled SAR data for this specific application.

TI  - Characterizing and mapping cropping patterns in a complex agro-ecosystem: An iterative participatory mapping procedure using machine learning algorithms and MODIS vegetation indices
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date spatial agricultural information is essential for applications including agro-environmental assessment, crop management, and appropriate targeting of agricultural technologies. There is growing research interest in spatial analysis of agricultural ecosystems applying satellite remote sensing technologies. However, usability of information generated from many of remotely sensed data is often constrained by accuracy problems. This is of particular concern in mapping complex agro-ecosystems in countries where small farm holdings are dominated by diverse crop types. This study is a contribution to the ongoing efforts towards overcoming accuracy challenges faced in remote sensing of agricultural ecosystems. We applied time-series analysis of vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor to detect seasonal patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns in five townships in the Central Dry Zone of Myanmar, which is an important agricultural region of the country has been poorly mapped with respect to cropping practices. To improve mapping accuracy and map legend completeness, we implemented a combination of (i) an iterative participatory approach to field data collection and classification, (ii) the identification of appropriate size and types of predictor variables (VIs), and (iii) evaluation of the suitability of three Machine Learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and C5.0 algorithms under varying training sample sizes. Through these procedures, we were able to progressively improve accuracy and achieve maximum overall accuracy of 95% When a small sized training dataset was used, accuracy achieved by RF was significantly higher compared to SVM and C5.0 (P < 0.01), but as sample size increased, accuracy differences among the three machine learning algorithms diminished. Accuracy achieved by use of NDVI was consistently better than that of EVI (P < 0.01). The maximum overall accuracy was achieved using RF and 8-days NDVI composites for three years of remote sensing data. In conclusion, our findings highlight the important role of participatory classification, especially in areas where cropping systems are highly diverse and differ over space and time. We also show that the choice of classifiers and size of predictor variables are essential and complementary to the participatory mapping approach in achieving desired accuracy of cropping pattern mapping in areas where other sources of spatial information are scarce.

TI  - Effectiveness of Stroke Early Supported Discharge Analysis From a National Stroke Registry
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Implementation of stroke early supported discharge (ESD) services has been recommended in many countries' clinical guidelines, based on clinical trial evidence. This is the first observational study to investigate the effectiveness of ESD service models operating in real-world conditions, at scale.Methods and Results: Using historical prospective data from the United Kingdom Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (January 1, 2016-December 31, 2016), measures of ESD effectiveness were "days to ESD" (number of days from hospital discharge to first ESD contact; n=6222), "rehabilitation intensity" (total number of treatment days/total days with ESD; n=5891), and stroke survivor outcome (modified Rankin scale at ESD discharge; n=6222). ESD service models (derived from Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme postacute organizational audit data) were categorized with a 17-item score, reflecting adoption of ESD consensus core components (evidence-based criteria). Multilevel modeling analysis was undertaken as patients were clustered within ESD teams across the Midlands, East, and North of England (n=31). A variety of ESD service models had been adopted, as reflected by variability in the ESD consensus score. Controlling for patient characteristics and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme hospital score, a 1-unit increase in ESD consensus score was significantly associated with a more responsive ESD service (reduced odds of patient being seen after >= 1 day of 29% [95% CI, 1%-49%] and increased treatment intensity by 2% [95% CI, 0.3%-4%]). There was no association with stroke survivor outcome measured by the modified Rankin Scale.Conclusions: This study has shown that adopting defined core components of ESD is associated with providing a more responsive and intensive ESD service. This shows that adherence to evidence-based criteria is likely to result in a more effective ESD service as defined by process measures.

TI  - Water-related ecosystems' mapping and assessment based on remote sensing techniques and geospatial analysis: The SWOS national service case of the Greek Ramsar sites and their catchments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and assessment of water-related ecosystems is a challenging task that requires advanced processing techniques with clear rules and standards in terminology and definition of class features. These ecosystems are hydrologically and ecologically connected at catchment level and co-exist within a human context. The SWOS (Satellite based Wetland Observation Service - Horizon 2020) national service case for mapping and assessing the 10 Greek Ramsar wetland sites and their catchment areas is built on the requirements of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. It contributes directly to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Global Indicator 6.6.1 "Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems". An Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach was adopted using Sentinel-2 satellite images for the year 2017, to discriminate 31 classes (wetland and non-wetland) over an area of 2,015,591 ha. The classification model was further adjusted to Landsat 5 TM imagery of previous years (1986-1987) in order to extract possible changes in the spatial extent of water-related ecosystems. The Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) ecosystem typology, as this was enhanced within SWOS, was applied. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the employed classification model, techniques and rules, in obtaining highly accurate (over 90%) mapping results on the spatial extent of water-related ecosystems. Also, they highlight the contribution of Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial analysis in assessments of area-based changes and their causes, as well as in identification of conservation and management priorities (i.e. areas for restoration). In addition, to address the need to strengthen national capacities, the established SWOS service lines have been used as a contribution to the user community.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic plays as a key climatic region, it is highly affected by climate change. Climate change has long been considered as an effect of global warming, it is derived from complex linkages and changes in climate variables. Land surface temperature (LST) is known as one of the essential climate variables (ECVs). Recent study founds that LST has risen in the Arctic. Due to the rising temperatures, there has been a massive decrease in basic Arctic features, which elevated the percentage of heat trapped in the surface. LST is an ECV which needs to be further investigated in key regions. This study aims to investigate LST changes over February 2000 to November 2019 in Spitsbergen. We used autoregression and multivariate regression with cubic spline used to investigate LST changes over this period in Spitsbergen. Four knots and seven knots cubic spline were applied, respectively, to detect acceleration and 7-year cycle. Research founds that LST in Spitsbergen rise by 1.039 degrees C per decade (CI 0.576-1.501;z: 4.403). Gustav Adolf Land, Nordaustlandet has the highest temperature rise, location of the well-known Vegafonna ice-caps. A notable increase has shown during winter days.

TI  - Trade-Offs Between 1-D and 2-D Regional River Hydrodynamic Models
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have seen the development of 1-D and 2-D regional-scale hydrological-hydrodynamic models, which differ greatly from reach-scale applications in terms of subgrid assumptions, parameterization, and applied resolution. Although 1-D and 2-D comparisons have already been performed at reach and local scales, model differences at regional scale are poorly understood. Moreover, there is a need to improve the coupling between hydrological and hydrodynamic models. It is addressed here by applying the MGB model at 1-D and 2-D dimensions for the whole similar to 700,000 km(2) Negro basin (Amazon), which presents different wetland types. Long-term continuous simulations are performed and validated with multisatellite observations of hydraulic variables. Results showed that both approaches are similarly able to estimate discharges and water levels along main rivers, especially considering parameter uncertainties, but differ in terms of flood extent and volume and water levels in complex wetlands. In these latter, the diffuse flow and drainage patterns were more realistically represented by the 2-D scheme, as well as wetland connectivity across the basin. The 2-D model led to higher drainage basinwide, while the 1-D model was more sensitive to hydrodynamic parameters for discharge and flood extent and had a similar sensitivity for water levels. Finally, tests on the coupling between hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes suggested that their representation in an online way is less important for tropical wetlands than model dimensionality, which largely impacts water transfer and repartition.Plain Language SummaryHydrologic-hydrodynamic numerical models are powerful tools for improving water resources and disaster management and for the understanding of hydrological processes. Last years have faced the development of regional-scale applications (i.e., areas between 10(4) to 10(6) km(2)), with approaches at both 1-D and 2-D dimensions, that is, by representing surface water transport in either one (along rivers) or two horizontal directions (in order to represent flood propagation in wetlands). In this study, we present a regional-scale application of the MGB model at both 1-D and 2-D dimensions for the Negro River Basin in the Amazon and compare its capability to simulate processes at the basin scale and for different wetland types. We show that current 1-D and 2-D models are similarly capable to represent discharges and water levels along main rivers, but for more complex wetlands, the 2-D models are required, especially for estimating water levels. We also show that for tropical wetlands, the consideration of feedbacks between hydrologic and hydrodynamics is less important than the dimensionality of the model (i.e., if it is 1-D or 2-D). New lessons on the functioning of complex river-wetland systems in the Amazon are presented, in special consideration of the current availability of remote sensing data sets.

TI  - CASNET2: evaluation of an electronic safety netting cancer toolkit for the primary care electronic health record: protocol for a pragmatic stepped-wedge RCT
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Safety-netting in primary care is the best practice in cancer diagnosis, ensuring that patients are followed up until symptoms are explained or have resolved. Currently, clinicians use haphazard manual solutions. The ubiquitous use of electronic health records provides an opportunity to standardise safety-netting practices.A new electronic safety-netting toolkit has been introduced to provide systematic ways to track and follow up patients. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this toolkit, which is embedded in a major primary care clinical system in England:Egerton Medical Information System(EMIS)-Web.Methods and analysis We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster RCT in 60 general practices within the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network. Groups of 10 practices will be randomised into the active phase at 2-monthly intervals over 12 months. All practices will be activated for at least 2 months. The primary outcome is the primary care interval measured as days between the first recorded symptom of cancer (within the year prior to diagnosis) and the subsequent referral to secondary care. Other outcomes include referrals rates and rates of direct access cancer investigation.Analysis of the clustered stepped-wedge design will model associations using a fixed effect for intervention condition of the cluster at each time step, a fixed effect for time and other covariates, and then include a random effect for practice and for patient to account for correlation between observations from the same centre and from the same participant.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the North West-Greater Manchester West National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (REC Reference 19/NW/0692). Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and sent to participating practices. They will be published on the University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Primary Care and RCGP RSC websites.

TI  - Estimating River Sediment Discharge in the Upper Mississippi River Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the decline of operational river gauges monitoring sediments, a viable means of quantifying sediment transport is needed. In this study, we address this issue by applying relationships between hydraulic geometry of river channels, water discharge, water-leaving surface reflectance (SR), and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) to quantify sediment discharge with the aid of space-based observations. We examined 5490 Landsat scenes to estimate water discharge, SSC, and sediment discharge for the period from 1984 to 2017 at nine gauging sites along the Upper Mississippi River. We used recent advances in remote sensing of fluvial systems, such as automated river width extraction, Bayesian discharge inference with at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG), and SSC-SR regression models. With 621 Landsat scenes available from all the gauging sites, the results showed that the water discharge and SSC retrieval from Landsat imagery can yield reasonable sediment discharge estimates along the Upper Mississippi River. An overall relative bias of -25.4, mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.24 x 10(4)tonne/day, relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 1.21, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.49 were obtained for the sediment discharge estimation. Based on these statistical metrics, we identified three of the nine gauging sites (St. Louis, MO; Chester, IL; and Thebes, IL), which were in the downstream portion of the river, to be the best locations for estimating water and sediment discharge using Landsat imagery.

TI  - Dynamic Management Zones for Irrigation Scheduling
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation scheduling decision-support tools can improve water use efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil and crop conditions within a season. Yet, little research is available on how to support real-time precision irrigation that varies within-season in both time and space. We investigate the integration of remotely sensed NDVI time-series, soil moisture sensor measurements, and root zone simulation forecasts for in-season delineation of dynamic management zones (MZ) and for a variable rate irrigation scheduling in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance. Delineation of MZ was conducted in a 5.8-ha maize field during 2018 using Sentinel-2 NDVI time-series and an unsupervised classification. The number and spatial extent of MZs changed through the growing season. A network of soil moisture sensors was used to interpret spatiotemporal changes of the NDVI. Soil water content was a significant contributor to changes in crop vigor across MZs through the growing season. Real-time cluster validity function analysis provided in-season evaluation of the MZ design. For example, the total within-MZ daily soil moisture relative variance decreased from 85% (early vegetative stages) to below 25% (late reproductive stages). Finally, using the Hydrus-1D model, a workflow for in-season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management was tested. Data simulations indicated that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications between 11 and 28.5% across the dynamic MZs. The proposed integration of spatiotemporal crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively control outputs of crop x environment x management interactions.

TI  - Integration of the bands of ASTER, OLI, MSI remote sensing sensors for detection of hydrothermal alterations in southwestern area of the Ardestan, Isfahan Province, Central Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews the band's integration of three remote sensing sensors for improving the detecting of hydrothermal alterations. The distinguishing feature of the various minerals has always been the challenge of Multispectral sensors due to the band's limitation. On the other hand, accessibility to Hyperspectral data requires paying a high cost. Also, the narrower bands in such data and the absence of suitable data to atmospheric correction can cause more errors. So, we hope that providing more bands by this method can detect hydrothermal alteration zones correctly. The integration method acts based on the spectral offset correction on the reflectance data of the images in a log-log plot. The data include bands of ASTER, MSI, and OLI sensors in the SWIR spectral region that are converted to reflectance by 6S atmospheric correction. For the spectral method of mineral detection, we have chosen the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) technique. This is a powerful classification to represses the influences of shading, solar illumination, and Albedo effects.Also, we benefit from the Concentration-Area(C-A) fractal model for specifying the range of thresholds. This review emphasizes that although the integration band method can lead to the detection of minerals in hydrothermal alterations, more investigation is still needed to achieve better results because it is unsuccessful to the identification of minerals which lacking the specific spectrum peak in the range of central wavelengths of the integrated bands.

TI  - Influence of fire foci on forest cover in the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In current times, variability and global climate change still require clarification of its effects on vegetation. The central issue in this discussion is how the distribution of fire foci can influence the vegetation cover pattern considering the spatial and temporal scales. Meteorological station data, together with Remote Sensing tools and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), produce very consistent results for monitoring the factors associated with the atmosphere - vegetation relationship. The present article aims to evaluate the relationship between occurrence of the fire foci and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in the state of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ), during the period from January 2000 to December 2015. EVIs were obtained through analysis of the sensor images Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with spatial (250 m) and temporal (16 days) resolutions, during 15 years, taking into consideration the different forest typologies of the biome in Atlantic forest as well as the SRJ administrative divisions. After the organization of the time series of fire foci, the Kernel density (20 km) was calculated for each month, to design the circular neighborhood around the fire foci. Afterward, the EVIs were obtained through analysis of the images of the sensors mentioned above, considering the same temporal and spatial scales. The present study revealed the occurrence of more than 10,000 fire foci in SRJ. According to the Pettit test, the years 2000, 2013, 2014 and 2015 recorded the highest frequency of occurrences. The North and Metropolitan regions of SRJ had a higher frequency of the fire foci, especially in the Ombrophylous Dense Forest and Pioneer Formations. However, Ombrophylous Forests, Seasonal Forest and Pioneer Formation showed an increase in forest cover from 2000 to 2013. In light of observed relationships between fire foci and EVI, the convergence of approaches to fire foci and EVI can be an effective tool for planning and management of natural resources in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Sentinel-3 Microwave Radiometers: Instrument Description, Calibration and Geophysical Products Performances
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Copernicus Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission embarks a two-channel microwave radiometer combined with the altimeter in order to correct the altimeter range for the excess path delay resulting from the presence of water vapour in the troposphere. The in-flight calibration of a single instrument is the critical point to achieve the expected performances. In the context of a constellation, the inter-calibration is even more important. After a presentation of the instrument design, we present the diagnoses used for the calibration of Sentinel-3A, using vicarious calibration over specific areas and double difference methods. The inter-calibration of Sentinel-3B with Sentinel-3A is performed during the tandem phase, using the residual differences of co-located measurements. Finally performances are assessed at crossover points with two parameters, first the wet troposphere correction by comparison with Jason-3; secondly on the Sea Surface Height by difference of variance. Analysis results have shown that Sentinel-3A is well calibrated, consistent with other instruments, and that Sentinel-3B is calibrated within 0.4 K with Sentinel-3A as a reference. Performances and stability fulfill the requirements for both missions.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on Nuclear Medicine in Germany, Austria and Switzerland: An International Survey in April 2020
T2  - NUKLEARMEDIZIN-NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Preparations of health systems to accommodate large number of severely ill COVID-19 patients in March/April 2020 has a significant impact on nuclear medicine departments. Materials and Methods A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. Results 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively. Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. Conclusions Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale. We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.

TI  - Irrigation water consumption and its impact on the groundwater aquifer of Wadi Uranah, Makkah, Saudi Arabia using remote sensing techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Saudi Arabia is of a limited water resources due to its sporadic and limited rainfall. During the last two decades, the rapid development of the country, together with increased population and living standards, resulted in drastic changes in water needs with irrigated agriculture consuming the highest amount of water (about 88%). The current study uses a prototype system to monitor crop water consumption at Wadi Uranah area, Makkah. The study relies on the use of the available satellite images (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) to extract the required parameters needed to calculate the water consumption for the different crops for one year. Results indicate that the area is mostly cultivated with vegetables which consumes a vast amount of water for irrigation. The calculated water consumption for the vegetated areas is about 112,670,088 m(3)/m(2)/year. These results indicate that the irrigation water recorded value at Wadi Uranah is about 7-folds the amount of the estimated annual recharge from rainfall water, which is estimated to be 14.2 Million m(3). The currently used irrigation methods contribute to even more loss in the groundwater than the currently calculated. Results from this study indicate that the groundwater aquifer in Wadi Uranah, Makkah, is at critical levels. Certain law enforced measures (type of cultivated crops, irrigation methods, areas being cultivated, etc.) must be applied to preserve and maintain the water resources in the area.

TI  - Distinct ecosystem types respond differentially to grazing exclosure
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we evaluate the ecosystem functioning and the ecosystems services supply of different vegetation types (grasslands, shrublands and woodlands) under contrasting management regimes by comparing a protected area with the surrounding landscape, which has been subjected to human disturbance in the Eastern Hills of Uruguay. We propose, based on functional attributes and vegetation physiognomy, a State and Transition Model for the dynamics of the grassland-woodland mosaic. We used remote sensing techniques to: (i) develop a land-cover map of the study area based on supervised Landsat imagery classification, and (ii) compare attributes of the ecosystem functioning (productivity and seasonality) and service supply derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The land-cover map showed that grasslands and shrublands were the most extensive land covers in the study area. These vegetation types presented higher productivity, seasonality and ecosystem service supply, outside the protected area than inside it. On the other hand, woodlands showed higher productivity, ecosystem service supply and lower seasonality inside the protected area than outside of it. Two axes represented the grassland-woodland mosaic dynamic: (i) the mean annual and (ii) the intra-annual coefficient of variation of the NDVI. Our results highlight that conservation of grasslands, shrublands and woodlands require different management strategies based on particular disturbance regimes like moderate grazing and controlled burns. Moderate disturbances may help to preserve ecosystem services provisioning in grasslands and shrublands. On the contrary, woodland conservation requires a more rigorous regime of protection against disturbances.

TI  - Determination of the Key Comparison Reference Value from Multiple Field Calibration of Sentinel-2B/MSI over the Baotou Site
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Field calibration is a feasible way to evaluate space-borne optical sensor observations via natural or artificial sites on Earth's surface with the aid of synchronous surface and atmospheric characteristic data. Since field calibration is affected by the coupled effects of surface and atmospheric characteristics, the single calibration results acquired under different surface and atmospheric conditions have different biases and different uncertainties, making it difficult to determine the consistency of these multiple calibration results. In view of this, by assuming that the radiometric performance is invariant during field calibration and the calibration samples are independent of each other, the surface-atmosphere invariant Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) is essentially derived from various calibration results. As the number of calibration samples increases, the uncertainty in the KCRV should decrease, and the KCRV should approach the "true" value. This paper addresses a novel method for estimating a weighted average value from multiple calibration results that can be used to compare each calibration result, and this value is accepted as the KCRV. Furthermore, this method is preliminarily applied to the field calibration of the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2B satellite via the desert target at the Baotou site, China. After employing a chi-squared test to verify that 12 calibration samples are independent from each other, the KCRV of the 12 calibration samples at the Baotou site is derived, which exhibits much lower uncertainty than a single sample. The results show that the KCRVs of the relative differences between the simulated and observed at-sensor reflectance are 3.75%, 5.11%, 6.09%, and 5.03% for the four bands of Sentinel-2B/MSI, respectively, and the corresponding uncertainties are 1.84%, 1.87%, 1.90%, and 1.93%. It is noted that the KCRV uncertainty obtained with only 12 calibration samples is reduced significantly, and in the future, more samples in other instrumented sites will be used to validate this method thoroughly.

TI  - Analysis of the changes and driving force of the water area in the Ulungur Lake over the past 40 years
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The inland lakes in arid regions, especially the terminal lakes, are highly sensitive to the influence of human activities and climate change. In order to analyze the evolution of the area of water in Ulungur Lake (Buluntuohai Lake, Jili Lake) and the main causes of those changes, 3S technology, satellite data preprocessing, water extraction and database construction methods are combined with consideration of climatic changes and human activity in this study. The data in this study include 11 phases of remote sensing image data, field mapping data and relevant attribute data of the study area from 1977 to 2017. The results demonstrated the following. (1) Over the past 40 years, the change in Ulungur Lake's area was characterized by natural expansion, fluctuation stability, and recovery increase. Significant changes were mainly concentrated in the waters of Zhonghaizi, Xiaohaizi, Camel's Neck, and the waters near Akekule. (2) The period from 1977 to 1995 was the expansion period of the lake water area, and human activities were the main driving factors. The period from 2000-2017 was a smaller period of expansion of the lake water area, with warmer and more humid climate trends combined with human activities driving the change. (3) The water area that was extracted based on theMNDWIwater index method can increase the contrast between bodies of water and buildings, which can aid in interpreting and extracting water element information from flat terrain and single types of surface features. This can provide an effective technical means for quantitative and dynamic analysis of the temporal and spatial changes in lake water area.

TI  - Drivers of Marine Heatwaves in the East China Sea and the South Yellow Sea in Three Consecutive Summers During 2016-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 3 consecutive years from 2016 to 2018, extreme ocean warming events, or marine heatwaves (MHWs), occurred during boreal summers in the East China Sea (ECS) and South Yellow Sea (SYS), which is unprecedented in the past four decades based on the satellite record. In this study, we used a high-resolution hydrodynamic model based on Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to simulate the evolution of these warming events. An upper ocean temperature budget (0-20 m) analysis based on the model results shows that the shortwave radiation and the ocean advection anomalies jointly contributed to the anomalous warming in the three successive summers (June-August) in the SYS and the north part of the ECS. In addition, the reduction of surface wind speeds during the 2016 and 2017 summers further weakened the vertical mixing, thereby enhancing the anomalous warming in the north part of the ECS adjacent to the SYS. During the three summers, the increases of shortwave radiation were closely related to the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) variability, which reduced the cloud cover in the ECS and SYS, whereas the advection anomalies were mostly associated with regional wind anomalies. In summer 2018, upper ocean heat was transported into the central trough of the SYS, accumulated in an anticyclonic eddy generated by the anomalous wind stress curls. Therefore, despite the primary driver of the MHWs is the EASM variation, regional processes are critical to driving the spatial pattern of the MHW intensity in the ECS and SYS.Plain Language Summary Marine heatwaves, known as periods of extreme warming at the sea surface, can last for days to months and cause damages to the marine environment and marine life. In the East China Sea and the South Yellow Sea, the frequent occurrences of harmful algae blooms are often associated with marine heatwaves. Satellite data reveal that marine heatwaves occurred in the East China Sea and the South Yellow Sea during the three boreal summers from 2016 to 2018, which is unprecedented in the past four decades. Using a numerical model of the ocean, we examined the marine heatwaves during these three successive summers. We show that the increased solar radiation, ocean current anomalies, and reduced vertical mixing were three critical factors for the warming events in the three summers. This study helps the fisheries and aquaculture industries in the East China Sea and the South Yellow Sea to better manage the environmental risks under a warming climate by predictions of marine heatwaves.

TI  - Axillary lymph node and non-sentinel lymph node metastasis among the ACOSOG Z0011 eligible breast cancer patients with invasive ductal, invasive lobular, or other histological special types: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Given the histological special types (HST) of breast carcinoma accounted for minority of the Z0011 study population, this study aimed to assess the rates of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement and non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), or other HST. Methods Patients with cT1-2N0M0 breast cancer treated between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively included from a multi-institutional database. Rates of nodal involvement were analyzed among different histological subgroups. The impact of ALN dissection (ALND) on adjuvant treatment decisions and prognosis were also analyzed among patients with 1-2 + SLNs. Results A total of 8294 patients were included: 6854 (82.6%), 257 (3.1%), and 1183 (14.3%) patients with IDC, ILC, and other HST, respectively. IDC patients had a significantly higher rate of ALN metastasis compared with ILC or other HST (31.9% vs. 22.6% vs. 16.4%,P < 0.001). However, in patients with 1-2 + SLNs, rates of non-SLN metastasis were similar among three groups (IDC:n = 182, 28.6% vs. ILC:n = 5, 31.2% vs. other HST:n = 29, 34.9%, P = 0.481). For patients with 1-2 + SLNs, rates of adjuvant chemotherapy and the estimated 3-year recurrence-free survival were similar between the SLN biopsy and ALND arms, regardless of the histological types. Conclusion Among patients with 1-2 + SLNs, ILC or other HST had similar rates of non-SLN metastasis compared with IDC. Omission of ALND may not influence adjuvant chemotherapy usage or disease outcome regardless of histological types.

TI  - A radiomics-based model for prediction of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop and validate a radiomics-based model for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in gastric cancer (GC).Method: A total of 768 GC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted from portal venous phase computed tomography (CT) scans. A radiomics signature was built with highly reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method in the training cohort (n= 486). The signature was further validated in internal validation (n= 240) and external testing cohorts (n= 42). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to build a model that combined radiomics signature, serum biomarkers, and lymph node status according to CT. Performance of the model was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The predictive value of the model was also evaluated in early stage GC (EGC) subgroup.Results: The radiomics signature comprised 7 robust features showed favorable prediction efficacy in all cohorts. A radiomics-based model that incorporated radiomics signature, serum CA72-4, and CT-reported lymph node status had good calibration and discrimination in training cohort [AUC, 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.890.95] and validation cohort (AUC 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91). The model also showed a favorable predictive performance for EGC patients with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.94). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of this model.Conclusions: The radiomics-based model showed favorable accuracy for prediction of LNM in GC. The model may also serve as a noninvasive tool for preoperative evaluation of LNM in EGC.

TI  - Primary care EMR and administrative data linkage in Alberta, Canada: describing the suitability for hypertension surveillance
T2  - BMJ HEALTH & CARE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To describe the process for linking electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data in Alberta and examine the advantages and limitations of utilising linked data for hypertension surveillance.Methods De-identified EMR data from 323 primary care providers contributing to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Alberta were used. Mapping files from each contributing provider were generated from their EMR to facilitate linkage to administrative data within the provincial health data warehouse. Deterministic linkage was conducted using valid personal healthcare number (PHN) with age and/or sex. Characteristics of patients and providers in the linked cohort were compared with population-level sources. Criteria used to define hypertension in both sources were examined.Results Data were successfully linked for 6307 hypertensive patients (96.2% of eligible patients) from 49 contributing providers. Non-linkages from invalid PHN (n=246) occurred more for deceased patients and those with fewer primary care encounters, with differences due to type of EMR and patient EMR status. The linked cohort had more patients who were female, >60 years and residing in rural areas compared to the provincial healthcare registry. Family physicians were more often female and medically trained in Canada compared to all physicians in Alberta. Most patients (>97%) had >= 1 record in the registry, pharmacy, emergency/ambulatory care and claims databases; 44.3% had >= 1 record in the hospital discharge database.Conclusion EMR-administrative data linkage has the potential to enhance hypertension surveillance. The current linkage process in Alberta is limited and subject to selection bias. Processes to address these deficiencies are under way.

TI  - The application of a radar-based depth inversion method to monitor near-shore nourishments on an open sandy coast and an ebb-tidal delta
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal management in the Netherlands has the aim to defend coastal zones by preventing flooding and mitigating erosion. To that end, large-scale nourishments are placed in the nearshore, which are supposed to dynamically preserve the coastal zone over a timescale of years. To assess their effectiveness, these nourishments are monitored over large areas and long durations. As repetitive, in-situ measurements become too expensive, remote sensing offers an attractive alternative, mapping depth and near-surface current fields via depth inversion algorithms (DIA). However, the information that can be derived from remotely-sensed data is subject to improvement. In this study a 3D-FFT based DIA named XMFit (X-Band Matlab Fitting) is introduced, which is robust, accurate and fast enough for operational use. Focusing on depth estimates, the algorithm was validated for two case studies in the Netherlands: (1) the "Sand Engine", a beach mega nourishment at a uniform open coast, and (2) the tidal inlet of the Dutch Wadden Sea island Ameland, characterizing a more complex coast. Considering both sites, the algorithm performance was characterized by a spatially averaged depth bias of -0.9 m at the Sand Engine and a time-varying bias of approximately -2 - 0 m at the Ameland Inlet. When compared to in-situ depth surveys the accuracy was lower, but the time resolution higher. Depth estimates from the Ameland tidal inlet were produced every 50 min by an operational system using a navigational X-Band radar to monitor the placement of a 5 million m(3) ebb-tidal delta nourishment - a pilot measure for coastal management. Volumetric changes in the nourishment area over the year 2018, occurring at 7 km distance from the radar, were estimated with an error of 7%. Depth errors statistically correlated with the direction and magnitude of simultaneous near-surface current estimates. Additional experiments on Sand Engine data demonstrated that depth errors may be significantly reduced using an alternative spectral approach and/or by using a Kalman filter.

TI  - The Potential of the Least-Squares Spectral and Cross-Wavelet Analyses for Near-Real-Time Disturbance Detection within Unequally Spaced Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real-time disturbance detection within the remotely sensed time series has become a crucial task in many environmental applications that can help policymakers and responsible authorities to make rapid decisions and proper actions. Although there are several techniques for the near-real-time monitoring of time series, their reliability in regions with higher latitudes are not yet assessed, particularly in regions with consistent data gaps in certain time periods and with large observational uncertainties. A new method is proposed that determines a stable history period from which the least-squares spectral analysis can detect and classify the changes in newly acquired data. To validate the effectiveness of the method, both simulated and real-world vegetation time series obtained for a region in northern Alberta, Canada, are used, where there are consistent data gaps from November to April each year due to the availability of valid Landsat satellite imagery and climate conditions. Furthermore, the least-squares cross-wavelet analysis is applied to demonstrate how the temperature and precipitation time series can be used for assessment of the results. The proposed method is fast, does not rely on any interpolation methods, leaves the data gap as is, considers the observational uncertainties, and does not depend on thresholds.

TI  - MONITORING AND SURVEY OF SNOW CLIMATOLOGICAL PARAMETER AREA USING REMOTE SENSING DATA IN ZAGROS MOUNTAINS RANGE, LOCATED ON THE EASTERN BORDER OF IRAQ
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As snowfall plays a vital role in the supply of water resources to all living things on the planet, its wasting must be avoided by careful planning. In recent decades, with the rising temperatures of the Earth and the melting of mountain snow, many scientists have taken the view of this natural hazard, so it is important to address this issue. The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyze the snow area and depth in the Zagros mountain range. For this purpose, TERRA - MODIS satellite image data for Iran were used. The timeframe of the selected images is between 2000 and 2019. Tips for selecting images are taken into account, with an averaging three months (Jan, Feb and Mar) image of winter in each year. Based on the results, the decreasing trend of groundwater aquifer trend with the amount of snowfall in the study area is highly correlated at the level of 0.94% and this decrease has been highly correlated since 2007 onwards. The largest decline in groundwater use by the CSR model was in November 2017 with 18.29 cm. The maximum average of three-month snowfall variations (January, February and March) in the study area during the period (2000 to 2019) was 55.16 cm in 2008. Average quarterly snow depth variations (January, February and March) fluctuated in the study area, the most severe between 2007 and 2014, with 2008 snowfall averaging 110.21 cm. According to the comparisons made during the study period, the lowest snow cover area was for the winter quarter (Jan, Feb and Mar) of 2018 with a value of 3919.423 km(2) and the highest was obtained for the quarter of 2007 with the amount of 86515.925 km(2). These results imply that the relevant authorities in the study area must adopt careful planning in water resources management.

TI  - Optimal texture image reconstruction method for improvement of SAR image matching
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image matching is an important step that is taken in most synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images applications. In this study, a method is proposed for texture image reconstruction to improve SAR image matching. This method consists of three major steps. First, textural features are extracted. Second optimal texture images (OTIs) are created using extracted features. Texture optimisation is conducted using a cat swarm optimisation algorithm. The cost function is the number of correct matched points that are obtained from speeded-up robust features (SURFs) image matching algorithm. Finally, corresponding points on stereo OTI pairs are matched. Experiments were conducted on spaceborne SAR image pairs consist of RADARSAT-2, ALOSPALSAR, and Sentinel-1. Results demonstrate that the proposed method has better results in terms of the number of matched points compared to the result of the original SURF and scale-invariant feature transform methods as two common matching methods.

TI  - First Evaluation of PRISMA Level 1 Data for Water Applications
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a first assessment of the Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances measured in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa), the new hyperspectral satellite sensor of the Italian Space Agency in orbit since March 2019. In particular, the radiometrically calibrated PRISMA Level 1 TOA radiances were compared to the TOA radiances simulated with a radiative transfer code, starting from in situ measurements of water reflectance. In situ data were obtained from a set of fixed position autonomous radiometers covering a wide range of water types, encompassing coastal and inland waters. A total of nine match-ups between PRISMA and in situ measurements distributed from July 2019 to June 2020 were analysed. Recognising the role of Sentinel-2 for inland and coastal waters applications, the TOA radiances measured from concurrent Sentinel-2 observations were added to the comparison. The results overall demonstrated that PRISMA VNIR sensor is providing TOA radiances with the same magnitude and shape of those in situ simulated (spectral angle difference, SA, between 0.80 and 3.39; root mean square difference, RMSD, between 0.98 and 4.76 [mW m(-2)sr(-1)nm(-1)]), with slightly larger differences at shorter wavelengths. The PRISMA TOA radiances were also found very similar to Sentinel-2 data (RMSD < 3.78 [mW m(-2)sr(-1)nm(-1)]), and encourage a synergic use of both sensors for aquatic applications. Further analyses with a higher number of match-ups between PRISMA, in situ and Sentinel-2 data are however recommended to fully characterize the on-orbit calibration of PRISMA for its exploitation in aquatic ecosystem mapping.

TI  - Localized Subsidence Zones in Gavle City Detected by Sentinel-1 PSI and Leveling Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among different sets of constraints and hazards that have to be considered in the management of cities and land use, land surface subsidence is one of the important issues that can lead to many problems, and its economic consequences cannot be ignored. In this study, the ground surface deformation of Gavle city in Sweden is investigated using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique as well as analyzing the historical leveling data. The PSI technique is used to map the location of hazard zones and their ongoing subsidence rate. Two ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets, collected between January 2015 and May 2020, covering the Gavle city, were processed and analyzed. In addition, a long record of a leveling dataset, covering the period from 1974 to 2019, was used to detect the rate of subsidence in some locations which were not reported before. Our PSI analysis reveals that the center of Gavle is relatively stable with minor deformation ranged between -2 +/- 0.5 mm/yr to +2 +/- 0.5 mm/yr in vertical and east-west components. However, the land surface toward the northeast of the city is relatively subsiding with a higher annual rate of up to -6 +/- 0.46 mm/yr. The comparison at sparse locations shows a close agreement between the subsidence rates obtained from precise leveling and PSI results. The regional quaternary deposits map was overlaid with PSI results and it shows the subsidence areas are mostly located in zones where the subsurface layer is marked by artificial fill materials. The knowledge of the spatio-temporal extents of land surface subsidence for undergoing urban areas can help to develop and establish models to mitigate hazards associated with such land settlement.

TI  - Vaginal fertility-sparing surgery and laparoscopic sentinel lymph node detection in early cervical cancer. Retrospective study with 15 years of follow-up
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncological outcomes of vaginal fertility-sparing surgery plus laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early cervical cancer over a 15 years period.Patients and methods: From March 2005 to April 2018, 38 patients diagnosed with early stage cervical cancer underwent vaginal fertility-sparing surgery at the Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain. Patients with FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion and stage IA2 underwent simple trachelectomy and patients with stage IB1 underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy. All cases underwent laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the first 19 cases, laparoscopic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was completed immediately after sentinel lymph node biopsy. Clinical and oncological follow-up data were collected.Results: The median age at diagnosis was 33.5 years (range 22-44). Simple trachelectomy was performed in seven cases (18.4%) and vaginal radical trachelectomy in 31 (81.6%). Nineteen patients were exclusively treated with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy and 19 with sentinel lymph node biopsy plus laparoscopic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. There were no significant differences between the two lymph node assessment groups regarding histology and tumour size. The median follow-up was 73 months (range 1-160 months). There were 4 recurrences (3 patients with IB1 and 1 with IA2). Two occurred in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group and 2 in the sentinel lymph node biopsy plus laparoscopic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy group. All the recurrences were diagnosed in patients with adenocarcinoma and in 3 patients without lymphovascular space invasion.Conclusion: Vaginal fertility-sparing surgery combined with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy seems to be a safe oncological procedure in selected patients with early stage cervical cancer. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in fertilitysparing surgery in cervical cancer. Adenocarcinoma histology seems to be an important risk factor for recurrence. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Decision Process for Optimizing Multi-Hazard Shelter Location Using Global Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating the effects of natural hazards through infrastructure planning requires integration of diverse types of information from a range of fields, including engineering, geography, social science, and geology. Challenges in data availability and previously siloed data have hindered the ability to obtain the information necessary to support decision making for disaster risk management. This is particularly challenging for areas susceptible to multiple types of natural hazards, especially in low-income communities that lack the resources for data collection. The data revolution is altering this landscape, due to the increased availability of remotely sensed data and global data repositories. This work seeks to leverage these advancements to develop a framework using open global datasets for identifying optimal locations for disaster relief shelters. The goal of this study is to empower low-income regions and make resilience more equitable by providing a multi-hazard shelter planning framework that is accessible to all decision-makers. The tool described integrates spatial multi-criteria decision analysis methods with a network analysis procedure to inform decisions regarding disaster shelter planning and siting.

TI  - Assessment of InSight Landing Site Predictions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive analysis of remote sensing data used to select the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) landing site correctly predicted the atmospheric temperature and pressure profile during entry and descent, the safe landing surface, and the geologic setting of the site. The smooth plains upon which the InSight landing site is located were accurately predicted to be generally similar to the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit landing site with relatively low rock abundance, low slopes, and a moderately dusty surface with a 3-10 m impact fragmented regolith over Hesperian to Early Amazonian basaltic lava flows. The deceleration profile and surface pressure encountered by the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing compared well (within 1 sigma) of the envelope of modeled temperature profiles and the expected surface pressure. Orbital estimates of thermal inertia are similar to surface radiometer measurements, and materials at the surface are dominated by poorly consolidated sand as expected. Thin coatings of bright atmospheric dust on the surface were as indicated by orbital albedo and dust cover index measurements. Orbital estimates of rock abundance from shadow measurements in high-resolution images and thermal differencing indicated very low rock abundance and surface counts show 1-4% area covered by rocks. Slopes at 100 to 5 m length scale measured from orbital topographic and radar data correctly indicated a surface comparably smooth and flat as the two smoothest landing sites (Opportunity and Phoenix). Thermal inertia and radar data indicated the surface would be load bearing as found.

T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yakov V. Abramov, a theorist and practitioner of the culturalist trend, held a special position in the camp of the reformist populism of the 1880s-1890s. He argued the idea of developing "small deeds" into "great deeds" and justified the need to enlighten people's consciousness and to change the principle of modern society's existence peacefully yet fundamentally. Defining his own self-actualisation strategy in socially beneficial activities, he purposefully formed his own circle of reading which reflects the breadth of his interests and represents his integrated approach to the development of scientific knowledge. The materials of archival research show that Abramov actualised the social and educational functions of literature, relating the progressive development of Russia to people's exposure to education and culture, back in the period of the formation of his ideology and democratic positions. Abramov developed his worldview learning the ideas of European Enlightenment and the theories of utopian socialism. Extracts from the writings of Montesquieu, Charles Fourier, Ferdinand Lassalle, and Louis Blanc testify to the social orientation of the spiritual and moral quests of the future populist ideologist and his critical attitude to the existing social system. While appreciating Montesquieu's On the Spirit of the Laws as a product of intellectual activity, Abramov emphasised that not all Montesquieu's ideas responded to the challenges of the new time and gave a clear preference to the works of modern European socialists. In the writings of Fourier, Lassalle, and Blanc, he found thoughts and ideas consonant with his thoughts about the domination of one class over the others established in the world, about the plight of the working masses not only in Russia, but also in other countries of the world. The problem of the "advantages of capital over labour", the anti-human essence of the "open economy" and the laws of capitalist exploitation became objects of Abramov's social analysis. In the writings of the utopian socialists, who argued for peaceful revolutions, one can see the genesis of Abramov's philosophy of social evolutionism that proved the historical productivity of the peaceful "people's movement forward" by means of developing education, culture, and economy in the name of a radical transformation of society and bringing humans to a higher level. Abramov's surviving notebooks and diaries of the second half of the 1870s record a high level of sociophilosophical reflection, which largely determined the interpretation of the dialectic of "small and great deeds", the practice of his real "work among the people".

TI  - Structural assessment and geochemistry of thermal waters at the Cerro Machin Volcano (Colombia): An approach to understanding the geothermal system
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Through a detailed structural assessment of faults, carried out by remote sensing and a slip-dilation tendency analysis along with water geochemistry of thermal waters, it was possible to characterize the geothermal system of Cerro Machin Volcano (CMV) located in the western flank of the Cordillera Central of Colombia. The study shows that the geothermal system presents a favorable structural setting for the transport of fluids (e.g. fault intersection), where the structural component is marked by faults striking NW-SE, NE-SW, and N-S, controlling its deformational model, permeability and therefore, the fluid flow path. In addition, hydro-geochemistry allows identifying two sets of water (i) Na-HCO3 and (ii) Ca-HCO3 types. Na-HCO3 springs are representatives of a more direct upflow in the system, where fluid uses critically stressed areas to ascend. In contrast, Ca-HCO3 springs are more strongly affected by subsurface process such as mixing and water rock interaction. The geothermal system is characterized of a convection-dominated geothermal play associated with recent volcanism, which is recharged by meteoric waters that flow through fractures and faults and is strongly influenced by a CO2-rich fluid coming from deeper levels. The reservoir occupies a fracture zone within the Cajamarca complex with an estimated temperature of around 220 degrees C, according to solute and multicomponent geothermometry.

TI  - Neuroimaging findings associated with the fetal inflammatory response syndrome
T2  - SEMINARS IN FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) is a condition whereby the fetus mounts an inflammatory response to intrauterine infection/inflammation. Clinical consequences include preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), spontaneous preterm delivery, neonatal sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and brain and other organ injury. Mechanisms leading to brain injury in FIRS have been investigated in animal and human studies. We review the neumimaging findings of brain injury in FIRS, which overlap those of hypoxic-ischemic injury, and clinical correlation is necessary for a correct diagnosis. FIRS should be considered the primary diagnosis when neuroimaging findings such as periventricular leukomalacia are identified in preterm children born as a consequence of PPROM and spontaneous preterm labor. Additionally, FIRS should be considered in term infants who do not have the most common features of HIE (e.g. a sentinel event). Systematic histopathologic examination of the placenta and umbilical cord and/or detection of characteristic inflammatory markers in such cases are needed to establish the correct diagnosis.

M3  - Article
AB  - We present "The Wall", the first web-based platform that animates the Earth in true natural color and close to real-time. The living planet is displayed both during day and night with a pixel resolution of approximately 1 km and a time frequency of 10 min. The automatic processing chains use the synchronized measurements provided by three geostationary satellites: the METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG2), Himawari-8, and GOES-16. A Rayleigh scattering correction is applied, and a cloud of artificial neural networks, chosen to render "true natural color" RBG composites, is used to recreate the missing daytime bands in the visible spectrum. The reconstruction methodology is validated by means of the TERRA/AQUA "Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer" (MODIS) instrument reflectance values. "The Wall" is a dynamic broadcasting platform from which the scientific community and the public can trace local and Earth-wide phenomena and assess their impact on the globe.

TI  - Detection of landslide induced by large earthquake using InSAR coherence techniques - Northwest Zagros, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Iran earthquake of November 12, 2017 is one of the most significant earthquakes throughout the history of Iran, which shook the regions of NW Zagros Mountains, Sarpol-e Zahab Region, and Northwest of Iran with a sheer magnitude of 7.3 Mw. The earthquake triggered many succeeding landslides, causing the largest seismic landslide in Iran (Maleh-Kabood) over the past few centuries. The seismic landslide was detected using coherence change detection techniques. Nine Single Look Complex (SLC) of Sentinel-1A, B imageries were processed to build interferometric coherence products. The coherence results enabled the detection of the surface area for the Maleh-Kabood landslide caused by the Azgleh earthquake. Its instability was recognized over time. The results also indicated that the surface deformation of Maleh-Kabood landslide continued on owing to aftershocks of a size greater than 4.5 Mw following the Azgleh earthquake. The results are indicative of the robustness of the InSAR coherence technique in detecting surface deformation as well as seismic landslide studies and environmental monitoring. The results also stipulated the potential of Sentinel-1A, B C-band coherence maps as suitable tool for the detection of active landslides.

TI  - Reducing Global Environmental Uncertainties in Reports of Tropical Forest Carbon Fluxes to REDD plus and the Paris Agreement Global Stocktake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The magnitude of net carbon dioxide emissions resulting from global forest carbon change, and hence the contribution of forests to global climate change, is highly uncertain, owing to the lack of direct measurement by Earth observation and ground data collection. This paper uses a new method to evaluate this uncertainty with greater precision than before. Sources of uncertainty are divided into conceptualization and measurement categories and distributed between the spatial, vertical and temporal dimensions of Earth observation. The method is applied to Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) reports and National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGGIs) submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by 12 countries containing half of tropical forest area. The two sets of estimates are typical of those to be submitted to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) mechanism of the UNFCCC and the 2023 Global Stocktake of its Paris Agreement, respectively. Assembling the Uncertainty Fingerprint of each estimate shows that Uncertainty Scores are between 10 and 14 for the NGGIs and 5 and 10 for the FREL reports, and so both exceed the threshold of 2 when it is advisable to evaluate uncertainty by standard statistical methods. Conceptualization uncertainties account for 60% of all uncertainties in the NGGIs and 47% in the FREL reports, e.g., there is incomplete coverage of forest carbon fluxes, and limited disaggregation of fluxes between different ecosystem types and forest carbon pools. Of the measurement uncertainties, all FREL reports base forest area estimates on at least medium resolution satellite data, compared with only 3 NGGIs; after REDD+ Readiness schemes, mean area mapping frequency has fallen to 2.3 years in Latin America and 3.0 years in Asia, but only 8.3 years in Africa; and carbon density estimates are based on national forest inventory data in all FREL reports but only 4 NGGIs. The effectiveness of the Global Stocktake and REDD+ monitoring will therefore be constrained by considerable uncertainties, and to reduce these requires a new phase of REDD+ Readiness to ensure more frequent national forest inventories and forest carbon mapping.

TI  - Individual Tree Crown Delineation from UAS Imagery Based on Region Growing and Growth Space Considerations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipped with various sensors (e.g., Lidar, multispectral sensors, and/or cameras) has provided the capability to "see" the individual trees in a forest. Individual tree crowns (ITCs) are the building blocks of precision forestry, because this knowledge allows users to analyze, model and manage the forest at the individual tree level by combing multiple data sources (e.g., remote sensing data and field surveys). Trees in the forest compete with other vegetation, especially neighboring trees, for limited resources to grow into the available horizontal and vertical space. Based on this assumption, this research developed a new region growing method that began with treetops as the initial seeds, and then segmented the ITCs, considering its growth space between the tree and its neighbors. The growth space was allocated by Euclidian distance and adjusted based on the crown size. Results showed that the over-segmentation accuracy (Oa), under-segmentation (Ua), and quality rate (QR) reached 0.784, 0.766, and 0.382, respectively, if the treetops were detected from a variable window filter based on an allometric equation for crown width. The Oa, Ua, and QR increased to 0.811, 0.853, and 0.296, respectively, when the treetops were manually adjusted. Treetop detection accuracy has a great impact on ITCs delineation accuracy. The uncertainties and limitations within this research including the interpretation error and accuracy measures were also analyzed and discussed, and a unified framework assessing the segmentation accuracy was highly suggested.

TI  - A Sensitive, One-Way Sequential Sieving Method to Isolate Helminths' Eggs and Protozoal Oocysts from Lettuce for Genetic Identification
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Different helminths and protozoa are transmitted to humans by oral uptake of environmentally resistant parasite stages after hand-to-mouth contact or by contaminated food and water. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method for the simultaneous detection of parasite stages from fresh produce (lettuce) by a one-way isolation test kit followed by genetic identification (PCR, sequencing). Three sentinel zoonotic agents (eggs of Toxocara canis, Echinococcus multilocularis and oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii) were used to investigate the practicability and sensitivity of the method. The detection limits (100% positive results) in the recovery experiments were four Toxocara eggs, two E. multilocularis eggs and 18 T. gondii oocysts (in 4/5 replicates). In a field study, helminth DNA was detected in 14 of 157 lettuce samples including Hydatigera taeniaeformis (Syn. Taenia taeniaeformis) (four samples), T. polyacantha (three), T. martis (one), E. multilocularis (two) and Toxocara cati (four). Toxoplasma gondii was detected in six of 100 samples. In vivo testing in mice resulted in metacestode growth in all animals injected with 40-60 E. multilocularis eggs, while infection rates were 20-40% with 2-20 eggs. The developed diagnostic strategy is highly sensitive for the isolation and genetic characterisation of a broad range of parasite stages from lettuce, whereas the sensitivity of the viability tests needs further improvement.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge on the Total Suspended Solids in the Pearl River Estuary Based on Landsat Time Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended solids (TSSs) can affect primary production through influencing light penetration and nutrient availability in aquatic environments. In this study, novel algorithms were developed for TSS in the Pearl River estuary using Landsat-derived reflectance corrected for Rayleigh scattering (R-rc). Comparisons between in situ and estimated TSS using the calibration and validation data sets resulted in R(2)s > 0.8 and mean absolute percentage errors < 35%. Landsat-derived annual TSS between 1987 and 2018 in the Pearl River estuary ranged from 16.5 to 41 mg L-1. It indicated a statistically significant decreasing trend with an annual rate of 0.26 mg L-1 and decreased by 58.5% from 1987 to 2018. It showed a higher decreasing rate after than before the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Nonetheless, TSS 2 km upstream from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge on the western side increased after the construction of the bridge related to the change of flow influenced by piers and artificial islands.

TI  - Predicting Land Cover Change in the Mamminasata Area, Indonesia, to Evaluate the Spatial Plan
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial plan program for Makassar City and the surrounding area called Mamminasata (Makassar, Maros, Sungguminasa, and Takalar) was created by the Indonesian Government. The program regulates the proportion of land cover, but predictions about land cover changes were not considered. Therefore, in this study, we predict what the land cover may be in 2031 using the multi-layer perceptron neural network and the Markov chain methods. For this purpose, image composite, support vector machine classifier, and change detection were applied to a time series of satellite data. Visual validation showed the hot-spots of land cover changes related to population density, and statistical validation scored 0.99 and 0.78 in no information kappa and grid-cell level location kappa, respectively. The model was performed to predict land cover in 2031, and the predicted result was then compared with the spatial plan using an overlapping method. The results showed that built-up area, dryland agriculture, and wetland agriculture occupied two, twenty, and eight percent of the protected zone, respectively. Meanwhile, fifteen percent of the development zone was covered by forest, mainly in the eastern part of Mamminasata. The result can be used to help the Government decide future plans for the Mamminasata area.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Tandem Phase Sentinel-3 OLCI Sensor Uncertainty on the Estimation of Potential Ocean Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 tandem project represents the first time that two ocean colour satellites have been flown in the same orbit with minimal temporal separation (similar to 30 s), thus allowing them to have virtually identical views of the ocean. This offers an opportunity for understanding how differences in individual sensor uncertainty can affect conclusions drawn from the data. Here, we specifically focus on trend estimation. Observational chlorophyll-auncertainty is assessed from the Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI-A) and Sentinel-3B OLCI (OLCI-B) sensors using a bootstrapping approach. Realistic trends are then imposed on a synthetic chlorophyll-atime series to understand how sensor uncertainty could affect potential long-term trends in Sentinel-3 OLCI data. We find that OLCI-A and OLCI-B both show very similar trends, with the OLCI-B trend estimates tending to have a slightly wider distribution, although not statistically different from the OLCI-A distribution. The spatial pattern of trend estimates is also assessed, showing that the probability distributions of trend estimates in OLCI-A and OLCI-B are most similar in open ocean regions, and least similar in coastal regions and at high northern latitudes. This analysis shows that the two sensors should provide consistent trends between the two satellites, provided future ageing is well quantified and mitigated. The Sentinel-3 programme offers a strong baseline for estimating long-term chlorophyll-atrends by offering a series of satellites (starting with Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that use the same sensor design, reducing potential issues with cross-calibration between sensors. This analysis contributes an important understanding of the reliability of the two current Sentinel-3 OLCI sensors for future studies of climate change driven chlorophyll-atrends.

TI  - Chimney Detection Based on Faster R-CNN and Spatial Analysis Methods in High Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially location and working status of pollution sources are very important pieces of information for environment protection. Waste gas produced by fossil fuel consumption in the industry is mainly discharged to the atmosphere through a chimney. Therefore, detecting the distribution of chimneys and their working status is of great significance to urban environment monitoring and environmental governance. In this paper, we use an open access dataset BUAA-FFPP60 and the faster regions with convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) algorithm to train the preliminarily detection model. Then, the trained model is used to detect the chimneys in three high-resolution remote sensing images of Google Maps, which is located in Tangshan city. The results show that a large number of false positive targets are detected. For working chimney detection, the recall rate is 77.27%, but the precision is only 40.47%. Therefore, two spatial analysis methods, the digital terrain model (DTM) filtering, and main direction test are introduced to remove the false chimneys. The DTM is generated by ZiYuan-3 satellite images and then registered to the high-resolution image. We set an elevation threshold to filter the false positive targets. After DTM filtering, we use principle component analysis (PCA) to calculate the main direction of each target image slice, and then use the main direction to remove false positive targets further. The results show that by using the combination of DTM filtering and main direction test, more than 95% false chimneys can be removed and, therefore, the detection precision is significantly increased.

TI  - Vegetation Products Derived from <i>Fengyun-3D</i> Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface vegetation condition has been operationally monitored from space for many years by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. As these instruments are close to the end of their design life, the surface vegetation products are required by many users from the new satellite missions. The MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard the Fengyun (FY) satellite (FY-3 series;FY-3D) is used to retrieve surface vegetation parameters. First, MERSI-II solar channel measurements at the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands at the top of atmosphere (TOA) are corrected to the surface reflectances at the top of canopy (TOC) by removing the contributions of scattering and absorption of molecules and aerosols. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at both the TOA and TOC is then produced by using the same algorithms as the MODIS and AVHRR. The MERSI-II enhanced VI (EVI) at the TOC is also developed. The MODIS technique of compositing the NDVI at various timescales is applied to MERSI-II to generate the gridded products at different resolutions. The MERSI-II VI products are consistent with the MODIS data without systematic biases. Compared to the current MERSI-II EVI generated from the ground operational system, the MERSI-II EVI from this study has a much better agreement with MODIS after atmospheric correction.

TI  - Comparing Fully Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Land Cover Classification with High-Spatial-Resolution Gaofen-2 Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is an important variable of the terrestrial ecosystem that provides information for natural resources management, urban sprawl detection, and environment research. To classify land cover with high-spatial-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery is a difficult problem due to heterogeneous spectral values of the same object on the ground. Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are a state-of-the-art method that has been increasingly used in image segmentation and classification. However, a systematic quantitative comparison of FCNs on high-spatial-multispectral remote imagery was not yet performed. In this paper, we adopted the three FCNs (FCN-8s, Segnet, and Unet) for Gaofen-2 (GF2) satellite imagery classification. Two scenes of GF2 with a total of 3329 polygon samples were used in the study area and a systematic quantitative comparison of FCNs was conducted with red, green, blue (RGB) and RGB+near infrared (NIR) inputs for GF2 satellite imagery. The results showed that: (1) The FCN methods perform well in land cover classification with GF2 imagery, and yet, different FCNs architectures exhibited different results in mapping accuracy. The FCN-8s model performed best among the Segnet and Unet architectures due to the multiscale feature channels in the upsampling stage. Averaged across the models, the overall accuracy (OA) andKappacoefficient (Kappa) were 5% and 0.06 higher, respectively, in FCN-8s when compared with the other two models. (2) High-spatial-resolution remote sensing imagery with RGB+NIR bands performed better than RGB input at mapping land cover, and yet the advantage was limited; theOAandKappaonly increased an average of 0.4% and 0.01 in the RGB+NIR bands. (3) The GF2 imagery provided an encouraging result in estimating land cover based on the FCN-8s method, which can be exploited for large-scale land cover mapping in the future.

TI  - Methodological Potential of the Complexity Concept in Education Modernization
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the existential situation of the humanity are increasingly testifying to their multidimensional, unpredictable and complex nature. Such complex entities as a society and a person not only demonstrate their multidimensionality and potential for development, but also need a different methodology for understanding them. The complexity concept allows to analyze existing problems looking at them in the context of probability and contingency. Complexity represents the reflection of the cognitive process itself, which is constantly transforming, generating unexpected meanings and opening up new facets of the modem world.The article analyses the possibilities of the methodological potential of the complexity concept for the education modernization, which would take into account the variability and complexity of both the society and the human world. Education as a public institution is in the state of constant changing and reforming. The educational process is based on the understanding of knowledge as an open and incomplete one, which is in the process of development. Under such conditions, education is considered as an innovative environment that contributes to the formation of innovative characteristics and innovative thinking among all participants in the educational interaction. Its value for modern education lies in the fact that, firstly, it offers a model of a person's self-development in the rapidly changing and evolving world and secondly, it addresses the most important worldview problem - a person's search for his place in this world.

TI  - Development of a time-varying MODIS/2D hydrodynamic model relationship between water levels and flooded areas in the Inner Niger Delta, Mali, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Inner Niger Delta (IND), Mali, West Africa, is a vast floodplain with abundant natural resources that supports the livelihood of about two million people. Ecosystem services in the IND are strongly affected by flood dynamics.Study focus: An accessible yet accurate flood extent estimation method is crucial for the management of natural resources in the IND. The relationships between water levels and inundation extents are examined for both the rising and receding flood periods, using the outputs of a 2D hydrodynamic model. Inundation extents derived from MODIS images were used to validate the result.New hydrological insight for the region: The relationship between water levels and flooded areas in the IND changes from year to year due to the amplitude of the incoming flood. Equations were developed to capture that dynamic relationship and estimate flood extent in real-time from September to the end of flood using water levels at Mopti. The relationship is dependent on the maximum water level at Mopti and maximum flooded area which was forecasted using streamflow and precipitation in the Upper Niger Basin. Results show that in addition to forecasting the maximum inundation ahead of time, the inundation predicted with the method shows improvement over the existing formulas by Mahe et al. (2011), Zwart et al. (2005), and Mariko (2003).

TI  - Tracking Seasonal and Interannual Variability in Photosynthetic Downregulation in Response to Water Stress at a Temperate Deciduous Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding and modeling of photosynthetic dynamics affected by climate variability can be highly uncertain. In this paper, we examined a well-characterized eddy covariance site in a drought-prone temperate deciduous broadleaf forest combining tower measurements and satellite observations. We find that an increase in spring temperature usually leads to enhanced spring gross primary production (GPP), but a GPP reduction in late growing season due to water limitation. We evaluated how well a coupled fluorescence-photosynthesis model (SCOPE) and satellite data sets track the interannual and seasonal variations of tower GPP from 2007 to 2016. In SCOPE, a simple stress factor scaling of Vcmax as a linear function of observed predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) shows a good agreement between modeled and measured interannual variations in both GPP and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The modeled and satellite-observed changes in SIFyield are similar to 30% smaller than corresponding changes in light use efficiency (LUE) under severe stress, for which a common linear SIF to GPP scaling would underestimate the stress reduction in GPP. Overall, GOME-2 SIF tracks interannual tower GPP variations better than satellite vegetations indices (VIs) representing canopy "greenness." However, it is still challenging to attribute observed SIF variations unequivocally to greenness or physiological changes due to large GOME-2 footprint. Higher-resolution SIF data sets (e.g., TROPOMI) already show the potential to well capture the downregulation of late-season GPP and could pave the way to better disentangle canopy structural and physiological changes in the future.

TI  - Ship-Iceberg Classification in SAR and Multispectral Satellite Images with Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of ships and icebergs in the Arctic in satellite images is an important problem. We study how to train deep neural networks for improving the discrimination of ships and icebergs in multispectral satellite images. We also analyze synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images for comparison. The annotated datasets of ships and icebergs are collected from multispectral Sentinel-2 data and taken from the C-CORE dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR images. Convolutional Neural Networks with a range of hyperparameters are tested and optimized. Classification accuracies are considerably better for deep neural networks than for support vector machines. Deeper neural nets improve the accuracy per epoch but at the cost of longer processing time. Extending the datasets with semi-supervised data from Greenland improves the accuracy considerably whereas data augmentation by rotating and flipping the images has little effect. The resulting classification accuracies for ships and icebergs are 86% for the SAR data and 96% for the MSI data due to the better resolution and more multispectral bands. The size and quality of the datasets are essential for training the deep neural networks, and methods to improve them are discussed.

TI  - Observations and Recommendations for Coordinated Calibration Activities of Government and Commercial Optical Satellite Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the biggest changes in the world of optical remote sensing over the last several years is the sheer increase in the number of sensors that are imaging the Earth in moderate to high spatial resolution. With respect to the calibration of these sensors, they are broadly classified into two types, namely government systems and commercial systems. Because of the differences in the design and mission of these sensor types, calibration approaches are often substantially different. Thus, an opportunity exists to foster discussion between calibration teams for these sensors with the goal of improving overall sensor calibration and data interoperability. The approach used to accomplish this task was a one-day workshop where team members from both government and commercial sensors could share best practices, discuss methods for collaboration and improvement, and make recommendations for continuing activities. Five major recommendations were developed from the event that focused on coordinated activities using pseudo invariant calibration sites (PIGS), broader and more consistent communication, collaboration on specific cross-calibration opportunities, developing a reference sensor for all optical systems, and encouraging the coordinated development of surface reflectance products. Workshop participants concluded that regular interactions between these teams could foster a better calibration of all sensor systems and accelerate the improved interoperability of surface products.

TI  - EVALUATION OF URBAN AREAS BY REMOTE SENSING METHODS IN RELATION TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS: CASE STUDY CITY OF TIMISOARA
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study used methods based on remote sensing to evaluate the urban area of Timisoara City in relation to the climatic conditions. Satellite images were taken from the Landsat 8 system. The study interval was between August 9, 2013 and August 7, 2018. The images were taken in August, an expressive month in thermal aspect for the studied area. The spectral information from the satellite images was analyzed using specific indices, such as: Land Surface Temp - LST, Normalized Difference Built-Up Index - NDBI, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, respectively. For the interpretation of the values of the indices, the climatic data were taken into account for the period January - July of each analyzed year (P1 - P7, precipitation in January-July; T1-T7, average monthly temperature in January-July). There were registered very strong, negative and positive correlations (NDVI with NDBI, r = -0.998; LST with P7, r =-0.976; LST with T4, r =-0.984; NDVI with P7, r =0.900). Also, strong negative or positive correlations were recorded (LST with P6, r=-0.891; LST with T5, r =-0.889; NDVI with LST, r=0.824; NDVI with T4, r =0.883). Depending on the time factor (T), the variation of indices was described by smoothing spline model (LST vs. T), or by models of the type of polynomial equations of degree 2 (NDBI vs T, R-2 =0.965, p <0.05; NDVI vs. T, R 2 =0.986, p <0.01). Multiple regression analysis led to obtaining 3D and isoquant variation models of NDVI and LST indices depending on T7 and P6.

TI  - Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Factors to Estimate the Response Time between SMOS and In-Situ Soil Moisture at Different Depths
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of temporal variability of subsurface soil moisture (SM) is paramount in hydrological and agricultural applications such as rainfed farming and irrigation. Since the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission was launched in 2009, globally available satellite SM retrievals have been used to investigate SM dynamics, based on the fact that useful information about subsurface SM is contained in their time series. SM along the depth profile is influenced by atmospheric forcing and local SM properties. Until now, subsurface SM was estimated by weighting preceding information of remotely sensed surface SM time series according to an optimized depth-specific characteristic time length. However, especially in regions with extreme SM conditions, the response time is supposed to be seasonally variable and depends on related processes occurring at different timescales. Aim of this study was to quantify the response time by means of the time lag between the trend series of satellite and in-situ SM observations using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique. DTW was applied to the SMOS satellite SM L4 product at 1 km resolution developed by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC), and in-situ near-surface and root-zone SM of four representative stations at multiple depths, located in the Soil Moisture Measurements Station Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) in Western Spain. DTW was customized to control the rate of accumulation and reduction of time lag during wetting and drying conditions and to consider the onset dates of pronounced precipitation events to increase sensitivity to prominent features of the input series. The temporal variability of climate factors in combination with crop growing seasons were used to indicate prevailing SM-related processes. Hereby, a comparison of long-term precipitation recordings and estimations of potential evapotranspiration (PET) allowed us to estimate SM seasons. The spatial heterogeneity of land use was analyzed by means of high-resolution images of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 to provide information about the level of spatial representativeness of SMOS observations to each in-situ station. Results of the spatio-temporal analysis of the study were then evaluated to understand seasonally and spatially changing patterns in time lag. The time lag evolution describes a variable characteristic time length by considering the relevant processes which link SMOS and in-situ SM observation, which is an important step to accurately infer subsurface SM from satellite time series. At a further stage, the approach needs to be applied to different SM networks to understand the seasonal, climate- and site-specific characteristic behaviour of time lag and to decide, whether general conclusions can be drawn.

TI  - Modelling avian habitat suitability in boreal forest using structural and spectral remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Avian species are often highlighted as key indicator species as they are easily and reliably studied, are sensitive to environmental change, and occupy a wide range of ecological niches. A link between structural vegetation indices and avian diversity has been widely established. Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) can quantify forest structure and have been widely used in bird/habitat studies. However, its use to quantify avian habitat suitability in managed boreal forest has received less investigation. We developed models by best subset regression of avian habitat suitability in western Newfoundland. Data included traditional vegetation plot surveys, satellite spectral information, topographic, landscape, climatic and ALS datasets. Models were assessed using goodness of fit to provide insight into how forest structure data can improve the efficacy of habitat suitability models. Additionally, the probability of presence and abundance of several key species relative to key metrics was examined. In 2018, we observed 371 individuals of 38 bird species in 29 plots over a 10 day period. Field plot metrics produced significant (alpha = 0.05) models of avian presence-absence and abundance. ALS metrics alone produced significant models, but with a poorer fit than field plot metrics, while spectral metrics alone were unable to produce significant models. The addition of the other environmental data produced significant results but also had poorer fit than field plot models. While field plot data may outperform remote sensing metrics from a single sensor; spatial models, combining multi-sensor and environmental data were found to be more significant. Results can aid monitoring the environmental impacts of management decisions and climate change.

TI  - Exploring Transformative Learning at the Cultural Interface: Insights From Successful Aboriginal University Students
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformative learning theory articulates a process whereby students experience a change in perspectives that expands and transforms their worldview. Despite being well established and regarded within the literature relating to adult and continuing education, Mezirow's (1978) seminal education theory remains largely absent in the research relating to Indigenous higher education. This study explores the transformative impact of university learning on the student journeys of three Aboriginal graduates from a Western Australian university. Applying a collaborative auto-ethnographic approach, each author-participant's personal narrative of their student experience was exposed to comparative, thematic and critical analysis. It was found that each author had faced similar cognitive and emotional challenges at university. Significantly, it emerged that university had changed the author-participants' identities in ways that aligned with Mezirow's transformative learning construct. The narrative data also revealed elements that appeared related to the students' negotiation of Nakata's cultural interface. A dominant theme in the data referred to the relationships formed during university, as being integral to transformation. Furthermore, family was understood to have a paradoxical influence on their educational journey. The insights garnered from this study prompt further consideration as to how transformative learning theory might be mobilised at the cultural interface.

TI  - Genomic Surveillance of Yellow Fever Virus Epizootic in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2016-2018
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sao Paulo, a densely inhabited state in southeast Brazil that contains the fourth most populated city in the world, recently experienced its largest yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in decades. YFV does not normally circulate extensively in Sao Paulo, so most people were unvaccinated when the outbreak began. Surveillance in non-human primates (NHPs) is important for determining the magnitude and geographic extent of an epizootic, thereby helping to evaluate the risk of YFV spill over to humans. Data from infected NHPs can give more accurate insights into YFV spread than when using data from human cases alone. To contextualise human cases, identify epizootic foci and uncover the rate and direction of YFV spread in Sao Paulo, we generated and analysed virus genomic data and epizootic case data from NHP in Sao Paulo. We report the occurrence of three spatiotemporally distinct phases of the outbreak in Sao Paulo prior to February 2018. We generated 51 new virus genomes from YFV positive cases identified in 23 different municipalities in Sao Paulo, mostly sampled from NHPs between October 2016 and January 2018. Although we observe substantial heterogeneity in lineage dispersal velocities between phylogenetic branches, continuous phylogeographic analyses of generated YFV genomes suggest that YFV lineages spread in Sao Paulo at a mean rate of approximately 1km per day during all phases of the outbreak. Viral lineages from the first epizootic phase in northern Sao Paulo subsequently dispersed towards the south of the state to cause the second and third epizootic phases there. This alters our understanding of how YFV was introduced into the densely populated south of Sao Paulo state. Our results shed light on the sylvatic transmission of YFV in highly fragmented forested regions in Sao Paulo state and highlight the importance of continued surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in sentinel species.

TI  - Identification of <i>ACKR1</i> variants associated with altered Duffy phenotype expression in blood donors from southern Brazil
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The atypical chemokine receptor 1 gene (ACKR1) is responsible for the clinically significant Duffy blood group. The main antigens of this system, Fya and Fyb, can be related to a null or weak expression of the DARC protein. In the present work, we aimed to identify ACKR1 gene variants in blood donors from southern Brazil based on discrepancies between their serological and molecular typing results. Then, we analyzed the association of these variants with the expression of the Duffy phenotype. The Fy antigen types were determined via hemagglutination and real-time PCR (c.125 G > A, c.265C > T and c. - 67T > C SNPs) tests in a sample composed of 382 regular repetitive voluntary blood donors to the Blood Bank of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. An inconclusive correlation between phenotype-genotype analyses was found in 11 (2.88 %) donors, and the entire ACKR1 gene was sequenced in these samples. Our investigation found 11 genetic variants, four of which (c. - 541C > T, c.21 + 150C > T, c.22 - 58A > G, and c.298 G > A SNPs) seem to have putative functional effects on the structure and expression of DARC undertaken for in silico analysis (SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and RegulomeDB). Molecular events can result in apparent discrepancies between red cell genotypes and phenotypes. Our findings provided insight into the molecular background of FY antigens to improve technical approaches for red cell genotyping.

TI  - Improved PM<sub>2.5</sub> predictions of WRF-Chem via the integration of Himawari-8 satellite data and ground observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The new-generation geostationary satellites feature higher radiometric, spectral, and spatial resolutions, thereby making richer data available for the improvement of PM2.5 predictions. Various aerosol optical depth (AOD) data assimilation methods have been developed, but the accurate representation of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship remains challenging. Empirical statistical methods are effective in retrieving ground-level PM2.5, but few have been evaluated in terms of whether and to what extent they can help improve PM2.5 predictions. Therefore, an empirical and statistics-based scheme was developed for optimizing the estimation of the initial conditions (ICs) of aerosol in WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry) and for improving the PM2.5 predictions by integrating Himawari-8 data and ground observations. The proposed method was evaluated via two one-year experiments that were conducted in parallel over eastern China. The contribution of the satellite data to the model performance was evaluated via a 2-week control experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improved the PM2.5 predictions throughout the year and mitigated the underestimation during pollution episodes. Spatially, the performance was highly correlated with the amount of valid data. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting Cooling Effect of Landscape from Composition and Configuration: An Urban Heat Island Study on Hangzhou
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing countries, is widely regarded as one of the most critical global issues in the 21 st century. It is known to exacerbate urban heat island effects, a phenomenon that could affect the livability of cities and the lives and comfort of more than half of the world population who are now living in urban areas. The issue on how to mitigate the impacts of this phenomenon and help urban dwellers adapt to it, has been, and continues to be, an important topic in the context of landscape design and urban planning. This study sought to examine the cooling effects of different land cover types from the perspectives of landscape composition and configuration using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data. Various spatial and statistical approaches, including urban-rural gradient, grid-based, landscape metrics, and scatter plot, were employed to analyze the derived land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. The results showed that both forest and water had a cooling effect during daytime in Hangzhou. The heat core in Hangzhou was situated close to the central business district and the variance in LST in urban and rural recorded at 3.22 celcius. The correlation of forest density with mean LST could be detected in both large (690 m) and small (210 m) grids, whereas the correlation of water density with mean LST was only observed in small grids. In general, forest with high aggregation and complex shape behave best in cooling LST while huge and complete water bodies had better cooling effect than scattered water patches. Besides, the minimum cooling scale of forest and water were proximately 120 m and 150 m from the cooling resources to the neighboring areas, respectively. The findings were considered valuable for urban planners to spatially and architecturally build and arrange the cooling land cover resources, eventually to fulfill the Chinese government's new plan of building "livable cities".

TI  - Near-Field Ground Motions and Shaking from the 2019 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Ridgecrest, California, Mainshock: Insights from Instrumental, Macroseismic Intensity, and Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaking from the 6 July 2019 M-w 7.1 Ridgecrest, California, mainshock was strongly felt through southern California, but generated relatively minimal structural damage in Ridgecrest. We consider the extent to which a damage proxy map (DPM) generated from satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar images can detect minor damage throughout the town of Ridgecrest. The DPM does not, as expected, detect all minor structural damage to individual structures, nor can it distinguish between structural damage and earthquake-related movement that is not consequential. However, the DPM does confirm many instances of minor structural damage to larger structures and groups of smaller structures and in some instances suggests minor structural damage that is not apparent upon visual inspection. Although ambiguous identification of minor damage may not be useful to guide earthquake response, the identification of minor, possibly hidden damage is potentially useful for other purposes. Overall, the DPM confirms that structural damage was commensurate with modified Mercalli intensity no higher than 7 throughout Ridgecrest. We consider both instrumental and intensity data to explore further the distribution of near-field ground motions over the frequency range of engineering concern. Peak ground accelerations and peak ground velocities estimated from "Did You Feel It?" intensity data using the Worden et al. (2012) ground-motion intensity conversion equation (GMICE) are consistent with recorded instrumental data. Both instrumental and estimated mainshock peak accelerations are further consistent with predictions from both the Boore et al. (2014) ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE), but lower than predicted by the Atkinson and Wald (2007) and Atkinson et al. (2014) intensity prediction equations (IPEs). A GMPE such as Boore et al. which is constrained by a large global dataset, together with a well- constrained GMICE, may thus characterize expected shaking intensities for large earthquakes better than an IPE based on more limited intensity data.

TI  - Estimating radiative impacts of black carbon associated with mixing state in the lower atmosphere over the northern North China Plain
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC) exerts important radiative effects over regions with intensive emissions. This study presents in-situ aircraft measurements of BC vertical profiles including mass loading, size distribution and mixing state, spanning a range of pollution levels in both warm and cold seasons over Beijing. The development of planetary boundary layer (PBL) influenced the properties of pollutants at low levels, and regional transport from the southwest elevated the pollution at higher altitudes. Thicker coatings of BC were associated with higher pollution in the PBL, where interactions between BC and other substances intensively took place. Considering the mixing state of BC, the absorption efficiency could be potentially increased by up to 86% and 60% in the PBL and lower free troposphere, respectively. Including a columnintegrated absorption enhancement, the in-situ constrained absorption aerosol optical depth at wavelength 870 nm (AAOD(870)) improved the agreement with AERONET by 28%, but the in-situ measurement remained 19% lower. A radiative transfer model finds a BC heating rate of 0.1-0.3 K/d and 0.5-3.1 K/d for less and more polluted environments respectively, and the BC coating effect could positively introduce a +0.1-4.2 Wm(-2) radiative forcing. The presence of aerosol layer enhanced the positive vertical gradient of heating rate by redistributing the actinic flux. In particular, this gradient was further enhanced by introducing thickly-coated BC at higher level during the regional transport events, which may promote the temperature inversion and further depress the PBL development on polluted days.

TI  - Coastline Fractal Dimension of Mainland, Island, and Estuaries Using Multi-temporal Landsat Remote Sensing Data from 1978 to 2018: A Case Study of the Pearl River Estuary Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Estuary Area was selected for this study. For the past 40 years, it has been one of the most complex coasts in China, yet few studies have analyzed the complexity and variations of the area's different coastlines. In this investigation, the coastlines of the Pearl River Estuary Area were extracted from multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing data from 1978, 1988, 1997, 2008, and 2018. The coastline of this area was classified into mainland, island, and estuarine. To obtain more detailed results of the mainland and island, we regarded this area as the main body, rezoned into different parts. The box-counting dimension was applied to compute the bidimensional (2D) fractal dimension. Coastline length and the fractal dimension of different types of coastline and different parts of the main body were calculated and compared. The fractal dimension of the Pearl River Estuary Area was found to have increased significantly, from 1.228 to 1.263, and coastline length also increased during the study period. The island and mainland showed the most complex coastlines, while estuaries showed the least complexity during the past forty years. A positive correlation was found between length and 2D-fractal dimension in some parts of the study area. Land reclamation had the strongest influence on fractal dimension variations.

TI  - Preliminary Selection and Characterization of Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites in Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) have been used for the radiometric calibration and stability monitoring of satellite optical sensors. Several stable PICS, such as those in the Sahara Desert in North Africa, were selected for the vicarious calibration of earth remote sensing satellites. However, the selection procedure of PICSs in the whole of Northwest China has not been fully explored before. This paper presents a novel technique for selecting PICS in Northwest China by combined using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) technique. IR-MAD, which calculates the differences between two multispectral N-band images from the same scene acquired at different times, is used to identify no-change pixels (NCPs) of the scene through one image pair. The NCPs from IR-MAD using the long-term data of FY-3 visible infrared radiometer (VIRR) and aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were aggregated into the contiguously stable sites. The traditional spatial uniformity and temporal stability from MODIS surface products were used to select the potential PICS. By combining the results of both methods, over thirty PICSs with a wider brightness range of the scene types were selected. To confirm and characterize these PICSs over Northwest China, Landsat operational land imager (OLI) high-spatial-resolution images were used to check the spatial uniformity of the selected site to determine the specific location and the size of these sites. Additionally, the surface spectral reflectance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were obtained from the field campaign at Chaidamu Basin, 2018. To demonstrate the practical utilization and usability of these PICSs, they were employed in the multi-site top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance simulation to validate the operational calibration performance of Aqua/MODIS and FY-3D/MERSI-II (Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II). The simulation results showed good consistency compared with the observations from both MODIS and MERSI-II, with a relative bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of <5% and <0.05%, respectively. These sites provide prospects for multi-site vicarious calibrations of solar reflective bands, which may help to evaluate or characterize instrumental nonlinear responses using a wider signal dynamic from the sites in different seasons.

TI  - Inversion of aerosol optical depth over land from directional polarimetric camera onboard chinese Gaofen-5 satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Directional polarimetric camera (DPC) can acquire multi-spectral, multi-angle, radiometric and polarimetric reflectance data from the earth. A method for the inversion of aerosol optical depth was presented according to the multi-spectral, multi-angle and polarimetric data. Firstly, the polarized land surface reflectance is calculated using the Nadal-Freon semi-empirical model to deduct the land surface radiation from the measured value. Secondly, the vector radiation transfer model derived from double-accumulation method is used to construct the lookup table of aerosol optical parameters. Then, the minimum residual is calculated to determine the aerosol model dynamically for the retrieving of aerosol optical thickness over the land. Using the L1 products of DPC, the aerosol optical thickness in eastern China is retrieved. The values are compared with the product of MODIS and the data measured at the same time from AERONET ground station displaced at several places. Results show that the distribution of aerosol optical thickness retrieved from DPC data is in good agreement with MODIS aerosol product. And also, the results of DPC and AERONET ground station are highly correlated. The correlation coefficients of 670 nm and 865nm bands are above 0. 8. It demonstrates the feasibility of the algorithm and what we have considered over land.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Mechanism Underlying the Effect of Urban Heat Island on Cardiovascular Diseases
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban heat island (UHI) effect on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).Methods: The land surface temperatures (LS were retrieved from four Landsat remote-sensing images' data, the temperature data from 95 meteorological stations, and analysis data on CVDs mortality. Based on these data, landscape pattern indexes were used to analyze the pattern-process-function and the mechanism.Results: During 1984-2017, the effects of UHI on CVDs increased, thereby increased the mortality by 28.8%. The affected areas gradually expand from the central area of the city and undergo three evolution stages; the highly affected areas are mainly distributed in central and southern regions, and patches increase in number. The areas and ratio of high-level patches also show an upward tendency, increasing dominance in the overall landscape. Patches of the overall landscape become more complicated in shape, whereas those of high-level ones become less complicated. Concentration degree of the overall landscape decreases gradually with the types of landscapes patches increasing, reaching a rather even space distribution.Conclusion: Increased temperatures exacerbated by UHI lead to increased CVD mortality. As cities expand, the effects of UHI on CVDs increase in terms of both intensity and areas, with the overall landscape in uneven distribution, high-level affected areas in point distribution, and low-level ones in large-area concentration.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data-Based Hydrological Model Calibrations for Predicting Runoff in Ungauged or Poorly Gauged Catchments
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Because remote sensing (RS) data are spatially and temporally explicit and available across the globe, they have the potential to be used for predicting runoff in ungauged catchments and poorly gauged regions, a challenging area of research in hydrology. There is potential to use remotely sensed data for calibrating hydrological models in regions with limited streamflow gauges. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation on how to incorporate gridded remotely sensed evapotranspiration (AET) and water storage data for constraining hydrological model calibration in order to predict daily and monthly runoff in 30 catchments in the Yalong River basin in China. To this end, seven RS data calibration schemes are explored and compared to direct calibration against observed runoff and traditional regionalization using spatial proximity to predict runoff in ungauged catchments. The results show that using bias-corrected remotely sensed AET (bias-corrected PML-AET data) for constraining model calibration performs much better than using the raw remotely sensed AET data (nonbias-corrected AET obtained from PML model estimate). Using the bias-corrected PML-AET data in a gridded way is much better than using lumped data and outperforms the traditional regionalization approach especially in headwater and large catchments. Combining the bias-corrected PML-AET and GRACE water storage data performs similarly to using the bias-corrected PML-AET data only. This study demonstrates that there is great potential in using bias-corrected RS-AET data to calibrating hydrological models (without the need for gauged streamflow data) to estimate daily and monthly runoff time series in ungauged catchments and sparsely gauged regions.

TI  - Preliminary Observations from the China Fengyun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager and Its Optical Radiation Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) is the first satellite-borne lightning imager developed in China, which can detect lightning over China and its neighboring regions based on a geostationary satellite platform. In this study, the spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristics of lightning activity over China and its neighboring regions were analyzed in detail based on 2018 LMI observations. The observation characteristics of the LMI were revealed through a comparison with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations. Moreover, the optical radiation characteristics of lightning signals detected by the LMI were examined. Factors that may affect LMI detection were discussed by analyzing the differences in optical radiation characteristics between LMI and LIS flashes. The results are as follows. Spatially, the flash density distribution pattern detected by the LMI was similar to those detected by the LIS and WWLLN. High-flash density regions were mainly concentrated over Southeastern China and Northeastern India. Temporally, LMI flashes exhibited notable seasonal and diurnal variation characteristics. The LMI detected a concentrated lightning outbreak over Northeastern India in the premonsoon season and over Southeastern China in the monsoon season, which was consistent with LIS and WWLLN observations. LMI-observed diurnal peak flash rates occurred in the afternoon over most of the regions. There was a "stepwise" decrease in the LMI-observed optical radiance, footprint size, duration, and number of groups per flash, from the ocean to the coastal regions to the inland regions. LMI flashes exhibited higher optical radiance but lasted for shorter durations than LIS flashes. LMI observations are not only related to instrument performance but are also closely linked to onboard and ground data processing. In future, targeted improvements can be made to the data processing algorithm for the LMI to further enhance its detection capability.

TI  - Physical-chemical characteristics of composite aerosols in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean and its associated effect on insolation: A climate perspective
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon (BC) mass concentration, aerosol size, along with wind parameters, were derived during Southern Ocean expeditions (SOE) 7 and 8 carried out in austral summer of 2013 and 2015, with an aim to analyse the effect of aerosol on incoming solar radiation. The data were complemented with trace metals from aerosol samples of SOE-6 conducted in 2012. The AOD spectra north of 40 degrees S followed Angstrom turbidity formulae while those in the south deviated from it. A statistically significant correlation (R-2) of 0.79 (P << 0.0001) between the differences of AOD(440) estimated from an Optical Properties of Aerosol and Cloud (OPAC) model and measured in situ and chlorophyll-a concentration revealed phytoplankton as a significant source of fine mode aerosols. Analysis of ten years of MODIS derived fine mode particle concentration indicated an increase as season advanced from winter to summer and a subsequent decrease towards the following winter, clearly showing a contribution from phytoplankton. BC mass concentration was found to be around 80 ng m(-3). Prevalence of trace metals such as Cu, Cd and Zn and the anions SO4-2 and NO3-1 were observed in this part of the world ocean. An inverse relation was observed between Cu and phytoplankton derived SO4-2, indicating the detrimental effect of Cu on fine mode sulphate aerosols which are as significant as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The aerosol radiative forcing was found to be between 25 and 28 W m(-)(2) to the north of the ITCZ while it was around 2-6 W m(-2) in the south. The associated heating rate was from 0.05 to 0.09 and from 0.01 to 0.02 K day(-1), respectively. The study revealed an increase in black carbon due to ship emissions. An increase in BC over the Southern Ocean atmosphere may have a far-reaching effect on the cloud formation and regional albedo.

TI  - Using remote sensing to characterize riparian vegetation: A review of available tools and perspectives for managers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Riparian vegetation is a central component of the hydrosystem. As such, it is often subject to management practices that aim to influence its ecological, hydraulic or hydrological functions. Remote sensing has the potential to improve knowledge and management of riparian vegetation by providing cost-effective and spatially continuous data over wide extents. The objectives of this review were twofold: to provide an overview of the use of remote sensing in riparian vegetation studies and to discuss the transferability of remote sensing tools from scientists to managers. We systematically reviewed the scientific literature (428 articles) to identify the objectives and remote sensing data used to characterize riparian vegetation. Overall, results highlight a strong relationship between the tools used, the features of riparian vegetation extracted and the mapping extent. Very high-resolution data are rarely used for rivers longer than 100 km, especially when mapping species composition. Multi-temporality is central in remote sensing riparian studies, but authors use only aerial photographs and relatively coarse resolution satellite images for diachronic analyses. Some remote sensing approaches have reached an operational level and are now used for management purposes. Overall, new opportunities will arise with the increased availability of very high-resolution data in understudied or data-scarce regions, for large extents and as time series. To transfer remote sensing approaches to riparian managers, we suggest mutualizing achievements by producting open-access and robust tools. These tools will then have to be adapted to each specific project, in collaboration with managers.

TI  - Comparison of commercial realtime reverse transcription PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of a new coronavirus in Wuhan China has triggered a global need for accurate diagnostic assays. Initially, mostly laboratory developed molecular tests were available but shortly thereafter different commercial assays started to appear and are still increasing in number. Although independent performance evaluations are ongoing, available data is still scarce. Here we provide a direct comparison of key performance characteristics of 13 commercial RT-PCR assays. Thirteen RT-PCR assays were selected based on the criteria that they can be used following generic RNA extraction protocols, on common PCR platforms and availability. Using a 10-fold and 2 -fold dilution series of a quantified SARS-CoV-2 cell-cultured virus stock, performance was assessed compared to our in house validated assay. Specificity was tested by using RNA extracted from cultured common human coronaviruses. All RT-PCR kits included in this study exhibited PCR efficiencies 90%, except for the Sentinel Diagnostics B E-gene RUO assay (80%). Analytical sensitivity varied between 3.3 RNA copies to 330 RNA copies. Only one assay cross reacted with another human coronavirus (MERS). This study provides a technical baseline of 13 different commercial PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that can be used by laboratories interested in purchasing any of these for further full clinical validation.

T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary dissection is routinely conducted for all patients with sentinel node (SN)-positive breast cancer. Metastasis to non SNs is not often found after axillary dissection in patients with SN-positive breast cancer. Thus, we investigated clinicopathological features, including immune cells in peripheral blood, in order to identify factors related to metastasis to non-SNs. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively investigated 184 patients with SN-positive disease, treated at our institution during the 2013 through 2018 period. All clinicopathological data were obtained before and during surgery. Results: Metastasis to non SNs was observed in 64 cases (35%). The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and the number of SN metastases were independent of metastasis to non SNs (p=0.023 and p=0.017, respectively). Patients with metastasis to non SNs had significantly lower PLR and more SN metastases. High lymphocyte number and low platelet number resulted in a low PLR. Conclusion: PLR might be a marker of metastasis to non SNs.

TI  - Flood Detection Using Multi-Modal and Multi-Temporal Images: A Comparative Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disasters such as flooding can severely affect human life and property. To provide rescue through an emergency response team, we need an accurate flooding assessment of the affected area after the event. Traditionally, it requires a lot of human resources to obtain an accurate estimation of a flooded area. In this paper, we compared several traditional machine-learning approaches for flood detection including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with recent domain adaptation-based approaches, based on a multi-modal and multi-temporal image dataset. Specifically, we used SPOT-5 and RADAR images from the flood event that occurred in November 2000 in Gloucester, UK. Experimental results show that the domain adaptation-based approach, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) with 20 labeled data samples, achieved slightly better values of the area under the precision-recall (PR) curve (AUC) of 0.9173 and F1 score of 0.8846 than those by traditional machine approaches. However, SSDA required much less labor for ground-truth labeling and should be recommended in practice.

AB  - An active discussion of the questions of the advisability of forming new principles of national unity and creating an orderly harmonious world in the minds of people, strengthening the educational functions of the state, its concern for public morality do not primarily concern education, humanization of its content, and revision of the educational process. The formation and implementation of a state policy adequate to this problem must comply with the requirements of our time, create, on the one hand, conditions for ensuring the rights and freedoms of citizens, including the observance of the fundamental principles of religious freedom, and on the other, develop legislative norms that regulate these rights. A legal democratic state provides for the formation of public policy in accordance with the needs of society and taking into account public thought. The secular nature of public education is not an obstacle to the introduction of disciplines in the provision of religious knowledge in the educational process of schools, religious knowledge can and should be considered as an element of secular culture. Knowledge of religion should be carried out by secular teachers, be neutral in content and not be accompanied by religious rites. The problems of the formation of moral and spiritual values, the worldview of a person, the introduction of religious disciplines in secondary schools are vividly discussed in scientific, educational, government circles, as well as among representatives of the clergy. The religious component in secular education will give importance to folk culture and traditional religion, which will form concepts such as tolerance and respect for other faiths and cultures, which is important in the context of globalization of the world.

TI  - Effect of fires on biophysical parameters, energy balance and evapotranspiration in a protected area in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are essential for defining the structure, biodiversity and functioning of the Brazilian Cerrado. Several protected areas have been created in the Cerrado to conserve natural ecosystems by eliminating, minimizing or reducing human pressures and threats operating within their limits. However, impacts of these conservation practices on the local microclimate and change in fire coverage are poorly known. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the 2017 megafire in the Chapada dos Guimaraes National Park (CGNP) on biophysical parameters, energy balance and evapotranspiration. We used data from fire spots between 2000 and 2017 and images from sensors Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Landsat 8 between July and October 2017. The satellite images provided data to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Surface Albedo (alpha), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), while the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model provided estimates of the radiation balance (Rn), soil heat flux (G), sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), and the daily evapotranspiration (ET). Surface reflectance and energy balance were evaluated before and after fire at three time periods throughout the study. All variables analyzed were affected by the combination of climate dynamics and fire occurrence. NDVI, LE and ET decreased, and alpha, NDWI, G and H increased throughout the dry season in the CGNP. The fire that occurred in the CGNP in 2017 decreased NDVI, LE, LE/Rn and ET and increased alpha, NDWI, G, H and H/Rn significantly. This study demonstrated that fires decrease surface biomass and surface-to-atmosphere water transfer and increase surface warming on Cerrado.

TI  - Remote sensing of selective logging in tropical forests: current state and future directions
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews and discusses the status of remote sensing techniques applied in detecting and monitoring selective logging disturbance in tropical forests. The analyses concentrated on the period 1992-2019. Accurate and precise detection of selectively logged sites in a forest is crucial for analyzing the spatial distribution of forest disturbances and degradation. Remote sensing can be used to monitor selective logging activities and associated forest fires over tropical forests, which otherwise requires labor-intensive and time-consuming field surveys, that are costly and difficult to undertake. The number of studies on remote sensing for selective logging has grown steadily over the years, thus, the need for their review so as to guide forest management practices and current research. A variety of peer reviewed articles are discussed so as to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of different methods in different circumstances. Major challenges with existing approaches are singled out and future needs are discussed.

TI  - Impact of Land Cover and Leaf Area Index on BVOC Emissions over the Korean Peninsula
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOCs) emissions are the largest VOC emission source globally, and are precursors to ozone and secondary organic aerosols, both of which are strong, short-lived climate pollutants. BVOC emissions are usually estimated using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), which requires Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and Leaf Area Indexes (LAIs) as inputs. Herein, the effects of refined input data on regional BVOC emission estimates are analyzed. For LAIs, lower resolution MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and higher spatio-temporal resolution Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) LAI were generated. For PFTs, local land cover maps were developed, in addition to MODIS PFT. In South Korea, annual emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes in 2015 were estimated as 384 and 160 Gg/year, respectively, using STARFM LAI and Local PFT (Case 4). For North Korea, 340 Gg/year isoprene and 72 Gg/year monoterpenes emissions were estimated using STARFM LAI and MODIS PFT. These estimates were 14-110% higher than when using MODIS LAI and MODIS PFT (Case 1). Inter-comparison with satellite-based inverse isoprene emission estimates from GlobEmission shows 32% (North Korea) to 34% (South Korea) overestimation in bottom-up data. Our new vegetation inputs improve MEGAN performance and resulting BVOC emission estimations. Performance of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological modeling requires improvement, especially for solar radiation, to avoid overestimation of isoprene emissions.

TI  - Toward Mapping Dietary Fibers in Northern Ecosystems Using Hyperspectral and Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub proliferation across the Arctic from climate warming is expanding herbivore habitat but may also alter forage quality. Dietary fibers-an important component of forage quality-influence shrub palatability, and changes in dietary fiber concentrations may have broad ecological implications. While airborne hyperspectral instruments may effectively estimate dietary fibers, such data captures a limited portion of landscapes. Satellite data such as the multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) instrument may enable dietary fiber estimation to be extrapolated across larger areas. We assessed how variation in dietary fibers ofSalix alaxensis(Andersson), a palatable northern shrub, could be estimated using hyperspectral and multispectral WV-3 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) in a greenhouse setting, and whether including structural information (i.e., leaf area) would improve predictions. We collected canopy-level hyperspectral reflectance readings, which we convolved to the band equivalent reflectance of WV-3. We calculated every possible SVI combination using hyperspectral and convolved WV-3 bands. We identified the best performing SVIs for both sensors using the coefficient of determination (adjusted R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) using simple linear regression. Next, we assessed the importance of plant structure by adding shade leaf area, sun leaf area, and total leaf area to models individually. We evaluated model fits using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes and conducted leave-one-out cross validation. We compared cross validation slopes and predictive power (Spearman rank coefficients rho) between models. Hyperspectral SVIs (R-2= 0.48-0.68; RMSE = 0.04-0.91%) outperformed WV-3 SVIs (R-2= 0.13-0.35; RMSE = 0.05-1.18%) for estimating dietary fibers, suggesting hyperspectral remote sensing is best suited for estimating dietary fibers in a palatable northern shrub. Three dietary fibers showed improved predictive power when leaf area metrics were included (cross validation rho= +2-8%), suggesting plant structure and the light environment may augment our ability to estimate some dietary fibers in northern landscapes. Monitoring dietary fibers in northern ecosystems may benefit from upcoming hyperspectral satellites such as the environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP).

TI  - Prediction of Daily PM10 Concentration for Air Korea Stations Using Artificial Intelligence with LDAPS Weather Data, MODIS AOD, and Chinese Air Quality Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PM (particulate matter) is of interest to everyone because it can have adverse effects on human health by the infiltration from respiratory to internal organs. To date, many studies have made efforts for the prediction of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Unlike previous studies, we conducted the prediction of tomorrow's PM10 concentration for the Air Korea stations using Chinese PM10 data in addition to the satellite AOD and weather variables. We constructed 230,639 matchups from the raw data over 3 million and built an RF (random forest) model from the matchups to cope with the complexity and nonlinearity. The validation statistics from the blind test showed excellent accuracy with the RMSE (root mean square error) of 9.905 mu g/m(3) and the CC (correlation coefficient) of 0.918. Moreover, our prediction model showed a stable performance without the dependency on seasons or the degree of PM10 concentration. However, part of coastal areas had a relatively low accuracy, which implies that a dedicated model for coastal areas will be necessary. Additional input variables such as wind direction, precipitation, and air stability should also be incorporated into the prediction model as future work.

TI  - Indirect Validation of Ocean Remote Sensing Data via Numerical Model: An Example of Wave Heights from Altimeter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using numerical model outputs as a bridge, an indirect validation method for remote sensing data was developed to increase the number of effective collocations between remote sensing data to be validated and reference data. The underlying idea for this method is that the local spatial-temporal variability of specific parameters provided by numerical models can compensate for the representativeness error induced by differences of spatial-temporal locations of the collocated data pair. Using this method, the spatial-temporal window for collocation can be enlarged for a given error tolerance. To test the effectiveness of this indirect validation approach, significant wave height (SWH) data from Envisat were indirectly compared against buoy and Jason-2 SWHs, using the SWH gradient information from a numerical wave hindcast as a bridge. The results indicated that this simple indirect validation method is superior to "direct" validation.

TI  - Evaluation of Assimilating FY-3C MWHS-2 Radiances Using the GSI Global Analysis System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MicroWave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2) onboard the FY-3C satellite provides an extra important data source for atmospheric water vapor monitoring besides the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS). This paper introduces MWHS-2 radiance data into the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) global analysis system. More than one-year cycling assimilation experiments with and without MWHS-2 data are performed. Results show that MWHS-2 has similar data quality to MHS and ATMS. The biases of MWHS-2 are stable except some sudden jumps that can be removed nicely by the variational bias correction scheme within GSI. Assimilating MWHS-2 makes the 6-h forecasts fit more closely to radiosonde observations, with a reduction of 0.55-1% for the observation-minus-simulation standard deviation of specific humidity. The 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly correlation scores are increased by around 0.006 for the 144-h forecast, indicating that assimilating MWHS-2 may also help to improve 3-8-day forecasts.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Agricultural Greenhouses and Plastic-Mulched Farmland: An Analysis of Worldwide Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total area of plastic-covered crops of 3019 million hectares has been increasing steadily around the world, particularly in the form of crops maintained under plastic-covered greenhouses to control their environmental conditions and their growth, thereby increasing production. This work analyzes the worldwide research dynamics on remote sensing-based mapping of agricultural greenhouses and plastic-mulched crops throughout the 21st century. In this way, a bibliometric analysis was carried out on a total of 107 publications based on the Scopus database. Different aspects of these publications were studied, such as type of publication, characteristics, categories and journal/conference name, countries, authors, and keywords. The results showed that "articles" were the type of document mostly found, while the number of published documents has exponentially increased over the last four years, growing from only one document published in 2001 to 22 in 2019. The main Scopus categories relating to the topic analyzed were Earth and Planetary Sciences (53%), Computer Science (30%), and Agricultural and Biological Sciences (28%). The most productive journal in this field was "Remote Sensing", with 22 documents published, while China, Italy, Spain, USA, and Turkey were the five countries with the most publications. Among the main research institutions belonging to these five most productive countries, there were eight institutions from China, four from Italy, one from Spain, two from Turkey, and one from the USA. In conclusion, the evolution of the number of publications on Remote Sensing of Agricultural Greenhouses and Plastic-Mulched Farmland found throughout the period 2000-2019 allows us to classify the subject studied as an emerging research topic that is attracting an increasing level of interest worldwide, although its relative significance is still very limited within the remote sensing discipline. However, the growing demand for information on the arrangement and spatio-temporal dynamics of this increasingly important model of intensive agriculture is likely to drive this line of research in the coming years.

TI  - Systematic Orbital Geometry-Dependent Variations in Satellite Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) shows promise as a remotely-sensed measurement directly related to photosynthesis, interpretation and validation of satellite-based SIF retrievals remains a challenge. SIF is influenced by the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation at the canopy level that depends upon illumination geometry as well as the escape of SIF through the canopy that depends upon the viewing geometry. Several approaches to estimate the effects of sun-sensor geometry on satellite-based SIF have been proposed, and some have been implemented, most relying upon satellite reflectance measurements and/or other ancillary data sets. These approaches, designed to ultimately estimate intrinsic or physiological components of SIF related to photosynthesis, have not generally been applied globally to satellite measurements. Here, we examine in detail how SIF and related reflectance-based indices from wide swath polar orbiting satellites in low Earth orbit vary systematically due to the host satellite orbital characteristics. We compare SIF and reflectance-based parameters from the Global Ozone Mapping Experiment 2 (GOME-2) on the MetOp-B platform and from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite with a focus on high northern latitudes in summer where observations at similar geometries and local times occur. We show that GOME-2 and TROPOMI SIF observations agree nearly to within estimated uncertainties when they are compared at similar observing geometries. We show that the cross-track dependence of SIF normalized by PAR and related reflectance-based indices are highly correlated for dense canopies, but diverge substantially as the vegetation within a field-of-view becomes more sparse. This has implications for approaches that utilize reflectance measurements to help account for SIF geometrical dependences in satellite measurements. To further help interpret the GOME-2 and TROPOMI SIF observations, we simulated cross-track dependences of PAR normalized SIF and reflectance-based indices with the one dimensional Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) canopy radiative transfer model at sun-satellite geometries that occur across the wide swaths of these instruments and examine the geometrical dependencies of the various components (e.g., fraction of absorbed PAR, SIF yield, and escape of SIF from the canopy) of the observed SIF signal. The simulations show that most of the cross-track variations in SIF result from the escape of SIF through the scattering canopy and not the illumination.

TI  - Reorganisation of primary care for older adults during COVID-19: a cross-sectional database study in the UK
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a rapid change in workload across healthcare systems. Factors related to this adaptation in UK primary care have not yet been examined.AimTo assess the responsiveness and prioritisation of primary care consultation type for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design and settingA Cross-sectional database study examining consultations between 17 February and 10 May 2020 for patients aged >= 65 years, drawn from primary care practices within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network, UK.MethodThe authors reported the proportion of consultation type across live categories: clinical administration, electronic/video, face-to-face. telephone, and home visits. Temporal trends in telephone and face-to-face consultations were analysed by polypharmacy, frailty status, and socioeconomic group using incidence rate ratios (IRR).ResultsAcross 3 851 304 consultations, the population median age was 75 years (interquartile range DORI 70-821; and 46% (n= 82 926] of the cohort (N= 180 470) were male. The rate of telephone and electronic/video consultations more than doubled across the study period [106.0% and 102.8%. respectively). Face-to-face consultations fell by 64.6% and home visits by 62.6%. This predominantly occurred across week 11 (week commencing 9 March 2020]. coinciding with national policy change. Polyphantracy and frailty were associated with a relative increase in consultations. The greatest relative increase was among people taking >= 10 medications compared with those taking none (face to face IRR 9.90, 95% CI = 9.55 to 10.26; telephone IRR 17.64. 95% CI =16.89 to 18.41).ConclusionPrimary care has undergone an unprecedented in-pandemic reorganisation while retaining focus on patients with increased complexity.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Biomass Open Burning Emissions in the Greater Mekong Subregion
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area products are widely used to assess the damaged area after wildfires and agricultural burning have occurred. This study improved the accuracy of the assessment of the burnt areas by using the MCD45A1 and MCD64A1 burnt area products with the finer spatial resolution product from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) surface reflectance data. Thus, more accurate wildfires and agricultural burning areas in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) for the year 2015 as well as the estimation of the fire emissions were reported. In addition, the results from this study were compared with the data derived from the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) that included small fires (GFED4.1s). Upon analysis of the data of the burnt areas, it was found that the burnt areas obtained from the MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 had lower values than the reference fires for all vegetation fires. These results suggested multiplying the MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 for the GMS by the correction factors of 2.11-21.08 depending on the MODIS burnt area product and vegetation fires. After adjusting the burnt areas by the correction factor, the total biomass burnt area in the GMS during the year 2015 was about 33.3 million hectares (Mha), which caused the burning of 109 +/- 22 million tons (Mt) of biomass. This burning emitted 178 +/- 42 Mt of CO2, 469 +/- 351 kilotons (kt) of CH4, 18 +/- 3 kt of N2O, 9.4 +/- 4.9 Mt of CO, 345 +/- 206 kt of NOX, 46 +/- 25 kt of SO2, 147 +/- 117 kt of NH3, 820 +/- 489 kt of PM2.5, 60 +/- 32 kt of BC, and 350 +/- 205 kt of OC. Furthermore, the emission results of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in all countries were slightly lower than GFED4.1s in the range between 0.3 and 0.6 times.

TI  - Evaluation of land use/land cover changes due to gold mining activities from 1987 to 2017 using landsat imagery, East Cameroon
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold mining activities began around 1934 at the artisanal stage and became semi-mechanized around 2004 in eastern Cameroon, with the emergence of exploration and mining companies in the region. This paper aims at monitoring Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes between 1987 and 2017 among Betare-Oya, Ngoura and Batouri Districts which are witnessing extensive gold mining activities, assessing the dynamics between LULC types and understanding the anthropogenic impact of gold mining activities during this period. A series of Landsat images acquired in 1987, 2000, and 2016/2017 were used to examine LULC change trajectories at per-pixel scale with the post-classification change detection techniques based on the matrix of changes. A supervised classification by the maximum likelihood algorithm composed of five classes-Bare land, Settlements, Water bodies, Vegetation and Mine activities, was designed for this study, in order to classify Landsat images into thematic maps. This research revealed spatio-temporal change patterns, various composition and rates among the three study areas. Also, it shows the strong appearance and emergence of mining activities between 2000 and 2017 are coupled with increase in settlement surfaces and major changes in environment in the study areas. The LULC change analysis over time for the study areas have provide the current change trends. This study stresses the usefulness of Landsat TM/ETM + and Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) data and highlights the data processing methods for long-term monitoring of artisanal mining activities impacts on the environment.

TI  - Development and application of ARMS fast transmittance model for GIIRS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The FengYun (FY)-4A Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) fast transmittance model has been developed as part of the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) and applied to quantitative uses of the GIIRS data. To determine the accuracy of the fast transmittance model, one dataset that includes 83 atmospheric profiles generated by the European center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and another dataset that includes 48 atmospheric profiles developed at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County (UMBC) are utilized for training and testing, respectively. The radiative transfer simulations at six viewing angles are compared with the line-by-line results for dependent and independent evaluations of the fast transmittance model. It is shown that the profile dataset chosen for coefficient training has a substantial effect on the accuracy of the fast transmittance model. ARMS simulations using the fast transmittance model are compared with RTTOV simulations using the fast transmittance model (DiDi RTTOV) as well as GIIRS observations. The biases between the ARMS simulations and GIIRS measurements are less than 1.0 K and 1.5 K (in absolute value) for most channels of GIIRS band 1 and 2, respectively, and the difference between the two models is less than 0.7 K, except those near the strong absorption bands. There are some GIIRS channels with large biases, which are unusable. Several issues are also found during the comparison. The Jacobians with respect to different physical parameters are also calculated using both ARMS and DiDi RTTOV and compared for consistency. It is found that the temperature Jacobians of both models are similar; however, the water vapor and ozone Jacobians differ substantially between ARMS and DiDi RTTOV. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Multipass SAR Interferometry Based on Total Variation Regularized Robust Low Rank Tensor Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multipass SAR interferometry (InSAR) techniques based on meter-resolution spaceborne SAR satellites, such as TerraSAR-X or COSMO-SkyMed, provide 3D reconstruction and the measurement of ground displacement over large urban areas. Conventional methods such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) usually requires a fairly large SAR image stack (usually in the order of tens) to achieve reliable estimates of these parameters. Recently, low rank property in multipass InSAR data stack was explored and investigated in our previous work (J. Kang et al., "Object-based multipass InSAR via robust low-rank tensor decomposition," IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 56, no. 6, 2018). By exploiting this low rank prior, a more accurate estimation of the geophysical parameters can be achieved, which in turn can effectively reduce the number of interferograms required for a reliable estimation. Based on that, this article proposes a novel tensor decomposition method in a complex domain, which jointly exploits low rank and variational prior of the interferometric phase in InSAR data stacks. Specifically, a total variation (TV) regularized robust low rank tensor decomposition method is exploited for recovering outlier-free InSAR stacks. We demonstrate that the filtered InSAR data stacks can greatly improve the accuracy of geophysical parameters estimated from real data. Moreover, this article demonstrates for the first time in the community that tensor-decomposition-based methods can be beneficial for largescale urban mapping problems using multipass InSAR. Two TerraSAR-X data stacks with large spatial areas demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method.

TI  - The conquest of hearts: the central role of Ottoman nostalgia within contemporary Turkish populism
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In contemporary Turkey, populism goes hand in hand with neo-Ottoman nostalgia. They make a stigmatized duo, as nostalgia is interpreted as lingering in the past and populism is deemed as the opium of the uninformed, emotional masses. In this paper, I complicate this vision through an ethnographic discourse analysis of the 2016 Conquest of Constantinople Rally, organized by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). I show how nostalgia helps boost the authenticity claim that social performances seek to achieve. In a ritualistic setting, the rally portrays a Manichean worldview predating to Ottoman times, underlines the power of the "people" against nefarious others, and is organized around a leader who is posited as a savior. By relying on forty-five in-depth interviews in five cities, I investigate the extent to which this social performance convinces the audience. Three interpretative perspectives emerged from participants' responses: Spectacle Seekers see the rallies as a necessity and as providing emotional uplift as the state's duty; Appraising Skeptics approve the commemoration, yet are skeptical of the authenticity of the effort; and History Guardians deem the Ottoman past as sacred and regard the AKP's use of it as emotional manipulation.

TI  - Assessment of land use/land covers changes linked to oil and gas exploration
T2  - TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land use/land cover changes (LU/LC) linked to oil and gas exploration under changing climatic conditions in South Lokichar Basin is crucial. This knowledge will inform policy makers on appropriate sustainable vegetation cover management strategies for the sake of pastrolism practiced in the area. The LU/LC changes were assessed using multi-spatial and multi-temporal remotely sensed imageries acquired through Landsat 5TM and Landsat 80LI/TIRS by use of ArcGIS. The study assessed medium resolution spatial imageries acquired for the area in both rainy and dry seasons, before oil and gas exploration developments begun in South Lokichar Basin between 2006-2011 and after commencement between 2012-2017. The study established that the average area in hectares under vegetation cover had declined since oil and gas exploration developments begun. A one sample t-test statistics indicated that the area under forest, shrubland and grassland cover had significantly reduced at 90% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.072, 0.074 and 0.061 respectively. The study established a decline in NDVI from 1 to 0.433 for the rainy season and 0.411 to 0.122 for the dry season between 2006 and 2017 with a p-value of 0.009 <0.05 on paired t-test implying a significant change on vegetation cover. Sustainable management of vegetation cover is important to safeguard livestock forage.

TI  - Improved Classification of Urban Trees Using a Widespread Multi-Temporal Aerial Image Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree identification is often limited by the accessibility of remote sensing imagery but has not yet been attempted with the multi-temporal commercial aerial photography that is now widely available. In this study, trees in Detroit, Michigan, USA are identified using eight high resolution red, green, and blue (RGB) aerial images from a commercial vendor and publicly available LiDAR data. Classifications based on these data were compared with classifications based on World View 2 satellite imagery, which is commonly used for this task but also more expensive. An object-based classification approach was used whereby tree canopies were segmented using LiDAR, and a street tree database was used for generating training and testing datasets. Overall accuracy using multi-temporal aerial images and LiDAR was 70%, which was higher than the accuracy achieved with World View 2 imagery and LiDAR (63%). When all data were used, classification accuracy increased to 74%. Taxa identified with high accuracy includedAcer platanoidesandGleditsia, and taxa that were identified with good accuracy includedAcer,Platanus, Quercus,andTilia. Our results show that this large catalogue of multi-temporal aerial images can be leveraged for urban tree identification. While classification accuracy rates vary between taxa, the approach demonstrated can have practical value for socially or ecologically important taxa.

TI  - GISS-E2.1: Configurations and Climatology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the GISS-E2.1 contribution to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6). This model version differs from the predecessor model (GISS-E2) chiefly due to parameterization improvements to the atmospheric and ocean model components, while keeping atmospheric resolution the same. Model skill when compared to modern era climatologies is significantly higher than in previous versions. Additionally, updates in forcings have a material impact on the results. In particular, there have been specific improvements in representations of modes of variability (such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation and other modes in the Pacific) and significant improvements in the simulation of the climate of the Southern Oceans, including sea ice. The effective climate sensitivity to 2 x CO(2)is slightly higher than previously at 2.7-3.1 degrees C (depending on version) and is a result of lower CO(2)radiative forcing and stronger positive feedbacks.

TI  - Inter -comparison of evapotranspiration datasets over heterogeneous landscapes across Australia
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection of optimal actual evapotranspiration (ET) dataset for hydro -meteorological applications requires a detailed accuracy assessment and uncertainty characterization. This evaluation study was conducted at the site scale to compare the accuracies of ET mea- surements extracted from four widely used satellite- and model -based ET datasets (MOD16, GLEAM, GLDAS, and AWRA-L). Site - scale ET values were compared with five eddy -covariance -based in -situ flux tower measurements representing different land cover types: forest, grassland, and savanna, over heterogeneous landscapes across Australia. The results show moderate to good index of agreement 0.71, >0.88, and >0.46 for forest, grassland, and savanna, respectively, producing a root mean square errors in the range of 8.16-31. 52 mm/month. AWRA-L demonstrated its best performance in forest ecosystems, GLDAS in grasslands, and GLEAM performed well in both forest and grassland biomes. Compared with the other datasets tested in this study, MOD16 performed relatively poorly across Australia. AWRA-L consistently showed the best agreement with the flux tower measurements, with a normalized standard deviation (o - n ) of -0.98, followed by GLEAM (o - n -0.92). Based on our accuracy assessment, agreement between the satellite- and model -based ET products and the flux tower measurements followed the order: AWRA-L > GLEAM > GLDAS > MOD16. The results of this study further reveal that existing ET datasets each have a particular advantages and limitations for a specific land cover types. Therefore, an integrated and merged ET product is needed to take advantage of the complementary strengths of each ET dataset. Overall, our quality evaluation of four widely used satellite- and model -based ET measurements can serve as a benchmark study of ET dynamics over dif- ferent land cover types and be used to select an appropriate dataset for improved quantification of water consumption across Australia.

TI  - Accuracy Comparison of Aerial Lidar, Mobile-Terrestrial Lidar, and UAV Photogrammetric Capture Data Elevations over Different Terrain Types
T2  - INFRASTRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar and other remotely sensed data such as UAV photogrammetric data capture are being collected and utilized for roadway design on an increasing basis. These methods are desirable over conventional survey due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness over large areas. A high degree of relative accuracy is achievable through the establishment of survey control. In this case study, elevations (z-values) derived from mobile-terrestrial lidar, aerial lidar, and UAV photogrammetric capture collected with survey control were statistically compared to conventionally surveyed elevations. A cost comparison of the methods is also included. Each set of z-values corresponds to a discrete horizontal point originally part of the conventional survey, collected as cross-sections. These cross-sections were surveyed at three approximate tenth-mile sample locations along US-30 near Georgetown, Idaho. The cross-sections were collected as elevational accuracy verification, and each sample location was selected as an area where the mobile-terrestrial lidar in particular was expected to have more difficulty achieving accuracy off the road surface. Processing and analysis were performed in Esri ArcMap 10.6, and all data were obtained from the Idaho Transportation Department, District 5. Overall, the aerial lidar elevations were found to be closest to conventionally surveyed elevations; on road surface and level terrain, mobile-terrestrial and UAV photogrammetric capture elevations were closer to the conventionally measured elevations.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Infestation and Fire Disturbance in the Southern Appalachian Using a Time Series Analysis of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Appalachian forests have been threatened by several large-scale disturbances, such as wildfire and infestation, which alter the forest ecosystem structures and functions. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugaeAnnand, HWA) is a non-native pest that causes widespread foliar damage and eventual mortality, resulting in irreversible tree decline in eastern (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina (T. caroliniana) hemlocks throughout the eastern United States. It is important to monitor the extent and severity of these disturbances over space and time to better understand their implications in the biogeochemical cycles of forest landscapes. Using all available Landsat images, we investigate and compare the performance of Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT)-based indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Disturbance Index (DI) in capturing the spectral-temporal trajectory of both abrupt and gradual forest disturbances (e.g., fire and hemlock decline). For each Landsat pixel, the temporal trajectories of these indices were fitted into a time series model, separating the inter-annual disturbance patterns (low frequency) and seasonal phenology (high frequency) signals. We estimated the temporal dynamics of disturbances based on the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the model, investigated the performance of all the indices in capturing the hemlock decline intensity, and further validated the results with the number of individual dead hemlocks identified from high-resolution aerial images. Our results suggested that the overall performance of NDVI, followed by TCT wetness, was most accurate in detecting both the disturbance timing and hemlock decline intensity, explaining over 90% of the variability in the number of dead hemlocks. Despite the overall good performance of TCT wetness in characterizing the disturbance regime, our analysis showed that this index has some limitations in characterizing disturbances due to its recovery patterns following infestation.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation Using Citizen Observatory Data, Microwave Satellite Imagery, and Environmental Covariates
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in the climate system and a key parameter in earth surface processes. This study aimed to test the citizen observatory (CO) data to develop a method to estimate surface SM distribution using Sentinel-1B C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat 8 data; acquired between January 2019 and June 2019. An agricultural region of Tard in western Hungary was chosen as the study area. In situ soil moisture measurements in the uppermost 10 cm were carried out in 36 test fields simultaneously with SAR data acquisition. The effects of environmental covariates and the backscattering coefficient on SM were analyzed to perform SM estimation procedures. Three approaches were developed and compared for a continuous four-month period, using multiple regression analysis, regression-kriging and cokriging with the digital elevation model (DEM), and Sentinel-1B C-band and Landsat 8 images. CO data were evaluated over the landscape by expert knowledge and found to be representative of the major SM distribution processes but also presenting some indifferent short-range variability that was difficult to explain at this scale. The proposed models were evaluated using statistical metrics: The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Multiple linear regression provides more realistic spatial patterns over the landscape, even in a data-poor environment. Regression kriging was found to be a potential tool to refine the results, while ordinary cokriging was found to be less effective. The obtained results showed that CO data complemented with Sentinel-1B SAR, Landsat 8, and terrain data has the potential to estimate and map soil moisture content.

TI  - Comparison of SAR Backscatter Coefficient and Water Indices for Flooding Detection
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing severity of climate change, intense torrential rains are occurring more frequently globally. Flooding due to torrential rain not only causes substantial damage directly, but also via secondary events such as landslides. Therefore, accurate and prompt flood detection is required. Because it is difficult to directly access flooded areas, previous studies have largely used satellite images. Traditionally, water indices such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) which are based on different optical bands acquired by satellites, are used to detect floods. In addition, as flooding likelihood is greatly influenced by the weather, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have also been used, because these are less influenced by weather conditions. In this study, we compared flood areas calculated from SAR images and water indices derived from Landsat-8 images, where the images were acquired at similar times. The flooded area was calculated from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 images taken between the end of May and August 2019 at Lijiazhou Island, China, which is located in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River basin and experiences annual floods. As a result, the flooded area calculated using the MNDWI was approximately 21% larger on average than that calculated using the NDWI. In a comparison of flood areas calculated using water indices and SAR intensity images, the flood areas calculated using SAR images tended to be smaller, regardless of the order in which the images were acquired. Because the images were acquired by the two satellites on different dates, we could not directly compare the accuracy of the water-index and SAR data. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that floods can be detected using both optical and SAR satellite data.

TI  - Informing hydrological models of poorly gauged river catchments - A parameter regionalization and calibration approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of robust hydrologic-hydrodynamic simulation models is challenging, especially in regions, where in-situ observation data are scarce. Parameter calibration is often a necessary and data-demanding step. Moreover, good calibration performance does not guarantee predictive skill in neighboring geographic regions or new time periods and scenarios. A robust calibration strategy is necessary and must apply an informed parameter regionalization approach, which can transfer parameter values from gauged to ungauged subcatchments, whilst accounting for data availability and quality. In this study, a calibration strategy combining a parameter transfer framework based on catchment similarities with a holistic calibration against hydrological signatures is presented to obtain reliable simulations at all relevant locations within a catchment. The approach is demonstrated for three African river catchments: the Tana, the Upper Niger and the Semliki catchments.A rainfall-runoff model based on Budyko's concept of limits with up to 11 calibration parameters and a daily simulation time step is used, coupled with a Muskingum routing scheme. Each river catchment is subdivided into so-called hydrological response units (HRU) based on climatic and physiographic characteristics. Multi-mission satellite remote sensing observations are used for the HRU classification: terrain slope derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the publicly available European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover map. Subcatchments within each HRU share the same parameters. The number of units is constrained by the number of in-situ stations available. The calibration strategy is a catchment-scale, multi-objective approach.The method improved the overall model performance compared to a simpler, nearest-neighbor regionalization method. In particular, spatial patterns of the hydrological response are more reasonable and performance is improved at validation stations, highlighting the importance of appropriate parameter regionalization within nested catchments. With this method, a wider range of currently available remote sensing data (elevation, precipitation, land cover, etc.) can be exploited in hydrological model development and calibration.

TI  - Local hydrological modelling containing global, alternative data sets
T2  - HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of alternative, meteorological datasets from remote sensing data and reanalyses with (almost) global coverage is increasing. In addition, new technologies, both on the hardware and software side, continuously improve the handling of these, often very large, datasets. One of these new technologies is the "Google Earth Engine" platform, which significantly simplifies and enhances the time-spatial extraction and processing of alternative datasets. Therefore, several alternative datasets for rainfall, air temperature and potential evapotranspiration were extracted from "Google Earth Engine" for the purpose of rainfall-runoff modelling (R-R modelling). An analysis of their suitability for mapping long-term climatic conditions was carried out before those alternative datasets were implemented in the hydrological model COSERO. The station-based, spatially highly resolved, but only regionally available meteorological dataset (INCA) of the existing R-R model was replaced by the extracted, lower-resolution, alternative datasets. The catchment area of the Austrian Mur was selected as the study area, as it shows several different hydro-climatic conditions. The 46 runoff gauges in the study area were used for evaluating the performance of the runoff simulations by the hydrological model. The existing model run with the high-resolution regional meteorological input datasets was thereby used as a reference.The almost globally available, alternative datasets showed decent model accuracies in a few cases, already with the basic model calibration. Especially the model run using the alternative GSMaP GC precipitation dataset showed surprisingly good results. In order to investigate the impact of the model calibration on the model performance, COSERO was recalibrated using several alternative datasets as input. The Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE) model performance of the reference simulation could not be reached with the alternative datasets, though the decrease in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency was lower than expected, especially for the GSMaP GC dataset. This is particularly valid at gauges with larger catchment areas. The error in the runoff balance (bias) was partially lower with the alternative datasets, compared to the local INCA dataset.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach for Burned Area Segmentation with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have major ecological, social and economic consequences. Information about the extent of burned areas is essential to assess these consequences and can be derived from remote sensing data. Over the last years, several methods have been developed to segment burned areas with satellite imagery. However, these methods mostly require extensive preprocessing, while deep learning techniques-which have successfully been applied to other segmentation tasks-have yet to be fully explored. In this work, we combine sensor-specific and methodological developments from the past few years and suggest an automatic processing chain, based on deep learning, for burned area segmentation using mono-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. In particular, we created a new training and validation dataset, which is used to train a convolutional neural network based on a U-Net architecture. We performed several tests on the input data and reached optimal network performance using the spectral bands of the visual, near infrared and shortwave infrared domains. The final segmentation model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.98 and a kappa coefficient of 0.94.

T2  - VETUS TESTAMENTUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Ancient Near Eastern Sources offer various kinds of descriptions of gemstones and their use, either for healing or for sanctification rituals. Several myths explain their place in the Ancient Near Eastern cosmology. One of these myths is the Gilgamesh Epic, which tells about a garden of gemstones lying behind the way of the sun-out of reach for humankind. The placement of the garden, e.g. the gemstones in Gilgamesh, also demands further investigation of the placement of gemstones in the Old Testament. The article offers a thorough reading of Gilg. IX 170-196; Gen 2:10-14; Ezek 28:11-19; Is 54:1117a and, briefly, Job 28. The author shows that gemstones are not just to be regarded colorful and precious. They are deeply connected with a realm outside human reach and with primeval times. They function as a marker in this respect when placed at the robe of the king of Tyre. And they transform Zion according to Is 54 at the other end, to an eschatological future.

TI  - Retrieval of the total ozone over Antarctica using Sentinel-3 ocean and land colour instrument
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a simple and fast technique to retrieve total ozone from measurements of spectral top-of-atmosphere reflectance for cloudless atmosphere over Antarctica. It is assumed that both snow and atmosphere are clean and not influenced by pollution. Spaceborne measurements performed by Ocean Land and Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 mission over Dome C (Antarctica) are analysed. The results of the retrievals are compared with those performed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the Aura satellite. Good correspondence of the derived total ozone columns is found. This work opens a door for fast ozone retrievals using high spatial resolution imagery with frequent re-visit time over polar areas covered by snow and ice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Photoperiod Explains the Asynchronization Between Vegetation Carbon Phenology and Vegetation Greenness Phenology
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation carbon phenology is a key indicator of vegetation actual photosynthesis activity and regulates terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance. A comprehensive understanding of the structural difference of carbon phenology and greenness phenology is still lacking. This study evaluated the structural difference of vegetation greenness phenology and carbon phenology on 95 eddy covariance flux sites (637 site-years). Vegetation greenness phenology is extracted from remote sensing vegetation indices (i.e., enhanced vegetation index [EVI] and normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites; carbon phenology is extracted from daily gross primary production estimates at flux sites. We found that there exists remarkable asynchronization between vegetation greenness phenology and carbon phenology on the 95 flux sites. Generally, the asynchronization is more prevalent in the withering season, with the bias about 18.7 13.0 days for EVI and about 29.8 14.4 days for NDVI. In comparison, in the green-up season, the bias is only about -1.6 12.9 days for EVI and -6.0 13.8 days for NDVI. We found that photoperiod is the dominant factor controlling the asynchronization and the decrease of photosynthetic capacity in the withering season, other than photosynthetically active radiation or temperature. Our study also reveals that EVI x PC and NDVI x PC are good proxies of vegetation carbon phenology, where PC is the photoperiod constraint and is quantified as dayl/daylmax2. Using PC in the withering season reduces the bias of EVI from 18.7 +/- 13.0 days to -2.4 +/- 11.2 days and the bias of NDVI from 29.8 +/- 14.4 days to -1.1 +/- 12.7 days.Key PointsThere exists strong asynchronization between vegetation greenness phenology and carbon phenology in the withering season Photoperiod explains the asynchronization between vegetation greenness phenology and carbon phenology in the withering season EVI x PC and NDVI x PC are good proxies of vegetation carbon phenology

TI  - A Development of PM Concentration Reanalysis Method using CMAQ with Surface Data Assimilation and MAIAC AOD in Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient exposure to PM (Particulate Matter) is harmful effect on public health and assessment of its exposure level is essential in health risk estimation. PM10 and PM2.5 concentration reanalysis method using CMAQ with surface data assimilation and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) has been developed to provide PM exposure level for health risk assessment in this study and its performance was tested against the measurements in Korea. The assimilation of CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System) with ambient air quality monitoring stations in China and Korea was applied and the assimilated PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations shows better agreement with observations. In order to enhance the accuracy of exposure estimation especially remote area where the air quality measurements are not available, MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) to predict daily PM concentration with 1km resolution was applied using predictor variables of MAIAC AOD, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), CMAQ assimilated PM concentrations, and WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model predicted meteorological parameters. The MLR estimates daily PM10 with R-2=0.81, IOA=0.95, and RMSE=14.62 mu g/m(3) and daily PM2.5 with R-2=0.64, IOA=0.87, and RMSE=9.13 mu g/m(3). The annual and seasonal spatial distribution of PM10 and PM2.5 could depict key hot spot regions in Korea. The method is expected to be used in estimating long term PM concentration distributions more than 10 years for health risk assessment in Korea.

TI  - From sacrilege to sustainability: the role of indigenous knowledge systems in biodiversity conservation in the Upper West Region of Ghana
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the management and sustainability of natural resources in Ghana reveals that indigenous knowledge systems have played major roles. The aim of this paper was to assess how indigenous knowledge systems used for sacred biological resources have resulted in the sustainability of resources in three selected communities in the Upper West Region. The study used researcher-administered questionnaires, focused group discussions and key informant interviews to collect data from traditional authorities, and community members. The concept of worldview was used to depict the 'indigenous knowledge makeup' of the inhabitants in northern Ghana. The study revealed that taboos and totems are the key indigenous knowledge system used in conserving biological resources. Whilst the traditional political institution plays out as custodian of the knowledge systems, sanctions in the form of fines, banishment and punishment by the gods are used to deter local communities from flouting the indigenous knowledge systems. Based on the perceptions of the respondents, indigenous knowledge systems were found to be very effective in conserving biodiversity. However, formal education, Christianity, Islam and modernisation emerged as key challenges which threaten the sustainability of existing indigenous knowledge systems and their potentials for biodiversity conservation in northern Ghana. The study recommends that the Forestry Division of Ghana, Forestry Commission and Ghana Tourism Authority integrate indigenous knowledge systems into modern laws and policies for effective conservation and management of biodiversity in Ghana.

TI  - Proof of Concept for Sea Ice Stage of Development Classification Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of ice concentration and ice type are needed to address increased interest in commercial marine transportation through the Arctic. RADARSAT-2 SAR imagery is the primary source of data used by expert ice analysts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) to produce sea ice maps over the Canadian territory. This study serves as a proof of concept that neural networks can be used to accurately predict ice type from SAR data. Datasets of SAR images served as inputs, and CIS ice charts served as labelled outputs to train a neural network to classify sea ice type. Our results show that DenseNet achieves the highest overall classification accuracy of 94.0% including water and the highest ice classification accuracy of 91.8% on a three class dataset using a fusion of HH and HV SAR polarizations for the input samples. The 91.8% ice classification accuracy validates the premise that a neural network can be used to effectively categorize different ice types based on SAR data.

TI  - Modelling soil erodibility in mountain rangelands of southern Kyrgyzstan
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion in mountain rangelands in Kyrgyzstan is an emerging problem due to vegetation loss caused by overgrazing. It is further exacerbated by mountain terrain and high precipitation values in Fergana range in the south of Kyrgyzstan. The main objective of this study was to map soil erodibility in the mountainous rangelands of Kyrgyzstan. The results of this effort are expected to contribute to the development of soil erodibility modelling approaches for mountainous areas. In this study, we mapped soil erodibility at two sites, both representing grazing rangelands in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan and having potentially different levels of grazing pressure. We collected a total of 232 soil samples evenly distributed in geographical space and feature space. Then we analyzed the samples in laboratory for grain size distribution and calculated soil erodibility values from these data using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) K-factor formula. After that, we derived different terrain indices and ratios of frequency bands from ASTER GDEM and LANDSAT images to use as auxiliary data because they are among the main soil forming factors and widely used for prediction of various soil properties. Soil erodibility was significantly correlated with channel network base level (geographically extrapolated altitude of water channels), remotely sensed indices of short-wave infrared spectral bands, exposition, and slope degree. We applied multiple regression analysis to predict soil erodibility from spatially explicit terrain and remotely sensed indices. The final soil erodibility model was developed using the spatially explicit predictors and the regression equation and then improved by adding the residuals. The spatial resolution of the model was 30 m, and the estimated mean adjusted coefficient of determination was 0.47. The two sites indicated different estimated and predicted means of soil erodibility values (0.035 and 0.039) with a 0.05 significance level, which is attributed mainly to the considerable difference in elevation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes and prediction of Amery ice shelf, east Antarctica: A remote sensing and statistics-based approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amery ice shelf (AIS) dynamics and mass balance play key role to decipher changes in the global climate scenario. The spatio-temporal changes in morphology of the AIS were studied into a number of transects at 5 km uniform intervals using multi-dated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite data (2001-2016) of the austral summer months (January-March). Past ice shelf extents have been reconstructed and future ice shelf extents were estimated for 5- and 10-year time periods. The rate changes of AIS extent were estimated using the linear regression analysis and cross-validated with the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) methods. Further, the changes in shelf extent were linked to prevailing factors viz. mass changes, Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index, and ocean-air temperatures. The study reveals that the AIS extent has been prograded at the rate of 994 m/year with an average 14.5 km increase in the areal extents during 2001-2016, as compared to the year 2001, whereas, the maximum advancement in ice shelf extent was recorded during the 2006-2016 period. Based on the linear regression analysis, the predicted ice shelf extents (i. e., the summer 2021 and 2016) show progradation in all the transects. About 52% of transects exhibit +/- 200 m RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based ice-shelf position. The recent changes (2017-2019) observed in the ice shelf are cross validated with predicted ice self-extent rates. The eastern part of Mackenzie Bay to Ingrid Christensen coast recorded advancement in the ice shelf extents and mass which is the feedback of positive SAM along with a decrease in the temperatures (air temperature and sea surface temperature). The present study demonstrates that the combined use of satellite imagery and statistical techniques can be useful in quantifying and predicting ice shelf morphological variability.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Subseasonal to Seasonal Model in Predicting Rainfall Onset Over West Africa
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates the performance of a Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) model (called The China Meteorological Administration) in simulating rainfall onset dates (RODs) over West Africa. Using two ROD definitions, we compared the model's ROD at six lead-time forecasts (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 days) with the observed ROD from satellite data sets, statistically quantified the model's capability to reproduce the interannual variability of RODs over the climatological zones in the subcontinent, and investigated how well the model links RODs with the dynamics of monsoon system over the subregion. The results show that the mean RODs follow a latitudinal progression and the dates increases northward from the coast. The performance of the S2S model in reproducing RODs largely depends on the definition used. For instance, the ability of the model to replicate the observed spatial pattern of RODs and all the essential features over the three zones in West Africa is stronger with DEF1 than DEF2. Regardless of the ROD definition used, the 20- to 60-day forecasts produced more realistic simulation than the 10-day forecast. We also found that the performance of the model in reproducing the interannual variability of RODs depends on the zones (Guinea, Savanna, and Sahel). Moreover, the model could reproduce the three main phases of the West African Monsoon (the onset, the peak, and the southward retreat of rainfall) and other dynamics. The results of the study have application in improving S2S forecasting over West Africa.

TI  - Remote Sensing Techniques for Classification and Mapping of Sugarcane Growth
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to apply remote sensing technologies in delineating sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) plantations and in identifying its growth stages. Considering the growing demand for sugarcane in the local and global markets, the need for a science-based resource inventory emerges. In this sense, remote sensing techniques' unique ability is vital to monitor crop growth and estimate crop yield. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) concept was employed by utilizing orthophotos and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) datasets. Specifically, the study applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to generate the resource map, validated by a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). The classification result showed an accuracy of 98.4%, delineating a total of 13.93 hectares of sugarcane plantation in the study area. The height information from LiDAR datasets aided in developing the rule-set that can further classify the sugarcane according to its growth stages. Results showed that the area distribution of sugarcane at establishment, tillering, yield formation, and ripening stage were 6.65%, 11.61%, 13.89%, and 17.90% respectively. GPS validation points of the growth stages verified the accuracy of SVM. The accuracy results for growth stages, i.e. establishment, tillering, yield formation, and ripening are 88%, 94.4%, 96.3%, and 91.7% respectively. The results proved the usefulness of SVM as a remote sensing classification technique which led to an exact mapping of the sugarcane areas as well as the practical use of LiDAR height information in estimating the growth stages of the mapped resource, both of which can provide valuable aid in estimating the potential sugarcane yield in the future.

AB  - The benthic habitats of shallow waters of Sebaru Island and Lancang Island have different water characteristics from geographical location. Data and information about benthic habitat are needed to maintain and preserve ecosystems in the waters. This study aims is to know the effect of different satellite image resolution, different algorithms and water quality e.g chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended solid (TSS) on the accuracy of shallow-water benthic habitats mapping on Sebaru Besar Island and Lancang Island. The accuracy (OA) of the application of different classification algorithms showed a good results. The highest OA results in shallow waters of Sebaru Island with Wordview 2 imagery were obtained from the SVM and DT algorithms with the same value of 76.24%, while the Sentinel 2B image with the DT algorithm obtained results (OA) of 68.08%. In Lancang Island the highest OA value of Wordview 2 imagery was obtained by DT algorithm with a value of 74.44%, while Sentinel 2B imagery was obtained from KNN algorithm with a value of 59.0%. High concentrations of Chl-a and TSS cannot yet be said to affect the low accuracy in mapping shallow water benthic habitats.

TI  - The Best of Both Worlds? Integrating Sentinel-2 Images and airborne LiDAR to Characterize Forest Regeneration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable forest management relies on practices ensuring vigorous post-harvest regeneration. Data on regeneration structure and composition are often collected through intensive field surveys. Remote sensing technologies (e.g., Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), satellite imagery) can cover a much larger spatial extent, but their ability to estimate regeneration characteristics is often challenged by the obstruction associated with canopy foliage. Here, we determined whether the integration of LiDAR and Sentinel-2 images can increase the accuracy of sapling density estimates and whether this accuracy decreased with canopy cover in the Acadian forest of New Brunswick, Canada. Using random forest regression, we compared the accuracy of three models (LiDAR and Sentinel-2 images alone or combined) to estimate sapling density for two species groups: saplings of all species or commercial species only. The integration of both sensors did not increase the accuracy of sapling density estimates, nor did it reduce the negative influence of canopy cover for either species group compared to LiDAR, but it increased the accuracy by approximately 15% relative to Sentinel-2 images. Under very high canopy cover, the accuracy of density estimates for all species combined was significantly lower with Sentinel-2 images only. We recommend using LiDAR and high-resolution satellite images acquired in the fall to obtain more accurate estimates of sapling density.

TI  - The Daily Fire Hazard Index: A Fire Danger Rating Method for Mediterranean Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean forests are gravely affected by wildfires, and despite the increased prevention effort of competent authorities in the past few decades, the yearly number of fires and the consequent damage has not decreased significantly. To this end, a number of dynamical methods have been developed in order to produce short-term hazard indices, such as the Fire Probability Index and the Fire Weather Index. The possibility to estimate the fire hazard is based on the observation that there is a relationship between the characteristics of the vegetation (i.e., the fuel), in terms of abundance and moisture content, and the probability of fire insurgence. The density, type, and moisture content of the vegetation are modeled using custom fuel maps, developed using the latest Corine Land Cover, and using a number of indices such as the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI), and the evapotranspiration, derived from daily satellite imagery. This paper shows how the algorithm for the calculation of the Fire Potential Index (FPI) was improved by taking into account the effect of wind speed, topography, and local solar illumination through a simple temperature correction, preserving the straightforward structure of the FPI algorithm. The results were validated on the Italian region of Sardinia using official wildfire records provided by the regional administration.

TI  - PlanetScope Radiometric Normalization and Sentinel-2 Super-Resolution (2.5 m): A Straightforward Spectral-Spatial Fusion of Multi-Satellite Multi-Sensor Images Using Residual Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery is used in many research areas and for diverse applications. Its spectral resolution and quality are high but its spatial resolutions, of at most 10 m, is not sufficient for fine scale analysis. A novel method was thus proposed to super-resolve S2 imagery to 2.5 m. For a given S2 tile, the 10 S2 bands (four at 10 m and six at 20 m) were fused with additional images acquired at higher spatial resolution by the PlanetScope (PS) constellation. The radiometric inconsistencies between PS microsatellites were normalized. Radiometric normalization and super-resolution were achieved simultaneously using state-of-the-art super-resolution residual convolutional neural networks adapted to the particularities of S2 and PS imageries (including masks of clouds and shadows). The method is described in detail, from image selection and downloading to neural network architecture, training, and prediction. The quality was thoroughly assessed visually (photointerpretation) and quantitatively, confirming that the proposed method is highly spatially and spectrally accurate. The method is also robust and can be applied to S2 images acquired worldwide at any date.

TI  - Node-Positive Patients Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Can Be Spared Axillary Lymph Node Dissection with Wireless Non-Radioactive Localizers
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) involves sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and excision of a biopsy-proven node marked by a clip. This study evaluates the feasibility of non-radioactive wireless localizers for targeted excision of clipped axillary lymph nodes. Methods We identified biopsy-proven, node-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and TAD from 2016 to 2020, and included those with a clipped node localized using SAVI SCOUT, Magseed, or RFID Tag. Primary outcome measures were (1) successful localization (ultrasound or mammographic-guided placement < 10 mm from target), and (2) retrieval of the clipped node during TAD, documented by specimen radiography or gross visualization. Secondary outcomes included rates of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) and complications. Results Overall, 57 patients were included; 1 (1.8%) patient had no clip visible at the time of localization, and no radiographic confirmation of clip placement at the time of biopsy, and was therefore excluded. In the remaining 56 patients, localization was successful in 53 (94.6%) patients and the clipped node was retrieved during TAD in 51 (91.1%) patients. Twenty-three of 27 (85.2%) ypN0 patients were spared cALND; 3 (11.1%) patients had cALND for failed clipped node retrieval during TAD, and 1 (3.7%) for false-positive frozen section. In patients with TAD alone, the rates of axillary seroma and infection were 20.0% and 8.6%, respectively. Conclusions Wireless non-radioactive localizers are feasible for axillary localization after NAT, with high success rates of retrieving clipped nodes. The lack of signal decay is an advantage of these devices, allowing flexibility in timing of placement.

TI  - LiCSAR: An Automatic InSAR Tool for Measuring and Monitoring Tectonic and Volcanic Activity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (InSAR) is now a key geophysical tool for surface deformation studies. The European Commission's Sentinel-1 Constellation began acquiring data systematically in late 2014. The data, which are free and open access, have global coverage at moderate resolution with a 6 or 12-day revisit, enabling researchers to investigate large-scale surface deformation systematically through time. However, full exploitation of the potential of Sentinel-1 requires specific processing approaches as well as the efficient use of modern computing and data storage facilities. Here we present Looking Into Continents from Space with Synthetic Aperture Radar (LiCSAR), an operational system built for large-scale interferometric processing of Sentinel-1 data. LiCSAR is designed to automatically produce geocoded wrapped and unwrapped interferograms and coherence estimates, for large regions, at 0.001 degrees resolution (WGS-84 coordinate system). The products are continuously updated at a frequency depending on prioritised regions (monthly, weekly or live update strategy). The products are open and freely accessible and downloadable through an online portal. We describe the algorithms, processing, and storage solutions implemented in LiCSAR, and show several case studies that use LiCSAR products to measure tectonic and volcanic deformation. We aim to accelerate the uptake of InSAR data by researchers as well as non-expert users by mass producing interferograms and derived products.

TI  - Assessment of Cloud Retrieval for IASI 1D-Var Cloudy-Sky Assimilation and Improvement with an ANN Approach
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Unified Model (UM) data assimilation system incorporates a 1D-Var analysis of cloud variables for assimilating hyperspectral infrared radiances. For the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) radiance assimilation, a first guess of cloud top pressure (CTP) and cloud fraction (CF) is estimated using the minimum residual (MR) method, which simultaneously obtains CTP and CF by minimizing radiance difference between observation and model simulation. In this study, we examined how those MR-based cloud retrievals behave, using optimum CTP and CF that yield the best 1D-Var analysis results. It is noted that the MR method tends to overestimate cloud top height while underestimating cloud fraction, compared to the optimum results, necessitating an improved cloud retrieval. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach was taken to estimate CTP as close as possible to the optimum value, based on the hypothesis that CTP and CF closer to the optimum values will bring in better 1D-Var results. The ANN-based cloud retrievals indicated that CTP and CF biases shown in the MR method are much reduced, giving better 1D-Var analysis results. Furthermore, the computational time can be substantially reduced by the ANN method, compared to the MR method. The evaluation of the ANN method in a global weather forecasting system demonstrated that it helps to use more temperature channels in the assimilation, although its impact on UM forecasts was found to be near neutral. It is suggested that the neutral impact may be improved when error covariances for the cloudy sky are employed in the UM assimilation system.

TI  - Current Status and Future Directions of Tropospheric Photochemical Ozone Studies in Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone is a critical chemical species for sustaining natural oxidizing power of atmosphere, as it is the most abundant oxidant species, as well as the precursor of most strong oxidants, such as OH and NO3 radicals in the troposphere. Although it plays an important role in reducing lifetimes of various pollutants in troposphere, it is also regarded as a criteria pollutant due to its adverse impact on human and ecological health. Long-term observations showed significant and rapidly increasing tends of tropospheric ozone in Korea. Ozone is the fast-rising public concern in air quality next to traditional PM pollution. This review summarizes the studies from the past 20 years associated with photochemical ozone in Korea, covering issues of long-term ozone trends analysis, its precursor emission inventories, biogenic VOCs emission, impact on the ecosystem, background ozone and long-range transport, health impacts, climate feedback, aerosol surface effects for HO2 heterogeneous reaction and radiation budget, radicals budgets and their implications. Considering the current status of scientific findings, advance of knowledge, and challenge of recent ozone studies, this review focuses on delivering future directions of ozone studies in Korea. Present recommendations for the future ozone R&D include: 1) continuous promotion of basic science for solving fundamental aspects of ozone productions and transport, 2) strengthening specifically the regional studies for ozone unattained areas, 3) developing collaborative implementation plan for multi-ministerial R&D platforms, 4) extension and outreach of international research collaboration, including long-term intensive field campaigns, 5) multi-pollutant approach and partnership with PM studies for practical and effective framework of R&D strategies and capabilities with limited resources.

TI  - Development of Land Surface Albedo Algorithm for the GK-2A/AMI Instrument
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korea Meteorological Administration successfully launched Korea's next-generation meteorological satellite, Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A), on 5 December 2018. It belongs to the new generation of GEO (Geostationary Elevation Orbit) satellite which offers capabilities to disseminate high spatial- (0.5-2 km) and high temporal-resolution (10 min) observations over a broad area, herein a geographic disk encompassing the Asia-Oceania region. The targeted objective is to enhance our understanding of climate change, owing to a bulk of coherent observations. For such, we developed an algorithm to map the land surface albedo (LSA), which is a major Essential Climate Variable (ECV). The retrieval algorithm devoted to GK-2A/Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) data considered Japan's Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data for prototyping, as this latter owns similar specifications to AMI. Our proposed algorithm is decomposed in three major steps: atmospheric correction, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) modeling and angular integration, and narrow-to-broadband conversion. To perform BRDF modeling, the optimization method using normalized reflectance was applied, which improved the quality of BRDF modeling results, particularly when the number of observations was less than 15. A quality assessment was performed to compare our results to those of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSA products and ground measurement from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites, Australian and New Zealand flux tower network (OzFlux) site and the Korea Flux Network (KoFlux) site from throughout 2017. Our results show dependable spatial and temporal consistency with MODIS broadband LSA data, and rapid changes in LSA due to snowfall and snow melting were well expressed in the temporal profile of our results. Our outcomes also show good agreement with the ground measurements from AERONET, OzFlux and KoFlux ground-based network with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.0223 and 0.0306, respectively, which is close to the accuracy of MODIS broadband LSA. Moreover, our results reveal still more reliable LSA products even when clouds are frequently present, such as during the summer monsoon season. It shows that our results are useful for continuous LSA monitoring.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-stream Fusion Architecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The generative adversarial network receives extensive attention in the study of computer vision such as image fusion and image super-resolution, due to its strong ability of generating high quality images. At present, the remote sensing image fusion method based on generative adversarial network only learns the mapping between the images, and lacks the unique Pan-sharpening domain knowledge. This paper proposes a remote sensing image fusion method based on optimized generative adversarial network with the integration of the spatial structure information of panchromatic image. The proposed algorithm extracts the spatial structure information of the panchromatic image by the gradient operator. The extracted feature would be added to both the discriminator and the generator which uses a multi-stream fusion architecture. The corresponding optimization objective and fusion rules are then designed to improve the quality of the fused image. Experiments on images acquired by WorldView-3 satellites demonstrate that the proposed method can generate high quality fused images, which is better than the most of advanced remote sensing image fusion methods in both subjective visual and objective evaluation indicators.

TI  - GIS-Based Machine Learning Algorithms for Gully Erosion Susceptibility Mapping in a Semi-Arid Region of Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, gully erosion susceptibility was evaluated for the area of the Robat Turk Watershed in Iran. The assessment of gully erosion susceptibility was performed using four state-of-the-art data mining techniques: random forest (RF), credal decision trees (CDTree), kernel logistic regression (KLR), and best-first decision tree (BFTree). To the best of our knowledge, the KLR and CDTree algorithms have been rarely applied to gully erosion modeling. In the first step, from the 242 gully erosion locations that were identified, 70% (170 gullies) were selected as the training dataset, and the other 30% (72 gullies) were considered for the result validation process. In the next step, twelve gully erosion conditioning factors, including topographic, geomorphological, environmental, and hydrologic factors, were selected to estimate gully erosion susceptibility. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to estimate the performance of the models. The results revealed that the RF model had the best performance (AUC = 0.893), followed by the KLR (AUC = 0.825), the CDTree (AUC = 0.808), and the BFTree (AUC = 0.789) models. Overall, the RF model performed significantly better than the others, which may support the application of this method to a transferable susceptibility model in other areas. Therefore, we suggest using the RF, KLR, and CDT models for gully erosion susceptibility mapping in other prone areas to assess their reproducibility.

TI  - A framework for setting up a country-wide network of regional surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> sampling sites utilising a satellite-derived proxy - The COALESCE project, India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality management and assessment of aerosol climate effects over a large area require the strategic placement of regionally representative monitoring sites (RRMS) to capture the required information. Ground-based, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations measured for a long duration at high spatial resolution i. e. at several potential locations in a region help identify an optimal regionally representative site for the monitoring network. However, in the absence of long-term PM2.5 concentrations with high spatial resolution, identification of RRMS is a challenge. To identify for such situations, a novel methodology utilising satellite-derived PM2.5 is presented in this study. High spatial resolution (1 km x 1 km) daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) over several years (2004-2011) is used to derive surface PM2.5 using appropriate conversion factors. PM2.5 concentrations thus derived for a potential site and its nearby cells in the region are subjected to statistical analysis, to quantify linear/non-linear relationships between the respective PM2.5 time-series. Metrics such as coefficient of divergence (CoD), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Mutual information (MI) are calculated to assess the regional representativeness of a site. These criteria combined with physical criteria such as proximity of the site to local sources, local meteorology analysis and clustered air parcel back-trajectory analysis, are used in a weight-of-evidence approach to establish site adequacy. The selection and validation of eleven sites for the COALESCE project, is used as an illustrative example, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the site-selection methodology developed in this study.

TI  - Land Cover Changes from 1990 to 2019 in Papua, Indonesia: Results of the Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term land cover changes play a significant driver of ecosystem and function of natural biodiversity. Hence, their analysis can be used for evaluating and supporting government plans, especially conservation and management of natural habitats such as sago palm. In Papua Province of Indonesia, sago palm has been stated as one of the priority plants in the Medium-Term Development Plan (R.P.J.M.). However, limited studies have examined this palm in one of the Regencies of Papua Province, namely, Merauke Regency. In this study, we performed remotely sensed data imagery and supervised classification to produce land cover maps from 1990 to 2019. During the study period, twenty-one land cover classes were identified. The six classes of the natural forest consist of primary dryland forest, secondary dryland forest, primary mangrove forest, secondary mangrove forest, primary swamp forest, and secondary swamp forest; thus, fifteen classes of non-forested area. Concerning the sago palm habitat, our study evaluated two different categories (1) based on the land cover scheme from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and (2) according to the peatland land cover ecosystem in Papua. Based on paired samplest-test, the result indicated statistically significant changes specifically at primary dryland (p-value = 0.015), grassland (p-value = 0.002) and swamp (p-value = 0.007). Twelve from 20 districts of Merauke Regency tend to lose the forecasted natural habitat of the sago palm. Therefore, this study suggests the further need to recognize and estimate the yield of sago palm area in these various ecosystems.

TI  - Incidence and etiology of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated diarrhea among children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries: Evidence from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income countries. While vaccines may prevent diarrhea infections for which children often receive antibiotics, the contribution of individual enteropathogens to antibiotic use is minimally understood. We used data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to estimate pathogen-specific incidence of antibiotic-treated diarrhea among children under five years old residing in six countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia before rotavirus vaccine implementation. GEMS was an age-stratified, individually-matched case-control study. Stool specimens were obtained from children presenting to sentinel health clinics with newly-onset, acute diarrhea (including moderate-to-severe and less-severe diarrhea) as well as matched community controls without diarrhea. We used data from conventional and quantitative molecular diagnostic assays applied to stool specimens to estimate the proportion of antibiotic-treated diarrhea cases attributable to each pathogen. Antibiotics were administered or prescribed to 9,606 of 12,109 moderate-to-severe cases and 1,844 of 3,174 less-severe cases. Across all sites, incidence rates of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated diarrhea were 12.2 (95% confidence interval: 9.0-17.8), 10.2 (7.4-13.9) and 1.9 (1.3-3.0) episodes per 100 child-years at risk at ages 6 weeks to 11 months, 12-23 months, and 24-59 months, respectively. Based on the recommendation for antibiotic treatment to be reserved for cases with dysentery, we estimated a ratio of 12.6 (8.6-20.8) inappropriately-treated diarrhea cases for each appropriately-treated case. Rotavirus, adenovirus serotypes 40/41,Shigella, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli, andCryptosporidiumwere the leading antibiotic-treated diarrhea etiologies. Rotavirus caused 29.2% (24.5-35.2%) of antibiotic-treated cases, including the largest share in both the first and second years of life.Shigellacaused 14.9% (11.4-18.9%) of antibiotic-treated cases, and was the leading etiology at ages 24-59 months. Our findings should inform the prioritization of vaccines with the greatest potential to reduce antibiotic exposure among children.Author summary Because diarrhea is the second-leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), effective vaccines against diarrheal pathogens may have the collateral benefit of reducing antibiotic exposure and resistance selection in these settings. Whereas antibiotic treatment is only recommended for diarrhea cases with blood in the stool (which suggestsShigellaetiology), little is known about real-world diarrhea treatment practices in LMICs. We used data from a study of children experiencing diarrhea and matched, asymptomatic controls residing in LMICs of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to understand factors leading to antibiotic treatment of diarrhea cases, and the proportion of cases attributable to various enteric pathogens. We identify rotavirus andShigellaas the predominant causes of antibiotic-treated diarrhea at ages 0-23 months and 24-59 months; additional leading causes include adenovirus serotypes 40/41, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli, andCryptosporidium. We estimate that approximately 12.6 diarrhea cases receive antibiotics inappropriately for each appropriately-treated case in the study settings. Vaccines against prominent enteropathogens may substantially reduce antibiotic consumption among children in LMICs.

TI  - Conjugate ruptures and seismotectonic implications of the 2019 Mindanao earthquake sequence inferred from Sentinel-1 InSAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, four strong earthquakes of Mw > 6.4 occurred successively in Mindanao, Philippines. Based on the reports from the USGS and PHIVOLCS, these earthquakes were dominated by strike-slip ruptures. Whether these earthquakes are temporally and spatially related remained unknown. We characterized the coseismic displacement fields during the earthquake sequence using an InSAR technique with Sentinel-1 SAR data. The InSAR deformation measurements convincingly reveal that the four earthquakes produced distinct coseismic displacement patterns. We estimated the source parameters of the earthquakes with a two-step inversion strategy. The optimal model suggests that the earthquake sequence resulted from the reactivation of a conjugate fault structure that involves two nearly vertical left-lateral strike-slip faults and two high-angle right-lateral strike-slip faults. We calculated Coulomb stress changes from the earthquake sequence, suggesting that the previous strong earthquakes had significant stress-encouraging effects on the following events. The regional velocities based on the GPS analysis suggest that the formation of this conjugate structure is mainly due to the westward movement of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate. This earthquake sequence provides a seismotectonic background for subsequent strong earthquakes and helps to better understand the formation mechanisms and seismotectonic implications of conjugate structure rupturing.

TI  - Ground Subsidence Analysis in Tianjin (China) Based on Sentinel-1A Data Using MT-InSAR Methods
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) methods have been widely used in remote sensing monitoring of ground subsidence, which occurs at many places around the world. Land subsidence, caused by excessive extraction of groundwater, has always been a problem to be solved in Tianjin, China. Although the subsidence in the urban area has been controlled at a low rate, the subsidence issue has not been effectively solved in the suburban area recently, which should be paid much attention. This paper aims to present two multi-temporal differential interferometry techniques, persistent scatterer (PS) and small baseline subset (SBAS), for monitoring the latest surface subsidence in a Tianjin study area on the basis of 20 Sentinel-1A images obtained from March 2017 to March 2019. Our research showed that the average velocity map obtained from the SBAS method closely followed the outcomes of the PS technique from the perspective of identifying similar subsidence patterns. Subsidence rate gradually increased from the urban area of Tianjin to the suburbs and high subsidence zones were mainly distributed at the junction of the Wuqing, Xiqing and Beichen districts. In the past two years, the annual average subsidence rate in the high settlement area mostly exceeded -50 mm/year, which caused serious damage to local infrastructures. Besides, high-resolution remote sensing images combined with field investigations further verified the successful application of MT-InSAR technology in Tianjin's subsidence monitoring. Effective ground subsidence control measures need to be taken as soon as possible to prevent the situation from getting worse.

TI  - Discovery of Parasitoids of <i>Anoplophora glabripennis</i> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and Their Seasonal Abundance in China Using Sentinel Host Eggs and Larvae
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), is a high-risk invasive forest pest worldwide. We surveyed Asian longhorned beetle parasitoid guilds and their seasonal abundance using field-deployed sentinel host logs infested with Asian longhorned beetle eggs or newly hatched (early-instar) larvae in three different sites of China (Beijing City, Shanghai City, and Jilin Province) from 2015 to 2018. Our survey detected 12 species of hymenopteran parasitoids (four Pteromalidae, three Braconidae, two Eupelmidae, one Eurytomidae, one Ichneumonidae, and one Bethylidae) attacking sentinel Asian longhorned beetle larvae or eggs deployed in these sites. Total parasitism by all the parasitoid species varied with different sites and across different years of the survey (averaging 7-16% in Beijing, 4-11% in Shanghai, and 0-0.2% in Jilin Province). In addition, the seasonal pattern of parasitism also differed among different sites, with parasitism peaking in July in the northern site (Beijing, 19%) and June in the southern site (Shanghai, 16%). Among all the parasitoid species recovered, Oxysychus sp. (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) was the most abundant parasitoid species in both Beijing and Shanghai (with 42-66% relative abundance and an average of 6% Asian longhorned beetle parasitism). The second most abundant species was Bracon planitibiae Yang, Cao et Gould (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which accounted for 35% of the species collected and caused an average of 5% Asian longhorned beetle parasitism. Relevance of our findings to Asian longhorned beetle biocontrol is discussed.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of land damage and restoration in rare earth mining areas in 6 counties in southern Jiangxi based on multisource sequential images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Components of the environment, such as soil and vegetation, are directly destroyed by ion-type rare earth mining processes, resulting in serious ecological problems. The destruction of land resources and ecological restoration in areas with rare earth ore have become key considerations in the sustainable development of the ion-type rare earth element industry. In this paper, ion-type rare earth ore areas in 6 counties in southern Jiangxi are taken as the research area. HJ-1B CCD and Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing data from 1995 to 2017 are used as data sources, and based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis and regression analysis, the statuses of rare earth element mining, land destruction and restoration in these 6 counties in southern Jiangxi are analyzed. To reduce the NDVI error related to sensor differences between different datasets, an NDVI transformation equation is constructed for the HJ-1B CCD and Landsat TM/OLI data according to a regression analysis method, and the accuracy of the transformation equation is assessed with the root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that there is a significant positive linear correlation between the NDVI data from HJ-1B CCD and those from Landsat TM/OLI; the obtained transformation equation has a high precision and can eliminate the influence of the differences in data sources on NDVI. The spatial and temporal distribution analysis of rare earth mining shows that the rare earth (RE) mining area in 6 counties in southern Jiangxi was highest in 1995, 2006 and 2017, and the total mining area was over 7 km(2). The spatial distribution of RE mining is relatively dispersed, which not only increases the difficulty of supervision but also causes resource waste and, to some extent, increases the difficulty of governance. Analysis of land destruction and restoration shows that the area of land not reclaimed after mining in 1995 remains extensive, at 38.1042 km(2); under the conditions of natural restoration, the restoration of rare earth ore areas is relatively slow. There is still a large area of rare earth ore that has not been reclaimed manually and requires the attention of the relevant departments to ensure its timely reclamation.

TI  - The Atlantic Water Boundary Current in the Chukchi Borderland and Southern Canada Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synoptic shipboard measurements, together with historical hydrographic data and satellite data, are used to elucidate the detailed structure of the Atlantic Water (AW) boundary current system in the southern Canada Basin and its connection to the upstream source of AW in the Chukchi Borderland. Nine high-resolution occupations of a transect extending from the Beaufort shelf to the deep basin near 152 degrees W, taken between 2003 and 2018, reveal that there are two branches of the AW boundary current that flow beneath and counter to the Beaufort Gyre. Each branch corresponds to a warm temperature core and transports comparable amounts of Fram Strait Branch Water between roughly 200-700 m depth, although they are characterized by a different temperature/salinity (T/S) structure. The mean volume flux of the combined branches is 0.87 +/- 0.13 Sv. Using the historical hydrographic data, the two branches are tracked upstream by their temperature cores and T/S signatures. This sheds new light on how the AW negotiates the Chukchi Borderland and why two branches emerge from this region. Lastly, the propagation of warm temperature anomalies through the region is quantified and shown to be consistent with the deduced circulation scheme. Plain Language Summary Warm water flows into the Arctic Ocean from the North Atlantic and circulates counterclockwise through the different subbasins of the Arctic. The water is cooled, freshened, and densified as part of the global overturning circulation. The warm water also spreads into the interior Arctic with the potential to melt sea ice. Presently, very little is known about the Atlantic Water (AW) circulation in the Canada Basin, far from the source of the water. In this study, we analyze nine repeat shipboard transects extending from the Beaufort Sea shelf to the deep basin, taken between 2003 and 2018. The transects reveal that there are two branches of the AW boundary current, each characterized by a warm temperature core. The branches transport roughly equal amounts of water. Using an extensive historical database, we demonstrate that the two branches emerge from a region of complex topography known as the Chukchi Borderland. A single AW current entering the Borderland undergoes a series of divisions and merges, which ultimately forms two branches that are further distinguishable by their temperature and salinity structure. Finally, we document the propagation of warm temperature pulses through the region, which is consistent with the deduced circulation scheme.

TI  - Changes in Air Quality during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Singapore and Associations with Human Mobility Trends
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On the 7th of April, the Singaporean government enforced strict lockdown measures with the aim of reducing the transmission chain of the coronavirus disease 2019. This had a significant impact on the movement of people within the country. Our study aims to quantify the impact that these measures had on outdoor air pollution levels. We obtained air quality and weather data from April 2016 to May 2020, satellite data for 2019 and 2020 and mobility data for 2020 from Apple, Google, and the Singaporean Housing & Development Board. We determined that outdoor air pollution during the lockdown significantly decreased when compared with the same period in the previous four years even if we included corrections for long time trends in the analysis. The concentrations of the following pollutants PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and SO2 decreased by 23, 29, 54, 6, and 52%, respectively, whilst that of O-3 increased by 18%. The Pollutant Standard Index decreased by 19%. The trends of PM2.5 and NO2 were significantly correlated with mobility data. The NO2 and SO2 tropospheric concentrations and the total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm obtained from satellite data during the lockdown in 2020 were also lower than during the same period in 2019. Our results can be used to evaluate possible mitigation strategies for outdoor air quality in a longer term beyond this lockdown.

TI  - Thin cloud removal in optical remote sensing images based on generative adversarial networks and physical model of cloud distortion
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination is an inevitable problem in optical remote sensing images. Unlike thick clouds, thin clouds do not completely block out background which makes it possible to restore background information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a physical model of cloud distortion (CR-GAN-PM) for thin cloud removal with unpaired images from different regions. A physical model of cloud distortion which takes the absorption of cloud into consideration was also defined in this paper. It is worth noting that many state-of-the-art methods based on deep learning require paired cloud and cloud-free images from the same region, which is often unavailable or time-consuming to collect. CR-GAN-PM has two main steps: first, the cloud-free background and cloud distortion layers were decomposed from an input cloudy image based on GANs and the principles of image decomposition; then, the input cloudy image was reconstructed by putting those layers into the redefined physical model of cloud distortion. The decomposition process ensured that the decomposed background layer was cloud-free and the reconstruction process ensured that generated background layer was correlated with the input cloudy image. Experiments were conducted on Sentinel-2A imagery to validate the proposed CR-GAN-PM. Averaged over all testing images, the SSIMs values (structural similarity index measurement) of CR-GAN-PM were 0.72, 0.77, 0.81 and 0.83 for visible and NIR bands respectively. Those results were similar to the end-to-end deep learning-based methods and better than traditional methods. The number of input bands and values of hyper-parameters affected little on the performance of CR-GAN-PM. Experimental results show that CR-GAN-PM is effective and robust for thin cloud removal in different bands.

TI  - Evaluation of a new 18-year MODIS-derived surface water fraction dataset for constructing Mediterranean wetland open surface water dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, due largely to their dynamic hydrology. Frequent observations by satellite sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) allow for monitoring the seasonal, inter-annual and long-term dynamics of surface water extent. However, existing MODIS-based studies have only demonstrated this for large water bodies (> 100 km(2)) despite the ecological importance of smaller-sized wetland systems. In this paper, we assessed if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent can be effectively captured with MODIS for a wide range of water body sizes, specifically 0.01 km(2) and larger. We constructed the temporal dynamics of surface water extent for 340 individual water bodies in the Mediterranean region between 2000 and 2017, using a previously developed 8-day 500 m MODIS surface water fraction (SWF) dataset. We then evaluated how MODIS SWF time series corresponded to water extent derived from a Landsat-based dataset and to satellite-altimetry derived water level data. Results showed that although correlations between MODIS- and Landsat-derived SWF were poor for relative static water bodies (r = 0.17), they increased for more dynamic water bodies (r = 0.81). For dynamic water bodies > 100 km(2), time series of water extent derived from MODIS SWF showed good correlation with both Landsat (r >= 0.76) and water level data (rho >= 0.63). Our MODIS SWF dataset can also effectively monitor the variability of very small water bodies (< 1 km(2)) when comparing with Landsat data as long as the temporal variability in their surface water area was high. We conclude that MODIS SWF is a useful product to help understand hydrological dynamics for both small and larger-sized water bodies, and to monitor their seasonal, intermittent, inter-annual and long-term changes.

TI  - Detection of Tailings Dams Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and a Single Shot Multibox Detector in the Jing-Jin-Ji Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate mapping and monitoring of mine tailings dams is crucial to the improvement of management practices by decision makers and to the prevention of disasters caused by failures of these dams. Due to the complex topography, varying geomorphological characteristics, and the diversity of ore types and mining activities, as well as the range of scales and production processes involved, as they appear in remote sensing imagery, tailings dams vary in terms of their scale, color, shape, and surrounding background. The application of high-resolution satellite imagery for automatic detection of tailings dams at large spatial scales has been barely reported. In this study, a target detection method based on deep learning was developed for identifying the locations of tailings ponds and obtaining their geographical distribution from high-resolution satellite imagery automatically. Training samples were produced based on the characteristics of tailings ponds in satellite images. According to the sample characteristics, the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model was fine-tuned during model training. The results showed that a detection accuracy of 90.2% and a recall rate of 88.7% could be obtained. Based on the optimized SSD model, 2221 tailing ponds were extracted from Gaofen-1 high resolution imagery in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in northern China. In this region, the majority of tailings ponds are located at high altitudes in remote mountainous areas. At the city level, the tailings ponds were found to be located mainly in Chengde, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou. The results prove that the deep learning method is very effective at detecting complex land-cover features from remote sensing images.

TI  - An Operational Split-Window Algorithm for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature from Geostationary Satellite Data: A Case Study on Himawari-8 AHI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational split-window (SW) algorithm was developed to retrieve high-temporal-resolution land surface temperature (LST) from global geostationary (GEO) satellite data. First, the MODTRAN 5.2 and SeeBor V5.0 atmospheric profiles were used to establish a simulation database to derive the SW algorithm coefficients for GEO satellites. Then, the dynamic land surface emissivities (LSEs) in the two SW bands were estimated using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Emissivity Dataset (GED), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and snow cover products. Here, the proposed SW algorithm was applied to Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) observations. LST estimates were retrieved in January, April, July, and October 2016, and three validation methods were used to evaluate the LST retrievals, including the temperature-based (T-based) method, radiance-based (R-based) method, and intercomparison method. The in situ night-time observations from two Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) sites and four Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) OzFlux sites were used in the T-based validation, where a mean bias of -0.70 K and a mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.29 K were achieved. In the R-based validation, the biases were 0.14 and -0.13 K and RMSEs were 0.83 and 0.86 K for the daytime and nighttime, respectively, over four forest sites, four desert sites, and two inland water sites. Additionally, the AHI LST estimates were compared with the Collection 6 MYD11_L2 and MYD21_L2 LST products over southeastern China and the Australian continent, and the results indicated that the AHI LST was more consistent with the MYD21 LST and was generally higher than the MYD11 LST. The pronounced discrepancy between the AHI and MYD11 LST could be mainly caused by the differences in the emissivities used. We conclude that the developed SW algorithm is of high accuracy and shows promise in producing LST data with global coverage using observations from a constellation of GEO satellites.

TI  - Fusing wearable and remote sensing data streams by fast incremental learning with swarm decision table for human activity recognition
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) by machine learning finds wide applications ranging from posture monitoring for healthcare and rehabilitation to suspicious or dangerous actions detection for security surveillance. Infrared cameras such as Microsoft Kinect and wearable sensors have been the two most adopted devices for collecting data for measuring the bodily movements. These two types of sensors generally are categorized as contactless sensing and contact sensing respectively. Due to hardware limitation, each of the two sensor types has their inherent limitations. One most common problem associating with contactless sensing like Kinect is the distance and indirect angle between the camera and the subject. For wearable sensor, it is limited in recognizing complex human activities. In this paper, a novel data fusion framework is proposed for combining data which are collected from both sensors with the aim of enhancing the HAR accuracy. Kinect is able to capture details of bodily movements from complex activities, but the accuracy is dependent heavily on the angle of view; wearable sensor is relatively primitive in gathering spatial data but reliable for detecting basic movements. Fusing the data from the two sensor types enables complimenting each other by their unique strengths. In particular, a new scheme using incremental learning with decision table coupled with swarm-based feature selection is proposed in our framework for achieving fast and accurate HAR by fusing data of two sensors. Our experiment results show that HAR accuracy could be improved from 23.51% to 68.35% in a case of almost 90 degrees slanted view of Kinect sensing while a wearing sensor is used at the same time. The swarm feature selection in general is shown to enhance the HAR performance compared to standard feature selection method. The experiment results reported here contribute to the possibilities of using hybridized sensors from the machine learning perspective.

TI  - Wetland Fire Scar Monitoring and Its Response to Changes of the Pantanal Wetland
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important disturbance factor which results in the irreversible change of land surface ecosystems and leads to a new ecological status after the fire is extinguished. Spanning the period from August to September 2019, the Amazon Forest fires were an unprecedented event in terms of the scale and duration of burning, with a duration of 42 days in the Pantanal wetland. Based on the observation data of wildfire and two Sentinel-2A images separated by a 35-day interval, the objectives of this study are to use the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to map the spatiotemporal change features of fire and then quantitatively measure the fire severity and the impact of fire on the Pantanal wetland. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the extracted results of wetland types reached 80.6% and 0.767, respectively, and the statistically analyzed results showed that wildfires did not radically change the wetland types of the Pantanal wetland, because the hydrological variation of the burned area was still the main change factor, with a dynamic ratio of <= 50%. Furthermore, the savanna wetland in the burned area was the wetland type which was most affected by the fire. Meanwhile, fire scars belonged to the moderate and low-severity burned areas, with a maximum burn area of 599 km(2). The case enriches the research into the impact of wildfire as the main disturbance factor on the change of wetland types and provides a scientific reference for the restoration and sustainable development of global wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Precise Orbit Determination for the FY-3C Satellite Using Onboard BDS and GPS Observations from 2013, 2015, and 2017
T2  - ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Using the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) onboard BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data from 2013 to 2017, this study investigates the performance and contribution of BDS to precise orbit determination (POD) for a low-Earth orbit (LEO). The overlap comparison result indicates that code bias correction of BDS can improve the POD accuracy by 12.4%. The multi-year averaged one-dimensional (1D) root mean square (RMS) of the overlapping orbit differences (OODs) for the GPS-only solution is 2.0, 1.7, and 1.5 cm, respectively, during the 2013, 2015, and 2017 periods. The 1D RMS for the BDS-only solution is 150.9, 115.0, and 47.4 cm, respectively, during the 2013, 2015, and 2017 periods, which is much worse than the GPS-only solution due to the regional system of BDS and the few BDS channels of the FY-3C receiver. For the BDS and GPS combined solution (also known as the GC combined solution), the averaged 1D RMS is 2.5, 2.3, and 1.6 cm, respectively, in 2013, 2015, and 2017, while the GC combined POD presents a significant accuracy improvement after the exclusion of geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites. The main reason for the improvement seen after this exclusion is the unfavorable satellite tracking geometry and poor orbit accuracy of GEO satellites. The accuracy of BDS-only and GC combined solutions have gradually improved from 2013 to 2017, thanks to improvements in the accuracy of International GNSS Service (IGS) orbit and clock products in recent years, especially the availability of a high-frequency satellite clock product (30 s sampling interval) since 2015. Moreover, the GC POD (without GEO) was able to achieve slightly better accuracy than the GPS-only POD in 2017, indicating that the fusion of BDS and GPS observations can improve the accuracy of LEO POD. GC combined POD can significantly improve the reliability of LEO POD, simply due to system redundancy. An increased contribution of BDS to LEO POD can be expected with the launch of more BDS satellites and with further improvements in the accuracy of BDS satellite products in the near future.

TI  - Construction of High Spatial-Temporal Water Body Dataset in China Based on Sentinel-1 Archives and GEE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is the most important resource and environmental factor in maintaining human survival and ecosystem stability; therefore, timely accurate information on dynamic surface water is urgently needed. However, the existing water datasets fall short of the current needs of the various organizations and disciplines due to the limitations of optical sensors in dynamic water mapping. The advancement of the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and free-sharing Sentinel-1 imagery makes it possible to map the dynamics of a surface water body with high spatial-temporal resolution on a large scale. This study first establishes a water extraction method oriented towards Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data based on the statistics of a large number of samples of land-cover types. An unprecedented high spatial-temporal water body dataset in China (HSWDC) with monthly temporal and 10-m spatial resolution using the Sentinel-1 data from 2016 to 2018 is developed in this study. The HSWDC is validated by 14,070 random samples across China. A high classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.93, kappa coefficient = 0.86) is achieved. The HSWDC is highly consistent with the Global Surface Water Explorer dataset and water levels from satellite altimetry. In addition to the good performance of detecting frozen water and small water bodies, the HSWDC can also classify various water cover/uses, which are obtained from its high spatial-temporal resolution. The HSWDC dataset can provide more detailed information on surface water bodies in China and has good application potential for developing high-resolution wetland maps.

TI  - Transformation of Urban Surfaces and Heat Islands in Nanjing during 1984-2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the many consequences of urbanization is the expansion of cities into rural areas, which leads to the transformation of lands from natural surfaces to developed surfaces. It is widely considered an established fact that urbanization generally increases the heat island effect. The objective of this study is to understand the pattern of urban surface transformation in the city of Nanjing since 1980 and to find, if any, the correlation between such transformation and the urban heat island effect. The supervised classification technique was used to analyze the remote sensing data obtained from Landsat to identify the different kinds of underlying surfaces. Land surface temperatures were calculated using a subset of Landsat data. The correlation between the transformation of underlying surfaces and the heat island effect was established through analytical and statistical approaches. The results clearly show that the proportion of developed surfaces has been steadily rising in Nanjing in the past 30 years and that the urban heat island effect is positively correlated with the expansion of hard pavement and the deterioration of green surfaces and water bodies considering the general trend.

TI  - Sharpening the Sentinel-2 10 and 20 m Bands to Planetscope-0 3 m Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combination of near daily 3 m red, green, blue, and near infrared (NIR) Planetscope reflectance with lower temporal resolution 10 m and 20 m red, green, blue, NIR, red-edge, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) Sentinel-2 reflectance provides potential for improved global monitoring. Sharpening the Sentinel-2 reflectance with the Planetscope reflectance may enable near-daily 3 m monitoring in the visible, red-edge, NIR, and SWIR. However, there are two major issues, namely the different and spectrally nonoverlapping bands between the two sensors and surface changes that may occur in the period between the different sensor acquisitions. They are examined in this study that considers Sentinel-2 and Planetscope imagery acquired one day apart over three sites where land surface changes due to biomass burning occurred. Two well-established sharpening methods, high pass modulation (HPM) and Model 3 (M3), were used as they are multiresolution analysis methods that preserve the spectral properties of the low spatial resolution Sentinel-2 imagery (that are better radiometrically calibrated than Planetscope) and are relatively computationally efficient so that they can be applied at large scale. The Sentinel-2 point spread function (PSF) needed for the sharpening was derived analytically from published modulation transfer function (MTF) values. Synthetic Planetscope red-edge and SWIR bands were derived by linear regression of the Planetscope visible and NIR bands with the Sentinel-2 red-edge and SWIR bands. The HPM and M3 sharpening results were evaluated visually and quantitatively using the Q2(n)metric that quantifies spectral and spatial distortion. The HPM and M3 sharpening methods provided visually coherent and spatially detailed visible and NIR wavelength sharpened results with low distortion (Q2(n)values > 0.91). The sharpened red-edge and SWIR results were also coherent but had greater distortion (Q2(n)values > 0.76). Detailed examination at locations where surface changes between the Sentinel-2 and the Planetscope acquisitions occurred revealed that the HPM method, unlike the M3 method, could reliably sharpen the bands affected by the change. This is because HPM sharpening uses a per-pixel reflectance ratio in the spatial detail modulation which is relatively stable to reflectance changes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this research and the recommendation that the HPM sharpening be used considering its better performance when there are surface changes.

TI  - Assessing the Consistency of Remotely Sensed Multiple Drought Indices for Monitoring Drought Phenomena in Continental China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various drought indices are developed to monitor drought conditions. Each drought index applies to specific environments given its own characteristics. This article aims to compare the drought conditions of continental China detected by remote sensing. We compare diverse types of remote sensing-based indices for studying drought situation in 2017. The Station-based precipitation data with different scales are used to evaluate drought phenomena. The drought indices compared in this article include the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission data, vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectra-radiometer (MODIS) data, and other integrated drought indices, which combine VCI, TCI, and PCI. Vegetation health index (VHI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), and synthesized drought index (SDI) constitute the integrated drought indices. The results indicate that numerous indices have different applicability across continental China. VHI has the optimal correlation with short-term and long-term precipitation. The SDI, SDCI, VCI, TCI, and temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are also reliable for monitoring drought conditions and are more suitable for long-term than short-term precipitation. Furthermore, combined indices (VHI, SDI, and SDCI) perform better than single drought indices (PCI, TCI, and VCI). VHI, SDI, and SDCI did not show good consistency in croplands when monitoring agricultural drought.

TI  - An investigation of the hydrological influence on the distribution and transition of wetland cover in a complex lake-floodplain system using time-series remote sensing and hydrodynamic simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrology is a critical environmental condition for the evolution of wetland ecosystems. The effects of hydrological changes on wetland cover are of great importance for preserving its ecological functions. In this study, the hydrological influences on wetland cover distribution and transition in a large complex lake-floodplain system, Poyang Lake (China), were investigated. Utilizing time-series satellite remote sensing observations, wetland cover types in Poyang Lake during 2000-2009, including water, mudflat, and the major vegetation communities, were extracted and related to the wetland hydrological characteristics calculated by the hydrodynamic simulations. The statistical results of annual inundation conditions for different wetland cover types indicated that vegetation communities were preferential to hydrological environments with shorter annual inundation than water and mudflats, and different vegetation communities were distributed in areas with considerable variations in annual inundation, which suggested a substantial hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in Poyang Lake. Furthermore, this study investigated the impact of hydrological changes on the wetland cover transitions between typical dry and wet years. The results showed that hydrological fluctuations had various degrees of influences on different types of wetland cover transformation. The spatial analysis indicated that hydrological changes were probably the dominant factor for the wetland cover evolution in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of Poyang Lake, but not the unique determined factor for wetland cover transitions in the shallow floodplains near the sink of the inflows in the eastern and southwestern parts of Poyang Lake. This study provides a practical reference for the effects of hydrological regulation in the protection and restoration of Poyang Lake wetland.

TI  - Accurate Measurement of Individual Tree Position Based on DBH Extraction of Terrestrial Laser Scanning
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective] To develop a spatial correction method based on the position of DBH center extracted from terrestrial laser scanning in order to match the position of individual trees to center of trunk precisely. [Method] Hough transform method was used to extract the DBH and circular center of individual trees from point cloud data of high-density terrestrial laser scanning in the sample plots. Then, based on the DBH data obtained from field survey, the relative spatial positions of individual trees were matched to the extracted DBH center of individual trees by the spatial point correction methods. Finally, the location matching of individual trees was realized by CHM feature analysis. [Result] The trial plots were located at Mengjiagang Forest Farm in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province. The relevant results of three Larix olgensis Henry forest plots with different stem densities were compared and analyzed. The errors of extracted DBH were within 1 cm. And when the DBH error was within 2 cm, the correct matching rate of individual trees position in high, middle and low stem density plots were 91%, 92.5% and 98.6% respectively. Besides, the relative spatial position errors of all matched field surveys were within 1 m and the errors of geographical position matching with the airborne LiDAR CHM products were within 0.5 m. [Conclusion] The method of extracting DBH from terrestrial laser scanning to match spatial positions of individual trees can greatly improve the precision of individual trees spatial position. It can both provide precise location information for individual trees segementation in local sample plot, and give reliable location verification information for large-scale remote sensing data. Overall, it is approved as a reliable method for individual trees position measurement and multi source data matching.

TI  - Analyzing Macro-Level Ecological Change and Micro-Level Farmer Behavior in Manas River Basin, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental degradation is closely related to unreasonable land use behaviors by farmers. In this study, participatory rural assessment (PRA) is used to conduct a detailed survey of farmers and plots and to collect relevant natural and social statistics. The accuracy of remote sensing data is verified by comparative analysis, and the change in status of various land use types in each research period is reflected by the change in the dynamic degree and change in range. We examine how farmers' attitudes and behaviors affect environmental degradation, using a sample of 403 farmers in China's Manas River Basin. Due to age, education, income and other differences, farmers' land use behaviors, as well as their attitude toward and feelings about environmental degradation, vary greatly. We found that most farmers considered the environment to be very important to their lives and crop production, but nearly 21% did not know the causes of environmental degradation and nearly 8% did not consider the environmental impacts of their crop production activities. A new model for oasis expansion-land integration-is presented here. This model can increase the area of cultivated land, reduce cultivated land fragmentation, save irrigation water, improve the field microclimate and form a good ecological cycle. Through land transfer, ecological compensation and ecological protection incentives, the government should guide farmers' land use behaviors toward cooperation with the river basin's ecological protection and land use planning.

TI  - Monitoring Water Level Change and Seasonal Vegetation Change in the Coastal Wetlands of Louisiana Using L-Band Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are productive ecosystems driven by highly dynamic hydrological processes such as tides and river discharge, which operate at daily to seasonal timescales, respectively. The scientific community has been calling for landscape-scale measurements of hydrological variables that could help understand the flow of water and transport of sediment across coastal wetlands. While in situ water level gauge data have enabled significant advances, they are limited in coverage and largely unavailable in many parts of the world. In preparation for the NISAR mission, we investigate the use of spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations of phase and coherence at L-band for landscape-scale monitoring of water level change and vegetation cover in coastal wetlands across seasons. We use L-band SAR images acquired by ALOS/PALSAR from 2007 to 2011 to study the impact of seasonal changes in vegetation cover on InSAR sensitivity to water level change in the wetlands of the Atchafalaya basin located in coastal Louisiana, USA. Seasonal variations are observed in the interferometric coherence (gamma) time-series over wetlands, with higher coherence during the winter and lower coherence during the summer. We show with InSAR time-series that coherence is inversely correlated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our analysis of polarimetric scattering mechanisms demonstrates that double-bounce is the dominant mechanism in swamps while its weakness in marshes hinders estimation of water level changes. In swamps, water level change maps derived from InSAR are highly correlated (r(2)= 0.83) with in situ data from the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS). From October to December, we observed that the water level may be below wetland elevation and thus not inundating wetlands significantly. Our analysis shows that water level can only be retrieved when both images used for InSAR are acquired when wetlands are inundated. The L-band derived-maps of water level change show large scale gradients originating from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway rather than the main delta trunk channel, confirming its significant role as a source of hydrologic connectivity across these coastal wetlands. These results indicate that NISAR, with its InSAR observations every 12 days, will provide the measurements necessary to reveal large scale hydrodynamic processes that occur in swamps across seasons.

TI  - Systemic Sentinel Lymph Node Detection Using Fluorescence Imaging After Indocyanine Green Intravenous Injection in Colorectal Cancer: Protocol for a Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nodal staging is a major concern in colorectal cancer as it is an important prognostic factor. Several techniques that could potentially improve patient treatment and prognosis have been developed to increase the accuracy of nodal staging. Sentinel lymph node detection has been shown to accurately reflect nodal status in various tumors and has become the standard procedure in nodal staging of breast cancer and melanoma. However, in colorectal cancer, sentinel lymph node detection techniques are still controversial as the sensitivity reported in the literature varies from one study to another. Recently, indocyanine green fluorescence-guided surgery has been reported to be a useful technique for detection of macroscopic and microscopic metastatic deposits in lymph nodes after intravenous administration of indocyanine green dye. However, no studies have focused on the potential role of sentinel lymph node detection after systemic administration of indocyanine green dye, so-called systemic sentinel lymph nodes, or on the correspondence between the identification of the sentinel lymph node by standard local injection techniques and the detection of fluorescent lymph nodes with this new approach.Objective: The aim of this protocol is to validate the concept of sentinel lymph nodes identified by fluorescence imaging after intravenous injection of indocyanine green dye and to compare the sentinel lymph nodes identified by fluorescence imaging with sentinel lymph nodes detected by the standard blue dye technique.Methods: This study (SeLyNoFI; Sentinel Lymph Nodes Fluorescence Imaging) is a diagnostic, single-arm, open-label feasibility study, including patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma with or without metastatic disease who are admitted for elective colorectal resection of the primary tumor. This study evaluates the feasibility of a new approach for improving the accuracy of nodal staging using fluorescence imaging after intravenous administration of indocyanine green dye. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the classical blue dye technique and of the investigatory fluorescence imaging technique will be calculated. Translational research will be proposed, if applicable.Results: As of June 2020, this study has been registered. Submission for ethical review is planned for September 2020.Conclusions: The potential correlation between the two different approaches to detect sentinel lymph nodes offers new strategies for improving the accuracy of nodal staging in colorectal cancer. This new concept of the systemic sentinel lymph node and a greater understanding of the interactions between systemic sentinel lymph nodes and standard sentinel lymph nodes may provide important information regarding the underlying mechanism of primary tumor lymphatic drainage. The enhanced permeability and retention effect can also play a role in the fluorescence of systemic sentinel lymph nodes, especially if these lymph nodes are inflamed. In this case, we can even imagine that this new technique will highlight more instances of lymph node-positive colorectal cancer.

TI  - A GNSS-Based Crowd-Sensing Strategy for Specific Geographical Areas
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, SARS, MERS, etc., have seriously endangered human safety, economy, and education. During the spread of epidemics, restricting the range of activities of personnel is one of the options for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. A global navigation satellite system (GNSS), it can provide accurate coordinates of latitude and longitude to targets with GNSS receivers. However, it is not common to use GNSS coordinates to represent positions in social life. For epidemic management, it is important to know the locations (and addresses) of targets, especially in social life. When there are many targets, it is not easy to efficiently map these coordinates to locations. Therefore, we propose a GNSS-based crowd-sensing strategy for specific geographical areas that can be used to calculate how many targets are in specific geographical areas or whether a target is in a specific area. This strategy is based on the coordinates of latitude and longitude provided by GNSS to find the locations of these coordinates. As simulated data, the data records containing latitude and longitude in a well-known social networking service platform are used. The strategy is also available for mining hot spots or hot areas.

TI  - The associations of residential greenness with fetal growth in utero and birth weight: A birth cohort study in Beijing, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although studies have examined the association between residential greenness and birth weight, there is no evidence regarding the association between residential greenness and fetal growth in utero. We aimed to investigate the associations of residential greenness with both fetal growth in utero and birth weight.Methods: A birth cohort (2014-2017) with 18,665 singleton pregnancies was established in Tongzhou Maternal and Child hospital of Beijing, China. Residential greenness was matched with maternal residential address and estimated from remote satellite data using normalized difference vegetation index with 200 m and 500 m buffers (NDVI-200 and NDVI-500). Fetal parameters including estimated fetal weight (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC), head circumference (HC) and femur length (FL) were assessed by ultrasound measurements during pregnancy. Fetal parameters were standardized as gestational-age- and gender-adjusted Z-score and undergrowth was defined as Z-score <-1.88. Birth weight Z-score, low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA) were assessed as birth outcomes. Generalized estimating equations with the autoregressive working correlation structure and generalized linear regression were used to examine the associations of residential greenness with quantitative and categorized outcomes.Results: We found an increase Z-score of EFW [0.054, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.020-0.087], AC (0.045, 95%CI: 0.011-0.080) and HC (0.054, 95%CI: 0.020-0.089) associated with residential greenness above NDVI500 median compared to less than and equal to NDVI-500 median. Stratified analyses indicated that the associations might be stronger in women exposed to lower levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters <= 2.5 mu m. No associations were found in the analyses of NDVI-250 with fetal growth in utero. We didn't observe significant associations of NDVI with birth weight Z-score, LBW and SGA.Conclusions: This study identified a positive association of NDVI-500 and fetal growth in utero, but we didn't observe its association with birth weight measures. Our results suggest that building sufficient green infrastructure might potentially promote early life health.

TI  - Biological Calcification Rate and Species-Specific Contributions of Coccolithophores to Total Calcite Inventory in the Eastern Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coccolithophores are calcifying protists that have a significant role in marine biological pump through calcite production (CP). We determined the biological calcification rate and ecologically key species (e.g., Gephyrocapsa oceanica) contribution to total calcite stocks in the eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) during spring intermonsoon; this region was quite undersampled compared to other oceanic regions. Our results indicated that the numerically dominant species are of great importance to cell calcite even with low cellular calcite. CP rate in EIO ranged from 0.148 to 85.017 mu mol Cm(-3)day(-1) in the entire data set, which was lower than those in the global ocean. Coccolithophores contributed 8.5% of total phytoplankton carbon fixation. CP acted as a function of light irradiance in the euphotic zone, while a decoupling between CP and primary productivity was found in most of the bottom of euphotic zone. To some degree, this decoupling indicated calcification was more nitrate dependent and less light dependent than photosynthesis. CP/primary productivity ratios were highly variable in our database and were possibly influenced by photoacclimation across various coccolithophore species. As roughly estimated, the turnover rate of coccolith calcite took values around 0.02-0.05 day(-1). The association between particulate organic carbon and calcite stocks implied a potential increasing ballast as depth increase. The current profiles of calcification and associated biogeochemical elements obtained from this field study helps our understanding about characteristics of biological pump in the EIO and are valuable for estimating calcification rate in the region using satellite data and numerical modeling.

TI  - Seasonal variation in particle contribution and aerosol types in Shanghai based on satellite data from MODIS and CALIOP
T2  - PARTICUOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter in Shanghai has declined in recent years, aerosols remain one of the major pollutants affecting air quality. Herein, spatio-seasonal variation in aerosol optical properties and aerosol types were studied over a 10-year period (2006-2015) in Shanghai, China, using satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The average aerosol optical depth values for central urban and suburban areas of Shanghai were between 0.9 and 1.0. Clear seasonal variation in aerosol concentrations occurred, causing strongest attenuation in summer and weakest attenuation in autumn. Polluted dust, polluted continental (urban/industrial) and smoke aerosols were the main aerosol types. Desert dust aerosols occurred in the Shanghai area at higher altitudes (greater than 3 km) in spring, related to dusty weather in the north; while in winter, smoke aerosols occurred at high altitudes, related to haze pollution in the north. The aerosols detected in autumn were mainly from local sources, comprising polluted dust, polluted continental, and smoke aerosols. Aerosols in Shanghai clearly reflect both local and regional sources at different times. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Orbital Lifetime (2008-2017) Radiometric Calibration and Evaluation of the HJ-1B IRS Thermal Infrared Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The infrared sensor (IRS) is a payload on the HJ-1B satellite and includes a thermal infrared band (B08). In order to obtain radiometric calibration coefficients and evaluate annual change, this study performed an analysis covering its 10-year orbital lifetime (2008-2017). The cross-calibration of IRS B08 with MODIS was performed using near-simultaneous images over Lake Qinghai, China. The results reveal that the radiometric response of IRS B08 notably changed during its orbital lifetime from year-to-year. The offsets fluctuated more than the gain. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance obtained by calibration coefficients in this study was generally in agreement with those obtained by onboard calibrator, within an error range of +/- 4.00% from 2008 to 2012. The percent difference compared with field validation was within 1.63%. The difference between IRS and MODIS radiance over field validation sites was within +/- 5%. Approximately a 1% difference occurred between the TOA temperature of IRS and MODIS. The radiometric response of IRS B08 continuously decreased from 2008 to 2013, whereas it fluctuated from 2014 to 2017. Moreover, the DN fluctuated more when the at-aperture radiance was low, although it was more stable at higher radiance.

TI  - Using a semi-analytical model to retrieve Secchi depth in coastal and estuarine waters
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi depth (SD, m) is a direct and intuitive measure of water's transparency, which is also an indicator of water quality. In 2015, a semi-analytical model was developed to derive SD from remote sensing reflectance, thus able to provide maps of water's transparency in satellite images. Here anin-situdataset (338 stations) is used to evaluate its potential ability to monitor water quality in the coastal and estuarine waters, with measurements covering the Zhujiang (Pearl) River Estuary, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea where measured SD values span a range of 0.2-21.0 m. As a preliminary validation result, according to the whole dataset, the unbiased percent difference (UPD) between estimated and measured SD is 23.3% (N=338,R-2=0.89), with about 60% of stations in the dataset having relative difference (RD) <= 20%, over 80% of stations having RD <= 40%. Furthermore, by excluding the field data which with relatively larger uncertainties, the semi-analytical model yielded the UPD of 17.7% (N=132,R-2=0.92) with SD range of 0.2-11.0 m. In addition, the semi-analytical model was applied to Landsat-8 images in the Zhujiang River Estuary, and retrieved high-quality mapping and reliable spatial-temporal patterns of water clarity. Taking into account the uncertainties associated with both field measurements and satellite data processing, and that there were no tuning of the semi-analytical model for these regions, these findings indicate highly robust retrieval of SD from spectral techniques for such turbid coastal and estuarine waters. The results suggest it is now possible to routinely monitor coastal water transparency or visibility at high-spatial resolutions from measurements, like Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and newly launched Gaofen-5.

TI  - Variations of Vegetation Phenology Extracted from Remote Sensing Data over the Tibetan Plateau Hinterland during 2000-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - How vegetation phenology responds to climate change is a key to the understanding of the mechanisms driving historic and future changes in regional terrestrial ecosystem productivity. Based on the 250-m and 8-day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for 2000-2014 in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of Qinghai Province, China, i.e., the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau, we extracted relevant vegetation phenological information (e.g., start, end, and length of growing season) and analyzed the changes in the TRSR vegetation in response to climate change. The results reveal that, under the increasingly warm and humid climate, the start of vegetation growing season (SOS) advanced 1.03 day yr(-1)while the end of vegetation growing season (EOS) exhibited no significant changes, which led to extended growing season length. It is found that the SOS was greatly affected by the preceding winter precipitation, with progressively enhanced precipitation facilitating an earlier SOS. Moreover, as the variations of SOS and its trend depended strongly on topography, we estimated the elevation break-points for SOS. The lower the elevations were, the earlier the SOS started. In the areas below 3095-m elevation, the SOS delay changed rapidly with increasing elevation; whereas above that, the SOS changes were relatively minor. The SOS trend had three elevation break-points at 2660, 3880, and 5240 m.

TI  - Particle Size Parameters of Particulate Matter Suspended in Coastal Waters and Their Use as Indicators of Typhoon Influence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The power law particle size distribution (PSD) slope parameter is commonly used to characterize sediment fluxes, resuspension, aggregates, and settling rates in coastal and estuarine waters. However, particle size distribution metrics are also very useful for understanding sediment source and dynamic processes. In this study, a method was proposed to employ the particle size parameters commonly used in sedimentary geology (average particle size (o), sorting, skewness, and kurtosis) as indicators of changes in sediment dynamic processes, and MODIS images were used to estimate these parameters. The particle size parameters were estimated using a Mie scattering model, Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) analysis algorithm, and least squares QR decomposition (LSQR) solution method based on the relationship between the power law distribution of the suspended particles and their optical scattering properties. The estimates were verified by field measurements in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea regions of China. This method provided good estimates of the average particle size (o), sorting, and kurtosis. A greater number of wavebands (39) was associated with more accurate particle size distribution curves. Furthermore, the method was used to monitor changes in suspended particulate matter in the vicinity of the Heini Bay of China before and after the passage of a strong storm in August 2011. The particle size parameters represented the influence of a strong typhoon on the distribution of the near-shore sediment and, together with the PSD slope, comprehensively reflected the changes in the near-shore suspended particulate matter. This method not only established the relationship between remote sensing monitoring and the historical sediment record, it also extends the power law model to the application of sediment source and dynamic processes in coastal waters.

TI  - Rapid Extraction of Regional-scale Agricultural Disasters by the Standardized Monitoring Model Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been used as an important tool for disaster monitoring and disaster scope extraction, especially for the analysis of spatial and temporal disaster patterns of large-scale and long-duration series. Google Earth Engine provides the possibility of quickly extracting the disaster range over a large area. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study used MODIS vegetation index products with 250-m spatial resolution synthesized over 16 days from the period 2005-2019 to develop a rapid and effective method for monitoring disasters across a wide spatiotemporal range. Three types of disaster monitoring and scope extraction models are proposed: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) median time standardization model (R-NDVI_TM(i)), the NDVI median phenology standardization model (R-NDVI_AM(i)(j)), and the NDVI median spatiotemporal standardization model (R-NDVI_ZM(i)(j)). The optimal disaster extraction threshold for each model in different time phases was determined using Otsu's method, and the extraction results were verified by medium-resolution images and ground-measured data of the same or quasi-same period. Finally, the disaster scope of cultivated land in Heilongjiang Province from 2010-2019 was extracted, and the spatial and temporal patterns of the disasters were analyzed based on meteorological data. This analysis revealed that the three aforementioned models exhibited high disaster monitoring and range extraction capabilities, with verification accuracies of 97.46%, 96.90%, and 96.67% forR(NDVI_TM(i)),R-NDVI_AM(i), and((j))R(NDVI_ZM(i)(j)), respectively. The spatial and temporal disaster distributions were found to be consistent with the disasters of the insured plots and the meteorological data across the entire province. Moreover, different monitoring and extraction methods were used for different disasters, among which wind hazard and insect disasters often required a delay of 16 days prior to observation. Each model also displayed various sensitivities and was applicable to different disasters. Compared with other techniques, the proposed method is fast and easy to implement. This new approach can be applied to numerous types of disaster monitoring as well as large-scale agricultural disaster monitoring and can easily be applied to other research areas. This study presents a novel method for large-scale agricultural disaster monitoring.

TI  - Rapidly Accelerating Deforestation in Cambodia's Mekong River Basin: A Comparative Analysis of Spatial Patterns and Drivers
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong River is a globally important river system, known for its unique flood pulse hydrology, ecological productivity, and biodiversity. Flooded forests provide critical terrestrial nutrient inputs and habitat to support aquatic species. However, the Mekong River is under threat from anthropogenic stressors, including deforestation from land cultivation and urbanization, and dam construction that inundates forests and encourages road development. This study investigated spatio-temporal patterns of deforestation in Cambodia and portions of neighboring Laos and Vietnam that form the Srepok-Sesan-Sekong watershed. A random forest model predicted tree cover change over a 25-year period (1993-2017) using the Landsat satellite archive. Then, a statistical predictive deforestation model was developed using annual-resolution predictors such as land-cover change, hydropower development, forest fragmentation, and socio-economic, topo-edaphic and climatic predictors. The results show that almost 19% of primary forest (nearly 24,000 km(2)) was lost, with more deforestation in floodplain (31%) than upland (18%) areas. Our results corroborate studies showing extremely high rates of deforestation in Cambodia. Given the rapidly accelerating deforestation rates, even in protected areas and community forests, influenced by a growing population and economy and extreme poverty, our study highlights landscape features indicating an increased risk of future deforestation, supporting a spatial framework for future conservation and mitigation efforts.

TI  - Real-time 7-day forecast of pollen counts using a deep convolutional neural network
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have used regression analyses to forecast pollen concentrations, yet few have applied a deep neural network in their research. This study implements a deep convolutional neural network with the great potential to recognize patterns of pollen phenomena that enable the prediction of pollen concentrations. We train the model using data from 2009 to 2015 from multiple meteorological datasets, satellite data and processed data reflecting pollen flux as input for the model. The model forecasts pollen counts 1-7 days ahead for the entire year of 2016. Comparison of daily forecasts to observations, the algorithm obtains a relatively high index of agreement and Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. An evaluation of categorical statistics based on defined threshold levels shows satisfactory results. Critical success index of the model forecasts is as high as 0.887 for weed pollen, 0.646 for tree pollen, and 0.294 for grass pollen. Forecasts of grass pollen exhibit the largest decrease in accuracy because of the strong variance in annual pollen concentrations. Forecasts of weed pollen exhibit the greatest consistency, with a 7-day forecast correlation and index of agreement of 0.82 and 0.77, respectively, during the peak season. This correlates with the consistency of annual and seasonal trends of weed pollen within the study area. Compared to the conventional modeling approaches, convolutional neural network shows a promising ability to predict pollen for multiple days to allow individuals with allergies to take proper precautions during high pollen days.

TI  - Pushing satellite imagery to new depths: Seascape feature mapping in a tropical shelf
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental shelves are areas of extreme environmental and economic importance and priority areas for management and planning efforts. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding many tropical shelves, mainly due to high costs associated with surveying large marine areas with traditional techniques. Carbonatic, sediment-starved shelves are distributed across tropical and temperate regions and display characteristics that may allow the application of remote sensing methods, albeit the depth range found in these areas. Thus, this study tested the applicability of Landsat-8 imagery to detect bottom features in a sediment-starved shelf in Northeastern Brazil. The Brazilian Northeast Continental Shelf harbours a variety of geohabitats, including coral and algal reefs, beachrocks, mesophotic reefs, canyons, and paleochannels. Nine scenes were processed following the same steps: radiometric and atmospheric correction, masking, glint removal, water column correction and individual image adjustments. Two scenes were deemed best to portray targeted features. We detected 14 paleochannels in a 9700 km(2) area, as well as the shelf break. A pixel-by-pixel analysis using all available bathymetric field data (n = 42,373 pixels) showed that 92.38% of the pixels were accurately classified. Misinterpreted pixels were either due to bordering regions incorrectly identified as paleochannels (3.99%) or paleochannels' sections undetected in our final mosaic (3.62%). The final mosaic allowed a detailed view of submerged valleys (including previously unmapped channels) distributed up to areas deeper than 100 m using free of charge, medium-resolution satellite imagery. Some of these channels are known fishing grounds and fish spawning aggregation areas, making them priority zones for management and conservation efforts. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study applying Landsat imagery to map paleochannels in submerged areas, and most importantly, in areas deeper than 30 m. We believe this research can help focusing future mapping efforts and may advance the general knowledge of the area.

TI  - Experimental Evaluation and Consistency Comparison of UAV Multispectral Minisensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has received increasing attention in remote sensing, vegetation monitoring, vegetation index (VI) mapping, precision agriculture, etc. It has many advantages, such as high spatial resolution, instant information acquisition, convenient operation, high maneuverability, freedom from cloud interference, and low cost. Nowadays, different types of UAV-based multispectral minisensors are used to obtain either surface reflectance or digital number (DN) values. Both the reflectance and DN values can be used to calculate VIs. The consistency and accuracy of spectral data and VIs obtained from these sensors have important application value. In this research, we analyzed the earth observation capabilities of the Parrot Sequoia (Sequoia) and DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral (P4M) sensors using different combinations of correlation coefficients and accuracy assessments. The research method was mainly focused on three aspects: (1) consistency of spectral values, (2) consistency of VI products, and (3) accuracy of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). UAV images in different resolutions were collected using these sensors, and ground points with reflectance values were recorded using an Analytical Spectral Devices handheld spectroradiometer (ASD). The average spectral values and VIs of those sensors were compared using different regions of interest (ROIs). Similarly, the NDVI products of those sensors were compared with ground point NDVI (ASD-NDVI). The results show that Sequoia and P4M are highly correlated in the green, red, red edge, and near-infrared bands (correlation coefficient (R-2) > 0.90). The results also show that Sequoia and P4M are highly correlated in different VIs; among them, NDVI has the highest correlation (R-2> 0.98). In comparison with ground point NDVI (ASD-NDVI), the NDVI products obtained by both of these sensors have good accuracy (Sequoia: root-mean-square error (RMSE) < 0.07; P4M: RMSE < 0.09). This shows that the performance of different sensors can be evaluated from the consistency of spectral values, consistency of VI products, and accuracy of VIs. It is also shown that different UAV multispectral minisensors can have similar performances even though they have different spectral response functions. The findings of this study could be a good framework for analyzing the interoperability of different sensors for vegetation change analysis.

TI  - The hidden costs of desert development
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic benefits and ecological restoration are the leading drivers of desert development through man-made oasis expansion. However, the sustainability of oasis expansion in combating desertification while promoting economic growth remains unclear, though such knowledge is critical for future desert development across the globe. To address this knowledge gap, a comprehensive assessment integrating meteorological, groundwater and remote-sensing data as well as groundwater simulation datasets was conducted to evaluate the spatial-temporal changes in the desert-oasis ecotone of northwest China over the past six decades. Desert development causes a rapid decline in the surrounding groundwater table, increases pollution in soil and groundwater and is associated with an increased frequency of strong sandstorms. Desert development seems to have improved the environment and promoted the economy, but there is a huge cost for the overexploitation of water resources and the transfer of pollution from surface to underground, which could cause deserts to degrade further.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the contributions of land use change and CO 2 fertilization to carbon use ef ficiency on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a key element in the vegetation carbon cycle, and determines how vegetation allocates carbon. Here, our research provides the spatio-temporal variations of CUE on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) based on ensemble simulations from 12 terrestrial ecosystem models. Moreover, the experimental design of simulations adds one time-varying driver at a time, thus quantitative analysis of the response of CUE to climate factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation and radiation), land use and land cover change (LULCC), and CO2 fertilization can be investigated. Results show that average CUE value of the multi-model simulations (0.583 +/- 0.064) on the TP is slightly lower than that derived from the satellite-based product, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (0.646). However, CUE varies greatly among models due to differences in simulating plant photosynthetic productivity and respiratory rate, with range of 0.489-0.661. LULCC and CO2 fertilization contribute 4.24% and 0.79% of the annual mean CUE, respectively. Among the climatic factors, temperature and precipitation have positive correlations with CUE over most areas of the TP while solar radiation shows a negative impact.

TI  - Classification of Urban Area Using Multispectral Indices for Urban Planning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accelerating trend of global urbanization accompanying population growth makes frequently updated land use and land cover (LULC) maps critical. LULC maps have been widely created through the classification of remotely sensed imagery. Maps of urban areas have been both dichotomous (urban or non-urban) and entailing of discrete urban types. This study incorporated multispectral built-up indices, designed to enhance satellite imagery, for introducing new urban classification schemes. The indices examined are the new built-up index (NBI), the built-up area extraction index (BAEI), and the normalized difference concrete condition index (NDCCI). Landsat Level-2 data covering the city of Miami, FL, USA was leveraged with geographic data from the Florida Geospatial Data Library and Florida Department of Environmental Protection to develop and validate new methods of supervised and unsupervised classification of urban area. NBI was used to extract discrete urban features through object-oriented image analysis. BAEI was found to possess properties for visualizing and tracking urban development as a low-high gradient. NDCCI was composited with NBI and BAEI as the basis for a robust urban intensity classification scheme superior to that of the United States Geological Survey National Land Cover Database 2016. BAEI, implemented as a shadow index, was incorporated in a novel infill geosimulation of high-rise construction. The findings suggest that the proposed classification schemes are advantageous to the process of creating more detailed cartography in response to the increasing global demand.

TI  - Measuring Functional Urban Shrinkage with Multi-Source Geospatial Big Data: A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Megaregion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the shrinking cities experience an unbalanced deurbanization across different urban areas in cities. However, traditional ways of measuring urban shrinkage are focused on tracking population loss at the city level and are unable to capture the spatially heterogeneous shrinking patterns inside a city. Consequently, the spatial mechanism and patterns of urban shrinkage inside a city remain less understood, which is unhelpful for developing accommodation strategies for shrinkage. The smart city initiatives and practices have provided a rich pool of geospatial big data resources and technologies to tackle the complexity of urban systems. Given this context, we propose a new measure for the delineation of shrinking areas within cities by introducing a new concept of functional urban shrinkage, which aims to capture the mismatch between urban built-up areas and the areas where significantly intensive human activities take place. Taking advantage of a data fusion approach to integrating multi-source geospatial big data and survey data, a general analytical framework is developed to construct functional shrinkage measures. Specifically, Landsat-8 remote sensing images were used for extracting urban built-up areas by supervised neural network classifications and Geographic Information System tools, while cellular signaling data from China Unicom Inc. was used to depict human activity areas generated by spatial clustering methods. Combining geospatial big data with urban land-use functions obtained from land surveys and Points-Of-Interests data, the framework further enables the comparison between cities from dimensions characterized by indices of spatial and urban functional characteristics and the landscape fragmentation; thus, it has the capacity to facilitate an in-depth investigation of fundamental causes and internal mechanisms of urban shrinkage. With a case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megaregion using data from various sources collected for the year of 2018, we demonstrate the validity of this approach and its potential generalizability for other spatial contexts in facilitating timely and better-informed planning decision support.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Shortwave Radiation From Himawari-8 Satellite Data Based on a Combination of Radiative Transfer and Deep Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we developed a hybrid method to estimate surface shortwave radiation (SSR) for the new-generation Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. This hybrid method combines the advantages of a deep neural network (DNN) with high speed and radiative transfer model (RTM) to achieve high accuracy: the RTM provides training data for the DNN under various cloud and aerosol conditions (including heavy aerosol loadings). Moreover, our hybrid method can simultaneously output the byproducts of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), ultraviolet A (UVA), and Ultraviolet B (UVB), the direct and diffuse components at the surface, and the upward solar radiation at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA). The trained DNN was applied to the Himawari-8 satellite atmospheric products for 2016 and comprehensively validated using a total of 118 stations from four networks located in the full-disk regions of Himawari-8. The results showed an RMSE of 125.9 Wm(-2) for instantaneous SSR, 105.4 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR, 31.9 Wm(-2) for daily SSR, and respective mean bias error (MBE) scores of 8.1, 27.6, and 12.3 Wm(-2). The hybrid method developed in this study performed well, achieving high accuracy and high speed, and it is capable of providing near-real-time SSR estimates for many applied energy fields.

TI  - Threshold Vegetation Greenness under Water Balance in Different Desert Areas over the Silk Road Economic Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of dryland vegetation growth over the Silk Road Economic Belt is under threat of water shortage, and the determination of water carrying capacity for vegetation is critically essential to balance water supply and water demand for the maintenance of existing ecosystems. To better understand how and why vegetation growth varies in different desert areas, this study first analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, we investigated the relationship between NDVI and climatic factors (precipitation, soil water content, air temperature, evapotranspiration), and estimated the threshold NDVI under water balance in different desert areas. Results showed that the higher NDVI was mainly distributed in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Azerbaijan, and it increased in approximately 53% of desert areas from 1982 to 2015 in the whole study region. The mean annual NDVI showed a simultaneous increasing trend in all desert areas from 1982 to 1994, and decreased significantly only in the cold arid desert area (p< 0.01, -0.0067 decade(-1)) or had no significant change in other desert areas after 1994 (p> 0.01). The climate condition generally appeared as a warming and drying trend in the past 34 years, with varied changing rates in different desert areas. NDVI presented a strong positive relationship with both precipitation and evapotranspiration in most desert areas. The threshold values of the mean annual NDVI under water balance between 1982 and 2015 were approximately 0.1041 (hot arid desert), 0.1337 (cold arid desert), 0.1346 (cold arid semi-desert), 0.0951 (hot arid desert semi-desert), 0.0776 (polar desert tundra), 0.1071 (hot arid desert shrub), 0.1377 (cold arid desert steppe), and 0.0701 (polar desert steppe), respectively. The responses of these threshold values to precipitation were all positive in different desert areas. These results provide an enhanced understanding of vegetation dynamics and ecological conservation, which are of great importance to implementing adaptation and mitigation measures for terrestrial ecosystems over the Silk Road Economic Belt.

TI  - The age of surface-exposed ice along the northern margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Each summer, surface melting of the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet exposes a distinctive visible stratigraphy that is related to past variability in subaerial dust deposition across the accumulation zone and subsequent ice flow toward the margin. Here we map this surface stratigraphy along the northern margin of the ice sheet using mosaicked Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery from the end of the 2019 melt season and finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for smaller regions of interest. We trace three distinct transitions in apparent dust concentration and the top of a darker basal layer. The three dust transitions have been identified previously as representing late-Pleistocene climatic transitions, allowing us to develop a coarse margin chronostratigraphy for northern Greenland. Substantial folding of late-Pleistocene stratigraphy is observed but uncommon. The oldest conformal surface-exposed ice in northern Greenland is likely located adjacent to Warming Land and may be up to similar to 55 thousand years old. Basal ice is commonly exposed hundreds of metres from the ice margin and may indicate a widespread frozen basal thermal state. We conclude that the ice margin across northern Greenland offers multiple opportunities to recover paleoclimatically distinct ice relative to previously studied regions in southwestern Greenland.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING (RS) MONITORING OF MANGROVES PLANTATION AGAINST THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD (GWR) OF MAXIMUM PLANTATION IN INDUS DELTA
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was designed to monitor the growth pattern of mangroves (Rhizophora mucronata) planted by SFD in June 2013 at Kharochan island near Keti bunder and created world record for planting maximum number of plants in one day. Since, this activity was accepted by Guinness Book of World Record (GWR) that is known as GWR-II. A study was required to evaluate the impact of this task of GWR. This study was conducted using Remote Sensing Data, GIS as well as field survey of the plantation site. After about two and half years of plantation during the field survey on 24 November, 2016, it was observed that the Rhizophora mucronata, the planted species was growing well. The plants were very healthy and attained average height of 32.8 inches with several branches. Moreover, the analysis of the data collected during the field survey showed survival rate of 77.7%. Analysis of remote sensing data for the years 2013, 2015 and 2017 revealed increase in mangroves cover of 9 and 103 hectares during the 2013 to 2015 and 2015 to 2017, respectively. The increase in mangroves has also been calculated using GIS techniques and maps for different years have been prepared. It has been noticed that during field survey, Avicennia marina which is most abundant specie of Indus Delta has also grown on the plantation site with one and half year age groups of plants. Findings of the Remote sensing data as well as the field survey show that mangroves forest area has been increased.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation status of Sali River basin, a tributary of Damodar River in Bankura District, West Bengal, using satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation status of Sali River basin has been evaluated in this study applying the Landsat 8 data. Here, NDVI, EVI, GI, LAI, PVI, SI, BI and NDMI have been used to assess vegetation status (VS). Indices have been classified into five categories following natural breaks classification method. Apart from BI, all the indices represented higher value in forest cover area. Weights for all the themes and sub-themes were assigned following multi-criteria decision analysis with consistency ratio of 0.0685, and weighted overlay analysis technique had been employed for the assessment of the vegetation status. Very low, low and moderate VS was found mainly over the water body, urban and agricultural area, which is covering more than half of the basin. The rest of the area is covered with high and very high VS, representing fragmented and dense Sal forest and covering 15.81% and 22.88% basin area, respectively. Accuracy assessment and thorough field verification were done with 90.43% classification accuracy. Our result is quite similar to land use land cover map of Bhuvan, ISRO. So, keeping in the view of health of the river basin and vegetation, this area needs urgent attention to control the degradation of vegetation in a scientific way.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Change Detection Analysis for Cyclone Damage Assessment in Urban Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For disaster emergency response, timely information is critical and satellite data is a potential source for such information. High-resolution optical satellite images are often the most informative, but these are only available on cloud-free days. For some extreme weather disasters, like cyclones, access to cloud-free images is unlikely for days both before and after the main impact. In this situation, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is a unique first source of information, as it works irrespective of weather and sunlight conditions. This paper shows, in the context of the cyclone Idai that hit Mozambique in March 2019, that Change Detection between pairs of SAR data is a perfect match with weather data, and therefore captures impact from the severe cyclone. For emergency operations, the filtering of Change Detections by external data on the location of houses prior to an event allows assessment of the impact on houses as opposed to impact on the surrounding natural environment. The free availability of SAR data from Sentinel-1, with further automated processing of it, means that this analysis is a cost-effective and quick potential first indication of cyclone destruction.

TI  - Impacts of Rapid Changes of Land Cover and Intensive Human Activities on Avarga Toson Lake Area, Mongolia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Avarga Toson Lake and its surrounding area are very important for people, wildlife, and animals in Delgerkhaan Soum of Khentii Province in Eastern Mongolia. Some research has been conducted so as to explore the medical nature and characteristics of the lake and its surrounding area. However, the adverse effects of land use have neither been studied nor reported. The fact that the water catchment area is shrinking evidences clearly that findings of various real-time studies must be used effectively in the long-term by the local government and relevant authorities in order to take immediate remedial measures. Our study focused on land cover changes occurring as a result of human activities in the area, using a Landsat imageries and water indices approach to estimate the changes of land use and land cover. The aims of this study were to assess the land use and cover change that occurred between 1989 and 2018 and to define the impacting factors on the changes of water surface area in Avarga Toson Lake area, Mongolia. Findings revealed that the water surface area has decreased by 34.1% in the past 30 years. The lake water area had the weakest, positive correlation with temperature and precipitation. We did not find any indicators suggesting a relationship between lake area and climate variables. In contrast, the area was slightly correlated with socio-economic variables, such as Toson Lake area with the number of visitors (R-2= 0.89) and Burd Lake area the with number of livestocks (R-2= 0.75), respectively. Therefore, the main conclusion of this paper is that socioeconomic factors driven by land use change, policy, and institutional failure together with the existing pressure on the lake may amplify their effect of the water surface area decreasing. Additionally, even if policy adoption is relatively sufficient in the country, the public institutional capacity to implement a successful sustainable land management model regarding land access, land development, land resources protection, land market, and investments in infrastructure remains very limited.

TI  - Inter-comparison of multi-satellites and Aeronet AOD over Indian Region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols affect global as well as regional climate by interacting with solar radiations and by altering the cloud properties. Due to the scarcity of ground observations over entire India, especially over Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), satellite-based measurements provide better spatial and temporal coverage for the evaluation of aerosol optical properties. This study presents the inter-comparison of multiple satellites (MISR, MODIS, and OMI) and ground-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) for the 2010-2017 (8 years) period over IGP (Gandhi College, Jaipur, and Kanpur) region. Satellite observations are spatially and temporally collocated by an average of 50 x 50 km square box and +/- 30 minutes, respectively. Results indicate a higher correlation with MODIS (R-2 = 0.7 at Gandhi College) followed by MISR and OMI AOD. Irrespective of few observations (219) at Jaipur, MISR shows the highest percentage (58%) of data points within the error envelope because of multiple angle viewing and spectral capability gives the accurate information in high reflecting desert areas. MISR and OMI have a systematic negative bias trend for higher AOD at all WA sites, while MODIS has a negative bias over the Jaipur region only. The temporal analysis reveals the higher concentration of fine mode aerosols captured by MISR and MODIS in December month over Gandhi College and Kanpur region, whereas Jaipur is over-loading with coarser aerosols during April to June month from the Thar Desert and Middle East dust storms. Seasonal distribution over the IGP region indicates higher AOD in summer owing to dust storms. Inter-comparison shows that MODIS has higher seasonal AOD as compared to MISR. The spatial correlation between MODIS and MISR is high during the summer and winter seasons. The OMI sensor performance over the IGP region has not been found to match with existing patterns. These findings are useful in the context of selecting the most reliable satellite AOD products for future studies.

TI  - Seasonal Cycles of Phytoplankton Expressed by Sine Equations Using the Daily Climatology from Satellite-Retrieved Chlorophyll-a Concentration (1997-2019) Over Global Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global coverage of Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) has been continuously available from ocean color satellite sensors since September 1997 and the Chl-a data (1997-2019) were used to produce a climatological dataset by averaging Chl-a values at same locations and same day of year. The constructed climatology can remarkably reduce the variability of satellite data and clearly exhibit the seasonal cycles, demonstrating that the growth and decay of phytoplankton recurs with similarly seasonal cycles year after year. As the shapes of time series of the climatology exhibit strong periodical change, we wonder whether the seasonality of Chl-a can be expressed by a mathematic equation. Our results show that sinusoid functions are suitable to describe cyclical variations of data in time series and patterns of the daily climatology can be matched by sine equations with parameters of mean, amplitude, phase, and frequency. Three types of sine equations were used to match the climatological Chl-a with Mean Relative Differences (MRD) of 7.1%, 4.5%, and 3.3%, respectively. The sine equation with four sinusoids can modulate the shapes of the fitted values to match various patterns of climatology with small MRD values (less than 5%) in about 90% of global oceans. The fitted values can reflect an overall pattern of seasonal cycles of Chl-a which can be taken as a time series of biomass baseline for describing the state of seasonal variations of phytoplankton. The amplitude images, the spatial patterns of seasonal variations of phytoplankton, can be used to identify the transition zone chlorophyll fronts. The timing of phytoplankton blooms is identified by the biggest peak of the fitted values and used to classify oceans as different bloom seasons, indicating that blooms occur in all four seasons with regional features. In global oceans within latitude domains (48 degrees N-48 degrees S), blooms occupy approximately half of the ocean (50.6%) during boreal winter (December-February) in the northern hemisphere and more than half (58.0%) during austral winter (June-August) in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, the sine equation can be used to match the daily Chl-a climatology and the fitted values can reflect the seasonal cycles of phytoplankton, which can be used to investigate the underlying phenological characteristics.

TI  - Contrasting hydrological seasonality with latitude in the South American Chaco: The roles of climate and vegetation activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest dry forest of the continent, the South American Chaco covers a broad latitudinal gradient (18 degrees-33 degrees S) with extremely flat topography, homogeneous vegetation structure and similar summer-rain regime. Despite high deforestation rates, Chaco is still dominated by native forests, offering a unique opportunity to explore the role of biophysical controls dictated by latitudinal gradients on its hydrological functioning. In this study, we used GRACE-derived satellite data, climatic information and river flow records to analyse the seasonality of total water storage and its relationship with climatic factors and plant activity across the whole latitudinal gradient of the Chaco region. Our results showed a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards the southern and more temperate portion in despite similar rainfall seasonality. Mean seasonal fluctuation of water storage was three times higher (119.1 +/- 46.0 vs. 38.6 +/- 12.4 mm year(-1)) for the northern (< 26 degrees S) than for the southern Chaco portion (> 26 degrees S), a pattern that matched the river flow seasonality of the main rivers of the region. A higher temporal coupling of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration towards the south appears to drive the observed latitudinal hydrological shift, high-lighting the importance of atmospheric water demand and plant activity regulating the water cycle at Chaco regional scale.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-1 Surface Water Mapping Algorithms and Radiometric Terrain Correction Processing in Southeast Asia Utilizing Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing plays an important role in the monitoring of surface water for historical analysis and near real-time applications. Due to its cloud penetrating capability, many studies have focused on providing efficient and high quality methods for surface water mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, few studies have explored the effects of SAR pre-processing steps used and the subsequent results as inputs into surface water mapping algorithms. This study leverages the Google Earth Engine to compare two unsupervised histogram-based thresholding surface water mapping algorithms utilizing two distinct pre-processed Sentinel-1 SAR datasets, specifically one with and one without terrain correction. The resulting surface water maps from the four different collections were validated with user-interpreted samples from high-resolution Planet Scope data. It was found that the overall accuracy from the four collections ranged from 92% to 95% with Cohen's Kappa coefficients ranging from 0.7999 to 0.8427. The thresholding algorithm that samples a histogram based on water edge information performed best with a maximum accuracy of 95%. While the accuracies varied between methods it was found that there is no statistical significant difference between the errors of the different collections. Furthermore, the surface water maps generated from the terrain corrected data resulted in a intersection over union metrics of 95.8%-96.4%, showing greater spatial agreement, as compared to 92.3%-93.1% intersection over union using the non-terrain corrected data. Overall, it was found that algorithms using terrain correction yield higher overall accuracy and yielded a greater spatial agreement between methods. However, differences between the approaches presented in this paper were not found to be significant suggesting both methods are valid for generating accurate surface water maps. High accuracy surface water maps are critical to disaster planning and response efforts, thus results from this study can help inform SAR data users on the pre-processing steps needed and its effects as inputs on algorithms for surface water mapping applications.

TI  - Volcano morphology as an indicator of stress orientation in the Java Volcanic Arc, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stress fields in the Earth's crust are important indicators leading to better understanding of geologic processes. One way to acquire stress data is through morphometric analysis of volcanoes. Here we evaluate 141 Quaternary-age monogenetic and polygenetic volcanoes and volcanic fields in Java, Indonesia, using a 30-m SRTM DEM, an 8-m DEMNAS, aerial photos, published geological maps, and Landsat and Google Earth satellite imagery. We analyze parameters that imply the geometry of the shallow magma plumbing system and ascent pathways: crater ellipticity and elongation axis, and the orientation of crater-breaching bisectors. The dominant trend of all of these parameters should indicate the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (sigma(Hmax)) while the minimum horizontal stress (sigma(Hmin)) should be perpendicular to it. The goal here is to estimate the principal stress axes at the time of dike emplacement, to recognize any spatial variations in stress orientations, and assess factors controlling the emplacement. The resulting orientation of sigma(Hmax) in the western part of Java is NE-SW, and the trend gradually rotates to NW-SE moving eastward. Abrupt changes in stress orientations and anomalies are also observed in the vicinity of prominent geologic structures, highlighting the influence of preexisting structures on dike emplacement and eruption characteristics. Results of the morphometric analysis of volcanoes and volcanic fields conducted in this study help to estimate the past and present stress orientations in Java, and provide valuable understanding regarding the relationship between volcanic emplacement and crustal structures, complementing other types of analysis.

TI  - Assessing the effect of fire severity on sediment connectivity in central Chile
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chilean territory is recurrently affected by severe wildfires, which drastically reduce the forest cover and promote runoff, soil erosion and slope instabilities. To understand how the geomorphic system responds to wildfires in terms of sediment dynamics, the assessment of sediment connectivity, i.e. the property describing the relationships between compartments of a geomorphic system, is crucial. This study aims to quantify the spatial linkages between fire severity and sediment connectivity to identify common patterns and driving factors. The compound use of field data and open-source satellite imagery helped to apply the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and the Index of Connectivity (IC) in the context of two consecutive wildfires, occurred in 2002 and 2015, in the Rio Toro catchment (Chile). The fire severity assessment showed that the 2002 event affected 90% of the catchment, with high severity areas representing around 70%. The 2015 wildfire instead, affected 76% of the catchment with moderate severity around 42%. Accordingly, as result of the sudden reduction in forest cover in severely affected areas, the IC changed after both wildfires with an overall increase of 1.07 and 0.54, respectively. However, only for the second disturbance, it was possible to observe a clear relationship between the RdNBR and the IC variations. The different degree of vegetation cover heterogeneity between the two pre-wildfire scenarios contributed to different fire severity and IC variability between the two disturbances. The use of open-source satellite data and the development of a weighting factor (W), to be used in IC and able to capture the land cover change driven by the wildfires, could make the application of this approach straightforward, promoting its reproducibility in other catchments for land management and risk mitigation purposes.

TI  - Utilization of Multi-Temporal Microwave Remote Sensing Data within a Geostatistical Regionalization Approach for the Derivation of Soil Texture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Models (LSM) have become indispensable tools to quantify water and nutrient fluxes in support of land management strategies or the prediction of climate change impacts. However, the utilization of LSM requires soil and vegetation parameters, which are seldom available in high spatial distribution or in an appropriate temporal frequency. As shown in recent studies, the quality of these model input parameters, especially the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of soil parameters, has a strong effect on LSM simulations. This paper assesses the potential of microwave remote sensing data for retrieving soil physical properties such as soil texture. Microwave remote sensing is able to penetrate in an imaged media (soil, vegetation), thus being capable of retrieving information beneath such a surface. In this study, airborne remote sensing data acquired at 1.3 GHz and in different polarization is utilized in conjunction with geostatistics to retrieve information about soil texture. The developed approach is validated with in-situ data from different field campaigns carried out over the TERENO test-site "North-Eastern German Lowland Observatorium". With the proposed approach a high accuracy of the retrieved soil texture with a mean RMSE of 2.42 (Mass-%) could be achieved outperforming classical deterministic and geostatistical approaches.

TI  - Towards a semi-automated mapping of Australia native invasive alien <i>Acacia</i> trees using Sentinel-2 and radiative transfer models in South Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) threaten biodiversity and critical ecosystem services worldwide. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop intervention measures to control the spread of IAPs. Efforts to control and monitor the spread of IAPs would require their current and detailed distribution over a large geographic area. Recently launched multispectral instrument on-board Sentinel-2 provides free data with good spatiotemporal and spectral resolution, compared to Landsat datasets. The Sentinel-2 dataset, therefore, can be a useful source of the IAPs spatial information required for detection and monitoring purposes. We combined Sentinel-2 data with a radiative transfer model to discriminate IAPs (Acacia mearnsii and Acacia dealbata) from surrounding native tree species in Van Reenen, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The forward mode of combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL was used to simulate reflectance corresponding to bands of Sentinel-MSI, while the PROSAIL model inversion retrieved leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll contents (CCC) of the IAPs and native species. Both reflectance and retrieved properties were used to map the distribution of the species within the study area. Our results showed that A. mearnsii and A. dealbata could be accurately discriminated from the surrounding native trees using integrated PROSAIL Sentinel-2 based model. We found that CCC- and LAI-based (% accuracy = 92.8%, 91.4% for CCC and LAI, respectively) modelling produced a higher classification accuracy than field sampling-based modelling (Accuracy = 90.2% (IAP), 82.2% (NAT) and kappa coefficient = 0.84 (IAP), 0.78 (NAT)). Simulated bands corresponding to Sentinel-2 data, on the other hand, produced species maps comparable to field sampling-based maps. Overall, the integrated PROSAIL Sentinel-2 inversion approach proved suitable for detecting and mapping IAPs over a large area. Due to the high spatiotemporal coverage of Sentinel-2, satellite images, the model developed showed the potential to contribute to the IAPs monitoring systems.

TI  - Remote Sensing Analysis of Surface Temperature from Heterogeneous Data in a Maize Field and Related Water Stress
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture aims at optimizing crop production by adapting management actions to real needs and requires that a reliable and extensive description of soil and crop conditions is available, that multispectral satellite images can provide. The purpose of the present study, based on activities carried out in 2019 on an agricultural area north of Ravenna (Italy) within the project LIFE AGROWETLANDS II, is to evaluate the potentials and limitations of freely available satellite thermal images for the identification of water stress conditions and the optimization of irrigation management practices, especially in agricultural areas and wetlands affected by saline soils and salt water capillary rise. Point field surveys and a very-high resolution thermal survey (5 cm) by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported thermal camera were performed on a maize field tentatively at every Landsat-8 passage to check land surface temperature (LST) and canopy cover (CC) estimated from satellite. Temperature measured in the soil near ground surface and from UAV flying at 100 m altitude is compared with LST estimated from satellite measurements using three conversion methods: the top of atmosphere brightness temperature based on Landsat-8 band 10 (SB) corrected to account only for surface emissivity, the radiative transfer equation (RTE) for atmosphere effects correction, and the original split window method (SW) using both Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) bands. The comparison shows discrepancies, due to extreme difference in resolution, the systematic hour of satellite passage (11 am solar time), and systematic differences between methods beside the unavoidable inaccuracy of UAV measurements. Satellite derived temperatures result usually lower than UAV measurements; SB produced the lowest values, SW the best (difference = -1.7 +/- 1.7), and RTE the median (difference = -2.7 +/- 1.6). The correlation between contemporary 30 m resolution temperature values of near pixels and corresponding tile-average temperatures was not significant, due to the purely numerical interpolation from the 100 m resolution TIRS images, whereas the time pattern along the season is consistent among methods, being correlation coefficient always greater than 0.85. Correlation coefficients among temperatures obtained from Landsat-8 by different methods are almost 1, showing that values are almost strictly related by a linear transformation. All the methods are useful to estimate water stress, since its associated Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) is, from its definition, insensitive to linear transformation of temperatures. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) maps are evaluated with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) based on the three Landsat-8 derived LSTs; the higher is LST, the lower is ETa. Resulting ETa estimates are related with LST but not strictly, due to variation in vegetation cover and soil, therefore patterns result similar but not equivalent, whereas values are dependent on the atmosphere correction method. RTE and SW result in the best methods among the tested ones and the derived ETa values result reliable and appropriate to user needs. For real time application the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), which can also be derived from more frequent Sentinel-2 passages, can be profitably used in combination or as a substitute of the CWSI.

TI  - Positive predictive value of stroke identification by ambulance clinicians in North East England: a service evaluation
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/background Accurate prehospital identification of patients who had an acute stroke enables rapid conveyance to specialist units for time-dependent treatments such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Misidentification leads to patients who had a 'stroke mimic' (SM) being inappropriately triaged to specialist units. We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of prehospital stroke identification by ambulance clinicians in the North East of England. Methods This service evaluation linked routinely collected records from a UK regional ambulance service identifying adults with any clinical impression of suspected stroke to diagnostic data from four National Health Service hospital trusts between 1 June 2013 and 31 May 2016. The reference standard for a confirmed stroke diagnosis was inclusion in Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data or a hospital diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack in Hospital Episode Statistics. PPV was calculated as a measure of diagnostic accuracy. Results Ambulance clinicians in North East England identified 5645 patients who had a suspected stroke (mean age 73.2 years, 48% male). At least one Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) symptom was documented for 93% of patients who had a suspected stroke but a positive FAST was only documented for 51%. Stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, was the final diagnosis for 3483 (62%) patients. SM (false positives) accounted for 38% of suspected strokes identified by ambulance clinicians and included a wide range of non-stroke diagnoses including infections, seizures and migraine. Discussion In this large multisite data set, identification of patients who had a stroke by ambulance clinicians had a PPV rate of 62% (95% CI 61 to 63). Most patients who had a suspected stroke had at least one FAST symptom, but failure to document a complete test was common. Training for stroke identification and SM rates need to be considered when planning service provision and capacity.

TI  - Quantifying Ground Subsidence Associated with Aquifer Overexploitation Using Space-Borne Radar Interferometry in Kabul, Afghanistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth combined with recent drought events and decades of political instability have left the residents of Kabul facing water scarcity, significantly relying on groundwater. Groundwater overexploitation might have induced various magnitudes of ground subsidence, however, to date, no comprehensive study of ground subsidence in Kabul has been conducted. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal evolution of ground deformation phenomena and its main governing processes in Kabul from 2014 to 2019 using C-Band Sentinel-1 derived Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series from both ascending and descending orbits to extract the two-dimensional (2D) surface displacement field. Four subsidence bowls were distinguished with highly variable spatial extents and deformation magnitudes over four separate aquifer basins, with the maximum value of -5.3 cm/year observed in the Upper Kabul aquifer basin. A wavelet analysis suggests that there is a strong correlation between the groundwater level variations and subsidence. Investigation of hydrogeological data further reveals that the observed subsidence could be attributed to the presence of highly compressible clayey soils. This detailed space-borne regional survey provides new insights into the main governing mechanism of land subsidence in Kabul and may direct better mitigation plans of potential hazards.

TI  - Time-series analysis of the evolution of large-scale loess landslides using InSAR and UAV photogrammetry techniques: a case study in Hongheyan, Gansu Province, Northwest China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loess landslides are a severe engineering geological problem on the Loess Plateau of China. This study relies on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry techniques to characterise a large-scale loess landslide deformation process in Northwest China. First, a total of 85 Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from March 2015 to March 2019 were used to detect the spatial displacement and characterise the pattern of deformation from presliding to postsliding. Second, three UAV flight surveys were conducted to reconstruct landslide morphology, identify scarps, cracks and fissures; and generate elevation differences. By comparing these two technologies, we found that InSAR has more advantages in the retrieval of creeping deformation, while UAV data is valuable for detecting large sudden slides. Dynamic deformation zonation maps were generated based on comprehensive analysis, and the deformation pattern of the large loess landslide was deduced. The Hongheyan landslide was induced by heavy rainfall and then gradually became suspended owing to the topography effect. Recently, the western part of the slope showed a clear accelerating trend. This evolution provides comprehensive kinematic information for local governments to make further intensive observations or take effective precautions.

TI  - Cloud removal in Sentinel-2 imagery using a deep residual neural network and SAR-optical data fusion
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing imagery is at the core of many Earth observation activities. The regular, consistent and global-scale nature of the satellite data is exploited in many applications, such as cropland monitoring, climate change assessment, land-cover and land-use classification, and disaster assessment. However, one main problem severely affects the temporal and spatial availability of surface observations, namely cloud cover. The task of removing clouds from optical images has been subject of studies since decades. The advent of the Big Data era in satellite remote sensing opens new possibilities for tackling the problem using powerful data-driven deep learning methods.In this paper, a deep residual neural network architecture is designed to remove clouds from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. SAR-optical data fusion is used to exploit the synergistic properties of the two imaging systems to guide the image reconstruction. Additionally, a novel cloud-adaptive loss is proposed to maximize the retainment of original information. The network is trained and tested on a globally sampled dataset comprising real cloudy and cloud-free images. The proposed setup allows to remove even optically thick clouds by reconstructing an optical representation of the underlying land surface structure.

TI  - The ESA Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration: Monitoring Performance of Radar Altimeters for Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B and Jason-3 Using Transponder and Sea-Surface Calibrations with FRM Standards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the latest calibration results for the Copernicus Sentinel-3A and -3B and the Jason-3 radar altimeters as determined by the Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration (PFAC) in west Crete, Greece. Radar altimeters are used to provide operational measurements for sea surface height, significant wave height and wind speed over oceans. To maintain Fiducial Reference Measurement (FRM) status, the stability and quality of altimetry products need to be continuously monitored throughout the operational phase of each altimeter. External and independent calibration and validation facilities provide an objective assessment of the altimeter's performance by comparing satellite observations with ground-truth and in-situ measurements and infrastructures. Three independent methods are employed in the PFAC: Range calibration using a transponder, sea-surface calibration relying upon sea-surface Cal/Val sites, and crossover analysis. Procedures to determine FRM uncertainties for Cal/Val results have been demonstrated for each calibration. Biases for Sentinel-3A Passes No. 14, 278 and 335, Sentinel-3B Passes No. 14, 71 and 335, as well as for Jason-3 Passes No. 18 and No. 109 are given. Diverse calibration results by various techniques, infrastructure and settings are presented. Finally, upgrades to the PFAC in support of the Copernicus Sentinel-6 'Michael Freilich', due to launch in November 2020, are summarized.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3 OLCI Integrated Water Vapor Products Using Regional GNSS Measurements in Crete, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is one of the essential variables in monitoring the Earth's climate. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Copernicus Sentinel-3 missions measures the Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) column over land and ocean surfaces. Post-launch calibration and validation of satellite measurements constitutes a key process in the operational phase of Earth observation satellites. This work presents the external and independent validation of OLCI-A IWV product using the regional network of continuously operating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) comprised 10 stations distributed over the island of Crete in the eastern Mediterranean. The Sentinel-3A/-3B OLCI imagery that captures in a single scene the entire area of Crete has been examined. For each OLCI image, the IWV value of cloud-free pixels containing the GNSS stations have been derived and compared against simultaneous GNSS-derived measurements. The absolute as well as the relative bias between OLCI-A and OLCI-B IWV measurements have been determined. There is a good agreement between OLCI and GNSS with a bias of -0.57 mm +/- 2.90 mm for OLCI(A) and +2.42 +/- 3.41 mm for OLCI(B). The results of this regional validation activity are compared against other studies and the regular validation carried out at the Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Center. This work concludes that the accuracy of the OLCI IWV products is within its design requirements. The potential synergy between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 IWV products is also discussed.

TI  - Estimation of forest cover change using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery in Georgia (the Caucasus)
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our objective was to use Sentinel-2A multispectral data in order to cost-effectively detect change in forest cover in Georgia (the Caucasus). Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to fit forest cover measures to Sentinel-2A spectral band values modified using different topographic correction methods. Canopy closure (calculated from upward-looking fisheye photographs taken beneath forest canopy) was the best forest cover measure accounted for by the Sentinel-2 spectral data that were topographically corrected using the Minnaert Correction (R-2 = 0.882). Spectral bands best explaining canopy closure were Band 3 (Green), Band 8 (NIR) and Band 12 (SWIR). Our model is able to reasonably detect spatial and temporal changes in canopy closure, even in highly rugged terrain and diverse vegetation cover, and it has potential to be improved to the extent that it can be applied by managers of natural resources. Based on free open source applications in combination with cheap gadgets our approach might play an important role in monitoring the forests of countries with low economic indicators.

TI  - Using Growing-Season Time Series Coherence for Improved Peatland Mapping: Comparing the Contributions of Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 Coherence in Full and Partial Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences in topographic structure, vegetation structure, and surface wetness exist between peatland classes, making active remote sensing techniques such as SAR and LiDAR promising for peatland mapping. As the timing of green-up, senescence, and hydrologic conditions vary differently in peatland classes, and in comparison with upland classes, full growing-season time series SAR imagery was expected to produce higher accuracy classification results than using only a few select SAR images. Both interferometric coherence, amplitude and difference in amplitude time series datasets were assessed, as it was hypothesized that these may be able to capture subtle changes in phenology and hydrology, which in turn differentiate classes throughout a growing season. Groups of variables were compared for their effectiveness in Random Forest classification for both Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2. The Shapley value was used to determine the contribution of each group of variables in thirty scenarios, and Mean Decrease in Accuracy was compared to evaluate its ability to rank variables by relative importance. Despite being dual-pol, the results of classifications using Sentinel-1 coherence (12-day repeat) were significantly better than using fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 coherence (24-day repeat), likely owing to the difference in baseline and specific acquisition dates of the data in this study. Overall, full growing season Sentinel-1 coherence time series produced higher accuracy results than fully polarimetric quad pol RADARSAT-2 coherence amplitude, difference in amplitude and polarimetric decomposition time series. Using a full growing season of time-series imagery in classification resulted in higher accuracy than using a few dates over a growing season. Using mean decrease in accuracy to rank and reduce variables resulted in a weaker classification than if the entire time series is used.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual Scientific Meeting of the Southeastern-Surgical-Congress (SESC)
CL  - New Orleans, LA
AB  - Background Current treatment guidelines for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with mastectomy recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In the modern era, there is a trend toward minimizing invasive staging and treatment of the axilla. In this study, we seek to determine the role of SLNB in patients undergoing mastectomy for the treatment of DCIS.Methods Patients undergoing mastectomy were identified from our institution's SLNB database from 2012 to 2016. Patients were included if core needle biopsy demonstrated DCIS. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and pathologic variables were abstracted.Results Of 187 patients undergoing mastectomy with SLNB from 2012 to 2016 for DCIS or invasive ductal carcinoma, 39 (21%) were diagnosed with DCIS on core biopsy. Mean age was 57 years. 70% were Caucasian, 18% were African American, 8% were Asian, and the remaining 5% were unknown. One patient (3%) had positive nodes on SLNB and underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Of those with DCIS on core biopsy, 14 (36%) were upstaged to invasive disease on final surgical pathology, including the patient with positive SLNB. Of the remaining 25 (64%) patients with DCIS on final pathology, 0 (0%) had SLNB positivity.Conclusion Only 3% of patients with DCIS undergoing mastectomy were found to have SLN metastases. However, a significant number of patients (36%) were upstaged due to invasive cancer. Although limited by a small sample size, our results suggest that SLNB should still be recommended to patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS on core needle biopsy due to the high rate of upstage rate to invasive disease.

TI  - Shoreline Extraction from WorldView2 Satellite Data in the Presence of Foam Pixels Using Multispectral Classification Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Foam is often present in satellite images of coastal areas and can lead to serious errors in the detection of shorelines especially when processing high spatial resolution images (<20 m). This study focuses on shoreline extraction and shoreline evolution using high spatial resolution satellite images in the presence of foam. A multispectral supervised classification technique is selected, namely the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and applied with three classes which are land, foam and water. The merging of water and foam classes followed by a segmentation procedure enables the separation of land and ocean pixels. The performance of the method is evaluated using a validation dataset acquired on two study areas (south and north of the bay of Sendai-Japan). On each site, WorldView-2 multispectral images (eight bands, 2 m resolution) were acquired before and after the Fukushima tsunami generated by the Tohoku earthquake in 2011. The consideration of the foam class enables the false negative error to be reduced by a factor of three. The SVM method is also compared with four other classification methods, namely Euclidian Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Maximum Likelihood, and Neuronal Network. The SVM method appears to be the most efficient to determine the erosion and the accretion resulting from the tsunami, which are societal issues for littoral management purposes.

TI  - Forest browning trends in response to drought in a highly threatened mediterranean landscape of South America
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is widely studied throughout the world. However, a less evident issue is the effect of climate change and drought on remnants of native forests. The objective of this work was to understand the geographic variations in resistance to drought of the Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests of central Chile. These forests have been historically reduced and fragmented and in recent years were subjected to the most prolonged drought occurred between 2010 and 2017. Using data from the MODIS satellite sensor, temporal trends in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were quantified. We related these trends with different environmental variables to understand the effects of geographical variation and forest type as indicators of resistance to drought. We observed a significant direct effect of drought, attributable to the reduced precipitation in central Chile, and a significantly reduced NDVI in near one-third of the region forests (browning). However, NDVI and therefore forest productivity were more stable in some mesic sites such as ravine bottoms, but not on south-facing slopes. This suggests that under a regime of reduced precipitations, a greater available soil humidity would be a more important factor than the fact of receiving less solar radiation. Finally, the highest degree of browning was observed in semi-arid sclerophyllous forest dominated by species tolerant to drought. Our findings emphasize the need to consider topographic site conditions to adequately assess forest productivity and vulnerability where local wet conditions could provide drought refuges. This recent drought may be analogous to forecasted warmer and drier climate conditions with more frequent and severe droughts, so our results may serve as a general framework for climate-smart decisions in highly threatened forest restoration and conservation.

TI  - Analyzing spatial variations of relationships between Land Surface Temperature and some remotely sensed indices in different land uses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surveying and remote sensing are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal variations of basic physical properties in accordance with different land uses. Guiding land managers, decision makers, and planners on the implementing mitigation strategies of adverse Land Surface Temperature (LST) impacts is accordingly important. However, studying the spatial variation of LST in connection with some important environmental variables is lacked. To this end, two statistical techniques viz. Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used along with Landsat data for July 2016 to explore spatial relationships between LST and some environmental variables in the industrialized Shazand Watershed, Iran. The models included individual or/and different combinations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Differenced Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and albedo. Results revealed that all GWR models indicated better prediction with smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), higher adjusted R-2 compared to OLS, and provided insights into the spatially varied relationships between LST and the study environmental variables. Furthermore, the performance of bivariable factor analyses was better than that of multivariable models. Bivariable models developed using NDWI, NDVI, and NDBI had the best performance achieved higher adjusted R-2 and lower AIC for both OLS and GWR methods.

TI  - Land use and land cover change detection using geospatial techniques in the Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring of land use land cover (LULC) changes in the Himalayas is vital for sustainable development, planning and management. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, the study is an attempt to monitor the changes in LULC patterns of Rani Khola watershed of Sikkim Himalaya for the periods 1988-1996, 1996-2008 and 2008-2017. Images from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Sentinel 2A (Multispectral Instrument) MSI data were used to extract land cover maps. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was applied to prepare LULC maps of the watershed. The accuracy of the classified map was assessed using a High Resolution Planet scope image and ground realities have been verified and ascertained through field observations and site specific interviews. As a result of policy changes and traditional agroforestry systems, LULC in the study watershed has undergone a series of complicated changes over the past three decades. Six major LULC classes viz; agriculture, barren land, built-up area, dense forest, open forests and water bodies have been identified and indicate that major land use in the watershed is forestry. Results shows, dense forest, built-up area and water bodies have increased by 16.40% (41.76 km(2)), 2.13% (5.41 km(2)) and 0.11% (0.28 km(2)) while open forest, agriculture and barren land have decreased by -13.98% (-35.59 km(2)), 2.83% (-7.22 km(2)) and -1.82% (0.4.64 km(2)) respectively. The analysis and findings of the study highlights important policy implications for the sustainable LULC management in the Rani Khola watershed of the Sikkim Himalaya.

TI  - Assessing Machine Learning Based Supervised Classifiers For Built-Up Impervious Surface Area Extraction From Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development concept requires a way forward towards smarter and easier urban development. But due to unintended urbanization, which contributes to increased impervious surface areas with several environmental issues. There was a requirement to assess and map the urban built-up impervious areas for solving various socio-environmental issues. This work attempts to evaluate and implement machine learning (ML) based supervised classifiers to semi-automate the process for extraction, quantification and mapping of urban built-up impervious areas. The work emphasised on the usage of freely available open-source high-resolution satellite datasets acquired from Sentinel-2 mission. Three different machine learning-based supervised classification techniques were evaluated for a better understanding of feature extraction methods along with suitable classifier for classification of urban impervious areas. It is a well-known phenomenon that an increase in the impervious surface contributes to declining of green cover. Also, a zonal analysis of extracted built-up impervious surfaces was conducted to understand the spatial configuration of the pilot study area. This zonal assessment of urban built-up impervious surfaces can be used as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development. These can serve as a valuable resource for restoring the required urban green cover for better sustainable urban development.

TI  - A direct endoscopic approach for left-sided infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy immediately after hysterectomy for endometrial cancer treatment: left dome formation (LDF)
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Endoscopic surgery for infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy has been widely accepted. Two major approaches, "transperitoneal" and "extraperitoneal", are generally used; however, they have several disadvantages. A "transperitoneal" approach to the left para-aortic region is usually indirect, often performed after wide extension of the right para-aortic region. An "extraperitoneal" approach is unsuitable when a peritoneal tear exists after a prior surgical procedure such as hysterectomy. Here, we propose a modified transperitoneal technique, "Left dome formation (LDF)," which directly provides a surgical field for left infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy even after hysterectomy. Methods The LDF procedure comprised three processes: (1) setting, (2) dissection of inframesenteric lymph nodes (step 1), and (3) dissection of infrarenal lymph nodes (step 2). Setting: two trocars were added 4 cm bilateral to the low-mid abdominal trocar that was used in prior hysterectomy. Step 1: The posterior layer of the renal fascia along with the left ureter and left ovarian vessel were separated from the left common iliac artery and iliopsoas. Left inframesentric nodes were removed from the surgical field. Step 2: The left ureter was isolated from the posterior renal fascia, and the dome was expanded cranially to the left renal vein, with the ovarian vein always visualizable at the dome ceiling. Left infrarenal nodes were removed. Results We applied LDF to ten endometrial cancer patients, recommended for additional dissection of para-aortic nodes based on intraoperative evaluation using the laparoscopically removed uterus. The operative time and number of removed lymph nodes in Step 1 and Step 2 were 28.8 (20-49) min and 5.3 (2-10) and 54.6 (52-70) min and 6.5 (1-11), respectively. Blood loss was below 50 ml. No serious organ injury occurred during procedures. Conclusion Since the left ureter is always observable, LDF procedure facilitates effective surgery to overcome the anatomical complexity of the left para-aortic region and is potentially useful for sentinel node sampling.

TI  - Comparing Arctic Sea Ice Model Simulations to Satellite Observations by Multiscale Directional Analysis of Linear Kinematic Features
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice models have become essential components of weather, climate, and ocean models. A realistic representation of sea ice affects the reliability of process representation, environmental forecast, and climate projections. Realistic simulations of sea ice kinematics require the consideration of both large-scale and finescale geomorphological structures such as linear kinematic features (LKF). We propose a multiscale directional analysis (MDA) that diagnoses the spatial characteristics of LKFs. The MDA is different from previous analyses in that it (i) does not detect LKFs as objects, (ii) takes into account the width of LKFs, and (iii) estimates scale-dependent orientation and intersection angles. The MDA is applied to pairs of deformation fields derived from satellite remote sensing data and from a numerical model simulation with a horizontal grid spacing of similar to 4.5 km. The orientation and intersection angles of LKFs agree with the observations and confirm the visual impression that the intersection angles tend to be smaller in the satellite data compared to the model data. The MDA distributions can be used to compare satellite data and numerical model fields using conventional metrics such as a Euclidean distance, the Bhattacharyya coefficient, or the Earth mover's distance. The latter is found to be the most meaningful metric to compare distributions of LKF orientations and intersection angles. The MDA proposed here provides a tool to diagnose if modified sea ice rheologies lead to more realistic simulations of LKFs.

TI  - Estimating Land Use and Land Cover Change in North Central Georgia: Can Remote Sensing Observations Augment Traditional Forest Inventory Data?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the last three decades, north central Georgia has experienced significant loss in forest land and tree cover. This study revealed the temporal patterns and thematic transitions associated with this loss by augmenting traditional forest inventory data with remotely sensed observations. In the US, there is a network of field plots measured consistently through time from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, serial photo-based observations collected through image-based change estimation (ICE) methodology, and historical Landsat-based observations collected through TimeSync. The objective here was to evaluate how these three data sources could be used to best estimate land use and land cover (LULC) change. Using data collected in north central Georgia, we compared agreement between the three data sets, assessed the ability of each to yield adequately precise and temporally coherent estimates of land class status as well as detect net and transitional change, and we evaluated the effectiveness of using remotely sensed data in an auxiliary capacity to improve detection of statistically significant changes. With the exception of land cover from FIA plots, agreement between paired data sets for land use and cover was nearly 85%, and estimates of land class proportion were not significantly different for overlapping time intervals. Only the long time series of TimeSync data revealed significant change when conducting analyses over five-year intervals and aggregated land categories. Using ICE and TimeSync data through a two-phase estimator improved precision in estimates but did not achieve temporal coherence. We also show analytically that using auxiliary remotely sensed data for post-stratification for binary responses must be based on maps that are extremely accurate in order to see gains in precision. We conclude that, in order to report LULC trends in north central Georgia with adequate precision and temporal coherence, we need data collected on all the FIA plots each year over a long time series and broadly collapsed LULC classes.

TI  - The Cultural Populism of Iosif I. Kablits (Yuzov) and its Foundations
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reconstructs the cultural doctrine of the famous publicist of populism (narodnichestvo), I.I. Kablits (Yuzov). To just equate Kablits' views with the slogan of "yuzovshchina" would be a narrow interpretation of his kul'turnichestvo; the slogan is characteristic for extreme right-wing populism during the upsurge of the revolutionary populist movement (narodovol'cheskoe dvizhenie). In 1880, Kablits was the first of the legal populists to pose the question, "What is populism?" According to the publicist, "true" narodnichestvo should be based on the principle that the forms of public life of the people must be in conformity with the development level of their consciousness. The author explains Kablits' evolution from Bakunism to a peasant-centered narodnichestvo by his interpretation of the reasons for the split between the intelligentsia and the people. Kablits considered them antagonists, and defined the ultimate goal of the narodniki as the liberation of the people from the power of the "intellectualbureaucratic minority," the latter supposedly trying to subjugate the life of the masses to its will. The article analyzes the main provisions of Kablits' sociocultural concept of social transformations: apolitism, populism, and the initiative of the masses. The article identifies the differences between his program of developing the "cultural identity" of the people, on the one hand, and other populists' understanding of the tasks of "cultural work," on the other. Particular attention is paid to Kablits-Yuzov's attitude towards the problem of educating the masses. Kablits was one of the few Russian populists who opposed the idea that the foundations of the worldview of the people must be changed, arguing that this would eliminate the traditional moral values of the village, including the sense of collectivism. The author assesses how Kablits, the leading publicist of the newspaper Nedelya, contributed to the establishment of a cultural direction in narodnichestvo at the turn of the 1870s and 1880s. According to the author, Kablits played a leading role in shaping the ideology of the right flank of the cultural direction in narodnichestvo. However, the "pure" populism of Kablits turned out to be too pseudo-scientific, dogmatic and irrational to attract the democratic intelligentsia for a long time; the latter had already become disillusioned with the idea of the people as the creator of new forms of social life.

AB  - We analyze the location of the extreme northern jet of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current based on the measurements in cruise 79 of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh to the region of the Drake Passage in February-March 2020. The jet occupies a position over the slope of Tierra del Fuego Island over a depth range of 400-600 m based on the measurements along four sections using the shipborne SADCP and CTD/LADCP casts. The width of this coastal jet is about 15-20 km. It penetrates to the depths of 200-300 m. The jet follows the direction of isobaths. Velocities in the jet reach 40 cm/s. It is likely that this jet is a local one and does not continue along the entire circle around Antarctica, but based on the satellite data of the absolute dynamical topography (ADT) this jet continues into the shallow region between Tierra del Fuego and Falkland Islands.

TI  - Production externalities of shrimp aquaculture on paddy farming in coastal Bangladesh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrimp aquaculture is a fast-growing industry in many parts of the world. The expansion of the industry has raised concerns about its external impacts on the local environment and ecosystems, including agriculture. This study examines changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from Satkhira district in Bangladesh. Moreover, the study measures the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluates how this, in turn, affects paddy farm profits, using farm-level data from 316 paddy plots. Results show that the land covered by shrimp ponds almost doubled in terms of percentage of land area, expanding from 22 % in 1990 to 38 % in 2016. Soil salinity also increased significantly over the same period. Farm-level analysis shows that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds. Each additional 1-meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0.14 % increase in soil salinity in both Aman (rainfed) and Boro (irrigated) seasons. As salinity is higher in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds, the same percentage change results in a greater absolute increase in salinity levels in nearby paddy plots relative to plots located farther away. Furthermore, due to the higher salinity levels, paddy profits per hectare are relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds. On average, a 1-meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds results in a decrease in paddy profits by USD 0.31 and 0.15 per hectare in the Aman and Boro seasons, respectively. The findings of this study call for policy measures to address the externalities posed by shrimp aquaculture to paddy farmers.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An investigation was carried out to characterize and classify some soils from Wadi Qena, Eastern Desert, Egypt. Twelve representative profiles were chosen based on DEM extracted from the Landsat 8 ETM+ satellite image. The soils were moderately deep to deep in depth, well drained, slightly to strongly alkaline in soil reaction (pH 7.6 - 8.4), slight to moderate saline (EC 3.3- 15.4 dS.m(-1)). The soils were low in organic matter (0.09 - 0.65%), low in CEC (1.5-8.1 cmol (p+).kg(-1)) and calcium carbonates ranged from (1.2 - 18.2%). The results revealed that the soils were low in available N (1-21 kg.ha(-1)), low in available P (1.0 - 9 kg.ha(-1)), and low to high in available K (105 - 762 kg.ha(-1)). Further, the soils were low in available micronutrients. Soil classification of the investigated area is done according to the field survey, morphological description and soil analyses. Two soil orders, viz Entisols and Aridisols were recognized in the study area. The soils were keyed out as Typic Torripsamments and Typic Haplocalcids at subgroup level. The obtained results can be used by decision makers to focus on prospective agricultural areas and to achieve land reclamation and better agricultural production.

TI  - Misperceptions of Predominant Slum Locations? Spatial Analysis of Slum Locations in Terms of Topography Based on Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Slums are a physical expression of poverty and inequality in cities. According to the UN definition, this inequality is, e.g., reflected in the fact that slums are much more often located in hazardous zones. However, this has not yet been empirically investigated. In this study, we derive proxies from multi-sensoral high resolution remote sensing data to investigate both the location of slums and the location of slopes. We do so for seven cities on three continents. Using a chi-squared test of homogeneity, we compare the locations of formal areas with that of slums. Contrary to the perception indirectly stated in the literature, we find that slums are in none of the sample cities predominantly located in these exposed areas. In five out of seven cities, the spatial share of slums on hills steeper than 10 degrees is even less than 5% of all slums. However, we also find a higher likelihood of slums occurring in these exposed areas than of formal settlements. In six out of seven sample cities, the probability that a slum is located in steep areas is higher than for a formal settlement. As slums mostly feature higher population densities, these findings reveal a clear tendency that slum residents are more likely to settle in exposed areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of metastasis in local lymph nodes (LNs) is a key factor influencing choice of therapy and prognosis in cervical and endometrial cancers; therefore, the exploration of sentinel LNs (SLNs) is highly important. Currently, however, SLN mapping requires LN biopsy for pathologic evaluation, since there are no clinical imaging approaches that can identify tumor-positive LNs in early stages. Staging lymphadenectomy poses risks, such as leg lymphedema or lymphocyst formation. Furthermore, in 80%-90% of patients, the explored LNs are ultimately tumor-free, meaning most patients are unnecessarily subjected to lymphadenectomy. Methods: Current lymphoscintigraphy methods identify only the anatomic location of the SLNs and do not provide information on their tumor status. There are no noninvasive methods to reliably identify metastases in LNs before surgery. We have developed positron lymphography (PLG), a method to detect tumor-positive LNs, in which F-18-FDG is injected interstitially into the uterine cervix on the day of surgery, and its rapid transport through the lymphatic vessels to the SLN is then visualized with dynamic PET/CT. We previously showed that PLG was able to identify metastatic LNs in animal models. Here, we present the first results from our pilot clinical trial (clinical trials identifier NCT02285192) in 23 patients with uterine or cervical cancer. On the morning of surgery, F-18-FDG was injected into the cervix, followed by an immediate dynamic PET/ CT scan of the pelvis and a delayed 1-h whole-body scan. Results: There were 3 (15%) node-positive cases on final pathologic analysis, and all of these LNs (including 1 with a focus of only 80 tumor cells) were identified by PLG. There were 2 (10%) false-positive cases with PLG, in which the final pathology of the corresponding SLNs was negative for tumor. Conclusion: This first-in-humans study of PLG in women with uterine and cervical cancer demonstrates its feasibility and its ability to identify patients with nodal metastases and warrants further evaluation in additional studies.

TI  - Ensemble Modelling of Skipjack Tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) Habitats in the Western North Pacific Using Satellite Remotely Sensed Data; a Comparative Analysis Using Machine-Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To examine skipjack tuna's habitat utilization in the western North Pacific (WNP) we used an ensemble modelling approach, which applied a fisher- derived presence-only dataset and three satellite remote-sensing predictor variables. The skipjack tuna data were compiled from daily point fishing data into monthly composites and re-gridded into a quarter degree resolution to match the environmental predictor variables, the sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll-a (SSC) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA), which were also processed at quarter degree spatial resolution. Using thesdmpackage operated in RStudio software, we constructed habitat models over a 9-month period, from March to November 2004, using 17 algorithms, with a 70:30 split of training and test data, with bootstrapping and 10 runs as parameter settings for our models. Model performance evaluation was conducted using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the point biserial correlation coefficient (COR), the true skill statistic (TSS) and Cohen's kappa (k) metrics. We analyzed the response curves for each predictor variable per algorithm, the variable importance information and the ROC plots. Ensemble predictions of habitats were weighted with the TSS metric. Model performance varied across various algorithms, with the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forests (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), and Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), showing consistently high performance than other algorithms, while the Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Bioclim (BIOC), Domain (DOM), Maxlike (MAXL), Mahalanobis Distance (MAHA) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) had lower performance. We found inter-algorithm variations in predictor variable responses. We conclude that the multi-algorithm modelling approach enabled us to assess the variability in algorithm performance, hence a data driven basis for building the ensemble model. Given the inter-algorithm variations observed, the ensemble prediction maps indicated a better habitat utilization map of skipjack tuna than would have been achieved by a single algorithm.

TI  - Integration of Digital Image Correlation of Sentinel-2 Data and Continuous GNSS for Long-Term Slope Movements Monitoring in Moderately Rapid Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the advantages and drawbacks of the application of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) data in conjunction with continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitoring. The goal is to retrieve a spatially distributed and long-term time-series of slope movements in large-scale moderately rapid landslides. The short revisit time of Sentinel-2 satellites (5 days since March 2017 and 10 days before) increases the availability of cloud and snow free satellite acquisitions of the area of interest, which is a prerequisite for the extrapolation of slope movement time-series using DIC techniques. Despite the Sentinel-2 limited spatial resolution, the derived long time-series can be integrated with-and validated by-continuous GNSS monitoring data. This allows to effectively monitor landslide movements that are too fast for the application of interferometric approaches. In this study, we used the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) digital image correlation technique by 51 Sentinel-2 MSI scenes (band 4 with 10 m spatial resolution), acquired between 19 February 2016 and 16 July 2019, to derive the slope movement time-series of the Ca' Lita earthslide-earthflow in the northern Apennines (Italy). During the period considered, the landslide experienced two to three months-long phases of moderately rapid velocity (around 10 m/month) and, in between, prolonged periods of slow movements (approx. 10 cm/month). NCC results have been integrated with, and are compared to, time series from three continuous GNSS devices located in different geomorphic zones of the landslide. On this basis, the errors and limitations associated to NCC time series are analysed and discussed together with their advantages and potentialities for assessing the spatial distribution and monitoring slope movements during moderately rapid reactivation events.

TI  - Multitemporal optical and radar metrics for wetland mapping at national level in Albania
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are highly dynamic, with many natural and anthropogenic drivers causing seasonal, periodic or permanent changes in their structure and composition. Thus, it is necessary to use time series of images for accurate classifications and monitoring. We used all available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to produce a national wetlands map for Albania. We derived different indices and temporal metrics and investigated their impacts and synergies in terms of mapping accuracy. Best results were achieved when combining Sentinel-1 with Sentinel-2 and its derived indices. We reduced systematic errors and increased the thematic resolution using morphometric characteristics and knowledge-based rules, achieving an overall accuracy of 82%. Results were also validated against field inventories. This methodology can be reproducible to other countries and can be made operational for an integrated planning that considers the food, water, and energy nexus.

TI  - Earth Observation for Settlement Mapping of Amazonian Indigenous Populations to Support SDG7
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous communities in the Amazon suffer from lack of access to basic services, such as electricity. Due to their isolation and difficult access it is challenging to acquire data on their location, numbers and needs, which would enable adequate development plans. Earth observation (EO), in combination with participatory mapping can support the creation of settlement maps as a basis for creating spatially explicit models of needs of basic services. Combining Landsat time series with SkySat and PlanetScope imagery, we have mapped the location and size of these settlements and modelled the number and densities of their houses. Additionally, we have projected settlement growth by 2030 in order to assess a demand of services that will be valid in the near future. We conducted surveys in 49 communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon to acquire information on the peoples' living conditions and needs, and validated our model based on the findings. The number of buildings per cleared land had a strong linear relationship with the communities surveyed (adjusted R(2)0.8). We used this linear relationship to model the number of buildings for the complete study area as well as for the 2030 settlement projection. Combining this information with data on the living conditions of indigenous communities, we can efficiently estimate the needs of basic services for larger territories and prompt development plans according to indigenous peoples' needs and wishes.

TI  - The Application of Ground-Based and Satellite Remote Sensing for Estimation of Bio-Physiological Parameters of Wheat Grown Under Different Water Regimes
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technologies have been widely studied for the estimation of crop biometric and physiological parameters. The number of sensors and data acquisition methods have been increasing, and their evaluation is becoming a necessity. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of two remote sensing data for describing the variations of biometric and physiological parameters of durum wheat grown under different water regimes (rainfed, 50% and 100% of irrigation requirements). The experimentation was carried out in Policoro (Southern Italy) for two growing seasons. The Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images and radiometric ground-based data were acquired regularly during the growing season with plant biometric (leaf area index and dry aboveground biomass) and physiological (stomatal conductance, net assimilation, and transpiration rate) parameters. Water deficit index was closely related to plant water status and crop physiological parameters. The enhanced vegetation index showed slightly better performance than the normalized difference vegetation index when plotted against the leaf area index with R-2= 0.73. The overall results indicated that the ground-based vegetation indices were in good agreement with the satellite-based indices. The main constraint for effective application of satellite-based indices remains the presence of clouds during the acquisition time, which is particularly relevant for winter-spring crops. Therefore, the integration of remote sensing and field data might be needed to optimize plant response under specific growing conditions and to enhance agricultural production.

TI  - The Estimation of Lava Flow Temperatures Using Landsat Night-Time Images: Case Studies from Eruptions of Mt. Etna and Stromboli (Sicily, Italy), Kilauea (Hawaii Island), and Eyjafjallajokull and Holuhraun (Iceland)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite-based remote sensing to investigate volcanic eruptions is a common approach for preliminary research, chiefly because a great amount of freely available data can be effectively accessed. Here, Landsat 4-5TM, 7ETM+, and 8OLI night-time satellite images are used to estimate lava flow temperatures and radiation heat fluxes from selected volcanic eruptions worldwide. After retrieving the spectral radiance, the pixel values were transformed into temperatures using the calculated calibration constants. Results showed that the TIR and SWIR bands were saturated and unable to detect temperatures over the active lava flows. However, temperatures were effectively detected over the active lava flows in the range similar to 500-1060 degrees C applying the NIR-, red-, green- or blue-band. Application of the panchromatic band with 15 m resolution also revealed details of lava flow morphology. The calculated radiant heat flux for the lava flows accords with increasing cooling either with slope or with distance from the vent.

TI  - Synergy of Active and Passive Remote Sensing Data for Effective Mapping of Oil Palm Plantation in Malaysia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is recognized as a golden crop, as it produces the highest oil yield among oil seed crops. Malaysia is the world's second largest producer of palm oil; 16% of its land is planted with oil palm. To cope with the ever-increasing global demand on edible oil, additional areas of oil palm are forecast to increase globally by 12 to 19 Mha by 2050. Multisensor remote sensing plays an important role in providing relevant, timely, and accurate information that can be developed into a plantation monitoring system to optimize production and sustainability. The aim of this study was to simultaneously exploit the synthetic aperture radar ALOS PALSAR 2, a form of microwave remote sensing, in combination with visible (red) data from Landsat Thematic Mapper to obtain a holistic view of a plantation. A manipulation of the horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV) polarizations of ALOS PALSAR data detected oil palm trees and water bodies, while the red spectra L-band from Landsat data (optical) could effectively identify built up areas and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization from Sentinel C-band data detected bare land. These techniques produced an oil palm area classification with overall accuracies of 98.36% and 0.78 kappa coefficient for Peninsular Malaysia. The total oil palm area in Peninsular Malaysia was estimated to be about 3.48% higher than the value reported by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The over estimation may be due the MPOB's statistics that do not include unregistered small holder oil palm plantations. In this study, we were able to discriminate most of the rubber areas.

TI  - Evolution of photodynamic medicine based on fluorescence image-guided diagnosis using indocyanine green and 5-aminolevulinic acid
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - New diagnostic techniques based on photodynamic medicine, such as near-infrared fluorescence using indocyanine green (NIR-ICG) and 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic diagnosis (ALA-PDD), are aiding navigation tasks across various fields of surgery. Specifically, NIR-ICG is being used for the intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes or blood vessels in organ resection and for blood flow evaluation in surgery. These ICG-fluorescent imaging techniques could provide an additional and potentially valuable way to identify vascular and lymphatic structures in surrounding tissue. 5-Aminolevulinic acid is a precursor of a photosensitizing substance with affinity for tumors; thus, diagnostic laparoscopy using ALA-PDD in combination should improve the accuracy of detecting peritoneal dissemination in patients with advanced gastric cancer. The ability to overlay fluorescent imaging with conventional color images in real time using ALA-PDD and NIR with ICG would be of immense benefit to surgeons, providing good visualization and detection of target lesions not seen with the naked eye. A multi-center clinical study examining the safety and efficacy of ALA-PDD during laparoscopic examination for patients with advanced gastric cancer is currently underway in the form of doctor-initiated trials, and further verification studies will be conducted. Such imaging capability could have broad potential across cancer and vascular surgery.

TI  - Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Rapid Flood Segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid response to natural hazards, such as floods, is essential to mitigate loss of life and the reduction of suffering. For emergency response teams, access to timely and accurate data is essential. Satellite imagery offers a rich source of information which can be analysed to help determine regions affected by a disaster. Much remote sensing flood analysis is semi-automated, with time consuming manual components requiring hours to complete. In this study, we present a fully automated approach to the rapid flood mapping currently carried out by many non-governmental, national and international organisations. We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method which isolates the flooded pixels in freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, requiring no optical bands and minimal pre-processing. We test a variety of CNN architectures and train our models on flood masks generated using a combination of classical semi-automated techniques and extensive manual cleaning and visual inspection. Our methodology reduces the time required to develop a flood map by 80%, while achieving strong performance over a wide range of locations and environmental conditions. Given the open-source data and the minimal image cleaning required, this methodology can also be integrated into end-to-end pipelines for more timely and continuous flood monitoring.

TI  - Use of Moon Observations for Characterization of Sentinel-3B Ocean and Land Color Instrument
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the commissioning of the Sentinel-3B satellite, a single lunar observation was performed to assess the possible use of the moon for characterization and validation of onboard instruments. The observation was carried out in stable orientation after a roll maneuver, allowing the moon to be imaged by the Earth view of instruments. Data acquired by the Ocean Land Color Instrument (OLCI) allowed inflight verification of stray-light correction (SLC) performed by the Mission Performance Centre (MPC), and assessment of radiometric behavior of instrument in comparison with lunar irradiance models performed in cooperation between European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) and European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). This paper describes the results of those activities along with the proposed update of stray-light correction developed with the use of lunar data.

TI  - Wind source potential assessment using Sentinel 1 satellite and a new forecasting model based on machine learning: A case study Sardinia islands
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean islands have the advantage of favourable climatic conditions to use different marine renewable energy sources. Remote sensing can provide data to determine wind energy production potential and observational activity to identify, assess and detect suitable points in large marine areas. In this paper, a new combined model has been developed to integrate wind speed assessment, mapping and forecasting using Sentinel 1 satellite data through images processing and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and the Bat algorithm. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images from the Sentinel 1 satellite have been used in order to detect offshore and nearshore wind potential. Particularly, Sentinel 1 images have been analysed by means of the SNAP software. Then, to extract data about wind speed and direction, a GIS software for mapping the wind climate has been used. This new methodology has been applied to the North-Central coasts of Sardinia Island and then focused on six main small islands of La Maddalena archipelago. Furthermore, ten Hot Spots (HSs) have been identified as interesting because of their high-energy potential and the possibility to be considered as sites for future implementation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Finally, the ten identified HS have been used as input data to train and test the proposed forecast model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonal Comparisons of Himawari-8 AHI and MODIS Vegetation Indices over Latitudinal Australian Grassland Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the Himawari-8 geostationary (GEO) satellite offers comparable spectral and spatial resolutions as low earth orbiting (LEO) sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors, but with hypertemporal image acquisition capability. This raises the possibility of improved monitoring of highly dynamic ecosystems, such as grasslands, including fine-scale phenology retrievals from vegetation index (VI) time series. However, identifying and understanding how GEO VI temporal profiles would be different from traditional LEO VIs need to be evaluated, especially with the new generation of geostationary satellites, with unfamiliar observation geometries not experienced with MODIS, VIIRS, or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) VI time series data. The objectives of this study were to investigate the variations in AHI reflectances and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and two-band EVI (EVI2) in relation to diurnal phase angle variations, and to compare AHI VI seasonal datasets with MODIS VIs (standard and sun and view angle-adjusted VIs) over a functional range of dry grassland sites in eastern Australia. Strong NDVI diurnal variations and negative NDVI hotspot effects were found due to differential red and NIR band sensitivities to diurnal phase angle changes. In contrast, EVI and EVI2 were nearly insensitive to diurnal phase angle variations and displayed nearly flat diurnal profiles without noticeable hotspot influences. At seasonal time scales, AHI NDVI values were consistently lower than MODIS NDVI values, while AHI EVI and EVI2 values were significantly higher than MODIS EVI and EVI2 values, respectively. We attributed the cross-sensor differences in VI patterns to the year-round smaller phase angles and backscatter observations from AHI, in which the sunlit canopies induced a positive EVI/ EVI2 response and negative NDVI response. BRDF adjustments of MODIS VIs to solar noon and to the oblique view zenith angle of AHI resulted in strong cross-sensor convergence of VI values (R-2> 0.94, mean absolute difference <0.02). These results highlight the importance of accounting for cross-sensor observation geometries for generating compatible AHI and MODIS annual VI time series. The strong agreement found in this study shows promise in cross-sensor applications and suggests that a denser time series can be formed through combined GEO and LEO measurement synergies.

TI  - Assessment the effect of atmospheric correction algorithms for monitoring PM10 concentration by using Landsat 8OLI data: A case study in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is becoming more serious, especially in developing countries like Vietnam. Air pollution is affecting human health, especially atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) or 10 mu m (PM10). Atmospheric particulate matter affect to scatter or absorb electromagnetic energy which reflect to satellite sensors. Hence, PM10 concentration can be determined based on ground measured data or satellite images. PM10 concentration is determined by multiple linear regression method using field measured value and atmospheric reflectance calculated by satellite images at the same time. The atmospheric reflectance is defined as the subtraction of top of atmospheric reflectance (TOA) and surface reflectance value. Therefore, atmospheric correction algorithm for surface reflectance plays an important role in determining PM10 concentration by using remote sensing data. In this article, the authors presented the assessment effect of atmospheric correction methods as DOS (Dark Object Subtraction), FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hyper cubes) and LaSRC (Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code) for accurate regression of PM10 concentration from satellite images. The experimental data were Landsat 8OLI of Hanoi area, Vietnam at three times on 22 January 2015; 30 May 2015 and 12 October 2016.

TI  - Suitability Evaluation of Typical Drought Index in Soil Moisture Retrieval and Monitoring Based on Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a basic agricultural parameter in the formation, transformation, and consumption of surface water resources, soil moisture has a very important influence on the vegetation growth, agricultural production, and healthy operation of regional ecosystems. The Aksu river basin is a typical semi-arid agricultural area which seasonally suffers from water shortage. Due to the lack of knowledge on soil moisture change, the water management and decision-making processes have been a difficult issue for local government. Therefore, soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing became a reasonable way to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Compared to in situ measurements, the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of soil water content is convenient and can be repetitively applied over a large area. To verify the applicability of the typical drought index to the rapid acquisition of soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions, this study simulated, compared, and validated the effectiveness of soil moisture inversion. GF-1 WFV images, Landsat 8 OLI images, and the measured soil moisture data were used to determine the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), and the Vegetation Adjusted Perpendicular Drought Index (VAPDI). First, the determination coefficients of the correlation analyses on the PDI, MPDI, VAPDI, and measured soil moisture in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth layers based on the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI images were good. Notably, in the 0-10 cm depth layers, the average determination coefficient was 0.68; all models met the accuracy requirements of soil moisture inversion. Both indicated that the drought indices based on the Near Infrared (NIR)-Red spectral space derived from the optical remote sensing images are more sensitive to soil moisture near the surface layer; however, the accuracy of retrieving the soil moisture in deep layers was slightly lower in the study area. Second, in areas of vegetation coverage, MPDI and VAPDI had a higher inversion accuracy than PDI. To a certain extent, they overcame the influence of mixed pixels on the soil moisture spectral information. VAPDI modified by Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) was not susceptible to vegetation saturation and, thus, had a higher inversion accuracy, which makes it performs better than MPDI's in vegetated areas. Third, the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture retrieved by the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI image were similar. However, the GF-1 WFV images were more sensitive to changes in the soil moisture, which reflected the actual soil moisture level covered by different vegetation. These results provide a practical reference for the dynamic monitoring of surface soil moisture, obtaining agricultural information and agricultural condition parameters in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - The magnetic field from a homogeneously magnetized cylindrical tile
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic field of a homogeneously magnetized cylindrical tile geometry, i.e. an angular section of a finite hollow cylinder, is found. The field is expressed as the product between a tensor field describing the geometrical part of the problem and a column vector holding the magnetization of the tile. Outside the tile, the tensor is identical to the demagnetization tensor. We find that four components of the tensor, N-xy, N-xz, N-yz and N-zy, can be expressed fully analytically, while the five remaining components, N-xx, N-yx, N-yy, N-zx and N-zz, contain integrals that have to be evaluated numerically. When evaluated numerically the tensor is symmetric. A comparison between the found solution, implemented in the open source magnetic framework MagTense, and a finite element calculation of the magnetic flux density of a cylindrical tile shows excellent agreement.

TI  - Snow Cover Estimation Underneath the Clouds Based on Multitemporal Correlation Analysis in Historical Time-Series Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of a snow-covered area (SCA) is often achieved by classification of imagery acquired by passive optical sensors aboard satellite platforms with high revisit frequencies [e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] required by various applications. The extraction of the SCA from optical imagery is inevitably hindered by the presence of clouds, where the surface labels (i.e., snow and no-snow) remain unknown. In the bulk of existing research, cloud pixels are either masked out without any further processing or assigned to snow/no-snow classes by performing spatial or temporal filters. The current approaches to deal with the cloud-obscuration problem are subjected to sizable uncertainties. They mostly neglect or only partially account for the temporal correlation, which undermines the full potential of long time series. We propose a novel method for estimating snow/no-snow labels beneath the clouds that leverages the multitemporal correlation between the presence/absence of snow and environmental factors including the topographical elevation, the date of acquisition (and thus the season), and the cloud-obscuration duration. The proposed method is built upon analyzing the long time series of maps derived from the single date classification of images in order to estimate the conditional probabilities of transition between the snow and no-snow classes. The probabilities are estimated as a function of the aforementioned environmental and multitemporal factors, which allow for the prediction of labels beneath the clouds in either archive or new acquisitions. Validation results on a four-year time series of daily MODIS images acquired over the Euregio region in Italian and Austrian Alps prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in assigning labels beneath the clouds.

TI  - A Simple Algorithm for Deriving an NDVI-Based Index Compatible between GEO and LEO Sensors: Capabilities and Limitations in Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary (GEO) satellite sensors provide earth observation data with a high temporal frequency and can complement low earth orbit (LEO) sensors in monitoring terrestrial vegetation. Consistency between GEO and LEO observation data is thus critical to the synergistic use of the sensors; however, mismatch between the sun-target-sensor viewing geometries in the middle-to-high latitude region and the sensor-specific spectral response functions (SRFs) introduce systematic errors into GEO-LEO products such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). If one can find a parameter in which the value is less influenced by geometric conditions and SRFs, it would be invaluable for the synergistic use of the multiple sensors. This study attempts to develop an algorithm to obtain such parameters (NDVI-based indices), which are equivalent to fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) computed from NDVI and endmember spectra. The algorithm was based on a linear mixture model (LMM) with automated computation of the parameters, i.e., endmember spectra. The algorithm was evaluated through inter-comparison between NDVI-based indices using off-nadir GEO observation data from the Himawari 8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and near-nadir LEO observation data from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as a reference over land surfaces in Japan at middle latitudes. Results showed that scene-dependent biases between the NDVI-based indices of sensors were-0.0004 +/- 0.018(mean +/- standard deviation). Small biases were observed in areas in which the fractional abundances of vegetation were likely less sensitive to the view zenith angle. Agreement between the NDVI-based indices of the sensors was, in general, better than the agreement between the NDVI values. Importantly, the developed algorithm does not require regression analysis for reducing biases between the indices. The algorithm should assist in the development of algorithms for performing inter-sensor translations of vegetation indices using the NDVI-based index as a parameter.

TI  - Performance of the Landsat 8 Provisional Aquatic Reflectance Product for Inland Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the United States Geological Service (USGS) released a new provisional product which estimates aquatic reflectance from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), called Landsat 8 Provisional Aquatic Reflectance (L8PAR). However, as indicated in the product guide, the use of this product for inland waters needs further verification and improvements. The goal of this study was to determine how the novel L8PAR product performs for different small turbid and eutrophic lakes in Northern Germany compared to in situ measurements of above water remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). For several recent scenes during our monitoring, the L8PAR product failed to produce full data for the lakes of our interest. For the best scene with in situ spectra, L8PAR was not able to retrieve any information for band 1 and not all information for bands 2, 3 and 4. The pixels with valid values for reflectance showed a weak relationship for band 2 (R(2)of 0.24) and a medium relationship for bands 3 and 4 (R(2)of 0.68 and 0.72, respectively). Compared to other atmospheric correction routines (ACOLITE, C2RCC, C2X, iCOR and L8SR), L8PAR was the only product which was not able to retrieveR(rs)for all match up samples. This work provides an evaluation of the L8PAR product for inland waterbodies. Although more analysis and validation need to be conducted, our study suggests that the L8PAR product cannot be used for small inland lakes in its current state and has to be used with care for inland waters in general.

TI  - Using Satellite Thermal-Based Evapotranspiration Time Series for Defining Management Zones and Spatial Association to Local Attributes in a Vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A well-planned irrigation management strategy is crucial for successful wine grape production and is highly dependent on accurate assessments of water stress. Precision irrigation practices may benefit from the quantification of within-field spatial variability and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET). A spatiotemporal modeling framework is proposed to delineate the vineyard into homogeneous areas (i.e., management zones) according to their ET patterns. The dataset for this study relied on ET retrievals from multiple satellite platforms, generating estimates at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions for a Vitis vinifera Pinot noir vineyard in the Central Valley of California during the growing seasons of 2015-2018. Time-series decomposition was used to deconstruct the time series of each pixel into three components: long-term trend, seasonality, and remainder, which indicates daily fluctuations. For each time-series component, a time-series clustering (TSC) algorithm was applied to partition the time series of all pixels into homogeneous groups and generate TSC maps. The TSC maps were compared for spatial similarities using the V-measure statistic. A random forest (RF) classification algorithm was used for each TSC map against six environmental variables (elevation, slope, northness, lithology, topographic wetness index, and soil type) to check for spatial association between ET-TSC maps and the local characteristics in the vineyard. Finally, the TSC maps were used as independent variables against yield (ton ha-1) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess whether the TSC maps explained yield variability. The trend and seasonality TSC maps had a moderate spatial association (V = 0.49), while the remainder showed dissimilar spatial patterns to seasonality and trend. The RF model showed high error matrix-based prediction accuracy levels ranging between 86% and 90%. For the trend and seasonality models, the most important predictor was soil type, followed by elevation, while the remainder TSC was strongly linked with northness spatial variability. The yield levels corresponding to the two clusters in all TSC were significantly different. These findings enabled spatial quantification of ET time series at different temporal scales that may benefit within-season decision-making regarding the amounts, timing, intervals, and location of irrigation. The proposed framework may be applicable to other cases in both agricultural systems and environmental modeling.

TI  - Recovery of aquifer-systems in Southwest US following 2012-2015 drought: Evidence from InSAR, GRACE and groundwater level data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the drought period 2012-2015, some of the major metropolitans and agricultural hubs within the Southwest US, including Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona, San Joaquin Valley in California, Colorado Springs in Colorado, Las Vegas in Nevada, and Albuquerque in New Mexico, experienced significant groundwater overdraft. At the end of the drought, GRACE-based estimates of total water storage show a rising trend. Also, the precipitation anomalies, considering monthly averages over 2002-2017, are positive. But, it is unclear if a pressure equilibrium is achieved within the aquifer systems, which is a requirement for residual compaction to halt. To this end, we perform a multidisciplinary multi-resolution analysis of space-borne and ground-based observations. We find that following the drought period and during wetter years, due to reduced pumping, owing to significant precipitation and the supply of surface water, groundwater levels begin to rise at all sites while compaction of aquifer-systems continues. A multi-temporal interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1A/B SAR datasets during Nov. 2014-Nov. 2017 shows subsidence rates of similar to 6 mm/yr, similar to 3 mm/yr, similar to 200-300 mm/yr, similar to 3-4 mm/yr, similar to 4-6 mm/yr, similar to 2 mm/yr affecting parts of Phoenix, Tucson, San Joaquin Valley, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, respectively, which are attributed to delayed compaction of fine-grain aquitard layer. We conclude that the aquifer-systems did not reach pressure equilibrium at least within similar to 2.5 years following the drought. The data provided here can assist policymakers and urban planners to improve groundwater management plans in the southwest and elsewhere.

TI  - Gene expression network analyses during infection with virulent and avirulent<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> strains unveil a role for fibroblasts in neutrophil recruitment and activation
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chagas disease is caused byTrypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite that has a heterogeneous population composed of a pool of strains with distinct characteristics, including variable levels of virulence. In previous work, transcriptome analyses of parasite genes after infection of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with virulent (CL Brener) and non-virulent (CL-14) clones derived from the CL strain, revealed a reduced expression of genes encoding parasite surface proteins in CL-14 compared to CL Brener during the final steps of the intracellular differentiation from amastigotes to trypomastigotes. Here we analyzed changes in the expression of host genes duringin vitroinfection of HFF cells with the CL Brener and CL-14 strains by analyzing total RNA extracted from cells at 60 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) with each strain, as well as from uninfected cells. Similar transcriptome profiles were observed at 60 hpi with both strains compared to uninfected samples. However, at 96 hpi, significant differences in the number and expression levels of several genes, particularly those involved with immune response and cytoskeleton organization, were observed. Further analyses confirmed the difference in the chemokine/cytokine signaling involved with the recruitment and activation of immune cells such as neutrophils uponT.cruziinfection. These findings suggest that infection with the virulent CL Brener strain induces a more robust inflammatory response when compared with the non-virulent CL-14 strain. Importantly, the RNA-Seq data also exposed an unexplored role of fibroblasts as sentinel cells that may act by recruiting neutrophils to the initial site of infection. This role for fibroblasts in the regulation of the inflammatory response during infection byT.cruziwas corroborated by measurements of levels of different chemokines/cytokines duringin vitroinfection and in plasma from Chagas disease patients as well as by neutrophil activation and migration assays.Author summary Trypanosoma cruziis the causative agent of Chagas disease, a debilitating and often life-threatening illness that affects 6 to 7 million people mainly in Latin America. The parasite, transmitted to humans by an insect vector, needs to invade different cells from the infected person in order to multiply and spread the infection to various organs, including the heart and the gut. In this study, we investigated how the host cell responds to the infection by analyzing changes in the expression of human genes in fibroblasts infected with the CL Brener and CL-14 strains, which are strains that present highly distinct virulent phenotypes during infection in mice. We showed that human fibroblasts build a strong immune response upon infection byT.cruziand that this response is different depending on the parasite strain: infection with the virulent CL Brener strain induces a more robust inflammatory response compared with the infection with the avirulent CL-14 strain. We also showed that, in response to the infection, fibroblasts produce molecules that can recruit and activate neutrophils, which are important immune cells that controls the infection.

TI  - Impact of Tropical Initial Water Vapor from MT-SAPHIR Observations on Medium-Range Forecasts Using the KMA Operational Model
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper representation of water vapor helps set accurate initial conditions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Water vapor levels have been observed over the tropics by the Sounder for Atmospheric Profiling of Humidity in the Inter-tropics by Radiometry (SAPHIR) on the Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite. To determine how tropical convection, which is relevant to water vapor levels, can affect medium-range forecasts in both the tropics and extratropics, we compare the differences between simulations with and without MT-SAPHIR data using the operational NWP model from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which includes a hybrid four-dimensional variational process in data assimilation. More observed water vapor in the lower tropical troposphere leads to stronger tropical convection, which is well represented in the 300 hPa velocity potential, and strengthens mean meridional circulation. Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for relative humidity, temperature, and wind fields in the tropics are reduced by up to 7%. This improvement enhances the forecast field in the middle latitudes. In particular, RMSEs are reduced by up to 3.5% in the humidity field in the extratropics. Overall, the correct simulation of tropical water vapor via MT-SAPHIR data improves medium-range forecasts in the extratropics.

TI  - Gravitrap Deployment for Adult <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Surveillance and its Impact on Dengue Cases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - House Index, Container Index, and Breteau Index are the most commonly used indices for dengue vector surveillance. However, these larval indices are a poor proxy for measuring the adult population-which is responsible for disease transmission. Information on the adult distribution and density are important for assessing transmission risk as well as for developing effective control strategies. This study introduces a new entomological index, Gravitrapaegyptiindex (GAI), which estimates the adult femaleAedes aegyptipopulation in the community and presents its association with dengue cases. Gravitraps were deployed across 34 treatment sites in Singapore from September 2013 to September 2016. The GAI, derived from the Gravitrap surveillance data, was analysed to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of theAe.aegyptipopulation in Singapore. The index was further categorised into low, moderate, and high-risk groups and its association with dengue cases were examined. A Before-After Control Impact analysis was performed to evaluate the epidemiology impact of Gravitrap system on dengue transmission. TheAe.aegyptipopulation exhibits a seasonal pattern, and spatial heterogeneity inAe.aegyptiabundance was observed among treatment sites. TheAe.aegyptipopulation was also found to be unevenly distributed among floors of an apartment block, with low floors (floors 1-4) having a higher abundance of mosquitoes trapped than mid (floors 5-8) and high (floors >= 9) floors. Areas with high GAI were shown to have higher dengue case count. Gravitrap has also demonstrated to be a good dengue control tool. The contribution of cases by treatment sites to the national numbers was lower after Gravitraps deployment. The GAI, which is of better relevance to dengue transmission risk, could be recommended as an indicator for decision making in vector control efforts, and to monitor the spatio-temporal variability of the adultAedespopulation in the country. In addition, findings from this study indicate that Gravitraps can be used as a dengue control tool to reduce dengue transmission.Author summary In the absence of an effective vaccine: vector surveillance and control remain the key strategy for dengue prevention and control. The collection of the adult femaleAedesmosquito is thus important to understand disease transmission dynamics. Information on its distribution and density are also essential for assessing transmission risk as well as for devising an effective control strategy. Here, we described a new approach to dengue vector surveillance based on adult femaleAedestrapping using Gravitraps. Using the Gravitrap surveillance data, we derived a new entomological index, Gravitrapaegyptiindex (GAI), which estimates the adult femaleAe.aegyptipopulation in the community and presents its association with dengue cases. When analysed, the index can provide useful information on the spatio-temporal distribution of theAe.aegyptipopulation in the country and hence, assist planning of vector control. The GAI, which is of better relevance to dengue transmission risk, could be used as an indicator for decision making in vector control efforts, and to monitor the spatio-temporal variability of the adultAedespopulation. In addition, findings from this study indicate that Gravitraps can be used as a dengue control tool to reduce dengue transmission.

TI  - Investigating Connections between Need for Cognitive Closure and Climate Change Concern in College Students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how people's worldviews and individual personality differences affect their thinking about anthropogenic climate change is critical to communication efforts regarding this issue. This study surveyed University of Georgia students to investigate the role that need for cognitive closure plays in level of climate change worry. The relationship between these two was found to involve suppression-a subset of mediation-by the social dimension of political conservatism. Political conservatism was also found to play a mediating role in the relationship between need for cognitive closure and support for governmental and personal climate solutions. However, social conservatism played this mediator role in women, and functioned as a suppressor for men. These findings help inform audience segmentation and creation of climate-related messages based on audience worldview and personality.

TI  - Unexpected Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Dysfunction after Administration of Sulfadiazine-trimethoprim Medicated Diet to ICR mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>)
T2  - COMPARATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, the University of Chicago administered sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim sulfate (SMZ-TMP) oral suspension to select immunocompromised mouse colonies via the drinking water. In 2014, SMZ-TMP oral suspension was placed on back-order and medicated diet with a different sulfonamide, sulfadiazine-trimethoprim (SDZ-TMP) was used as a replacement. Months after this transition, sentinel mice from the same room as one of the remaining immunocompromised colonies on this diet were found dead or appeared sick. Necropsies revealed cardiomegaly, and histology confirmed myocardial fibrosis in the first 4 sentinel mice examined, consistent with cardiomyopathy. Subsequent sequential monitoring of 2 sentinel mice via echocardiography showed their progression toward decreased cardiac function. Investigation of the housing room revealed that the sentinel mice had been accidently placed on SDZ-TMP diet upon entering the colony housing room. This case report describes cardiomyopathy in 6 ICR mice after long term consumption of SDZ-TMP medicated feed.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Imagery Processing for Tree Logging Observations on the Bialowie(z) over dota Forest World Heritage Site
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is currently among the most critical ecological issues, which need to be addressed urgently. Hence, identification of effective environmental monitoring methods is of top priority, especially in locations where no precise ground-based data are available. Constant development of remote sensing technology provides an increasing number of tools needed for that purpose, based on extraction of information about Earth's surface. One of the most advanced Earth Observation (EO) programs is Copernicus, established by European Space Agency (ESA). It incorporates a constellation of Sentinel satellites continuously delivering imagery, which can serve as input data for further environmental analyses. They can be performed in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), the software also developed by ESA. The Sentinel-2 (S-2) mission was designed specifically for Earth's surface observation. It acquires high-resolution data within visible and infrared range of electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), which has found applications in forest cover monitoring. In this paper, S-2 imagery was processed in SNAP software to determine its potential for deforestation observation on the example of 2017 tree logging in Bialowie(z) over dota Forest. For this purpose, images from October 2016 and 2018, covering the area of interest, were downloaded from the Copernicus Open Hub Platform. They then underwent pre-processing, involving atmospheric correction, resampling, and subset operations. As a part of environmental analysis, a set of chosen radiometric and biophysical indices was computed to preliminarily determine their usefulness for deforestation mapping. Index values were extracted from tree logging areas using pinpoints and region of interest (ROI) mask. The most effective indicators were the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) and the Brightness Index (BI). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as well as the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), also displayed promising results. The results were visualized in Quantum GIS (QGIS) software, provided by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

TI  - Application of LISS III and MODIS-derived vegetation indices for assessment of micro-level agricultural drought
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought in recent years has crippled the livelihoods of millions of people living in India and has also been the cause of many deaths. Puruliya district, India with more than one-third of its population belonging to the backward community has no proper agricultural drought management system. In this study, spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural drought were examined using indices derived from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS III) sensor and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor satellite images. MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) results almost match with the results obtained from LISS III NDVI analysis. Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was prepared from MODIS for a period of 16 years (2000-2016) and subsequently blockwise drought severity maps were generated from MODIS-derived VCI for Kharif and Rabi season. MODIS VCI analysis shows that nearly 34.1% and 76.5% of the study area for Kharif and Rabi season respectively faces drought conditions during the recent year 2015-16. It also shows severe and extreme drought situations for the years 2010-11 and 2005-06 respectively. Blockwise drought severity analysis reveals that Jaipur, Purulia I, Purulia II and Para blocks were chronically drought prone areas. The results indicate significant agreement between NDVI anomaly obtained from MODIS sensor and foodgrain anomaly obtained from crop yield statistics. The outcome of the research may be used for the district's drought preparedness programme so that proper crop planning and management can be carried out to help in agricultural production.

TI  - Imaging of Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha Expression in a Preclinical Mouse Model of Glioma Using Positron Emission Tomography
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive glioma of the primary central nervous system. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for patients remains bleak. Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP), a 170 kDa type II transmembrane serine protease was observed to be expressed on glioma cells and within the glioma tumor microenvironment. To understand the utility of targeting FAP in this tumor type, the immuno-PET radiopharmaceutical [Zr-89]Zr-Df-Bz-F19 mAb was prepared and Lindmo analysis was used for its in vitro evaluation using the U87MG cell line, which expresses FAP endogenously. Lindmo analysis revealed an association constant (K-a) of 10(-8)M(-1)and an immunoreactivity of 52%. Biodistribution studies in U87MG tumor-bearing mice revealed increasing radiotracer retention in tumors over time, leading to average tumor-to-muscle ratios of 3.1, 7.3, 7.2, and 8.3 at 2, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. Small animal PET corroborated the biodistribution studies; tumor-to-muscle ratios at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h were 2.0, 5.0, 6.1 and 7.8, respectively. Autoradiography demonstrated accumulated activity throughout the interior of FAP(+)tumors, while sequential tumor sections stained positively for FAP expression. Conversely, FAP(-)tissues retained minimal radioactivity and were negative for FAP expression by immunohistochemistry. These results demonstrate FAP as a promising biomarker that may be exploited to diagnose and potentially treat GBM and other neuroepithelial cancers.

TI  - The evolution of the periphery in the Pelotas-Capao do Leao conurbation
T2  - ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - From a conceptual discussion on periphery, we analyzed the process of peripheralization in the conurbation of an average-sized city located in the south of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. We aimed to investigate the expansion and the production of peripheral space in the conurbation Pelotas-Capdo do Ledo, between 1990 and 2011. We used LANDSAT 5 images from the ThematicMapper (TM) sensor, and processed the data with softwares Spring and ArcGIS. The study also included interviews in the local city halls, bibliographical research and data from IBGE. Results indicate the production of two types of periphery in the conurbation analyzed, one formed by precarious settlements in Pelotas and Capdo do Ledo, and the other composed of medium and high standard subdivisions and gated residential areas around an area of natural attractions. We found that the growth of the cities is related to the location of a naval hub in the neighboring city of Rio Grande, the fragmentation and diffusion of the peripheral space and the formation of urban voids in the process of space production.

TI  - Greening and Browning Trends of Vegetation in India and Their Responses to Climatic and Non-Climatic Drivers
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is imperative to know the spatial distribution of vegetation trends in India and its responses to both climatic and non-climatic drivers because many ecoregions are vulnerable to global climate change. Here we employed the NDVI3g satellite data over the span of 35 years (1981/82-2015) to estimate vegetation trends and corresponding climatic variables trends (i.e., precipitation, temperature, solar radiation and soil moisture) by using the Mann-Kendall test (tau) and the Theil-Sen median trend. Analysis was performed separately for the two focal periods-(i) the earlier period (1981/82-2000) and (ii) later period (2000-2015)-because many ecoregions experienced more warming after 2000 than the 1980s and 1990s. Our results revealed that a prominent large-scale greening trend (47% of area) of vegetation continued from the earlier period to the later period (80% of area) across the northwestern Plain and Central India. Despite climatologically drier regions, the stronger greening trend was also evident over croplands which was attributed to moisture-induced greening combined with cooling trends of temperature. However, greening trends of vegetation and croplands diminished (i.e., from 84% to 40% of area in kharif season), especially over the southern peninsula, including the west-central area. Such changes were mostly attributed to warming trends and declined soil moisture trends, a phenomenon known as temperature-induced moisture stress. This effect has an adverse impact on vegetation growth in the Himalayas, Northeast India, the Western Ghats and the southern peninsula, which was further exaggerated by human-induced land-use change. Therefore, it can be concluded that vegetation trend analysis from NDVI3g data provides vital information on two mechanisms (i.e., temperature-induced moisture stress and moisture-induced greening) operating in India. In particular, the temperature-induced moisture stress is alarming, and may be exacerbated in the future under accelerated warming as it may have potential implications on forest and agriculture ecosystems, including societal impacts (e.g., food security, employment, wealth). These findings are very valuable to policymakers and climate change awareness-raising campaigns at the national level.

TI  - Bonnet Carre Spillway freshwater transport and corresponding biochemical properties in the Mississippi Bight
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large freshwater pulses to coastal ecosystems change local hydrologic regimes and alter biogeochemical processes. The Mississippi Bight coastal ecosystem, located in the northern Gulf of Mexico shelf, is influenced by extensive freshwater inputs: the Mississippi River (MSR) and several smaller rivers to the east. Under river flood conditions, MSR waters flow through the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to relieve pressure on levees in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 2015, mild wintertime temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the MSR watershed led to extreme flooding and prompted an unusually early BCS opening on January 10, 2016 for 23 days. This study examines the effects of such intermittent freshwater diversions on local shelf circulation, planktonic distributions, and potential contaminant transport pathways. Physical, chemical, and remote sensing data collected one month after the BCS opening suggested the region was comprised of three water masses: shelf saltwater, MSR waters, and local river waters. Observations and circulation model results showed the BCS waters remained within the estuarine lakes and sounds, where winter wind patterns mixed the waters and prevented BCS waters from flowing onto the shelf. Freshwater within the Mississippi Bight was primarily from concurrent flooding of local rivers. Two distinct clusters of microplankton (offshore versus nearshore stations) and zooplankton (Chandeleur Sound versus other stations) community compositions were detected. No algal blooms were observed during this BCS opening. The 2016 wintertime BCS opening resulted in muted effects on the sounds and shelf because of its short duration and uncharacteristically early release.

TI  - The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI): Algorithm Improvements, Spatiotemporal Consistency and Continuity with the MERIS Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on-board Sentinel-3 (2016-present) was designed with similar mechanical and optical characteristics to the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) (2002-2012) to ensure continuity with a number of land and marine biophysical products. The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R-2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R-2>0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD similar to 0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of paddy (Oryza sativa L.) cultivating areas using modern technologies like remote sensing and geographical information system is an important way for managing food security, agricultural production and water resource. This paper aims to identify the Aman paddy cultivating areas and estimate yield of Aman paddy using phenological algorithm based on different vegetation indices extracting from Landsat OLI images in Bansloi River basin, Eastern India. Different vegetation indices (viz. NDVI, EVI, LSWI and RGVI) were used to identify paddy cultivating areas and yield. Phenological phases of paddy growth were recognized considering daily air temperature, rainfall and field survey data. After running the linear regression between different vegetation indices and paddy yield collected during the field survey, the paddy yield was predicted for the identified paddy cultivated areas. The estimated paddy cultivated areas were validated using user, producer, overall accuracy and kohen's kappa test. On the other hand, predicted paddy yield was validated through RMSE and ME statistical techniques. All the validating methods are showing good accuracy of estimated paddy cultivated areas and predicted yield. The recognized total rice cultivating area, average yield and total production was 107173 ha, 2.51 tons/ha and 269004.23 tons respectively from 2015 to 2017. The estimation of paddy yield before harvest can provide valuable information to a planner about export, import and storage of food for the future.

TI  - Predicting wetland area and water depth of Ganges moribund deltaic parts of India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland area and depth of wetland in the moribund Ganges delta of India is simulated and predicted up to 2037. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) map from 1987 to 2017 is used for predicting the same. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) simulation is used to predict wetland area and exponential adaptive smoothing and least square regression are used to predict wetland depth. The result shows 17-18% of wetland area may lose their existence in the upcoming two decades. Water depth of large wetlands area is likely to be reduced by 45-50% in both seasons and small fragmented marginal wetlands are going to be dried out in the next twenty years. Large wetland and wetland core area is safer than smaller and fringe wetland. Considering the socio-ecological importance policy should be taken and the result could help to define plan sustainably.

TI  - Temporal Variation Model of Ultraviolet Hyperspectral Solar Reference Spectrum
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar reference spectrum is the basis for radiometric calibration and wavelength calibration in the field of on-board calibration. During the solar cycle, the amplitude of the solar irradiance spectrum fluctuates periodically, changing by more than 10% in the ultraviolet band. However, the on-board absolute calibration requirement is 3%. Temporal variation characteristics of the sun cannot be ignored. First of all, we studied the influence of calculation of MgII when given spectra, which are based on interpolation and convolution intervals, with different resolutions and sampling. After selecting appropriate interpolation and convolution interval, we model the periodic variation of the solar-based on the MgII of Climate spectrum and SORCE spectrum. Secondly, we select 80 sets (there are two dates for every set) of amplitude variation of MgII and irradiance at a different wavelength from August 21, 2003, to April 15, 2012. By first order fitting instead of ratio method, the first order fitting method decreases error from 1.167% to 0.125% for Climate spectrum, from 1.057% to 0.558% for SORCE spectrum, when compared to true irradiance data from August 21, 2003, to April 15, 2012. The results show that the first-order fitting method has higher inversion precision and prediction accuracy than the ratio method. Finally, based on time series of MgII we fulfil normalization of time and format of the spectrum. By eliminating large deviated data over the different spectrum, we got a solar reference spectrum with the resolution of 1 nm and sampling of 0.1 nm on June 25, 2008. In addition, the spectrum has an absolute error of 0.982% compared to the average of six spectra without eliminating deviated data in all wavelength. The spectrum can also be converted to any day using solar cycle activity model based on MgII and conversion factor. By promotion of resolution and sampling for this reference spectrum based on KNMI hyperspectral, as a result, we get the solar reference spectrum with the spectrum range of 250 similar to 500 nm, resolution of 0.1 nm and sampling of 0.01 nm, which can provide reference spectrum for on-orbit observation and on-board calibration of China's FY-3 ultraviolet hyperspectral ozone detector (OMS).

TI  - Assessing the benefit of satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence in crop yield prediction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop yield prediction is critical for early warning of food insecurity, agricultural supply chain management, and economic market. Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.

TI  - Recognition and Characterization of Forest Plant Communities through Remote-Sensing NDVI Time Series
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytosociology is a reference method to classify vegetation that relies on field data. Its classification in hierarchical vegetation units, from plant associations to class level, hierarchically reflects the floristic similarity between different sites on different spatial scales. The development of remotely sensed multispectral platforms as satellites enormously contributes to the detection and mapping of vegetation on all scales. However, the integration between phytosociology and remotely sensed data is rather difficult and little practiced despite being a goal for the modern science of vegetation. In this study, we demonstrate how normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series with functional principal component analysis (FPCA) could support the analyses of phytosociologists. The approach supports the recognition and characterization of forest plant communities identified on the ground by the phytosociological approach by using NDVI time series that encode phenological behaviors. The methodology was evaluated in two study areas of central Italy, and it could characterize and discriminate six different forest plant associations that have similar dominant tree species but distinct specific composition: three dominated by black hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and three dominated by holm oak (Quercus ilex). The methodology was also able to optimize the ground data collection of unexplored areas (from a phytosociological point of view) by using a phenoclustering approach. The obtained results confirmed that by using remote sensing, it is possible to separate and distinguish plant communities in an objective/instrumental way, thus overcoming the subjectivity intrinsic to the phytosociological method. In particular, FPCA functional components (NDVI seasonalities) were significantly correlated with vegetation abundance data variation (Mantelr= 0.76,p< 0.001).

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud phase retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are evaluated against combined CloudSat-CALIPSO (CCL) observations using four years of data (2007-10) over the Arctic Ocean. AIRS cloud phase is evaluated over sea ice and open ocean separately using collocated CCL and AIRS fields of view (FOVs). In addition, AIRS and CCL cloud phase occurrences are evaluated seasonally, zonally, and with respect to total column water vapor (TCWV) and the temperature difference between 1000 and 300 hPa (Delta T1000-300). Last, collocated MODIS cloud information is implemented in a 1-month case study to assess the relationship between AIRS and CCL phase decisions, cloud cover, and cloud phase throughout the AIRS FOV. Depending on the surface type, AIRS classification skill for single-layer ice and liquid-phase clouds is over the ranges of 85%-95% and 22%-32%, respectively. Most unknown and liquid AIRS phase classifications correspond to mixed-phase clouds. AIRS ice-phase relative occurrence is biased low relative to CCL. However, the liquid-phase relative occurrence is similar between the two instruments. When compared with the CCL climatology, AIRS accurately represents the seasonal cycle of liquid and ice cloud phase across the Arctic as well as the relationship between cloud phase and TCWV and Delta T1000-300 regime in some cases. The more heterogeneous the MODIS cloud macrophysical properties within an AIRS FOV are, the more likely it is that the AIRS FOV is classified as unknown phase.

TI  - Land Cover Classification using Google Earth Engine and Random Forest Classifier-The Role of Image Composition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information plays a vital role in many aspects of life, from scientific and economic to political. Accurate information about land cover affects the accuracy of all subsequent applications, therefore accurate and timely land cover information is in high demand. In land cover classification studies over the past decade, higher accuracies were produced when using time series satellite images than when using single date images. Recently, the availability of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform, has gained the attention of remote sensing based applications where temporal aggregation methods derived from time series images are widely applied (i.e., the use the metrics such as mean or median), instead of time series images. In GEE, many studies simply select as many images as possible to fill gaps without concerning how different year/season images might affect the classification accuracy. This study aims to analyze the effect of different composition methods, as well as different input images, on the classification results. We use Landsat 8 surface reflectance (L8sr) data with eight different combination strategies to produce and evaluate land cover maps for a study area in Mongolia. We implemented the experiment on the GEE platform with a widely applied algorithm, the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Our results show that all the eight datasets produced moderately to highly accurate land cover maps, with overall accuracy over 84.31%. Among the eight datasets, two time series datasets of summer scenes (images from 1 June to 30 September) produced the highest accuracy (89.80% and 89.70%), followed by the median composite of the same input images (88.74%). The difference between these three classifications was not significant based on the McNemar test (p> 0.05). However, significant difference (p< 0.05) was observed for all other pairs involving one of these three datasets. The results indicate that temporal aggregation (e.g., median) is a promising method, which not only significantly reduces data volume (resulting in an easier and faster analysis) but also produces an equally high accuracy as time series data. The spatial consistency among the classification results was relatively low compared to the general high accuracy, showing that the selection of the dataset used in any classification on GEE is an important and crucial step, because the input images for the composition play an essential role in land cover classification, particularly with snowy, cloudy and expansive areas like Mongolia.

TI  - Greening and Browning Trends across Peru's Diverse Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - If he were living today, Alexander von Humboldt would be using current technology to evaluate change in the Andes. Inspired by von Humboldt's scientific legacy and the 2019 celebrations of his influence, we utilize a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)time-series vegetation index to ask questions of landscape change. Specifically, we use an 18-year record of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as a proxy to evaluate landscape change in Peru, which is well known for its high biological and ecological diversity. Continent-level evaluations of Latin America have shown sites with a positive trend in NDVI, or "greening" and "browning", a negative trend in NDVI that suggests biophysical or human-caused reductions in vegetation. Our overall hypothesis was that the major biomes in Peru would show similar NDVI change patterns. To test our expectations, we analyzed the NDVI time-series with Thiel-Sen regression and evaluated Peru overall, by protected area status, by biome, and by biome and elevation. Across Peru overall, there was a general greening trend. By protected area status, surprisingly, the majority of greening occurred outside protected areas. The trends were different by biome, but there were hotspots of greening in the Amazon, Andean Highlands, and Drylands where greening dominated. In the Tropical Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest biome, greening and browning signals were mixed. Greening trends varied across the elevation gradient, switching from greening, to browning, and then back to greening as elevation increased. By biome and elevation, the results were variable. We further explored biome-specific drivers of greening and browning drawing on high-resolution imagery, the literature, and field expertise, much as we imagine von Humboldt might have approached similar questions of landscape dynamism.

TI  - The Effect of Post-Fire Disturbances on a Seasonally Thawed Layer in the Permafrost Larch Forests of Central Siberia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined and simulated the consequences of the degradation of the litter and the moss-lichen layer after fire impact, which could affect the seasonal temperature of the soil and the depth of the seasonally thawed layer (STL) in the permafrost zone. According to the analysis of satellite imagery for 2000 to 2019, the fire-disturbed area in the region of interest amounted to 20%. The main aims of the study included quantitative evaluation of the variation range of summer temperature anomalies at fire-damaged plots, summarizing the statistical norm of the STL depending on natural conditions, and numerical simulation of the response of the STL. Using Terra and Aqua/MODIS imagery, we analyzed surface temperature (in bands of lambda = 10.780-11.280 and 11.770-12.270 mu m) coupled with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for non-disturbed and fire-damaged sites under the same natural conditions of larch forests in Central Siberia. Heat transfer, freezing and thawing processes were numerically simulated for two extreme cases of soil conditions: dry soil and water-saturated soil. The model was also applied to soil with non-homogeneous water content. As input parameters, we used data on the properties of cryogenic soils collected in larch forests (Larix gmelinii) in the flat-mountainous taiga region of the Evenkia (Central Siberia). For post-fire plots, surface temperature anomalies observed during summer months remained significant for more than 15-20 years after fire impact, while the NDVI values were restored to the statistical norm within 7-10 years of the fire. According to the results of numerical simulation, the thickness of the STL could show a 30-50% increase compared to the statistical norm. In the first approximation, we showed the annual soil temperature dynamics at various depths in disturbed and non-disturbed plots.

TI  - Predicting biomass dynamics at the national extent from digital aerial photogrammetry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for precise mapping and monitoring of forest resources, such as above ground biomass (AGB), has increased rapidly. National accounting and monitoring of AGB requires regularly updated information based on consistent methods. While remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) have been shown to deliver the necessary 3D spatial data for AGB mapping, the capacity of repeat acquisition, remotely sensed, vegetation structure data for AGB monitoring has received less attention. Here, we use vegetation height models (VHMs) derived from repeat acquisition DAP data (with ALS terrain correction) to map and monitor woody AGB dynamics across Switzerland over 35 years (1983-2017 inclusive), using a linear least-squares regression approach. We demonstrate a consistent relationship between canopy height derived from DAP and field-based NFI measures of woody AGB across four inventory periods. Over the environmentally heterogeneous area of Switzerland, our models have a comparable predictive performance (R-2 = 0.54) to previous work predicting AGB based on ALS metrics. Pearson correlation coefficients between measured and predicted changes in woody AGB over time increased with shorter time gaps (< 2 years) between image capture and field-based measurements, ranging between 0.76 and 0.34. A close temporal match between field surveys and remote sensing data acquisition is thus key to reliable mapping and monitoring of AGB dynamics, especially in areas where forest management and natural disturbances trigger relatively fast canopy dynamics. We show that VHMs derived from repeat DAP capture constitute a cost effective and reliable approach to map and monitor changes in woody AGB at a national extent and can provide an important information source for national carbon accounting and monitoring of ecosystem service provisioning.

TI  - Evaluation of safety, humoral immune response and faecal shedding in horses inoculated with a modified-live bovine coronavirus vaccination
T2  - EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is considered an emerging enteric virus with reported morbidity rates ranging from 10 to 83% and fatality rates ranging from 7 to 27% in adult horses; a vaccine forECoV is currently not available. This study investigated the safety, humoral response and viral shedding in horses inoculated with a commercially available modified-live bovine coronavirus (BCoV) vaccine. Twelve healthy adult horses were vaccinated twice, 3 weeks apart, either orally, intranasally or intrarectally. Two healthy unvaccinated horses served as sentinel controls. Following each vaccine administration, horses were monitored daily for physical abnormalities whilst the onset and duration ofBCoV shedding was determined by quantitativePCR(qPCR) in nasal secretions and faeces. Whole blood was collected every 3 weeks to determineBCoV-specific antibody response. With the exception of transient and self-limiting changes in faecal character observed in seven vaccinated and one control horse, no additional abnormal clinical findings were found in the study horses. Following the first and second vaccine administration, two and one horse, respectively, testedqPCR-positive forBCoV in nasal secretions 1-day post intranasal vaccination. No vaccinated horses testedqPCR-positive forBCoV in faeces following each vaccine administration. One of the two horses that shedBCoV seroconverted toBCoV after the first vaccine administration and an additional two vaccinated horses (oral and intrarectal) seroconverted toBCoV after the second vaccine administration. In conclusion, the results show that the modified-liveBCoV is safe to administer to horses via various routes, causes minimal virus shedding and results in detectable antibodies toBCoV in 27% of the vaccinates.

TI  - Mapping urban tree species by integrating multi-seasonal high resolution pleiades satellite imagery with airborne LiDAR data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping individual tree species is critical to understand the ecosystem services value of the urban forest and improve management. The main aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of integrating multi-seasonal high resolution Pleiades satellite images with airborne LiDAR data for improving urban tree species mapping in the City of Tampa, FL, USA. In this study, we evaluated and compared the abilities of multi-seasonal individual and combined Pleiades satellite images with airborne LiDAR data for classifying seven urban tree species to understand effects of season and tree canopy height information on tree species mapping accuracy. A multi-level classification system was adopted to classify image objects of the tree species and groups. To efficiently utilize seasonal change information of tree species, a seasonal trajectory difference index (STDI) was developed with multi-seasonal images. Species mapping accuracy was compared and evaluated among individual seasonal Pleiades images and combined dry-wet season images, and between feature types: (i) 6 canonical variables only, transformed by canonical discriminant analysis algorithm; ii) 6 canonical variables plus 2 normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) derived variables; and iii) 6 canonical variables plus 2 nDSM variables and 4 STDI band indices. The 6 canonical variables were extracted from all spectral and textural features (SFs) including tree species fraction features. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers were used to classify the seven tree species with tree crown image objects. The research results demonstrate that (1) with additional 2 nDSM variables and extracted 4 STDI band indices, the accuracy of mapping urban tree species could be further improved (p < 0.09); and (2) with the 6 canonical variables, tree species mapping accuracies could be significantly improved using late spring season (April) image compared to all other seasonal images (p < 0.01), combined dry-wet season images performed even better. Our results further confirm that there exists a significant seasonal effect on tree species classification and that the 2 nDSM variables and the newly developed STDI in this study are useful to improve mapping urban tree species.

TI  - Efficient Location and Extraction of the Iceberg Calved Areas of the Antarctic Ice Shelves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous, rapid, and precise monitoring of calving events contributes to an in-depth understanding of calving mechanisms, which have the potential to cause significant mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet. The difficulties in the precise monitoring of iceberg calving lie with the coexistence of ice shelf advances and calving. The manual location of iceberg calving is time-consuming and painstaking, while achieving precise extraction has mostly relied on the surface textural characteristics of the ice shelves and the quality of the images. Here, we propose a new and efficient method of separating the expansion and calving processes of ice shelves. We visualized the extension process by simulating a new coastline, based on the ice velocity, and detected the calved area using the simulated coastline and single-temporal post-calving images. We extensively tested the validity of this method by extracting four annual calving datasets (from August 2015 to August 2019) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar mosaic of the Antarctic coastline. A total of 2032 annual Antarctic calving events were detected, with areas ranging from 0.05 km(2)to 6141.0 km(2), occurring on almost every Antarctic ice shelf. The extraction accuracy of the calved area depends on the positioning accuracy of the simulated coastline and the spatial resolution of the images. The positioning error of the simulated coastline is less than one pixel, and the determined minimum valid extraction area is 0.05 km(2), when based on 75 m resolution images. Our method effectively avoids repetition and omission errors during the calved area extraction process. Furthermore, its efficiency is not affected by the surface textural characteristics of the calving fronts and the various changes in the frontal edge velocity, which makes it fully applicable to the rapid and accurate extraction of different calving types.

TI  - The Effect of Water Transfer during Non-growing Season on the Wetland Ecosystem via Surface and Groundwater Interactions in Arid Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of ecological water transfer to maintain the ecological environment in arid or semiarid regions has become an important means of human intervention to alleviate vegetation ecosystem degradation in arid and semiarid areas. The water transfer to downstream in a catchment is often carried out during the non-growing season, due to the competitive water use between the upper and middle reaches and lower reaches of rivers. However, the impacts and mechanism of artificial water transfer on vegetation and wetland ecosystem restoration have not been thoroughly investigated, especially in northwest China. Taking the Qingtu Lake wetland system in the lower reaches of the Shiyang River Catchment as the study area, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution surface area of Qingtu Lake and the surrounding vegetation coverage before and after water transfer, by interpreting remote sensing data, the variation of water content in the vadose zone, and the groundwater level by obtaining field monitoring data, as well as the correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake and the highest vegetation coverage area in the following year. The conclusion is that there is a positive correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake in autumn and the vegetation coverage in each fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) interval in the next summer, especially in terms of the FVC of 30-50%. The groundwater level and soil water content increase after water transfer and remain relatively high for the following months, which suggests that transferred water from upstream can be stored as groundwater or soil water in the subsurface through surface water and subsurface water interaction. These water sources can provide water for the vegetation growth the next spring, or support plants in the summer.

TI  - Crop Mapping from Sentinel-1 Polarimetric Time-Series with a Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate agricultural information is essential for food security assessment and agricultural management. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are increasingly available in crop mapping, as they provide all-weather imagery. In particular, the Sentinel-1 sensor provides dense time-series data, thus offering a unique opportunity for crop mapping. However, in most studies, the Sentinel-1 complex backscatter coefficient was used directly which limits the potential of the Sentinel-1 in crop mapping. Meanwhile, most of the existing methods may not be tailored for the task of crop classification in time-series polarimetric SAR data. To solve the above problem, we present a novel deep learning strategy in this research. To be specific, we collected Sentinel-1 time-series data in two study areas. The Sentinel-1 image covariance matrix is used as an input to maintain the integrity of polarimetric information. Then, a depthwise separable convolution recurrent neural network (DSCRNN) architecture is proposed to characterize crop types from multiple perspectives and achieve better classification results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves better accuracy in complex agricultural areas than other classical methods. Additionally, the variable importance provided by the random forest (RF) illustrated that the covariance vector has a far greater influence than the backscatter coefficient. Consequently, the strategy proposed in this research is effective and promising for crop mapping.

TI  - Sensitivity of Altimeter Wave Height Assessment to Data Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the issue of how the selection of buoys and the calculation of altimeter averages affect the metrics characterising the errors of altimetric wave height estimates. The use of a 51-point median reduces the sensitivity to occasional outliers, but the quality of this measure can be improved by demanding that there is a minimum number of valid measurements. This had a marked impact in both the open ocean and the coastal zone. It also affected the relative ordering of algorithms' performances, as some fared poorly when a representative value was gleaned from a single waveform inversion, but had a much better ranking when a minimum of 20 values were used. Validation procedures could also be improved by choosing altimeter-buoy pairings that showed a good consistency. This paper demonstrated an innovative procedure using the median of the different retrackers analysed, which can be easily extended to other data validation exercises. This led to improved comparison statistics for all algorithms in the open ocean, with many showing errors less than 0.2 m, but there was only one strong change in the relative performance of the 11 Jason-3 retrackers. For Sentinel-3A, removing the inconsistent coastal buoys showed that all of the new algorithms had similar errors of just over 0.2 m. Thus, although improvements were found in the procedure used for the Sea State Round Robin exercise, the relative rankings for the buoy calibrations are mostly unaffected.

TI  - Game Theory Based Pixel Approximation for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of remote sensing images faces several challenges due to mixed pixels. Such pixels that are wrongly classified are called mixed pixels. There is uncertainty about the class label of mixed pixels as they represent the average energy emitted from different objects present within their spatial extent. Rough set theory can address the vagueness in data. Therefore, in this work rough set concept is used to identify the mixed pixels. In a multi-player environment, the Game theory is a science of making rational decisions. We propose a game theory-based approach to approximate the mixed pixels to lower approximations of a class. For pixel approximation, we have applied the spatial information of neighbouring pixels. Experiment for the implementation of the proposed approach is carried on six Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper images with a different region of interest. These datasets vary in size and have different dominant classes. The impact of the proposed method on the quality of clusters is studied with the help of cluster quality parameters. The results of the percentage of approximation demonstrate the significant number of mixed pixels approximated to one of the class. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of soil erosion, sediment yield and basin specific controlling factors using RUSLE-SDR and PLSR approach in Konar river basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study comprehensively assessed the effects of river basin parameters (basin morphology, drainage network, topography, climate, land use land cover (LULC) composition & pattern, and soil properties) on soil erosion (SE) and specific sediment yield (SSY) in the tropical river basin of Konar, India. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) along with the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) model has been used to quantify the SE and SSY. As the basin parameters are highly codependent with each other, multivariate partial least square regression (PLSR) with variable importance projection (VIP) statistics has been applied to 32 basin parameters to elucidate the linkage with SE and SSY. Multi-spectral LANDSAT-8 image, topographical sheets (1:50,000), gridded (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) daily rainfall data series, laboratory estimates of soil parameters along with other ancillary data have been employed in this regard. Results revealed that wastelands encouraged moderate to very high (5-40.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) annual rate of SE compare to other LULC classes. The PLSR studies revealed that the mean slope gradient (S), basin relief (HD), sediment delivery ratio (SDR), patch density (PD), edge density (ED), hypsometric integral (HI), topographic wetness index (TWI) were very strongly influential (b = 0.1-0.16) in SE. Likewise, SDR, mean annual precipitation (P), rainfall-runoff erosivity (R factor) PD, S, and HD were highly (b =0.12-0.22) important variables (VIP = 1.2-2.3) for SSY. Generated spatial information may help in understanding the SE and SSY dynamics in the basin and the knowledge can be used for soil erosion conservation measures in and around the river basins in India.

The physiological response patterns (e.g. heart rate variability, shell gape) of sentinel oysters can provide valuable insight into their exposure to environmental stressors. Sensors were attached to measure both heart rate and shell gape (physiological behaviour) of oysters placed at different depths in the water column. Sensors were also deployed to measure water quality that represents the environmental condition the oysters were in. The objective of this study is to utilise the data from different sensors to investigate how environmental conditions modulate physiological response of oysters. We have utilised a set of machine learning models to develop data-driven approaches that can predict heart rate and shell gape (opening and closing action) of oysters from water quality variables, and vice-versa. The level of prediction accuracy indicates how well environmental conditions influence the physiological response of oysters. The effectiveness of the developed approaches is evaluated using data collected from two different deployments of sensors in South East Tasmania, Australia. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented data-driven approaches can provide accurate predictions of physiological and water quality variables, for the data set considered in this study. The prediction error (in terms of MAPE) for HR and water quality is in the range of 3.17%-8.21% and 0.72%-2.48%, respectively, and classification accuracy (F-Score) for shell gape varies between 0.96 and 0.99.

TI  - Performance evaluation of MLE, RF and SVM classification algorithms for watershed scale land use/land cover mapping using sentinel 2 bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use and land cover map plays a significant role in agricultural, water resources planning, management, and monitoring programs at regional and national levels and is an input to various hydrological models. Land use and land cover maps prepared using satellite remote sensing techniques in conjunction with landform-soilvegetation relationships and ground truth are popular for locating suitable sites for the construction of water harvesting structures, soil and water conservation measures, runoff computations, irrigation planning and agricultural management, analyzing socio-ecological concerns, flood controlling, and overall watershed management. Here we use a novel approach to analyze Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite data using traditional and principal component analysis based approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of maximum likelihood estimation, random forest tree, and support vector machine classifiers to improve land use and land cover categorization for Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model. Additionally, we use stratified random sampling to evaluate the accuracies of resulted land use and land cover maps in terms of kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. The classifiers were used for classifying the data into seven major land use and land cover classes namely water, built-up, mixed forest, cultivated land, barren land, fallow land with vertisols dominance, and fallow land with inceptisols dominance for the Vishwamitri watershed. We find that principal component analysis with support vector machine is able to produce highly accurate land use and land cover classified maps. Principal component analysis extracts the useful spectral information by compressing redundant data embedded in each spectral channel. The study highlights the use of principal component analysis with support vector machine classifier to improve land use and land cover classification from which policymakers can make better decisions and extract basic information for policy amendments.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Forest-Cover Dynamics in the Tropical Realm: Past Trends and Policy Insights for Forest Conservation in Dry Zone of Sri Lanka
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-cover change has become an important topic in global biodiversity conservation in recent decades because of the high rates of forest loss in different parts of the world, especially in the tropical region. While human interventions are the major cause, natural disasters also contribute to forest cover changes. During the past decades, several studies have been conducted to address different aspects of forest cover changes (e.g., drivers of deforestation, degradation, interventions) in different parts of the world. In Sri Lanka, increasing rates of forest loss have been recorded during the last 100 years on a regional basis, especially in the dry zone. However, Sri Lanka needs detailed studies that employ contemporary data and robust analytical tools to understand the patterns of forest cover changes and their drivers. The dry zone of Sri Lanka encompasses 59% of the total land area of the country, ergo, the most extensive forest cover. Our study analyzed forest cover dynamics and its drivers between 1992 and 2019. Our specific objectives included (i) producing a forest cover map for 2019, (ii) analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of forest cover changes from 1992 to 2019, and (iii) determining the main driving forces. Landsat 8 images were used to develop forest-cover maps for 2019, and the rest of the forest cover maps (1992, 1999, and 2010) were obtained from the Forest Department of Sri Lanka. In this study, we found that the dry zone had undergone rapid forest loss (246,958.4 ha) during the past 27 years, which accounts for 8.0% of the net forest cover changes. From 2010 to 2019, the rates of forest loss were high, and this can be associated with the rapid infrastructure development of the country. The findings of this study can be used as a proxy to reform current forest policies and enhance the forest sustainability of the study area.

TI  - SAR-enhanced mapping of live fuel moisture content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing wildfire risk presents several challenges due to uncertainty in fuel flammability and ignition potential. Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) - the mass of water per unit dry biomass in vegetation - exerts a direct control on fuel ignitability, fuel availability and fire spread, and is thus an important parameter in assessing wildfire risk. Current estimates of LFMC from optical remote sensing or meteorological indices are insufficient to accurately map LFMC at landscape scale. In this study, we present a physics-assisted recurrent neural network model for mapping LFMC every 15 days at 250 m resolution over the western US using microwave backscatter (from Sentinel-1) and optical reflectance (from Landsat-8). The model was physics-assisted by adding handcrafted inputs representing radiative transfer processes and related parameters. Field data from the National Fuel Moisture Database was used to train the deep learning model. The model had a satisfactory overall predictability of R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 25.0% and bias = 1.9% when cross-validated at 125 sites. The model was substantially better at predicting site-means (R-2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 14.3%) as compared to site-anomalies (R-2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 21.3%). Of the 6 land cover types tested, the model was most accurate in predicting LFMC in shrub-lands (R-2 = 0.69), while closed broadleaf deciduous sites had the least accuracy (R-2 = 0.49). Incorporating microwave backscatter as a model input significantly enhanced performance (R-2 increasing from 0.44 to 0.63, and RMSE decreasing from 31.8% to 25.0%). Microwave backscatter therefore presents a complementary source of information to optical remote sensing metrics for LFMC mapping. The high resolution dynamic LFMC maps presented here may assist in improved wildfire risk characterization and also have potential applications in quantifying plant drought stress at large scales.

TI  - The physician as a neoliberal subject - A qualitative study within a private-public mix setting
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on neoliberalism in health care has insufficiently explored the intermediary role of physicians in neoliberal subjectification. This paper studies the construct of the physician as a neoliberal subject in the Israeli health care system, using qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 21 medical specialists. We interviewed physicians from specialties in which private practice is both less common (infectious disease and intensive care) and more common (orthopedics, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery). Our analysis focused on two key issues: the physician's role in society and the value placed on health care. We found a spectrum of views. At one end, some perceived themselves as entrepreneurs, managing themselves both as an enterprise and a product, and perceived health care as a commodity. M the opposite end, we found a professional ethos that considered the physician as a public servant, and health care as a human right. Both views were in constant tension with neoliberal subjectivity. Further research should investigate the association between institutional belonging, whether public or private, and the internalization of the main characteristics of the neoliberal worldview.

TI  - Development of Rice Yield Model Using C-Band Sentinel-1A Data
T2  - PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice yield models were generated using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from SENTINEL 1-A mission. Time-series vertical transmission-horizontal reception (VH) and vertical transmission-vertical reception (VV) backscatter data were collected from November 2015 to January 2017 in Laguna, Philippines to generate and evaluate rice yield models for dry and wet seasons. Different parameters of the time-series VH and VV backscatter were considered in the development of the models. These were single-day VH and VV backscatter, VH/VV ratio and slope of the time-series curve. During dry season, rice yields were significantly correlated with VV backscatter at 24 days after transplanting (DAT), VH/VV ratio at 24 DAT, and upward slope of VH/VV ratio curve. During wet season, rice yields were significantly correlated with VV backscatter at 60 DAT, VH/VV ratio at 60 DAT, and upward slope of VH/VV ratio curve. Based on R-2 and RMSE values, the equation Y = -3.673 - 1.140 * VH/VV data provided the best estimate of rice yield at 24 DAT during dry season; while Y = 1.793 - 0.495 * VH/VV data at 60 DAT during wet season. The study has shown the potential of VH/VV ration in estimation of rice yield at varying phenological stages during dry and wet seasons.

TI  - Fusing street level photographs and satellite remote sensing to map leaf area index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural parameter of vegetation, and is used in many models of climate and ecosystem services. Maps of LAI are typically produced by relating satellite remote sensing with field-based measurements of LAI, but such field measurements are time consuming to collect over large areas. In this study we develop a rapid and scalable method for mapping LAI by fusing high-resolution freely-available Sentinel 2 satellite imagery with ground measurements of LAI extracted from a large publicly available database of street-level panoramic photographs. The use of existing street-level photographs allowed large numbers of training data to be automatically obtained. The method developed here was validated against a field dataset collected using established techniques. The use of existing online databases of street-level photographs will allow rapid mapping of LAI in many situations worldwide. The technique developed here may be particularly useful in cities, which have high heterogeneity in vegetation, and high densities of street level photographs collected along road networks. The approach could be applied to map LAI at high resolution across very large areas, for national- or continental-scale comparison.

TI  - Surgical Infections in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Global Assessment of the Burden and Management Needs
T2  - SURGICAL INFECTIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background:The burden of surgical infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains poorly defined compared with high-income countries. Although there are common infections necessitating surgery prevalent across the world, such as appendicitis and peptic ulcer disease, other conditions are more localized geographically. To date, comprehensive assessment of the burden of surgically treatable infections or sequelae of surgical infections in LMICs is lacking. Methods:We reviewed the literature to define the burden of surgical infections in LMICs and characterize the needs and challenges of addressing this issue. Results:Surgical infections comprise a broad range of diseases including intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue, and healthcare-associated infections and other infectious processes. Treatment of surgical infections requires a functional surgical ecosystem, microbiology services, and appropriate and effective antimicrobial therapy. Systems must be developed and maintained to evaluate screening, prevention, and treatment strategies. Solutions and interventions are proposed focusing on reducing the burden of disease, improving surveillance, strengthening antibiotic stewardship, and enhancing the management of surgical infections. Conclusions:Surgical infections constitute a large burden of disease globally. Challenges to management in LMICs include a shortage of trained personnel and material resources. The increasing rate of antimicrobial drug resistance, likely related to antibiotic misuse, adds to the challenges. Development of surveillance, infection prevention, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are initial steps forward. Education is critical and should begin early in training, be an active process, and be sustained through regular programs.

TI  - Modern surgical treatment of breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women all over the world. The prognosis is generally good, with a five-year overall survival rate above 90% for all stages. It is still the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Surgical treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically over the years. Initially, treatment involved major surgery with long hospitalization, but it is now mostly accomplished as an outpatient procedure with a quick recovery. Thanks to well-designed retrospective and randomly controlled prospective studies, guidelines are continually changing. We are presently in an era where safely de-escalating surgery is increasingly emphasized. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, where a "one-size-fits-all" treatment approach is not appropriate. There is often more than one surgical solution carrying equal oncological safety for an individual patient. In these situations, it is important to include the patient in the treatment decision-making process through well informed consent. For this to be optimal, the physician must be fully updated on the surgical options. A consequence of an improved prognosis is more breast cancer survivors, and therefore physical appearance and quality of life is more in focus. Modern breast cancer treatment is increasingly personalized from a surgical point of view but is dependent on a multidisciplinary approach. Detailed algorithms for surgery of the breast and the axilla are required for optimal treatment and quality control. This review illustrates how breast cancer treatment has changed over the years and how the current standard is based on high quality scientific research.

TI  - Fog and Low Stratus Obstruction of Wind Lidar Observations in Germany-A Remote Sensing-Based Data Set for Wind Energy Planning
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coherent wind doppler lidar (CWDL) is a cost-effective way to estimate wind power potential at hub height without the need to build a meteorological tower. However, fog and low stratus (FLS) can have a negative impact on the availability of lidar measurements. Information about such reductions in wind data availability for a prospective lidar deployment site in advance is beneficial in the planning process for a measurement strategy. In this paper, we show that availability reductions by FLS can be estimated by comparing time series of lidar measurements, conducted with WindCubes v1 and v2, with time series of cloud base altitude (CBA) derived from satellite data. This enables us to compute average maps (2006-2017) of estimated availability, including FLS-induced data losses for Germany which can be used for planning purposes. These maps show that the lower mountain ranges and the Alpine regions in Germany often reach the critical data availability threshold of 80% or below. Especially during the winter time special care must be taken when using lidar in southern and central regions of Germany. If only shorter lidar campaigns are planned (3-6 months) the representativeness of weather types should be considered as well, because in individual years and under persistent weather types, lowland areas might also be temporally affected by higher rates of data losses. This is shown by different examples, e.g., during radiation fog under anticyclonic weather types.

TI  - SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF RICE PHENOLOGY USING SENTINEL 2 AND UAV IN PARAKANSALAK, SUKABUMI DISTRICT, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - West Java is the third province with the largest area of paddy field. On the province scale, there are five districts with more than 60,000 hectares of the paddy field area. Sukabumi is the fifth largest district, with 6.8 percent of the area covered with paddy field. Although it is not the greatest number, Sukabumi is the largest producer of paddy with more than 6 tons per hectare, especially in 2015. Rice is the primary food for most Indonesian. Therefore, monitoring the rice planting regarding the phenology, planting area, and productivity is a critical process. Information from the process is very important to address the national issues on food security. This study uses the excellence of remote sensing technology to cover a big area of paddy field in Sukabumi. The images from Sentinel 2 and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are utilized to generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The objectives of this study are two folds: (i) to create NDVI map from both Sentinel 2 and UAV; and (ii) to analyze rice crop phenology from the NDVI value. With NDVI, this study can determine the growth stage of paddy by discriminating each stage based on the spectral value. The planting phases that have discovered in the area are divided into land preparation, vegetative, generative, and harvesting. Based on the NDVI value, it is known that the vegetative stage ranges from 0.18 to 0.80. The study concludes that results from both Sentinel 2 and UAV can be used to show the distribution of paddy based on different growth stages.

AB  - Soil management practices for soy cultivation are considered necessary to sustain crop yields, in addition to implementing a synergy between sustainable agricultural practices and reducing environmental impacts. Thus, it is necessary to develop a model that can accurately and quickly distinguish between soil management treatments for soy based on spatial analysis. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi desenvolver uma metodologia aplicada na deteccao dos tipos de Plantios Convencional e Direto, atraves da integracao entre GEOBIA (Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis) e MD (Mineracao de Dados) nas areas identificadas com o cultivo da soja (Glycine max L. Merr.) no estado de Mato Grosso (MT). Para a identificacao das areas cultivadas com a cultura da soja foi utilizado o PCEI (Perpendicular Crop Enhancement), por meio de imagens multiespectrais do sensor MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). O processamento das bandas espectrais e os indices de vegetacao em uma serie temporal do satelite Landsat foram associadas as tecnicas de mineracao de dados e classificacao orientada a objeto devidamente tratados e aplicados uma segmentacao em multiresolucao para definicao dos objetos, com a selecao pre-definida dos alvos, sendo entao gerada uma Arvore de Decisao (AD) pelo algoritmo C4.5/J48 implementado no software Weka (R). O algoritmo foi composto por 28 atributos e por 468 amostras de treinamento, representando todas as classes de plantio para obtencao de uma analise matricial de erro e estatistica Kappa. As estatisticas indicaram que a classificacao alcancou uma precisao geral de 95.29% e um coeficiente Kappa de 0.92. Os resultados revelaram que a combinacao das tecnicas GEOBIA e MD sao eficientes e promissoras para o processo de classificacao do tipo de tratamento de solo.

TI  - Photometric multi-view mesh refinement for high-resolution satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern high-resolution satellite sensors collect optical imagery with ground sampling distances (GSDs) of 30-50 cm, which has sparked a renewed interest in photogrammetric 3D surface reconstruction from satellite data. State-of-the-art reconstruction methods typically generate 2.5D elevation data. Here, we present an approach to recover full 3D surface meshes from multi-view satellite imagery. The proposed method takes as input a coarse initial mesh and refines it by iteratively updating all vertex positions to maximise the photo-consistency between images. Photo-consistency is measured in image space, by transferring texture from one image to another via the surface. We derive the equations to propagate changes in texture similarity through the rational function model (RFM), often also referred to as rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model. Furthermore, we devise a hierarchical scheme to optimise the surface with gradient descent. In experiments with two different datasets, we show that the refinement improves the initial digital elevation models (DEMs) generated with conventional dense image matching. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method is able to reconstruct true 3D geometry, such as facade structures, if off-nadir views are available.

TI  - Impacts of Drought on Vegetation Assessed by Vegetation Indices and Meteorological Factors in Afghanistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has severe impacts on human society and ecosystems. In this study, we used data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) sensors to examine the drought effects on vegetation in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2018. The MODIS data included the 16-day 250-m composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) with Land Surface Temperature (LST) images with 1 km resolution. The TRMM data were monthly rainfalls with 0.1-degree resolution. The relationship between drought and index-defined vegetation variation was examined by using time series, regression analysis, and anomaly calculation. The results showed that the vegetation coverage for the whole country, reaching the lowest levels of 6.2% and 5.5% were observed in drought years 2001 and 2008, respectively. However, there is a huge inter-regional variation in vegetation coverage in the study period with a significant rising trend in Helmand Watershed with R = 0.66 (pvalue = 0.05). Based on VCI for the same two years (2001 and 2008), 84% and 72% of the country were subject to drought conditions, respectively. Coherently, TRMM data confirm that 2001 and 2008 were the least rainfall years of 108 and 251 mm, respectively. On the other hand, years 2009 and 2010 were registered with the largest vegetation coverage of 16.3% mainly due to lower annual LST than average LST of 14 degrees and partially due to their slightly higher annual rainfalls of 378 and 425 mm, respectively, than the historical average of 327 mm. Based on the derived VCI, 28% and 21% of the study area experienced drought conditions in 2009 and 2010, respectively. It is also found that correlations are relatively high between NDVI and VCI (r= 0.77,p= 0.0002), but slightly lower between NDVI and precipitation (r= 0.51,p= 0.03). In addition, LST played a key role in influencing the value of NDVI. However, both LST and precipitation must be considered together in order to properly capture the correlation between drought and NDVI.

TI  - TIC 278956474: Two Close Binaries in One Young Quadruple System Identified by TESS
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We have identified a quadruple system with two close eclipsing binaries in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. The object is unresolved in Gaia and appears as a single source at parallax 1.08 +/- 0.01 mas. Both binaries have observable primary and secondary eclipses and were monitored throughout TESS Cycle 1 (sectors 1-13), falling within the TESS Continuous Viewing Zone. In one eclipsing binary (P = 5.488 days), the smaller star is completely occluded by the larger star during the secondary eclipse; in the other (P = 5.674 days) both eclipses are grazing. Using these data, spectroscopy, speckle photometry, spectral energy distribution analysis, and evolutionary stellar tracks, we have constrained the masses and radii of the four stars in the two eclipsing binaries. The Li I equivalent width indicates an age of 10-50 Myr and, with an outer period of 858(-5)(+7)days, our analysis indicates this is one of the most compact young 2 + 2 quadruple systems known.

TI  - Mosaicking Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data to Enhance LandTrendr Time Series Analysis in Northern High Latitude Permafrost Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is warming in the northern high latitudes, inducing highly dynamic thaw-related permafrost disturbances across the terrestrial Arctic. Monitoring and tracking of permafrost disturbances is important as they impact surrounding landscapes, ecosystems and infrastructure. Remote sensing provides the means to detect, map, and quantify these changes homogeneously across large regions and time scales. Existing Landsat-based algorithms assess different types of disturbances with similar spatiotemporal requirements. However, Landsat-based analyses are restricted in northern high latitudes due to the long repeat interval and frequent clouds, in particular at Arctic coastal sites. We therefore propose to combine Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for enhanced data coverage and present a combined annual mosaic workflow, expanding currently available algorithms, such as LandTrendr, to achieve more reliable time series analysis. We exemplary test the workflow for twelve sites across the northern high latitudes in Siberia. We assessed the number of images and cloud-free pixels, the spatial mosaic coverage and the mosaic quality with spectral comparisons. The number of available images increased steadily from 1999 to 2019 but especially from 2016 onward with the addition of Sentinel-2 images. Consequently, we have an increased number of cloud-free pixels even under challenging environmental conditions, which then serve as the input to the mosaicking process. In a comparison of annual mosaics, the Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics always fully covered the study areas (99.9-100 %), while Landsat-only mosaics contained data-gaps in the same years, only reaching coverage percentages of 27.2 %, 58.1 %, and 69.7 % for Sobo Sise, East Taymyr, and Kurungnakh in 2017, respectively. The spectral comparison of Landsat image, Sentinel-2 image, and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic showed high correlation between the input images and mosaic bands (e.g., for Kurungnakh 0.91-0.97 between Landsat and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic and 0.92-0.98 between Sentinel-2 and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic) across all twelve study sites, testifying good quality mosaic results. Our results show that especially the results for northern, coastal areas was substantially improved with the Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics. By combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 data we accomplished to create reliably high spatial resolution input mosaics for time series analyses. Our approach allows to apply a high temporal continuous time series analysis to northern high latitude permafrost regions for the first time, overcoming substantial data gaps, and assess permafrost disturbance dynamics on an annual scale across large regions with algorithms such as LandTrendr by deriving the location, timing and progression of permafrost thaw disturbances.

T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has raised concerns regarding its impact on clinic capacity and access to HIV testing. We describe enrolment in PrEPX, a large PrEP implementation study in Victoria, Australia, and the impact of PrEP uptake and maintenance on existing health services. Methods We describe enrolment between July 26, 2016, and March 31, 2018, and trends in HIV testing among PrEPX participating and nonparticipating gay and bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) at 5 study clinics participating in a sentinel surveillance system (ACCESS). We evaluated HIV and STI testing trends using segmented linear regression across the prestudy (January 2015 to June 2016) and PrEPX study (July 2016 to March 2018) periods. Findings There were 2,049 individuals who registered interest in study participation: 72% enrolled into the study. Study clinics enrolled participants rapidly; of 4265 people enrolled in PrEPX (98% GBM), 1000 enrolled by week 3, 88% (n = 876) of whom enrolled at ACCESS sites. Prestudy period HIV testing rates were increasing at all ACCESS sites. In the month PrEPX commenced, there was an additional 247 HIV tests among PrEPX participants (P< 0.01) and no significant change among non-PrEPX GBM (P= 0.72). Across the study period, HIV testing increased by 7.2 (P< 0.01) and 8.9 (P< 0.01) tests/month among PrEPX participants and non-PrEPX GBM, respectively. The HIV testing increased among non-PrEPX GBM at sexual health clinics (18.8 tests/month,P< 0.01) and primary care clinics (7.9 tests/month,P< 0.01). Similar trends were observed across testing for all measured STIs. Conclusions Rapid PrEP scale-up is possible without a reduction in HIV testing among GBM not using PrEP.

TI  - An Improved Conversion Relationship between Tropical Cyclone Intensity Index and Maximum Wind Speed for the Advanced Dvorak Technique in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean Using SMAP Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) uses geostationary satellite data to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity owing to the difficulty in directly observing a TC's internal structure. This study presents a new relationship (Hong and Ryu scale) between the current intensity (CI) number and estimated maximum wind speed (MWS) of TCs over the northwestern Pacific region; the CI number is the TC intensity index retrieved from the ADT. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) with the L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiometer, is used to calibrate and produce the new Hong and Ryu scale for the ADT algorithm. Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) best track MWS data, SMAP sea surface wind speed estimates, and ADT's TC intensity data between 2015-2018 are spatiotemporally collocated for the calibration process. The CI number is derived from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) operational ADT which uses the Koba scale to convert to the MWS for validation against the MWS of the best track. The conversion relationships between CI number and SMAP MWS, and between SMAP MWS and MWS of the best track a derived, and the MWS of two ADTs with the Koba and Hong and Ryu scales are then estimated using the same CI numbers with TC intensity data between 2015-2018. Finally, the MWS of the ADT with the Koba scale and the new ADT with the proposed Hong and Ryu scale are independently validated on best track data from 2013-2014. The MWS root mean square error (RMSE) is 4.39 m/s for the new ADT using the Hong and Ryu scale, which is lower than 4.77 m/s RMSE of the ADT using the Koba scale. Hence, the ADT using the Hong and Ryu scale can modestly improve the accuracy of TC intensity analysis in the northwestern Pacific region.

TI  - Sentinel program: Example of suicide prevention for an agricultural population in Switzerland
T2  - ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. - In the field of suicide prevention, the identification of risk groups is important, as is the training of front-line workers, to raise awareness of suicide issues. Agricultural workers represent a group at high risk of suicidal behavior due to various factors (low income of farmers, work related to climatic conditions, social isolation, poor access to primary care). The main objective of this article is to present the implementation of prevention training in suicide prevention for a population of agricultural workers in two cantons of French-speaking Switzerland (Vaud and Neuchatel) which represent a population of about 980,000 inhabitants. The second objective is to identify the experiences of the participants in this training and their expectations.Methods. - Suicide prevention training sessions are organized in collaboration with public health departments, agriculture departments and suicide prevention professionals. Each session is led by four trainers experienced in suicide prevention and belonging to the "Groupement Romand Prevention du Suicide" (GRPS) which manages the training and other training modules on this topic in French-speaking Switzerland. The GRPS guarantees the content of the training as well as the updating of scientific knowledge. The training model is based on a concept that alternates between brief theoretical contributions, exchanges between participants in plenary sessions and role playing in small groups. The training has two main objectives: on the one hand to work on the participants' representations of suicide and to modify their posture by training "sentinels", i.e. "peers" who can establish a link between suffering individuals and the available support resources. On the other hand, to give key messages: dare to talk about the suicidal question and to not remain alone with this.Results. - Between December 2016 and May 2018, nine sessions were held in the two cantons of Vaud and Neuchatel with a total of 220 participants. The sessions took place in agricultural schools or buildings related to agriculture. Invited to express themselves on the theme of suicide as well as on the concept of training, agricultural workers all verbalized the importance of this issue and were often very moved when the subject was discussed. The topics addressed by the participants were the taboo aspect of the subject, the difficulty of talking about it and the need to be able to address the subject (breaking the isolation). Participants also highlighted the need for peers to act as relays for help.Conclusions. - The sessions were highly appreciated by the organizers concerned, particularly by the public health and agricultural departments. Participants expressed their satisfaction at the opportunity to express their views on this subject, regretting that such initiatives are all too rare. Although studies highlight the difficulty of emotional expression in the agricultural field, we observed on the contrary a great facility of the participants to express their emotions in relation to the suicidal theme. We have highlighted that the issue of suicide in this population is linked to several causal factors, as is the suicidal issue more broadly. Factors specific to this population emerged from the sessions, including working conditions and difficulties related to the family environment of farmers. There is a need to strengthen suicide prevention with training programs among the agricultural population. We also note the major importance of improving access to mental health care which is often very deficient in rural areas. (C) 2019 L'Encephale, Paris.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Imagery Using Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites provide multi-spectral optical remote sensing images with four bands at 10 m of spatial resolution. These images, due to the open data distribution policy, are becoming an important resource for several applications. However, for small scale studies, the spatial detail of these images might not be sufficient. On the other hand, WorldView commercial satellites offer multi-spectral images with a very high spatial resolution, typically less than 2 m, but their use can be impractical for large areas or multi-temporal analysis due to their high cost. To exploit the free availability of Sentinel imagery, it is worth considering deep learning techniques for single-image super-resolution tasks, allowing the spatial enhancement of low-resolution (LR) images by recovering high-frequency details to produce high-resolution (HR) super-resolved images. In this work, we implement and train a model based on the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) with pairs of WorldView-Sentinel images to generate a super-resolved multispectral Sentinel-2 output with a scaling factor of 5. Our model, named RS-ESRGAN, removes the upsampling layers of the network to make it feasible to train with co-registered remote sensing images. Results obtained outperform state-of-the-art models using standard metrics like PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS, SAM and CC. Moreover, qualitative visual analysis shows spatial improvements as well as the preservation of the spectral information, allowing the super-resolved Sentinel-2 imagery to be used in studies requiring very high spatial resolution.

TI  - Remote characterization of photosynthetic communities in the Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the spatial distribution, spectral properties and temporal variability of primary producers (e.g. communities of microbial mats and mosses) throughout the Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, using high-resolution multispectral remote-sensing data. Our results suggest that photosynthetic communities can be readily detected throughout the Fryxell basin based on their unique near-infrared spectral signatures. Observed intra- and inter-annual variability in spectral signatures are consistent with short-term variations in mat distribution, hydration and photosynthetic activity. Spectral unmixing is also implemented in order to estimate mat abundance, with the most densely vegetated regions observed from orbit correlating spatially with some of the most productive regions of the Fryxell basin. Our work establishes remote sensing as a valuable tool in the study of these ecological communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and demonstrates how future scientific investigations and the management of specially protected areas could benefit from these tools and techniques.

TI  - Quality Assessment of PROBA-V Surface Albedo V1 for the Continuity of the Copernicus Climate Change Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) includes estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) as a series of Climate Data Records (CDRs) derived from satellite data. The C3S Surface Albedo (SA) v1.0 CDR is composed of observations from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) (1981-2005), and VEGETATION sensors onboard Satellites for the Observation of the Earth (SPOT/VGT) (1998-2014) and Project for Onboard Autonomy satellite (PROBA-V) (2014-2020), and will continue with Sentinel-3 (from 2020 onwards). The goal of this study is to assess the uncertainties associated with the C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0 product, with a focus on the transition from SPOT/VGT to PROBA-V. The methodology followed the good practices recommended by the Land Product Validation sub-group (LPV) of the Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) of the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) for the validation of satellite-derived global albedo products. Several performance criteria were evaluated, including an intercomparison with National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) MCD43A3 C6 products. C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0 and MCD43A3 C6 showed similar completeness but had higher fractions of missing data than C3S SPOT/VGT SA v1.0. C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0 showed similar precision (similar to 1%) to MCD43A3 C6, improving the results of SPOT/VGT SA v1.0 (2-3%), but C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0 provided residual noise in the near-infrared (NIR). Good spatio-temporal continuity between C3S PROBA-V and SPOT/VGT SA v1.0 products was found with a mean bias between +/- 2%. The comparison with MCD43A3 C6 showed positive mean biases (5%, 8%, and 12% for visible, NIR and total shortwave, respectively). The accuracy assessment with ground measurements showed a median error of 18.4% with systematic overestimation (positive bias of 11.5%). The percentage of PROBA-V retrievals complying with the C3S target requirements was 28.6%.

TI  - Role of dynamic thermography in diagnosis of nodal involvement in patients with breast cancer: A pilot study
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The existing standard method of axillary nodal staging in breast cancer is sentinel lymph node biopsy using tracing agents such as blue dye or radioisotope. However, there are some drawbacks to using these agents such as skin tattooing and adverse reactions caused by blue dye and radiation risk posed by radioisotopes. Considering tumor biology, digital infrared thermal imaging may aid in detecting metastatic lymph nodes and staging axillary nodal disease while refraining from these disadvantages.Patients and methods: In this pilot study, 26 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of breast were enrolled. Prior to surgical intervention, axillary region was evaluated by digital infrared thermal imaging after 2 min of cold stress. Diagnostic potential of dynamic thermography was assessed.Results: Dynamic thermography achieved sensitivity of 83% and the false negative rate was 16%. Thermal analysis was superior to ultrasound, mammography and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of detecting metastatic lymph nodes.Conclusion: The proposed research protocol of dynamic thermography was found to be workable. Digital infrared thermal imaging of axillary region seems promising and can render valuable staging information in the era of minimally invasive surgery.

TI  - Risk Factors for Complications and Long-Term Outcomes Following Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Cutaneous Melanoma: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for malignant melanoma is performed for regional cancer control and is associated with a high complication rate. It is unknown whether post-operative complications influence cancer recurrence or survival. Our aim was to evaluate the risk factors for short- and long-term complications after CLND, and to determine whether complications affect recurrence or survival.Method: We performed a retrospective cohort study including all melanoma patients who underwent CLND in the Stockholm region during 2005-2014. Patient and cancer characteristics were collected from medical records, as were clinical outcomes. Assessment was performed by multivariate logistic regression.Results: Among 144 patients, the risk of any post-operative one year complication was 68.8%. Lymphedema (41.0%), infection (37.5 %), and seroma (31.3 %) were the most common complications. Diabetes and inguinal CLND were associated with nine- and ten-fold increased risks of post-operative complications (p<0.05), respectively. Complications were linked to an increased risk of recurrent cancer (p<0.05), median follow-up time of 49 months, but did not appear to affect five-year survival.Conclusion: Post-operative complications are common in melanoma patients undergoing CLND. Strong risk factors for complications are diabetes and inguinal CLND. Post-operative complications appear to be associated with increased risks of recurrent cancer, but the mechanism is unknown.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Assessment of Irrigation Performance of the Kou Valley Irrigation Scheme in Burkina Faso Using Satellite Remote Sensing-Derived Indicators
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods based on field campaigns are generally used to assess the performance of irrigation schemes in Burkina Faso, resulting in labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly processes. Despite their extensive application for such performance assessment, remote sensing (RS)-based approaches remain very much underutilized in Burkina Faso. Using multi-temporal Landsat images within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model, we investigated the spatiotemporal performance patterns of the Kou Valley irrigation scheme (KVIS) during two consecutive cropping seasons. Four performance indicators (depleted fraction, relative evapotranspiration, uniformity of water consumption, and crop water productivity) for rice, maize, and sweet potato were calculated and compared against standard values. Overall, the performance of the KVIS varied depending on year, crop, and the crop's geographical position in the irrigation scheme. A gradient of spatially varied relative evapotranspiration was observed across the scheme, with the uniformity of water consumption being fair to good. Although rice was the most cultivated, a shift to more sweet potato farming could be adopted to benefit more from irrigation, given the relatively good performance achieved by this crop. Our findings ascertain the potential of such RS-based cost-effective methodologies to serve as basis for improved irrigation water management in decision support tools.

TI  - Spatial variability of the aerosol optical thickness over Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica: Comparison with MODIS and MERRA-2 aerosol products
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols scatter or absorb incoming solar radiation and alter the earth's radiation budget. The Southern Ocean provides an excellent environment to study the natural/background aerosols and teleconnection with other regions of the world through long-range transport. Measurements of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) (in the wavelength range 380-1020 nm) have been carried out during a 10th Southern Ocean expedition, between 20 degrees-67 degrees S, during December 2017-February 2018, onboard chartered ice-class vessel SA Agulhas. AOT (500 nm) in the range similar to 0.04-0.17 and an Angstrom parameter (alpha) (turbidity coefficient (beta)) in the range similar to 0.03-1.29 (0.02-0.05) were observed and values decrease with the increase in latitude towards the Antarctic coast, indicative of a clean environment. AOT versus a scatter plot reveals broadly two classes, fine mode and coarse mode but exhibits different optical properties in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic coast. The HYSPLIT air mass back trajectory analysis shows that for the measurement location between 30 degrees - 60 degrees S, the origin of air masses is from the South Atlantic Ocean, whereas measurement locations between 60 degrees-70 degrees S are influenced by sources from Antarctica with no long-range transport of aerosols from other significant landmasses. The AOT data south of 30 degrees is sparse and ship-based data are the only source to validate satellite and modelled AOT. Comparison of sunphotometer AOT with collection 6.1 MODIS (TERRA) AOT reveals a Mean Bias Error (MBE) in the range -0.01 to -0.1 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in the range 0.02- to 0.1. Similarly, comparison with MERRA-2 reanalysis AOT shows the MBE (RMSE) in the range 0 to -0.11 (0.02-0.11). Both the MODIS (TERRA) and MERRA-2 reanalysis are found to underestimate AOT and show maximum errors (in terms of MBE and RMSE) in the 50 degrees S-60 degrees S latitude band.

TI  - Spatial and temporal evolution of co-seismic landslides after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large earthquakes in mountainous regions often trigger widespread landslides, some of which remain active for years to decades. This study has evaluated the spatial and temporal evolution of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake-induced landslides using pre-earthquake and post-earthquake landslide inventories. Temporal landslide inventories were developed from the SPOT satellite images, using the visual image interpretation supported with field validation. It is observed that after the earthquake, the landslide area and number showed a surge, however, decays in the subsequent years. The rate of decline in the landslide area was relatively slower until 2010, however, it dropped considerably during 2010-2018. The spatial variation of the landslides was traced and analyzed to classify them based on the activity. The temporal evolution of the landslides was compared with the geology, earthquake triggering fault and topographic attributes of slope, aspect, and elevation, to evaluate their influence on the distribution of landslides. The landslide inventories were related to the major triggering factors including rainfall and earthquakes, to determine their impact on the temporal dynamics of the landslides. Regeneration of vegetation is analyzed using the temporal NDVI images as one of the drivers for the decline in the landslide area. The knowledge of temporal dynamics of landslides and their major contributing factors shall assist to understand their triggering mechanism and effective mitigation measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Application of Fengyun-4 Satellite to Flood Disaster Monitoring through a Rapid Multi-Temporal Synthesis Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A(FY-4A) belongs to the second generation of geostationary meteorological satellite series in China. Its observations with high frequency and resolution provide a better data basis for monitoring of extreme weather such as sudden flood disasters. In this study, the flood disasters occurred in Bangladesh, India, and some other areas of South Asia in August 2018 were investigated by using a rapid multi-temporal synthesis approach for the first time for removal of thick clouds inFY-4Aimages. The maximum between-class variance algorithm (OTSU; developed by Otsu in 2007) and linear spectral unmixing methods are used to extract the water area of flood disasters. The accuracy verification shows that the water area of flood disasters extracted fromFY-4Ais highly correlated with that from the high-resolution satellite datasetsGaofen-1(GF-1) andSentinel-1A, with the square correlation coefficientR(2)reaching 0.9966. The average extraction accuracy ofFY-4Ais over 90%. With the rapid multi-temporal synthesis approach used in flood disaster monitoring withFY-4Asatellite data, advantages of the wide coverage, fast acquisition, and strong timeliness with geostationary meteorological satellites are effectively combined. Through the synthesis of multi-temporal images of the flood water body, the influence of clouds is effectively eliminated, which is of great significance for the real-time flood monitoring. This also provides an important service guarantee for the disaster prevention and reduction as well as economic and social development in China and the Asia-Pacific region.

TI  - Characterization and Estimation of Dates Palm Trees in an Urban Area Using GIS-Based Least-Squares Model and Minimum Noise Fraction Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Date palm is the major food source and possesses an important role in the economic aspects, environmental parts, and society. These crops were subjected to degradation due to the financial and numerous military conflicts. Because of the expensive cost of monitoring and managing date palm in field measurements, and limited studies using satellite images, the authors proposed a method to estimate and map date palm using the Landsat-8 satellite images. The authors applied the least-squares multiple regression and GIS techniques to find suitable predictors from the set of variables such as original bands of Landsat-8, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, tasseled cap component transformation, and spectral index. In order to validate the proposed method, the field measurement data were utilized to assess the estimated date palm from the Landsat-8 images. A linear combination of MNF Landsat-8 band 4 (red, 0.636-0.673 mu m), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were the best date palm predictor (R2adj= 0.988, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 0.013). The results demonstrate that the MNF Landsat-8 images in the least square regression help improve the date palm estimation and mapping for the practical use in the study area with high accuracy.

TI  - Integrating Perspectives to Understand Lake Ice Dynamics in a Changing World
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cover plays a critical role in physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes in lakes. Despite its importance, winter limnology remains relatively understudied. Here, we provide a primer on the predominant drivers of freshwater lake ice cover and the current methodologies used to study lake ice, including in situ and remote sensing observations, physical based models, and experiments. We highlight opportunities for future research by integrating these four disciplines to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of lake ice dynamics in changing winters. Advances in technology, data integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration will allow the field to move toward developing global forecasts of lake ice cover for small to large lakes across broad spatial and temporal scales, quantifying ice quality and ice thickness, moving from binary to continuous ice records, and determining how winter ice conditions and quality impact ecosystem processes in lakes over winter. Ultimately, integrating disciplines will improve our ability to understand the impacts of changing winters on lake ice.Plain Language Summary Lakes are experiencing accelerated rates of warming, including shorter seasonal duration of ice cover, later ice-on, earlier ice-off, and in some years no ice cover at all. Lake ice has been historically studied independently by four subdisciplines: observations by in situ and remote sensing scientists, controlled mesocosm experiments by limnologists, and process-based models by physical modelers. Here, we highlight opportunities for collaboration between disciplines and provide guidelines to successfully integrate the disciplines to tackle the most urgent questions surrounding lake ice loss in warming climates.

TI  - Characterizing regional aerosol pollution in central China based on 19 years of MODIS data: Spatiotemporal variation and aerosol type discrimination
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the frequent occurrence of haze with aerosol pollution in China has attracted worldwide attention. Air pollutant emissions in conjunction with changing meteorological conditions create environment pollution in China. Aerosol pollution is spatially centralized in four regions of China, including the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan Basin. In this observational study, a new center of aerosol pollution was identified in the Twain-Hu Basin (THB), covering the Hubei and Hunan provinces in central China. Based on the analysis of 19 years of satellite remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the THB experiences high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values exceeding 0.9. The fine mode fraction (FMF) values below 0.3 were also detected over the aerosol polluted THB region, where aerosol pollution was dominated by the mixed aerosol type. This reflects the role of intense human activities and the unique aerosol processes involved in the regional aerosol pollution over central China. The interannual AOD variations for THB present an increasing trend (mostly >0.02 yr(-1)) between 2000 and 2011 and a significant descending trend (mostly < -0.06 yr(-1)) between 2011 and 2018. This inverse trends in AOD with an overall increasing trend in FMF characterizes the past 19 years. This highlights the contribution of the increase in submicron particles and meteorological effects to the regional aerosol concentrations during recent years when considering the reduced anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the THB.

TI  - Quantifying the Actual Impacts of Forest Cover Change on Surface Temperature in Guangdong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change is critical in the regulation of global and regional climate change through the alteration of biophysical features across the Earth's surface. The accurate assessment of forest cover change can improve our understanding of its roles in the regulation processes of surface temperature. In spite of this, few researchers have attempted to discern the varying effects of multiple satellite-derived forest changes on local surface temperatures. In this study, we quantified the actual contributions of forest loss and gain associated with evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo to local surface temperature in Guangdong Province, China using an improved spatiotemporal change pattern analysis method, and explored the interrelationships between surface temperature and air temperature change. We specifically developed three forest change products for Guangdong, combining satellite observations from Landsat, PALSAR, and MODIS for comparison. Our results revealed that the adjusted simple change detection (SCD)-based Landsat/PALSAR forest cover data performed relatively well. We found that forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2010 had opposite effects on land surface temperature (LST), ET, and albedo. Forest gain led to a cooling of -0.12 +/- 0.01 degrees C, while forest loss led to a warming of 0.07 +/- 0.01 degrees C, which were opposite to the anomalous change of air temperature. A reduced warming to a considerable cooling was estimated due to the forest gain and loss across latitudes. Specifically, mid-subtropical forest gains increased LST by 0.25 +/- 0.01 degrees C, while tropical forest loss decreased LST by -0.16 +/- 0.05 degrees C, which can demonstrate the local differences in an overall cooling. ET induced cooling and warming effects were appropriate for most forest gain and loss. Meanwhile, the nearby temperature changes caused by no-change land cover types more or less canceled out some of the warming and cooling. Albedo exhibited negligible and complex impacts. The other two products (i.e., the GlobeLand30 and MCD12Q1) affect the magnitude of temperature response due to the discrepancies in forest definition, methodology, and data resolution. This study highlights the non-negligible contributions of high-resolution maps and a robust temperature response model in the quantification of the extent to which forest gain reverses the climate effects of forest loss under global warming.

T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is a core technology in weather forecast and disaster mitigation. China's NWP research and operational applications have been attached great importance by the meteorological community. Fundamental achievements have been made in the theories, methods, and NWP model development in China, which are of certain international impacts. In this paper, the scientific and technological progress of NWP in China since 1949 is summarized. The current status and recent progress of the domestically developed NWP system-GRAPES (Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System) are presented. Through independent research and development in the past 10 years, the operational GRAPES system has been established, which includes both regional and global deterministic and ensemble prediction models, with resolutions of 3-10 km for regional and 25-50 km for global forecasts. Major improvements include establishment of a new non-hydrostatic dynamic core, setup of four-dimensional variational data assimilation, and development of associated satellite application. As members of the GRAPES system, prediction models for atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, tropical cyclones, and ocean waves have also been developed and put into operational use. The GRAPES system has been an important milestone in NWP science and technology in China.

TI  - Strong shrub expansion in tundra-taiga, tree infilling in taiga and stable tundra in central Chukotka (north-eastern Siberia) between 2000 and 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is responding to climate change, which is especially prominent in the Arctic. Vegetation change is manifest in different ways and varies regionally, depending on the characteristics of the investigated area. Although vegetation in some Arctic areas has been thoroughly investigated, central Chukotka (NE Siberia) with its highly diverse vegetation, mountainous landscape and deciduous needle-leaf treeline remains poorly explored, despite showing strong greening in remote-sensing products. Here we quantify recent vegetation compositional changes in central Chukotka over 15 years between 2000/2001/2002 and 2016/2017. We numerically related field-derived information on foliage projective cover (percentage cover) of different plant taxa from 52 vegetation plots to remote-sensing derived (Landsat) spectral indices (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI)) using constrained ordination. Clustering of ordination scores resulted in four land-cover classes: (1) larch closed-canopy forest, (2) forest tundra and shrub tundra, (3) graminoid tundra and (4) prostrate herb tundra and barren areas. We produced land-cover maps for early (2000, 2001 or 2002) and recent (2016 or 2017) time-slices for four focus regions along the tundra-taiga vegetation gradient. Transition from graminoid tundra to forest tundra and shrub tundra is interpreted as shrubification and amounts to 20% area increase in the tundra-taiga zone and 40% area increase in the northern taiga. Major contributors of shrubification are alder, dwarf birch and some species of the heather family. Land-cover change from the forest tundra and shrub tundra class to the larch closed-canopy forest class is interpreted as tree infilling and is notable in the northern taiga. We find almost no land-cover changes in the present treeless tundra.

TI  - Accuracy Assessments of Local and Global Forest Change Data to Estimate Annual Disturbances in Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances are generally estimated using globally available forest change maps or locally calibrated disturbance maps. The choice of disturbance map depends on the trade-offs among the detection accuracy, processing time, and expert knowledge. However, the accuracy differences between global and local maps have still not been fully investigated; therefore, their optimal use for estimating forest disturbances has not been clarified. This study assesses the annual forest disturbance detection of an available Global Forest Change map and a local disturbance map based on a Landsat temporal segmentation algorithm in areas dominated by harvest disturbances. We assess the forest disturbance detection accuracies based on two reference datasets in each year. We also use a polygon-based assessment to investigate the thematic accuracy based on each disturbance patch. As a result, we found that the producer's and user's accuracies of disturbances in the Global Forest Change map were 30.1-76.8% and 50.5-90.2%, respectively, for 2001-2017, which corresponded to 78.3-92.5% and 88.8-97.1%, respectively in the local disturbance map. These values indicate that the local disturbance map achieved more stable and higher accuracies. The polygon-based assessment showed that larger disturbances were likely to be accurately detected in both maps; however, more small-scale disturbances were at least partially detected by the Global Forest Change map with a higher commission error. Overall, the local disturbance map had higher forest disturbance detection accuracies. However, for forest disturbances larger than 3 ha, the Global Forest Change map achieved comparable accuracies. In conclusion, the Global Forest Change map can be used to detect larger forest disturbances, but it should be used cautiously because of the substantial commission error for small-scale disturbances and yearly variations in estimated areas and accuracies.

TI  - Parameters of Regional Media Discourse: Subject, Communicative Situation, Context Structure
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the main characteristics of regional media discourse defined on the basis of Teun. A. van Dijk's cognitive discourse theory. The article focuses on three aspects: the types of subjects of social action; features of the media text; and the context structure of regional media discourse. The author proposes to introduce a regulatory goal setting along with the cognitive one into the media discourse functioning model. This change influences the ultimate goal of media functioning. According to the author, apart from giving information, journalists and their articles have an important task of encouraging social action. Therefore, the article concentrates on the types of subjects of social action, but not on the types of authors of media texts. Subjects of social action are: institution, person, media, and society. All of them (except for society) can act both as authors and main characters in media texts. Society is the only subject of the media field that is symbolic. Its function is to give an ethical assessment of the content of the media message. Mass audience is characterised as generally passive, and it is not able to become the subject of media discourse. It leads to the fact that the opponent (interlocutor) of the author cannot take part in shaping the content and developing the dynamics of regional media discourse, like in oral discourse. The characters of the texts, i.e. subjects of social action, do it, depending on how the author presented them. As a result, the images of subjects become dramatic. Thus, the main communicative factor in shaping media discourse is the activity of the mass media and the authors. The text is an elementary unit of media discourse. The text takes up the functions of a communicative situation and can fill gaps: it can help reconstruct some characteristics of the simulated speech communication. The media text (in the intended role characteristics of the consumer) contains conditions for the consumption of the mass product. The importance of the context increases in the conditions when a typical situation becomes equal to the text of a media message. In accordance with regulatory goal setting, the structure of the media context is as follows: the event-related context layer is on the surface, the social is deeper and leads to the development of social change in the actions and the worldview of the consumer, and the cultural media context is the most profound and penetrating. All layers of the media context are closely intertwined and connected with each other.

TI  - Quantitative Constraints on Faulting and Fault Slip Rates in the Northern Main Ethiopian Rift
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Boset magmatic segment (BMS) of the northern Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) is an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the kinematics, interaction, and rates of activity within a fault network in a magma-rich rift. In this paper we take advantage of the availability of (1) high-resolution remote sensing data (LiDAR, ASTER); (2) absolute age chronology on offset reference surfaces; and (3) well-exposed active normal fault arrays to place new constraints on rift kinematics and strain distribution, and to quantify the architecture and fault slip rates at different temporal scales within a magmatic segment. We found that the rift border faults strike approximately NE, while the younger faults in the rift segments strike NNE. Analyses of geometric rift parameters show that the axial active part of the rift is transtensional with an increase of the shear component northward. The fault displacement analyses and displacement:length ratios increase toward the segment tips, suggesting a significant contribution of fault growth by linkage. In contrast, magmatism is focused on the segment center and localized to a narrow zone. Estimated fault slip rates vary, with rates of up to similar to 0.37 mm/year in similar to 0.3 Ma old rift floor deposits, whereas higher rates of up to similar to 4.4 mm/year are observed for faults cutting through similar to 6 Ka lavas. The difference in slip rates indicates short-term variability or a very active recent episode compared to long-term low average slip rates.

TI  - The Formulation of Methylene Blue Encapsulated, Tc-99m Labeled Multifunctional Liposomes for Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging and Therapy
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Methylene blue (MB) is a commonly used dye that can be used for near-infrared (NIR) imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) by producing reactive oxygen species after light exposure, inducing apoptosis. The limiting factor of MB is its poor penetration through cell membranes. Its decreased cellular uptake can be prevented by encapsulation in drug delivery systems such as liposomes. Additionally, the enhanced permeability and retention effect of tumors enables enhanced accumulation of nanocarriers at the target site.Materials and Methods: Nanosized, MB encapsulated, Tc-99m radiolabeled Lipoid S PC:PEG2000-PE:Chol: DTPA-PE and DPPC:PEG2000-PE:Chol:DTPA-PE liposomes were formulated to design multifunctional theranostic nanocarriers for: 1) NIR imaging, 2) gamma probe detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), and 3) PDT, which can provide accurate imaging and therapy helping surgery with a single liposomal system. The characterization of liposomes was performed by measuring particle size, zeta potential, phospholipid content, and encapsulation efficiency. Additionally, the in vitro release profile of MB and physical stability were also evaluated over 6 months at determined time intervals by measuring the mean particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and phospholipid content of liposomes kept at room temperature (25 degrees C) and 4 degrees C.Results: Tc-99m radiolabeled, nanosized Lipoid S PC:PEG2000-PE:Chol:DTPA-PE and DPPC:PEG2000-PE:Chol:DTPA-PE liposomes showed suitable particle size (around 100 nm), zeta potential (-9 to-13 mV), encapsulation efficiency (around 10%), phospholipid efficiency (around 8590%), and release profiles. Additionally, the liposomes found stable for 3 months especially when kept at 4 degrees C.Conclusion: MB encapsulated, Tc-99m radiolabeled, nanosized Lipoid S PC:PEG2000-PE:Chol:DTPA-PE and DPPC:PEG2000-PE:Chol:DTPA-PE liposomes were found to have potential for SLN imaging by gamma probe detection, NIR imaging, and PDT. In vitro and in vivo imaging and therapeutic efficiency should be definitely evaluated to enable a final decision and our studies on this research topic are continuing.

TI  - Moving from plot-based to hillslope-scale assessments of savanna vegetation structure with long-range terrestrial laser scanning (LR-TLS)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable quantification of savanna vegetation structure is critical for accurate carbon accounting and biodiversity assessment under changing climate and land-use conditions. Inventories of fine-scale vegetation structural attributes are typically conducted from field-based plots or transects, while large-area monitoring relies on a combination of airborne and satellite remote sensing. Both of these approaches have their strengths and limitations, but terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has emerged as the benchmark for vegetation structural parameterization - recording and quantifying 3D structural detail that is not possible from manual field-based or airborne/spaceborne methods. However, traditional TLS approaches suffer from similar spatial constraints as field-based inventories. Given their small areal coverage, standard TLS plots may fail to capture the heterogeneity of landscapes in which they are embedded. Here we test the potential of long-range (> 2000 m) terrestrial laser scanning (LR-TLS) to provide rapid and robust assessment of savanna vegetation 3D structure at hillslope scales. We used LR-TLS to sample entire savanna hillslopes from topographic vantage points and collected coincident plot-scale (1 ha) TLS scans at increasing distances from the LR-TLS station. We merged multiple TLS scans at the plot scale to provide the reference structure, and evaluated how 3D metrics derived from LR-TLS deviated from this baseline with increasing distance. Our results show that despite diluted point density and increased beam divergence with distance, LR-TLS can reliably characterize tree height (RMSE = 0.25-1.45 m) and canopy cover (RMSE = 5.67-15.91%) at distances of up to 500 m in open savanna woodlands. When aggregated to the same sampling grain as leading spaceborne vegetation products (10-30 m), our findings show potential for LR-TLS to play a key role in constraining satellite-based structural estimates in savannas over larger areas than traditional TLS sampling can provide.

TI  - Mapping Understory Invasive Plants in Urban Forests with Spectral and Temporal Unmixing of Landsat Imagery
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful eradication and management of invasive plants require frequent and accurate maps. Detection of invasive plants is difficult at moderate resolution because target species are often located in the forest understory among other vegetation types, and so produce mixed spectral signatures. Spectral unmixing approaches can help to decompose these spectral mixtures; however, they are typically applied to only one or a few images, and thus neglect phenological variability that may improve invasive species discrimination. We compared two approaches to multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis for detecting Ligustrum sinense in the southeastern United States: the use of temporal signatures of endmembers from full and select-date normalized difference vegetation index time series, and conventional spectral unmixing using a single image date. Our results suggest that using temporal signatures from all available imagery may be a good choice, with minimal impact to achievable accuracy, if a priori information on phenological differences between endmembers is unavailable, or imagery for periods of high phenological difference are unavailable.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane crop identification and crop distribution information provides an important basis for crop acreage and yield estimation. In this study three methods i.e. object-based classification, multi-date supervised classification and knowledge-based classification methods were used for the analysis of multi-temporal LISS-III and single date LISS-IV image of Resourcesat-2A satellite. The comparison of classification results showed that planted sugarcane area overlapping was ranging from 79.30% to 91.66% and ratoon sugarcane area overlapping was ranging from 61.17% to 79.44%. Further, the classification results for planted and ratoon sugarcane at pixel levels were integrated to increase the reliability of results using the decision tree method. The integration of all the three classification results increased the overall accuracy that was 86.15% with kappa coefficient of 0.73. The use of remote sensing techniques to extract the sugarcane field information is an economically effective method that can be further used for modelling crop production in the region, forecast crop production and management of resources.

TI  - Identifying floods and flood-affected paddy rice fields in Bangladesh based on Sentinel-1 imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, flooding is the leading cause of natural disaster related deaths, especially in Bangladesh where approximately one third of national area gets flooded annually by overflowing rivers during the monsoon season, which drastically affects paddy rice agriculture and food security. However, existing studies on the pattern of floods and their impact on agriculture in Bangladesh are limited. Here we examined the spatiotemporal pattern of floods for the country during 2014-2018 using all the available Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We also identified the flood-affected paddy rice fields by integrating the flooding areas and remote sensing-based paddy rice planting areas. Our results indicate that flooding is frequent in northeastern Bangladesh and along the three major rivers, the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. Between 2014 and 2018, the flood-affected paddy rice areas accounted for 1.61-18.17% of the total paddy rice area. The satellite-based detection of floods and flood-affected paddy rice fields advance our understanding of the annual dynamics of flooding in Bangladesh, which is essential for adaptation and mitigation strategies where severe annual floods threaten human lives, properties, and agricultural production.

TI  - Near-real time forecasting and change detection for an open ecosystem with complex natural dynamics
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing fire, water, biodiversity and carbon stocks can greatly benefit from early warning of changes in the state of vegetation. While near-real time tools to detect forest change based on satellite remote sensing exist, these ecosystems have relatively stable natural vegetation dynamics. Open (i.e. non-forest) ecosystems like grasslands, savannas and shrublands are more challenging as they show complex natural dynamics due to factors such as fire, postfire recovery, greater contribution of bare soil to observed vegetation indices, as well as high sensitivity to rainfall and strong seasonality. Tools to aid the management of open ecosystems are desperately required as they dominate much of the globe and harbour substantial biodiversity and carbon. We present an innovative approach that overcomes the difficulties posed by open ecosystems by using a spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model that uses data on climate, topography, soils and fire history to generate ecological forecasts of the expected land surface signal under natural conditions. This allows us to monitor and detect abrupt or gradual changes in the state of an ecosystem in near-real time by identifying areas where the observed vegetation signal has deviated from the expected natural variation. We apply our approach to a case study from the hyperdiverse fire-dependent African shrubland, the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and UNESCO World Heritage Site that faces a number of threats to vegetation health and ecosystem function. The case study demonstrates that our approach is useful for identifying a range of change agents such as fire, alien plant species invasions, drought, pathogen outbreaks and clearing of vegetation. We describe and provide our full workflow, including an interactive web application. Our approach is highly versatile, allowing us to collect data on the impacts of change agents for research in ecology and earth system science, and to predict aspects of ecosystem structure and function such as biomass, fire return interval and the influence of vegetation on hydrology.

TI  - Sentinel-3A/B SLSTR Pre-Launch Calibration of the Thermal InfraRed Channels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first two models of the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometers (SLSTR) for the European Copernicus Sentinel-3 missions were tested prior to launch at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory space instrument calibration facility. The pre-launch tests provide an essential reference that ensures that the flight data of SLSTR are calibrated to the same standards needed for surface temperature measurements and to those used by shipborne radiometers for Fiducial Reference Measurement (FRM). The radiometric calibrations of the thermal infrared channels were validated against accurate and traceable reference BB sources under flight representative thermal vacuum environment. Measurements were performed in both earth views for source temperatures covering the main operating range, for different instrument configurations and for the full field-of-view of the instruments. The data were used to derive non-linearity curves to be used in the level-1 processing. All results showed that the measured brightness temperatures and radiometric noise agreed within the requirements for the mission. An inconsistency that particularly affected SLSTR-A was observed which has been attributed to an internal stray light error. A correction for the stray light has been proposed to reduce the error. The internal stray light error was reduced for SLSTR-B by replacing the coating on the main aperture stop. We present a description of the test methodology and the key results.

TI  - Mass-balance observation, reconstruction and sensitivity of Stok glacier, Ladakh region, India, between 1978 and 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first-ever mass-balance (MB) observation (2014-19), reconstruction (between 1978 and 2019) and sensitivity of debris-free Stok glacier (33.98 degrees N, 77.45 degrees E), Ladakh Region, India. In-situ MB was negative throughout the study period except in 2018/19 when the glacier witnessed a balanced condition. For MB modelling, three periods were considered based on the available data. Period I (1978-87, 1988/89) witnessed a near balance condition (-0.03 +/- 0.35 m w.e. a(-1)) with five positive MB years. Whereas Period II (1998-2002, 2003-09) and III (2011-19) experienced high (-0.9 +/- 0.35 m w.e. a(-1)) and moderate (-0.46 +/- 0.35 m w.e. a(-1)) negative MBs, respectively. Glacier area for these periods was derived from the Corona, Landsat and PlanetScope imageries using a semi-automatic approach. The in-situ and modelled MBs were in good agreement with RMSE of 0.23 m w.e. a(-1),R-2= 0.92, P< 0.05. The average mass loss was moderate (-0.47 +/- 0.35 m w.e. a(-1)) over 28 hydrological years between 1978 and 2019. Sensitivity analysis showed that the glacier was more sensitive to summer temperature (-0.32 m w.e. a(-1)degrees C-1) and winter precipitation (0.12 m w.e. a(-1)for +/- 10%). It was estimated that similar to 27% increase in precipitation is required on Stok glacier to compensate for the mass loss due to 1 degrees C rise in temperature.

TI  - Using UAV-Based SOPC Derived LAI and SAFY Model for Biomass and Yield Estimation of Winter Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of sub-field yield potential is critical for guiding precision farming. The recently developed simulated observation of point cloud (SOPC) method can generate high spatial resolution winter wheat effective leaf area index (SOPC-LAIe) maps from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based point cloud data without ground-based measurements. In this study, the SOPC-LAIe maps, for the first time, were applied to the simple algorithm for yield estimation (SAFY) to generate the sub-field biomass and yield maps. First, the dry aboveground biomass (DAM) measurements were used to determine the crop cultivar-specific parameters and simulated green leaf area index (LAI) in the SAFY model. Then, the SOPC-LAIe maps were converted to green LAI using a normalization approach. Finally, the multiple SOPC-LAIe maps were applied to the SAFY model to generate the final DAM and yield maps. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated and measured yield is 88 g/m2, and the relative root mean squire error (RRMSE) is 15.2%. The pixel-based DAM and yield map generated in this study revealed clearly the within-field yield variation. This framework using the UAV-based SOPC-LAIe maps and SAFY model could be a simple and low-cost alternative for final yield estimation at the sub-field scale.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Phytoplankton Primary Production in Baltic Lakes Using Sentinel-3 OLCI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton primary production (PP) in lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, monitoring the PP in lakes with traditional complicated and costly in situ sampling methods are impossible due to the large number of lakes worldwide (estimated to be 117 million lakes). In this study, bio-optical modelling and remote sensing data (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) was combined to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of PP in four Baltic lakes during 2018. The model used has three input parameters: concentration of chlorophyll-a, the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and incident downwelling irradiance. The largest of our studied lakes, Vortsjarv (270 km(2)), had the highest total yearly estimated production (61 Gg C y(-1)) compared to the smaller lakes Lubans (18 Gg C y(-1)) and Razna (7 Gg C y(-1)). However, the most productive was the smallest studied, Lake Burtnieks (40.2 km(2)); although the total yearly production was 13 Gg C y(-1), the daily average areal production was 910 mg C m(-2)d(-1)in 2018. Even if lake size plays a significant role in the total PP of the lake, the abundance of small and medium-sized lakes would sum up to a significant contribution of carbon fixation. Our method is applicable to larger regions to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of lake PP.

TI  - Application of Empirical Land-Cover Changes to Construct Climate Change Scenarios in Federally Managed Lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sagebrush-dominant ecosystems in the western United States are highly vulnerable to climatic variability. To understand how these ecosystems will respond under potential future conditions, we correlated changes in National Land Cover Dataset "Back-in-Time" fractional cover maps from 1985-2018 with Daymet climate data in three federally managed preserves in the sagebrush steppe ecosystem: Beaty Butte Herd Management Area, Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, and Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge. Future (2018 to 2050) abundance and distribution of vegetation cover were modeled at a 300-m resolution under a business-as-usual climate (BAU) scenario and a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 climate change scenario. Spatially explicit map projections suggest that climate influences may make the landscape more homogeneous in the near future. Specifically, projections indicate that pixels with high bare ground cover become less bare ground dominant, pixels with moderate herbaceous cover contain less herbaceous cover, and pixels with low shrub cover contain more shrub cover. General vegetation patterns and composition do not differ dramatically between scenarios despite RCP 8.5 projections of +1.2 degrees C mean annual minimum temperatures and +7.6 mm total annual precipitation. Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge is forecast to undergo the most change, with both models projecting larger declines in bare ground and larger increases in average herbaceous and shrub cover compared to Beaty Butte Herd Management Area and Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge. These scenarios present plausible future outcomes intended to guide federal land managers to identify vegetation cover changes that may affect habitat condition and availability for species of interest.

T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare, but life-threatening cause of intramural hematoma of the esophagus (IHE). Typical clinical presentation of AEF includes midthoracic pain and sentinel hemorrhage followed by massive, often fatal, hematemesis, with the period between sentinel hemorrhage and massive hematemesis generally varying from hours to days. This is a case of a 61-year-old male who presented with chest pain after development of an aortoesophageal fistula and associated intramural hematoma of the esophagus. The fistula and associated hematoma were initially mischaracterized on imaging, and went undiagnosed for approximately 2 weeks before being iatrogenically disrupted during endoscopy. Though this case was successfully treated, aortoesophageal fistulas are associated with a high mortality, and aortoesophageal fistula/intramural hematoma of the esophagus should always be considered in the differential of an esophageal mass.

TI  - POTENTIAL FISHING ZONES ESTIMATION BASED ON APPROACH OF AREA MATCHING BETWEEN THERMAL FRONT AND MESOTROPHIC AREA
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) has undergone many developments, including parameter suitability selection. The thermal front has become the primary parameter input of ZPPI (LAPAN's PFZ). The accuracy of the thermal front parameter to predict PFZ cannot be known with certainty because of the radius between ZPPI with fishing areas, so it is necessary to develop parameters to support the thermal front. The thermal front described the meeting area of two water masses with different temperature characteristics associated with high nutrients (chlorophyll-a) and indicate an upwelling's appearance. This study aims to determine ZPPI by approaching the thermal front and mesotrophic area's matching area (chlorophyll-a concentration 0.2-0.5 mg/m3). Chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature data for thermal fronts detection are derived from Aqua MODIS satellite on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The matching area's approach between the thermal front and mesotrophic area is used in the analysis of ZPPI. The results show thermal front and mesotrophic area on WPPNRI 715 have a variation seasonally where December appears like the peak event. The two parameters are distributed evenly from coastal areas to high seas. This method generates thermal fronts that have more than 60.3% matching with the mesotrophic area where the amount is acceptable due to has more than 50% amount of moderate ZPPI. The accuracy improvement in ZPPI both on the coast and open sea can be determined through this approach.

TI  - Overexpression of Holocarboxylase Synthetase Predicts Lymph Node Metastasis and Unfavorable Prognosis in Breast Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) catalyzes the specific attachment of biotin onto biotin-dependent carboxylases (BDCs) which play important roles in intermediary metabolism. Previous studies show that BDCs are overexpressed in many cancer types. However, expression of HLCS in cancerous tissues has not been reported. Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate HLCS expression in breast tissue obtained from 65 Thai patients, and the correlation between its expression and key clinical-pathological parameters was assessed. The role of HLCS in supporting invasion was investigated in HLCS-knockdown MCF-7 cells. Results: Overexpression of HLCS was significantly associated with metastasis of breast cancer cells to other lymph nodes but not the sentinel and axillary lymph nodes - a finding supported in cellular invasion assays using HLCS knockdown cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HLCS reduced survival time of patients with breast cancer. Conclusion: HLCS appears to be a prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of Blue Steel Roofs Information Based on CNN Using Gaofen-2 Imageries
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue steel roof is advantageous for its low cost, durability, and ease of installation. It is generally used by industrial areas. The accurate and rapid mapping of blue steel roof is important for the preliminary assessment of inefficient industrial areas and is one of the key elements for quantifying environmental issues like urban heat islands. Here, the DeeplabV3+ semantic segmentation neural network based on GaoFen-2 images was used to analyze the quantity and spatial distribution of blue steel roofs in the Nanhai district, Foshan (including the towns of Shishan, Guicheng, Dali, and Lishui), which is the important manufacturing industry base of China. We found that: (1) the DeeplabV3+ performs well with an overall accuracy of 92%, higher than the maximum likelihood classification; (2) the distribution of blue steel roofs was not even across the whole study area, but they were evenly distributed within the town scale; and (3) strong positive correlation was observed between blue steel roofs area and industrial gross output. These results not only can be used to detect the inefficient industrial areas for regional planning but also provide fundamental data for studies of urban environmental issues.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation and Climate Influence Factors of Vegetation Ecological Quality in the Sanjiangyuan National Park
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiangyuan National Park is the first Chinese national park system, and the ecological environment is inherently fragile and sensitive. Therefore, for environmental protection, it is imperative to understand the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of the ecological quality of vegetation and its climate influence factors. We used the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, meteorological dataset, and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and change trends of the NDVI and the net primary productivity (NPP) of the vegetation in the Sanjiangyuan National Park from 2000 to 2016. A linear regression model was used to explore the influence of the ecological quality of vegetation and climatic factors. The results showed that (1) the NDVI and NPP were high in the southeast area and low in the northwest area. The Yangtze River headwater region had the lowest NDVI (0-0.3) and NPP (0-100 gC/m(2)). The Lancang River had the highest NDVI (0.4-0.8) and NPP (100-250 gC/m(2)). (2) From 2000-2016, approximately 23.46% of the area showed a significant positive trend of the NDVI that was mainly distributed in the prairie areas in the midlands and the north of the Yangtze River headwater region, and was scattered in the midlands and the north of Yellow River headwater region. Furthermore, 24.32% of the NPP was determined to have increased significantly, which was mainly distributed in the midlands and the north of the Yangtze River headwater region, as well as the midlands and the east of the Yellow River headwater region. (3) The vegetation growth in the Sanjiangyuan National Park was regulated by both water and heat conditions. The NDVI was significantly affected by precipitation during the growing season and by the annual precipitation. In addition, the NPP was significantly affected by temperature during the growing season and by the annual average temperature of the study area.

TI  - Machine learning techniques for regional scale estimation of high-resolution cloud-free daily sea surface temperatures from MODIS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) estimates are dependent on satellite-based infrared radiometers, which are proven to be highly accurate in the past decades. However, the presence of clouds is a big stumbling block when physical approaches are used to derive SST. This problem is more prominent across tropical regions such as Arabian Sea(AS) and Bay of Bengal(BoB), restricting the availability of high-resolution SST data for ocean applications. The previous studies for developing daily high-resolution cloud-free SST products mainly focus on fusion of multiple satellites and in-situ data products that are computationally expensive and often time consuming. At the same time, it was observed that the capabilities of data-driven approaches are not yet fully explored in the estimation of cloud-free high-resolution SST data. Hence, in this study an attempt has been made for the first time to estimate daily cloud free SST from a single sensor (MODIS Aqua) dataset using advanced machine learning techniques. Here, three distinct machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)-based algorithms were developed and evaluated over two different study areas within the AS and BoB using 10 years of MODIS data and in-situ reference data. Among the developed algorithms, the SVR-based algorithm performs consistently better. In AS region, while testing, the SVR-based SST estimates was able to achieve an adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) of 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 degrees C with respect to the in situ data. Similarly, in BoB too, the SVR algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with R-adj(2) of 0.78 with RMSE of 0.88 degrees C. Further, a spatio-temporal and visual analysis of the results as well as an inter-comparision with NOAA AVHRR daily optimally interpolated global SST (a standard SST product available in practice) the suggest that the proposed SVR-based algorithm has huge potential to produce operational high-resolution cloud-free SST estimates, even if there is cloud cover in the image.

TI  - A Local Unscented Transform Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Systems
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an efficient data assimilation approach based on the sigma-point Kalman filter (SPKF). With a potential for nonlinear filtering applications, the proposed approach, designated as the local unscented transform Kalman filter (LUTKF), is similar to the SPKF in that the mean and covariance of the nonlinear system are estimated by propagating a set of sigma points-also referred to as ensemble members-generated using the scaled unscented transformation (SUT), while making no assumptions with regard to nonlinear models. However, unlike the SPKF, the LUTKF can reduce the influence of observations on distant state variables by employing a localization scheme to suppress spurious correlations between distant locations in the error covariance matrix. Moreover, while the SPKF uses the augmented state vector constructed by concatenating the model states, model noise, and measurement noise, the system state for the LUTKF is not augmented with the random noise variables, thereby providing an accurate state estimate with relatively few sigma points. In sensitivity experiments executed with a 40-variable Lorenz system, the LUTKF required only three sigma points to prevent filter divergence for linear/nonlinear measurement models. Comparisons of the LUTKF and the local ensemble transform Kalman filters (LETKFs) reveal the advantages of the proposed filter in situations that share common features with geophysical data assimilation applications. In particular, the LUTKF shows considerable benefits over LETKFs when assimilating densely spaced observations that are related nonlinearly to the model state and that have high noise levels-such as the assimilation of remotely sensed data from satellites and radars.

TI  - A 10-Year Radar-Based Climatology of Mesoscale Convective System Archetypes and Derechos in Poland
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a 10-yr (2008-17) radar-based mesoscale convective system (MCS) and derecho climatology for Poland is presented. This is one of the first attempts of a European country to investigate morphological and precipitation archetypes of MCSs as prior studies were mostly based on satellite data. Despite its ubiquity and significance for society, economy, agriculture, and water availability, little is known about the climatological aspects of MCSs over central Europe. Our results indicate that MCSs are not rare in Poland as an annual mean of 77 MCSs and 49 days with MCS can be depicted for Poland. Their lifetime ranges typically from 3 to 6 h, with initiation time around the afternoon hours (1200-1400 UTC) and dissipation stage in the evening (1900-2000 UTC). The most frequent morphological type of MCSs is a broken line (58% of cases), then areal/cluster (25%), and then quasilinear convective systems (QLCS; 17%), which are usually associated with a bow echo (72% of QLCS). QLCS are the feature with the longest life cycle. Among precipitation archetypes of linear MCSs, trailing stratiform (73%) and parallel stratiform (25%) are the most common. MCSs are usually observed from April to September, with a peak in mid-July. A majority of MCSs travels from the west, southwest, and south sectors. A total of 16 derecho events were identified (1.5% of all MCS and 9.1% of all QLCS); the majority of them were produced by a warm-season QLCS, whereas only 4 were produced by cold-season narrow cold-frontal rainbands. Warm-season derechos produced a bigger impact than did cold-season events, even though their damage paths were shorter.

TI  - Deep Gaussian processes for biogeophysical parameter retrieval and model inversion
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameter retrieval and model inversion are key problems in remote sensing and Earth observation. Currently, different approximations exist: a direct, yet costly, inversion of radiative transfer models (RTMs); the statistical inversion with in situ data that often results in problems with extrapolation outside the study area; and the most widely adopted hybrid modeling by which statistical models, mostly nonlinear and non-parametric machine learning algorithms, are applied to invert RTM simulations. We will focus on the latter. Among the different existing algorithms, in the last decade kernel based methods, and Gaussian Processes (GPs) in particular, have provided useful and informative solutions to such RTM inversion problems. This is in large part due to the confidence intervals they provide, and their predictive accuracy. However, RTMs are very complex, highly nonlinear, and typically hierarchical models, so that very often a single (shallow) GP model cannot capture complex feature relations for inversion. This motivates the use of deeper hierarchical architectures, while still preserving the desirable properties of GPs. This paper introduces the use of deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for bio-geo-physical model inversion. Unlike shallow GP models, DGPs account for complicated (modular, hierarchical) processes, provide an efficient solution that scales well to big datasets, and improve prediction accuracy over their single layer counterpart. In the experimental section, we provide empirical evidence of performance for the estimation of surface temperature and dew point temperature from infrared sounding data, as well as for the prediction of chlorophyll content, inorganic suspended matter, and coloured dissolved matter from multispectral data acquired by the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor. The presented methodology allows for more expressive forms of GPs in big remote sensing model inversion problems.

TI  - InSAR Campaign Reveals Ongoing Displacement Trends at High Impact Sites of Thessaloniki and Chalkidiki, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the broader area of Thessaloniki in northern Greece and Chalkidiki and performed an InSAR campaign to study the surface deformation phenomena that have been known to exist for at least two decades. Sentinel-1 data (2015-2019) together with drill measurements were exploited to focus on specific sites of interest. Our results indicate an ongoing displacement field. At the region of Kalochori and Sindos-where intense subsidence in the 1990s was previously found to have had a natural surface rebound in the 2000s-a new period of subsidence, caused by the enlivenment of the groundwater overexploitation, was reported. The uplifting trend of Oreokastro is still active and subsidence in Anthemountas graben is ongoing; special focus was set on the Makedonia Airport, where significant displacement is occurring. The study also reveals a new area at Nea Moudania, that was not known previously to deform; another case corresponding to anthropogenic-induced surface displacement. Thessaloniki is surrounded by different persistent displacement phenomena, whose main driving mechanisms are anthropogenic. The sensitivity of the surface displacements to the water trends is highlighted in parts of the study area. Results highlight the plan of a water resources management as a high priority for the area.

TI  - Mapping of land-use/land-cover changes and its dynamics in Awash River Basin using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of land-use and land-cover change at a basin scale, including its driving causes, is vital for the development and planning of appropriate environmental management policies and strategies. The aim of this research was to analyse and understand the long-term dynamics of land-use/land-cover changes and population growth in the Awash River Basin (ARB) using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Landsat images for 1988, 2002, and 2018 were processed, classified and analysed. The accuracy assessment showed that the classification was relatively acceptable and effective in detecting the long-term land-use changes in ARB. Cropland increased by 12% between 1988 and 2002, and by 2018 it had increased by 15%. Similarly, the built-up area expanded by 52 km(2) (184%) between 1988 and 2002, and by 2018 it had reached 225%. The analysis showed that the cropland and built-up area expanded at the expense of forest and shrubland, with shrubland and forest reducing by 4% and 25% respectively over the 30 year study period. Higher levels of deforestation, combined with population growth, urbanization and cropland expansion, have impacted on the available water resources and runoff in the area. The findings from this study can help in the design of sustainable environmental management strategies and practices to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem and natural resources. The results can also be used to address food security issues in the ARB since we see an increasing trend in population growth with a commensurate decrease in agricultural land, thereby increasing food security concerns.

TI  - Evaluating the Effect of<i>Prosopis juliflora</i>, an Alien Invasive Species, on Land Cover Change Using Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species (IPS) affect people's livelihoods and well-being by providing both benefits and costs in different contexts. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact ofProsopis juliflorainvasion on land cover change using ground survey and satellite sensor data derived from Landsat ETM+. The study was conducted at Sweimeh, Jordan Valley, between 1999 and 2017. The overall classification accuracy of remotely sensed data was 86% for 1999 and 80% for 2017. Accordingly, a remote sensing approach has the potential to assess land change/cover and aid in monitoring the IPS, specificallyProsopisinvasion. Change detection analysis of Landsat classes (i.e., 1999 and 2017) showed that bare soil, urban, and water surface areas decreased by 6%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Conversely, the vegetation class (i.e., IPS and native plants) increased by 20%. Ground surveys in 1999 and 2017 showed that the average vegetation area in Sweimeh invaded byProsopiswas approximately 60% in 1999 and 70% in 2017. Accordingly, the total estimated area invaded byP. julifloraat Sweimeh (2106 ha) in 1999 was approximately 92 ha, whileProsopiscoverage in the same region was approximately 413 ha in 2017. The high emergence rate, the adaptation to high temperatures and low precipitation as well as governmental regulations which restrict the removal of trees, including IPS, were the main factors that prompted the extremeP. juliflorainvasion in the Jordan Valley. The high invasion rate has led to a reduction in native species, includingTamarixspp., and dried up five natural water springs in the area. Overall, a monitoring plan should be applied to control the invasion problem byProsopisin the valley. In addition, the conservation regulations that deal with IPS should be revised to mitigate the IPS risk.

TI  - Contribution of SAR/RADARSAT-1 and ASAR/ENVISAT images to geological structural mapping and assessment of lineaments density in Divo-Oume area (Cote d'Ivoire)
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Access to drinking water and management of water resources are still a real issue in Cote d'Ivoire's granitic and volcano-sedimentary basement regions. This situation is due to the combination of many factors including poor knowledge of hydrogeological environment. The present study assess the fractures' network that has affected the Precambrian basement aquifer of Divo-Oume area by making a structural mapping and studying the spatial distribution of lineaments. For this purpose, the study exploits the contribution of radar images. Manually and without using directional filters, 7886 lineaments with variables lengths, have been derived from both RADARSAT-1 and ASAR images. The validation approach was based on the comparison between the orientations of the lineaments of the current study and those of the previous ones, and on the analysis of the distance between the nearest lineament and the well. This approach has shown that the lineaments would mostly correspond to fractures and they would be involved in the occurrence of groundwater. The analysis of lineaments orientations distribution revealed heterogeneity of directions and predominance of NW-SE and NE-SW families' directions. The cumulative lineaments density map and one related the number of lineaments cross-points density revealed the spatial heterogeneity of fractures network which seem to be controlled by geomorphology, geological formations and lithology contacts. The results obtained from different thematic maps are useful for the context of setting up of high yield hydraulic drilling programs and the implementation of water resources management tools.

TI  - [Triple-Tracer Technique of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Blue Dye plus Radioisotope Combined with Real-Time Indocyanine Green(ICG)Fluorescence Imaging Procedures for Patients with Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy].
T2  - Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Clinical evidence has indicated that, after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy(NAC), sentinel node(SN)identification rates(IR) were lower and false-negative rates(FNR)were higher for patients(pts)with local advanced breast cancer(BC)than for pts with early stage BC who did not receive NAC. Our previous clinical trial indicated that the real-time indocyanin green (RT-ICG)fluorescence imaging technique could improve the diagnostic sensitivity and detection accuracy of sentinel node biopsy(SNB). Nine pts with histologically confirmed Stage ⅡA to ⅢB, T1-T3, N0-2, M0 BC were selected to receive NAC, and the standard surgeries were performed after NAC completion. The SNs were detected by using conventional procedures with the blue dye(indigo carmine)plus 99mTc radioisotope techniques combined with concurrent RT-ICG. Clinically positive nodes were diagnosed by the radiologists using axillary ultrasound, MRI, and/or CT scans. All pts provided written informed consent before surgery. The surgical SNB was guided via RT-ICG fluorescence under standard light conditions by using the HEMS imaging system as previously published. All pts underwent SNB followed by completion node dissection(CND). The IR and FNR were calculated by comparing the results of the SNB and the histopathology of the resection specimens obtained via CND. The IR and FNR for each procedure of SNB were, respectively, 35.3% and 41.7% when indigo carmine blue was used, 82.4% and 0 when ICG fluorescence was used, and 58.8% and 5% when RI was used. In contrast, the total calculation of the triple tracer showed that IR reached 100% and FNR was 0. These data suggest that IR and FNR of SNB might be improved in pts with BC treated with NAC by using the novel triple tracer technique.

TI  - Geolocation Correction for Geostationary Satellite Observations by a Phase-Only Correlation Method Using a Visible Channel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a high-speed correction method for geolocation information of geostationary satellite data for accurate physical analysis. Geostationary satellite observations with high temporal resolution provide instantaneous analysis and prompt reports. We have previously reported the quasi real-time analysis of solar radiation at the surface and top of the atmosphere using geostationary satellite data. Estimating atmospheric parameters and surface albedo requires accurate geolocation information to estimate the solar radiation accurately. The physical analysis algorithm for Earth observations is verified by the ground truth. In particular, downward solar radiation at the surface is validated by pyranometers installed at ground observation sites. The ground truth requires that the satellite observation data pixels be accurately linked to the location of the observation equipment on the ground. Thus, inaccurate geolocation information disrupts verification and causes complex problems. It is difficult to determine whether error in the validation of physical quantities arises from the estimation algorithm, satellite sensor calibration, or a geolocation problem. Geolocation error hinders the development of accurate analysis algorithms; therefore, accurate observational information with geolocation information based on latitude and longitude is crucial in atmosphere and land target analysis. This method provides the basic data underlying physical analysis, parallax correction, etc. Because the processing speed is important in geolocation correction, we used the phase-only correlation (POC) method, which is fast and maintains the accuracy of geolocation information in geostationary satellite observation data. Furthermore, two-dimensional fast Fourier transform allowed the accurate correction of multiple target points, which improved the overall accuracy. The reference dataset was created using NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 1-s mesh data. We used HIMAWARI-8/Advanced HIMAWARI Imager data to demonstrate our method, with 22,709 target points for every 10-min observation and 5826 points for every 2.5 min observation. Despite the presence of disturbances, the POC method maintained its accuracy. Column offset and line offset statistics showed stability and characteristic error trends in the raw HIMAWARI standard data. Our method was sufficiently fast to apply to quasi real-time analysis of solar radiation every 10 and 2.5 min. Although HIMAWARI-8 is used as an example here, our method is applicable to all geostationary satellites. The corrected HIMAWARI 16 channel gridded dataset is available from the open database of the Center for Environmental Remote Sensing (CEReS), Chiba University, Japan. The total download count was 50,352,443 on 8 July 2020. Our method has already been applied to NASA GeoNEX geostationary satellite products.

TI  - Long Term Aquatic Vegetation Dynamics in Longgan Lake Using Landsat Time Series and Their Responses to Water Level Fluctuation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic vegetation in shallow freshwater lakes are severely degraded worldwide, even though they are essential for inland ecosystem services. Detailed information about the long term variability of aquatic plants can help investigate the potential driving mechanisms and help mitigate the degradation. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we made use of a 33-year (1987-2019) retrospective archive of moderate resolution Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI satellite images to estimate the extent changes in aquatic vegetation in Longgan Lake from Middle Yangtze River Basin in China using the modified enhanced vegetation index, including emerged, floating-leaved and floating macrophytes. The analysis of the long term dynamics of aquatic vegetation showed that aquatic vegetation were mainly distributed in the western part of the lake, where lake bottom elevation ranged from 11 to 12 m, with average water depth of less than 1 m in spring. The vegetation area variation for the 33-year period were divided into six stages. In years with heavy precipitation, the vegetation area decreased sharply. In the following years, the area normally restored. Aquatic vegetation area had a significant negative correlation with the spring water level and summer water level. The results showed that aquatic vegetation was negatively affected when water depth exceeded 2.5 m in May and 5 m in summer. It is recommended that water depth remain close to 1 m in spring and close to 3 m in summer for aquatic vegetation growth. Our study provide quantitative evidence that water-level fluctuations drive vegetation changes in Longgan Lake, and present a basis for sustainable lake restoration and management.

TI  - Water Storage Monitoring in the Aral Sea and its Endorheic Basin from Multisatellite Data and a Hydrological Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland water storage change is a fundamental part of the hydrologic cycle, which reflects the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources. In this study, we used multisatellite data (from satellite altimetry, remote sensing, and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) to investigate water storage changes in the Aral Sea and its endorheic basin. The water storage depletion rate in the Aral Sea from calibrated hypsometric curves (CHCs) created by satellite altimetry and image data agrees with the GRACE-derived result using the Slepian space domain inverse method (SSDIM). Compared with the combined filtering method (CFM) and mascon solutions, the SSDIM was shown to be an effective method of reducing the GRACE leakage error and restoring the signal attenuation in the Aral Sea. Moreover, we used the WaterGAP global hydrology model (WGHM) to qualitatively analyze the variations in the water storage components. The results show that the groundwater in the Aral Sea affects the change in the interannual water storage, especially during the extreme dry and humid periods. However, from the long-term water storage trend, the decrease in the surface storage dominates the shrinking of the Aral Sea. In addition, more details of the water storage change pattern in the endorheic basin were revealed by the enhanced GRACE solution. Our findings accentuate the severe water storage states of the Aral Sea endorheic basin under the impact of climate change and human interventions.

TI  - Detection of gold-bearing quartz veins in the meta-sedimentary formation in the North-Eastern Guinea using remote sensing and geophysical exploration
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Siguiri volcano-sedimentary basin located in north-eastern Guinea, and particularly in the Alahina District, the lithological column consists of schistose argilitic to feldspathic sandstone rocks with micashists, limestone, and traversed by pyroclastites, monzogranites and Paleoproterozoic granodiorites of an age between 2040 and 2250 Ma. These formations are surrounded in places by Neoproterozoic sandstones and conglomerates. Some dolerite dykes and Mesozoic gabbros also affect these formations.The present study, using Landsat 8 satellite imagery data and a ground-based geophysical survey, by time-domain induced polarization, is designed to detect sulphide-associated gold veins within meta-sediments. The study includes fractures network mapping by remote sensing and discriminating zones susceptible to concentrate metal sulphides and silica.The fracture frequency map and geophysical anomalies (resistivity and chargeability) were validated from field observations which include structural measurements from outcrops, trenching and drilling. In resistive and chargeable zones, quartz veins sampled and processed by fire assay and optical emission spectrometry returned gold concentrations of up to 74 g/t. The N10 degrees to N45 degrees azimuths of these auriferous quartz veins coincide with the directions of the major lineaments highlighted by remote sensing. The chargeability and resistivity signatures of auriferous quartz veins concentration zones and their elongated sigmoidal shape suggest a context of mineralized shear-zone.

TI  - Malicious Relay Detection Using Sentinels: A Stochastic Geometry Framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Next generation wireless networks are under high risk of security attacks due to increased connectivity and information sharing among peer nodes. Some of the nodes could potentially be malicious, intending to disrupt or tamper sensitive data transfer in the network. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the sentinel based data integrity attack detection of malicious relays using a stochastic geometry framework. We assume a practical channel model for each wireless link and apply a stochastic geometry approach to interference modeling. Two detection schemes depending on the level of connectivity between sentinel devices are proposed: isolated and co-operative detection. For both schemes, attack detection probability is derived as a function of important network parameters, and the minimum density of sentinels to achieve a given detection probability is calculated. It will be shown that a reasonable attack detection probability can be achieved even when the sentinel node density is much lower than the relay node density.

TI  - Evaluation Analysis of Landsat Level-1 and Level-2 Data Products Using In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat Level-1 products are delivered as quantized and calibrated scaled Digital Numbers (DN). The Level-1 DN data can be rescaled to Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance applying radiometric rescaling coefficients. Currently, the Level-1 product is the standard data product of the Landsat sensors. The more recent Level-2 data products contain surface reflectance values, i.e., reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric effects; in the near future, these products are anticipated to become the standard products of the Landsat sensors. The purpose of this paper is to present a radiometric performance evaluation of Level-1 and Level-2 data products for the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. TOA reflectance and derived surface reflectance values from both data products were evaluated and compared to in situ measurements from eight test sites located in Turkey, Brazil, Chile, the United States, France, and Namibia. The results indicate an agreement between the ETM+ and OLI Level-1 TOA reflectance data and the in situ measurements of 3.9% to 6.5% and 3.9% to 6.0%, respectively, across all spectral bands. Agreement between the in situ measurements and both Level-2 surface reflectance data products were consistently decreased in the shorter wavelength bands, and slightly better in the longer wavelength bands. The mean percent absolute error for Level-2 surface reflectance data ranged from 3.3% to 10% for both Landsat sensors. The significant decay in agreement with the data collected in situ in the short wavelength spectral bands with Level-2 data suggests issues with retrieval of aerosol concentration at some sites. In contrast, the results indicate a reasonably accurate estimate of water vapor in the mid-infrared spectrum. Lastly, despite the less reliable performance of Level-2 data product in the visible spectral region (compared with Level-1 data) in both sensors, the Landsat-8 OLI Level-2 showed an improvement of surface reflectance product over all spectral bands in common with the Landsat-7 ETM+ Level-2 data.

TI  - Investigating Detection of Floating Plastic Litter from Space Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic litter floating in the ocean is a significant problem on a global scale. This study examines whether Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used to identify plastic litter on the sea surface for monitoring, collection and disposal. A pilot study was conducted to determine if plastic targets on the sea surface can be detected using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-2 data. A target made up of plastic water bottles with a surface measuring 3 m x 10 m was created, which was subsequently placed in the sea near the Old Port in Limassol, Cyprus. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to acquire multispectral aerial images of the area of interest during the same time as the Sentinel-2 satellite overpass. Spectral signatures of the water and the plastic litter after it was placed in the water were taken with an SVC HR1024 spectroradiometer. The study found that the plastic litter target was easiest to detect in the NIR wavelengths. Seven established indices for satellite image processing were examined to determine whether they can identify plastic litter in the water. Further, the authors examined two new indices, the Plastics Index (PI) and the Reversed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI) to be used in the processing of the satellite image. The newly developed Plastic Index (PI) was able to identify plastic objects floating on the water surface and was the most effective index in identifying the plastic litter target in the sea.

TI  - Christian Integrity Regained: Reformational Worldview Engagement for Everyday Medical Practice
T2  - CHRISTIAN BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - How does one committed to the claims of Christ and a biblical story of redemption live Christianly and navigate the competing worldviews encountered in everyday medical practice? Adopting the practical conceptual framework promoted by Reformed Christian philosopher and theologian Albert Wolters, we argue for an all-encompassing biblical understanding of God's cosmic redemption plan for the entire creation order in contrast to a more typical sacred/secular duality. We then apply the concepts of structure and direction, drawn from a pretheological understanding of human life drawn from the Scripture, to a semi-fictional case study in discerning Christian faithfulness in everyday mundane aspects of medicine. Our subsequent analysis seeks to render an interpretation of what it means to live life consistent with that worldview when confronted with challenges like those presented in the case.

TI  - Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3 Expression Predicts Sentinel Node Status in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 in primary cutaneous melanomas with positive and negative sentinel node status (SLN) (a total of 58 specimens divided into 2 groups of 29 for each status). The specimens were collected from the pathological archive of the department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology of the University Medical Center Heidelberg. A quantification score was developed for protein expression, by considering the percentage of positive melanoma cells (0: 0%, 1: up to 1%, 2: 2-10%, 3: 11-50%, and 4: 50%) in relation to the intensity of staining (0: negative, 1: low, 2: medium, 3: strong). Tumoural VEGFR-3 expression (mean +/- standard deviation) in SLN+ tumours (9.62 +/- 3.09) was significantly stronger than in SLN- tumours (6.13 +/- 3.87; p < 0.001). A binary logistic regression model proved VEGFR-3 expression and tumour thickness to be significant independent predictors of SLN. These data provide evidence that VEGFR-3 expression may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma and that its investigation may help to improve the selection of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma for sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR Images for Convective System Surface Wind Pattern Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Convective systems (CS) through their downdrafts hitting the sea surface may produce wind patterns (or cold pools) with wind intensity exceeding 10-25 m s(-1). The latter for a long time have been significant for weather forecast and meteorological studies, especially in the tropical regions like the Gulf of Guinea since it is hard to detect the CS-associated wind patterns. Based on Sentinel-1 images [C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)] with high spatial resolution and large swath, the current study proposed the detection of surface wind patterns through wind speed estimation by C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N; for vertically polarized images) and two models proposed by Sapp and Komarov (for horizontally polarized images). Relative to the X-band SAR, the effects of precipitation on C-band radar backscattering are negligible, and thereby it has little impact on wind speed estimation from Sentinel-1 images. The detected surface wind patterns include a squall line and a bow echo at the mesoscale (>100 km) and many submesoscale (<100 km) convection cells. They are accompanied by various degrees of precipitation (from light to heavy rain). This study also used Meteosat infrared images for monitoring and detection of deep convective clouds (with low brightness temperature) corresponding to surface wind patterns. The agreement in location and sometimes in shape between them strengthened the assumption that the CS downdrafts may induce the sea surface patterns with high wind intensity (10-25 m s(-1)). In particular, because of the Sentinel-1 high spatial resolution, the pattern spots with high winds (20-25 m s(-1)) are detected on the illustrated images, which was not reported in the literature. They are located close to the coldest convective clouds (about 200-K brightness temperature).

TI  - Detection of Thermal Changes Related to the 2011 Shinmoedake Volcano Activity, Japan: Spatiotemporal Variation of Singularity of MODIS Data after Discriminating False Changes Due to Cloud
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed a cloud discrimination method applicable in Japan using MODIS nighttime data, monitored the singularity of the spatiotemporal correlation of surface temperature anomalies and investigated the possibility of detecting and monitoring lava activity in Shinmoedake. With the aim to detect lava eruption activity in 2011, nine years of data from 2003 to 2011 were analyzed. As a result, the first anomalous singularity in brightness temperature was detected on 26 January 2011. Moreover, the maximum value was detected on 30 January 2011. The values showed larger ones until early February 2011. When an anomalous singularity appeared, it was the only period with the magma-related volcanic activity for Shinmoedake over the analyzed period of nine years. The above facts indicate the effectiveness of the proposed singularity method to monitor the lava activity for Shinmoedake. Therefore, it is concluded that if cloud discrimination is realized with high accuracy, no spurious changes will come to arise, and no false detection of hotspots will be given.

TI  - Sectioning protocol determines accuracy of intraoperative pathological examination of sentinel lymph node in cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives. To determine the diagnostic performance and optimal protocol of frozen section examination (FSE) in SLNB for cervical cancer.Methods. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched from inception to July 30, 2019, for studies concerning SLNB with FSE in cervical cancer. Sensitivity of FSE in detecting SLN metastasis was the primary diagnostic indicator for evaluation.Results. The pooled sensitivity of FSE among 31 eligible studies (1887 patients) was 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.85) with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 69.73%). Two representative sectioning protocols for FSE were identified from 26 studies, described as equatorial (E-protocol, SLN was bisected) and latitudinal (L-protocol, SLN was cut at intervals). Meta-regression showed that FSE protocol was the only source of heterogeneity (p < 0.001). The pooled sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.91, I-2= 0%) and 0.59 (0.46-0.72, I-2 = 58.47%) for FSE using L- (13 studies, 650 patients) and E- (13 studies, 1047 patients) protocol, respectively. Among the available data, marcometastases (>2mm) were missed in 4 and 20 patients; small-volume metastases (<= 2 mm) were detected in 13 and 2 patients, respectively, under L- and E-protocol. The pooled sensitivity of FSE using L-protocol would reach 0.97 (95% CI 0.89-0.99) if only marcometastases were considered. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.Conclusion. The sectioning protocol determines the accuracy of FSE in SLNB. With L-protocol, FSE can provide precise intraoperative pathology for SLNB, which enables immediate decision-making for individualized managements. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - NDVI imaging within space exploration plant growth modules - A case study from EDEN ISS Antarctica
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of using informative wavelength imagery to monitor plant health and ecosystem stability from space is derived from the deployment of Landsat and the development of the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index, or NDVI. NDVI presents the relative reflectance of the Near IR from plant leaves as a measure of relative plant health in terrestrial habitats and landscapes. However, the use of NDVI and NDVI-like imagery is rapidly evolving toward higher spatial resolution and more localized assessments of plant health, such as the use of drone imagery to monitor outdoor farms, and the use of mounted cameras within indoor growing facilities. With the advancement of plant growth systems in support of human space exploration, especially to the moon and Mars, remote assessment of plant health within exploration habitats becomes a critical element for development. This project examines the deployment of NDVI-like capabilities within a planetary analog greenhouse on the Antarctic ice shelf. The EDEN ISS Antarctica project provides a case study on the practical use of specific wavelength imagery to monitor plant health within space exploration environments. GoPro cameras, modified to dual bandpass capabilities, provided Single Image NDVI analyses for a year within the EDEN ISS Future Exploration Greenhouse at the Neumayer Station III in Antarctica. Images were acquired on site, analyzed remotely, and archived for the entire duration of the deployment through a combination of back-room science activities and operational communications with the Neumayer Station III. The results provide insights into the potential use of specific imaging wavelengths to enhance crop production in space exploration.

TI  - Laparotomy <i>vs</i>. minimally invasive surgery for ovarian cancer recurrence: a systematic review
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of the present review is to thoroughly investigate the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the setting of secondary cytoreduction for ovarian cancer recurrence, comparing this approach to traditional open surgery. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus and Web of Science databases (between 1st January 1989 and 1st January 2020), have been systematically queried to identify all articles reporting either laparoscopic or robotic-assisted secondary surgical cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer. We also manually searched the reference lists of the identified studies. Only English language papers were considered. Two independent reviewers screened and identified the reports. A sub-analysis was performed including studies comparing MIS vs. open abdominal secondary cytoreduction. A total of 617 articles were considered. Among them, we included 12 retrospective studies on minimally invasive secondary cytoreduction, enrolling 372 patients (260 of whom were submitted to whether robotics or laparosopy). Three studies compared 69 patients who underwent MIS vs. 112 cases of open abdominal secondary cytoreduction. Other 9 articles described a total of 191 patients who had minimally invasive secondary cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer without a comparative arm. The quality of the evidence was low. The decision regarding the use of MIS was left to surgeon's discretion; in general, the candidates to MIS were selected patients with single-site disease or few localizations of relapse. Compared to open surgery, MIS was associated with significantly lower blood loss, shorter hospital stay and less postoperative complications; the rate of complete cytoreduction to residual tumor =0 was 95.5% in MIS cases vs. 87.5% in laparotomy cases. The risk of complications was generally low. Disease-free and overall survival were comparable between groups. There is no consensus on the criteria to select patients for laparoscopic or robotic secondary cytoreduction. Intra-operative ultrasound has been proposed as a possible tool to better identify the site of recurrence and for confirmation of complete resection of disease. In conclusion, MIS is an option in selected patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, provided there is no widespread disease. Selection of patients appears of utmost importance to obtain satisfactory survival outcomes.

TI  - Cutaneous eyelid melanoma in an African American child
T2  - ORBIT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ORBITAL DISORDERS-OCULOPLASTIC AND LACRIMAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma of the eyelid constitutes less than 2% of all eyelid malignancies. Such cases in the pediatric population are even rarer, and exceedingly so in darkly pigmented individuals. A 9-year-old African American boy presented with a left upper eyelid lesion. Biopsy was consistent with deep penetrating melanoma, and the patient underwent a wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy. One upper parotid sentinel node was positive, leading to further parotidectomy and selective neck dissection. The eyelid defect was reconstructed by primary closure after margin clearance. This is the first reported case of cutaneous eyelid melanoma in an African American child with nodal metastasis. Clinical features of melanoma in the pediatric population can be more atypical and higher index of suspicion is indicated. While rare, the diagnosis of melanoma in darkly pigmented patients is still possible and cannot be excluded without a definitive biopsy.

TI  - Bayesian Calibration of the Aquacrop-OS Model for Durum Wheat by Assimilation of Canopy Cover Retrieved from VENμS Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth models play an important role in agriculture management, allowing, for example, the spatialized estimation of crop yield information. However, crop model parameter calibration is a mandatory step for their application. The present work focused on the regional calibration of the Aquacrop-OS model for durum wheat by assimilating high spatial and temporal resolution canopy cover data retrieved from VEN mu S satellite images. The assimilation procedure was implemented using the Bayesian approach with the recent implementation of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm DREAM((KZS)). The fraction of vegetation cover (fvc) was retrieved from the VEN mu S satellite images for two years, during the durum wheat growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 in Central Italy. The retrieval was based on a hybrid method using PROSAIL Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) simulations for training a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm, combined with Active Learning to reduce the computational cost. The Aquacrop-OS model was calibrated with thefvcdata of 2017-2018 for the Maccarese farm in Central Italy and validated with the 2018-2019 data. The retrieval accuracy of thefvcfrom the VEN mu S images were the Coefficient of Determination (R-2) = 0.76, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.09, and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) = 11.6%, when compared with the ground-measuredfvc. The MCMC results are presented in terms of Gelman-Rubin R statistics and MR statistics, Markov chains, and marginal posterior distribution functions, which are summarized with the mean values for the most sensitive crop parameters of the Aquacrop-OS model subjected to calibration. When validating for thefvc, the R(2)of the model for year (2018-2019) ranged from 0.69 to 0.86. The RMSE, Relative Error (RE), Relative Variability (alpha), and Relative Bias (beta) ranged from 0.15 to 0.44, 0.19 to 2.79, 0.84 to 1.45, and 0.91 to 1.95, respectively. The present work shows the importance of the calibration of the Aquacrop-OS (AOS) crop water productivity model for durum wheat by assimilating remote sensing information from VEN mu S satellite data.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to monitor the displacement of the bridges using Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) time-series Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar analysis. For case study bridges: Kimdaejung bridge and Deokyang bridge, we acquired 60 and 33 Cosmo-Skymed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data over the Mokpo region and Yeosu region, respectively from 2013 to 2019. With single-look interferograms, we estimated the long-term time-series displacements over the bridges. The time-series displacements were estimated as -8.8 mm/year and -1.34 mm/year at the mid-span over the selected bridges: Kimdaejung and Deokyang bridge, respectively. This time-series displacement provides reliable and high spatial resolution information to monitor the structural behavior of the bridge for preventing structural behaviors.

TI  - Deep Learning for Land Use and Land Cover Classification Based on Hyperspectral and Multispectral Earth Observation Data: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Lately, with deep learning outpacing the other machine learning techniques in classifying images, we have witnessed a growing interest of the remote sensing community in employing these techniques for the land use and land cover classification based on multispectral and hyperspectral images; the number of related publications almost doubling each year since 2015 is an attest to that. The advances in remote sensing technologies, hence the fast-growing volume of timely data available at the global scale, offer new opportunities for a variety of applications. Deep learning being significantly successful in dealing with Big Data, seems to be a great candidate for exploiting the potentials of such complex massive data. However, there are some challenges related to the ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that strongly impact the performance of classification. In this paper, we review the use of deep learning in land use and land cover classification based on multispectral and hyperspectral images and we introduce the available data sources and datasets used by literature studies; we provide the readers with a framework to interpret the-state-of-the-art of deep learning in this context and offer a platform to approach methodologies, data, and challenges of the field.

TI  - The Librations, Tides, and Interior Structure of Io
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The melt zone in the volcanically active satellite Io plays a key role in diverse processes such as volcanism, heat transfer, tidal dissipation, and the orbital evolution of the Galilean satellites in the Laplace resonance. Information on the melt distribution, the degree of partial melt, and the possible existence of a global magma ocean has been derived from Galileo magnetic induction measurements, volcanic eruption temperatures, and Hubble Space Telescope auroral spot observations but is currently inconclusive. Here, we calculate the libration amplitude of Io for a diverse set of internal structure models and show that Io's libration can provide insight into the existence of a global magma ocean and into the thickness and rigidity of the crust above it. The diurnal libration amplitude of Io is several times larger if Io has a magma ocean instead of a partial melt asthenosphere and can reach values of above 1 km, making it easily observable for spacecraft flying close by Io on multiple occasions. It also strongly increases with decreasing crustal thickness and increases significantly with increasing rigidity. We demonstrate that the combination of observations of the libration amplitude and the tidal Love numberk(2)will allow estimating the rigidity and thickness of the crust separately, which is impossible with only one of the quantities observed.

TI  - Combined land surface emissivity and temperature estimation from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of Land Surface Temperature (LST) generally requires atmospheric parameters and the emissivity (epsilon) of the target to be estimated. The atmospheric up- and downwelling radiances and transmittance can be accurately modelled using radiative transfer models and profiles of relative humidity and temperature, either measured by radiosonde probes or retrieved from assimilating weather models. The estimation of epsilon is a large source of uncertainty in the resulting LST product, and there are various approaches using multi-angle observations, multispectral optical or multispectral thermal infrared imagery. In this paper, the estimation of LST from the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated using more than 6 years of in situ temperature measurements from a network of 14 Autonomous Weather Stations (AWS) in Belgium. epsilon is estimated from concomitant atmospherically corrected imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) using two new neural network approaches trained on ECOSTRESS spectra, and an established NDVI based method. Results are compared to using epsilon = 1 and the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset. LST retrievals from L8/TIRS perform well for all emissivity data sources for > 500 matchups with AWS subsoil temperature measurements: Mean Differences 0.8-3.7 K and unbiased Root Mean Squared Differences of 2.9-3.5 K for both B10 and B11. The use of unity emissivity gives the best results in terms of MD (0.8 K) and unb-RMSD (3 K). Similar ranges of unb-RMSD are found for > 500 matchups with broadband radiometer temperatures (2.6-3.1 K), that have lower absolute MD values (-2.2-0.6 K). For the radiometer temperatures, both the neural net approaches gave lowest MD, in the best case +/- 0.1 K. The present investigation can hence recommend the neural nets to derive epsilon for the retrieval of LST over the AWS in Belgium. Using published matchup results from other authors however, no single source of epsilon data performed better than epsilon = 1, but this could be due to their low number of matchups. Further efforts for estimating representative pixel average emissivities are needed, and establishing a denser in situ measurement network over varied land use, with rather homogeneous land cover within a TIRS pixel, may aid further validation of a per pixel and per scene epsilon estimates from multispectral imagery. AWS data seems valuable for evaluation of satellite LST, with the advantage of a much lower cost and higher potential matchup density compared to conventional radiometers.

TI  - Improving community participation in clinical and translational research: CTSA Sentinel Network proof of concept study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Research participation by members of racial or ethnic minority groups continues to be less than optimum resulting in difficulties to generalization of research findings. Community-engaged research that relies on a community health worker (CHW) model has been found effective in building trust in the community, thereby motivating people to participate in health research. The Sentinel Network study aimed at testing the feasibility of utilizing the CHW model to link community members to appropriate health research studies at each of the research sites. Methods: The study was conducted at six Clinical and Translational Science Award institutions (N = 2371) across the country; 733 (30.9%) of the participants were from the University of Florida, 525 (22.0%) were from Washington University in St. Louis, 421 (17.8%) were from the University of California, Davis, 288 (12.1%) were from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 250 (10.5%) were from Rochester, and 154 (6.5%) from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Trained CHWs from each of these sites conducted regular community outreach where they administered a Health Needs Assessment, provided medical and social referrals, and linked to eligible research studies at each of those sites. A 30-day follow-up assessment was developed to track utilization of services satisfaction with the services and research study participation. Results: A large majority of people, especially African Americans, expressed willingness to participate in research studies. The top two health concerns reported by participants were hypertension and diabetes. Conclusion: Findings on the rate of navigation and enrollment in research from this study indicate the effectiveness of a hybrid CHW service and research model of directly engaging community members to encourage people to participate in research.

TI  - Management of the clinically N<sub>0</sub> neck in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). An EACMFS position paper
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to the cervical lymph nodes has a significant impact on prognosis. Accurate staging of the neck is important in order to deliver appropriate treatment for locoregional control of the disease and for prognosis.The management of the neck in early, low volume disease (clinically T-1/T-2 oral cavity tumours) has long been debated. The risk of occult nodal involvement in cT(1)/T-2 OSCC is estimated around 20-30%.We describe the natural evolutionary history of OSCC and its patterns of spread and metastasis to the local lymphatic basins. We discuss most published literature and studies on management of the clinically negative neck (cN(0)). Particular focus is given to prospective randomized trials comparing the outcomes of upfront elective neck dissection against the observational stance, and we summarize the results of the sentinel node biopsy studies.The paper discusses the significance of the primary tumour histological characteristics and specifically the tumour's depth of invasion (DOI) and its impact on predicting nodal metastasis. The DOI has been incorporated in the TNM staging highlighting its significance in aiding the treatment decision making and this is reflected in world-wide oncological guidelines.The critical analysis of all available literature amalgamates the existing evidence in early OSCC and provides recommendations in the management of the clinically N-0 neck.

TI  - Deriving Wheat Crop Productivity Indicators Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency Earth observation (EO) data have been shown to be effective in identifying crops and monitoring their development. The purpose of this paper is to derive quantitative indicators of crop productivity using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study shows that the field-specific SAR time series can be used to characterise growth and maturation periods and to estimate the performance of cereals. Winter wheat fields on the Rothamsted Research farm in Harpenden (UK) were selected for the analysis during three cropping seasons (2017 to 2019). Average SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 satellites was extracted for each field and temporal analysis was applied to the backscatter cross-polarisation ratio (VH/VV). The calculation of the different curve parameters during the growing period involves (i) fitting of two logistic curves to the dynamics of the SAR time series, which describe timing and intensity of growth and maturation, respectively; (ii) plotting the associated first and second derivative in order to assist the determination of key stages in the crop development; and (iii) exploring the correlation matrix for the derived indicators and their predictive power for yield. The results show that the day of the year of the maximum VH/VV value was negatively correlated with yield (r = -0.56), and the duration of "full" vegetation was positively correlated with yield (r = 0.61). Significant seasonal variation in the timing of peak vegetation (p= 0.042), the midpoint of growth (p= 0.037), the duration of the growing season (p= 0.039) and yield (p= 0.016) were observed and were consistent with observations of crop phenology. Further research is required to obtain a more detailed picture of the uncertainty of the presented novel methodology, as well as its validity across a wider range of agroecosystems.

TI  - Multisatellite-Based Feeding Habitat Suitability Modeling of Albacore Tuna in the Southern Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision strategies in fisheries management are often directed by the geographic distribution and habitat preferences of target species. This study used remote sensing data to identify the optimal feeding habitat of albacore tuna in the Southern Atlantic Ocean (SAO) using an empirical habitat suitability model applying longline fisheries data during 2009-2015. An arithmetic mean model with sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSC) was determined to be suitable for defining the albacore habitat in the SAO. The optimal ranges of SST and SSC for the habitat were approximately 16.5 degrees C-19.5 degrees C and 0.11-0.33 mg/m(3), respectively. The study revealed a considerable positive trend between the suitable habitat area and standardized catch per unit effort (r= 0.97;p< 0.05); due to the west-to-east and northward development of the suitable habitat, albacore schools moved to the northeast of the SAO, thus increasing catch probability in April to August in that region. Overall, the frontal structure of SST and SSC plays an essential role in the formation of potential albacore habitats in the SAO. Our findings could contribute to the establishment of regional ecosystem-based fisheries management in the SAO.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present work was to determine the effects of long-term changes in land use/land cover (LULC) on surface and groundwater resources of quaternary aquifers in the Lucknow area of the Ganga plain, based on the analysis of multi-temporal satellite and field survey data. Changes in LULC for the period of 2008 and 2016 were mapped using Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 satellite data by applying hybrid image classification techniques. Hydro-geomorphic feature mapping for 2008 and 2016 was also carried out to monitor changes in important surface and subsurface hydro-geomorphic features of the area such as paleochannels, cut-off meanders, oxbow lakes, meander scars, flood plains and younger alluvial plain, and observation found that a decreasing trend in most features. Groundwater level data of selected wells for 2008 and 2016 were used to analyze the trend in groundwater level depletion and its relation with land use change and hydro-geomorphic features. In general, the observations from the present study clearly indicate that large-scale changes in groundwater reservoirs has been taken place due to changes in LULC, hydro-geomorphic features and extensive groundwater exploration practices over the past decade. The results show 4.09% increase in built-up land, 5.49% increase in open area, 8.80% decrease in vegetation cover, 2.31% decrease in agricultural land and 0.35% decrease in surface water bodies. The results observed through monitoring of LULC change, along with water level dynamics of the area, provide scientific data base for the protection, governance and decision-making for water resources management.

T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, remote sensing data have been available to monitor the surface movement for long periods of time. The analysis of satellite data shows that there is still residual subsidence (i.e., with average rates of about -10 mm/year) several decades after mining longwall panels in an area. Several years after the underground infrastructure was sealed, the surface started to move upwards. In the past, it often was claimed that movement of the surface was limited in time, i.e., a few years after mining a longwall panel. This is not the case for the conditions of the Campine coal basin, Belgium. This knowledge is important when one wants to design new operations in deep coal seams, but also when planning to stop the underground mining and to seal the access to the mine.

Use of remote sensing and GIS for distinguishable proof of the sensible objectives of solid waste dumped depends on the overlaying of datasets and spots that fulfill the site suitability criteria. The datasets and spots join the spatial examination devices given by GIS to arrange and survey in order to choose possible waste areas. Finally, in Erode city Municipal Corporation an appropriate dumping zone and few locations for dumping of solid waste are created. A set of twenty-one (21) sites is found to be the most favorable locations for dumping of solid waste. Indeed, SMCE is found to be the best method for the present work.

In areas covered by extensive regolith, colluvial and/or alluvial deposits, with scarce rock outcrops, the application of airborne geophysics and remote sensing products has become a key tool to unravel the geological framework and lithological units. The integration of all those data files requires the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis techniques. More than 87,200 km of linear-collected airborne geophysics data have been acquired by government companies to subside mineral prospecting and geological mapping in northern Minas Gerais State, SE Brazil. Together, geomorphological, geological and geophysical data outline distinct domains on the studied region. The eastern domain shows large tablelands (plateaus) sustained by metadiamictite-quartzite-rich units of the Neoproterozoic Macatibas Group and related glaciogenic iron deposits, like those of the Nova Aurora Formation, comprising hematite- and/or magnetite-rich metadiamictites with 10-60 wt% Fe. However, on tablelands, the known Neoproterozoic iron deposits are largely hidden beneath Cenozoic covers, although there are scattered outcrops of iron-rich rocks well-preserved from lateritization, a weathering process that can reach dozens of meters deep in the region. Applying Fuzzy logic methodology, our thematic maps provide great progress to define lithological units and structural trends, supporting new guides to track iron-rich rocks. The favorability maps allow us to suggest new targets, and a prospective model to trace locations and structural trends of iron-anomalous rock units. The regional model shows scattered favorable areas with few high-density concentrations of probable iron-rich rocks or even iron ore deposits. Magnetic data images disclose the main occurrences of iron-rich rocks, although lacking resolution for more specific studies. Although gammaspectrometry and Landsat 8 data only reflect responses from surface materials, they may reduce information ambiguity after integrated with magnetic data on areas covered by laterites richer in iron. Our final integrated models constrain the most favorable areas for the occurrence of iron-rich rocks, even in the large tableland domains.

TI  - Spring Row Crops Productivity Prediction Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of statistical modelling for the yields prediction of spring row crops, namely, maize, sorghum and soybean, depending on the values of the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at critical stages of the crops growth and development were presented. The spatial NDVI data obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite were used to create the models. Quadratic regression analysis was applied to develop the yielding models based on true yield data of the crops obtained in the period of 2017 and 2018 at the experimental field of the Institute of Irrigated Agriculture of NAAS, Ukraine. The results of statistical modelling revealed that the method is suitable for precise yield prediction, and the best stages for NDVI screening and use in this purpose are different for the studied crops. The best accuracy of prediction could be obtained at the stage of tasselling (VT) or silking (R1) for maize (the mean absolute percentage error MAPE is 8.75%): at the stage of second trifoliate (V2) for soybean (MAPE is 3.75%), and at the stage of half bloom (S6) for sorghum (MAPE is 17.62%). The yield predictions by NDVI are reliable at a probability level of 95% (p < 0.05).

TI  - Satellite-derived foresummer drought sensitivity of plant productivity in Rocky Mountain headwater catchments: spatial heterogeneity and geological-geomorphological control
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term plot-scale studies have found water limitation to be a key factor driving ecosystem productivity in the Rocky Mountains. Specifically, the intensity of early summer (the 'foresummer' period from May to June) drought conditions appears to impose critical controls on peak ecosystem productivity. This study aims to (1) assess the importance of early snowmelt and foresummer drought in controlling peak plant productivity, based on the historical Landsat normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climate data; (2) map the spatial heterogeneity of foresummer drought sensitivity; and (3) identify the environmental controls (e.g. geomorphology, elevation, geology, plant types) on drought sensitivity. Our domain (15 x 15 km) includes four drainages within the East Water watershed near Gothic, Colorado, USA. We define foresummer drought sensitivity based on the regression slopes of the annual peak NDVI against the June Palmer Drought Severity Index between 1992 and 2010. Results show that foresummer drought sensitivity is spatially heterogeneous, and primarily dependent on the plant type and elevation. In support of the plot-based studies, we find that years with earlier snowmelt and drier foresummer conditions lead to lower peak NDVI; particularly in the low-elevation regions. Using random forest analysis, we identify additional key controls related to surface energy exchanges (i.e. potential net radiation), hydrological processes (i.e. microtopography and slope), and underlying geology. This remote-sensing-based approach for quantifying foresummer drought sensitivity can be used to identify the regions that are vulnerable or resilient to climate perturbations, as well as to inform future sampling, characterization, and modeling studies.

TI  - The<i>T</i>Index: Measuring the Reliability of Accuracy Estimates Obtained from Non-Probability Samples
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, the term accuracy typically expresses the degree of correctness of a map. Best practices in accuracy assessment have been widely researched and include guidelines on how to select validation data using probability sampling designs. In practice, however, probability samples may be lacking and, instead, cross-validation using non-probability samples is common. This practice is risky because the resulting accuracy estimates can easily be mistaken for map accuracy. The following question arises: to what extent are accuracy estimates obtained from non-probability samples representative of map accuracy? This letter introduces theTindex to answer this question. Certain cross-validation designs (such as the common single-split or hold-out validation) provide representative accuracy estimates when hold-out sets are simple random samples of the map population. TheTindex essentially measures the probability of a hold-out set of unknown sampling design to be a simple random sample. To that aim, we compare its spread in the feature space against the spread of random unlabelled samples of the same size. Data spread is measured by a variant of Moran'sIautocorrelation index. Consistent interpretation of theTindex is proposed through the prism of significance testing, withTvalues < 0.05 indicating unreliable accuracy estimates. Its relevance and interpretation guidelines are also illustrated in a case study on crop-type mapping. Uptake of theTindex by the remote-sensing community will help inform about-and sometimes caution against-the representativeness of accuracy estimates obtained by cross-validation, so that users can better decide whether a map is fit for their purpose or how its accuracy impacts their application. Subsequently, theTindex will build trust and improve the transparency of accuracy assessment in conditions which deviate from best practices.

TI  - Deep learning on edge: Extracting field boundaries from satellite images with a convolutional neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of digital agricultural services often require either farmers or their advisers to provide digital records of their field boundaries. Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records, which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images. We formulated this task as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, the model's performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve. Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, our model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the same model generalised well across resolutions (10 m to 30 m), sensors (Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8), space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images acquired across the season is paramount to reducing the temporal variations of accuracy. Our convolutional neural network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of individual crop fields at scale.

TI  - Monitoring of large-scale landslides in Zongling, Guizhou, China, with improved distributed scatterer interferometric SAR time series methods
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zongling landslide (Nayong, Guizhou, China) is dominated by a unique karst landscape area with many landslide masses. In this paper, an improved Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) method is proposed to identify and monitor the Zongling landslide. In this method, the Anderson-Darling test is applied to distributed scatterer (DS) selection, and DS and persistent scatterer (PS) are combined to improve the density of measurement points in vegetation area. Moreover, this method is also characterized by the appropriate combination of differential interferograms produced by a small baseline subsets and the employment of the phase triangulation algorithm to estimate the optimal phase. Combining 105 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1A ascending and descending data acquired during 2014-2018, the method is applied to retrieve time series displacement for the large-scale landslide in Zongling Town. Finally, three accelerating landslides are identified from our result, which is consistent with ALOS PALSAR differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) results and field investigation. The influencing factors and deformation mechanism of the Zongling landslide are also analysed. Our monitoring results will help the local government to conduct regular inspections and strengthen disaster prevention in mountain areas.

TI  - Small-Baseline Approach for Monitoring the Freezing and Thawing Deformation of Permafrost on the Beiluhe Basin, Tibetan Plateau Using TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic changes of the thawing and freezing processes of the active layer cause seasonal subsidence and uplift over a large area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau due to ongoing climate warming. To analyze and investigate the seasonal freeze-thaw process of the active layer, we employ the new small baseline subset (NSBAS) technique based on a piecewise displacement model, including seasonal deformation, as well as linear and residual deformation trends, to retrieve the surface deformation of the Beiluhe basin. We collect 35 Sentinel-1 images with a 12 days revisit time and 9 TerraSAR-X images with less-than two month revisit time from 2018 to 2019 to analyze the type of the amplitude of seasonal oscillation of different ground targets on the Beiluhe basin in detail. The Sentinel-1 results show that the amplitude of seasonal deformation is between -62.50 mm and 11.50 mm, and the linear deformation rate ranges from -24.50 mm/yr to 5.00 mm/yr (2018-2019) in the study area. The deformation trends in the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) and Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH) regions are stable, ranging from -18.00 mm to 6 mm. The InSAR results of Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X data show that seasonal deformation trends are consistent, exhibiting good correlations 0.78 and 0.84, and the seasonal and linear deformation rates of different ground targets are clearly different on the Beiluhe basin. Additionally, there are different time lags between the maximum freezing uplift or thawing subsidence and the maximum or minimum temperature for the different ground target areas. The deformation values of the alpine meadow and floodplain areas are higher compared with the alpine desert and barren areas, and the time lags of the freezing and thawing periods based on the Sentinel-1 results are longest in the alpine desert area, that is, 86 days and 65 days, respectively. Our research has important reference significance for the seasonal dynamic monitoring of different types of seasonal deformation and the extensive investigations of permafrost in Qinghai Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Understanding Cloud Droplet Spectral Dispersion Effect Using Empirical and Semi-Analytical Parameterizations in NCAR CAM5.3
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Five parameterizations of cloud droplet spectral shape are implemented in a global climate model to investigate the dispersion effect and aerosol indirect effect (AIE). We design a series of experiments by modifying the microphysical cloud scheme of NCAR CAM5.3 (National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model Version 5.3). We employ four empirical (Martin94, RLiu03, PengL03, and Liu08) and one semi-analytical (LiuLi15) expressions for cloud droplet spectral shape parameters. Analysis focuses on the instantaneous differences in the simulated cloud microphysical properties and the comparison between model output and satellite data. The results show that RLiu03, PengL03, and LiuLi15 produce wider droplet spectrum and faster autoconversion rate, but Liu08 has a narrower droplet spectrum and slower autoconversion rate than the default parameterization (Martin94) in CAM5.3. Global dispersion effects caused by the five parameterizations modify the aerosol indirect effect by -10% (counteract) to 13% (strengthen). The simulated AIEs and dispersion effects exhibit noticeably spatial inhomogeneity. In the sensitive regions of AIE (Southeast Asia, North Pacific, and West Coast of South America), we decompose the response of shortwave cloud forcing to the change in droplet number for analysis. The varying dispersion effects can be explained by different responses of cloud properties in different spectral parameterizations.Plain Language Summary Increase of air pollution modifies the water cloud droplet size spectrum and further impacts on cloud physical properties, precipitation, and energy budget in atmosphere. We applied four empirical and one semi-analytical schemes for calculating cloud droplet spectral shape parameters in a global climate model. The five spectral schemes have different impacts on cloud physical properties but have limited effects on global atmospheric energy and on total precipitation. The model simulated changes in cloud properties and in atmospheric energy are analyzed in detail, helping to understand the physical mechanism of the five spectral schemes.

TI  - Deimplementation of the Choosing Wisely Recommendations for Low-Value Breast Cancer Surgery A Systematic Review
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - This systematic review evaluated the extent to which low-value surgical procedures for breast cancer have been deimplemented and identified possible barriers and facilitators to deimplementation.Importance Overtreatment of early-stage breast cancer results in increased morbidity and cost without improving survival. Major surgical organizations participating in the Choosing Wisely campaign identified 4 breast cancer operations as low value: (1) axillary lymph node dissection for limited nodal disease in patients receiving lumpectomy and radiation, (2) re-excision for close but negative lumpectomy margins for invasive cancer, (3) contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in patients at average risk with unilateral cancer, and (4) sentinel lymph node biopsy in women 70 years or older with hormone receptor-positive cancer. Objective To evaluate the extent to which these procedures have been deimplemented, determine the implications of decreased use, and recognize possible barriers and facilitators to deimplementation. Evidence Review A systematic review of published literature on use trends in breast surgery was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The Ovid, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane databases were searched for original research with relevance to the Choosing Wisely recommendations of interest. Eligible studies were examined for data about use, and any patient-level, clinician-level, or system-level factors associated with use. Findings Concordant with recommendations, national rates of axillary lymph node dissection for patients with limited nodal disease have decreased by approximately 50% (from 44% in 2011 to 30% to 34% in 2012 and 25% to 28% in 2013), and national rates of lumpectomy margin re-excision have decreased by nearly 40% (from 16% to 34% before to 14% to 18% after publication of a consensus statement). Conversely, national rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy continue to rise each year, accounting for up to 30% of all mastectomies for breast cancer (range in all mastectomy cases: 2010-2012, 28%-30%; 1998, <2%), and rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy in women 70 years or older with low-risk breast cancer are persistently greater than 80% (range, 80%-88%). Factors associated with high rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy use are younger age, white race, increased socioeconomic status, and the availability of breast reconstruction; limited data exist on factors associated with high rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy in women 70 years or older. Successful deimplementation of axillary lymph node dissection and lumpectomy margin re-excision were associated with decreased costs and improved patient-centered outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance This review demonstrates variable deimplementation of 4 low-value surgical procedures in patients with breast cancer. Addressing specific patient-level, clinician-level, and system-level barriers to deimplementation is necessary to encourage shared decision-making and reduce overtreatment.Question Has low-value breast cancer surgery been successfully deimplemented? Findings Rates of axillary lymph node dissection in patients with limited nodal disease and re-excision of close but negative margins after lumpectomy have significantly decreased over time, reflecting changes in practice concordant with current evidence and recommendations; conversely, rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in patients at average risk with unilateral cancer and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients 70 years or older with hormone receptor-positive cancer remain elevated, despite recommendations against their routine use. This review identifies some of the patient-level, tumor-level, and facility-level factors that contribute to this differential deimplementation. Meaning Efforts toward the reduction of low-value breast cancer surgery have been variably influential; areas of incomplete deimplementation can provide insight into potential barriers at guideline, patient, clinician, and system levels contributing to the persistent use of some procedures.

TI  - Extracting Soil Moisture from<i>Fengyun-3D</i>Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II Imagery by Using a Deep Belief Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining continuous and high-quality soil moisture (SM) data is important in scientific research and applications, especially for agriculture, meteorology, and environmental monitoring. With the continuously increasing number of artificial satellites in China, the acquisition of SM data from remote sensing images has received increasing attention. In this study, we constructed an SM inversion model by using a deep belief network (DBN) to extract SM data fromFengyun-3D(FY-3D) Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) imagery; we named this model SM-DBN. The SM-DBN consists of two subnetworks: one for temperature and the other for SM. In the temperature subnetwork, bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 25 of theFY-3DMERSI-II imagery, which are relevant to temperature, were used as inputs while land surface temperatures (LST) obtained from ground stations were used as the expected output value when training the model. In the SM subnetwork, the input data included LSTs generated from the temperature subnetwork, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI); and the SM data obtained from ground stations were used as the expected outputs. We selected the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China as the study area and used selected MERSI-II images and in-situ observation station data from 2018 to 2019 to develop our dataset. The results of the SM-DBN were validated by using in-situ SM data as a reference, and its performance was also compared with those of the linear regression (LR) and back propagation (BP) neural network models. The overall accuracy of these models was measured by using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the differences between the model results and in-situ SM observation data. The RMSE of the LR, BP neural network, and SM-DBN models were 0.101, 0.083, and 0.032, respectively. These results suggest that the SM-DBN model significantly outperformed the other two models.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Driving Forces of Ecosystem Changes: A Case Study of the National Barrier Zone, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecosystem and explore the driving forces that affect change in the ecosystem in the National Barrier Zone (NBZ). Based on multi-source remote sensing data, this paper analyzed the change in the ecosystem in the NBZ from 2000 to 2015. Natural and social economic factors were selected as the driving factors, and the change mechanism of the ecological system in the NBZ area was analyzed by means of redundancy analysis and other methods. The results showed the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2015, the ecosystem changes in the NBZ are obvious. It is important to note that the grassland and urban ecosystem increased by 13,952 and 6720 km(2), respectively; at the same time, the desert ecosystem significantly decreased by 4544 km(2). (2) The human activity represented by gross domestic product (GDP) is the main factor in the change of ecosystem change in the NBZ with a contribution of 75%, especially in the ecological barrier of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Loess plateau with a GDP contribution rate of 83%. (3) The changes in the ecosystems are significantly influenced by multifactorial interactions, such as the joint contribution rate of the drought index (PDSI) and GDP reaching 0.11 in the ecological barrier of Qinghai-Tibet plateau. (4) The ecological protection projects, such as the Green for Grain Project in the NBZ, play a positive role, and the ecological environment is improving. The conclusions of this paper will be used as a basic theory to contribute to subsequent research on ecosystem services, policy making, and other aspects in the NBZ.

TI  - A Bandwidth Statistical Multiplexing and Control Method for Satellite Broadcasting
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of satellite data broadcasting, the management quality of data broadcasting bandwidth is directly related to the throughput of the broadcasting system and plays an important role in the performance of satellites. In this paper, for the sun-synchronous orbit meteorological satellite broadcasting which has the conventional product files and emergency information, a broadcast bandwidth statistical multiplexing and control method is designed for bandwidth management. It can be used for the management of broadcasting between regular products and emergency information, as well as internal broadcasting among regular products. This paper is the first to apply common multiplexing of PID and channel mode (CMPCM) to satellite broadcasting. The test verified that the broadcast channel of the parameters and the broadcast schedule management channel resources achieved statistical multiplexing of bandwidth, ratio of channel management functions, and data broadcast control. Broadcasting occupation ratio (BOR) and broadcasting file error ratio (BER) improved significantly. This is significant for improving the efficiency of satellite uplink broadcasting.

TI  - Inland water's trophic status classification based on machine learning and remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we tested machine learning algorithms in classifying waters in a reservoir cascade with basis in trophic state. The classification was done through remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements collected in situ. Chlorophyll-a (chla) content determined in the laboratory were used to define the trophic state in the sampling points distributed in four reservoirs (Barra Bonita, Bariri, Ibitinga and Nova Avanhandava), located at the Tiete River, Brazil. Those four impoundments exhibit widely differing optical properties from each other, which is rather evident in relation to chla concentration. From the dataset collected in the reservoir cascade, a trophic gradient is observed, decreasing from up-to downstream. To classify the trophic state, we tested three machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results showed that ANN and RF algorithms exhibited the best performance in classifying the different trophic state in the cascade of reservoirs. Both approaches raised a global accuracy of 80.00% and average area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUCROC) of 0.928 and 0.912, respectively. Comparing the machine learning approaches with a parametric algorithm, only SVM presented a slightly lower performance. The outcomes of this classification can be useful for trophic state mapping considering the large cascade of reservoirs or rivers. In addition, it can give a direction in bio-optical modeling studies, which have shown that a unique bio-optical algorithm is unable to accurately retrieving concentrations of optically active constituents in aquatic system with high optical variability. So that, it is possible to develop specific chla prediction models considering the optical characteristics of each stretch of river, since machine learning-based classifications (ANN and RF) indicate different optical regions.

TI  - Exploring the Use of DSCOVR/EPIC Satellite Observations to Monitor Vegetation Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology plays a pivotal role in regulating several ecological processes and has profound impacts on global carbon exchange. Large-scale vegetation phenology monitoring mostly relies on Low-Earth-Orbit satellite observations with low temporal resolutions, leaving gaps in data that are important for monitoring seasonal vegetation phenology. High temporal resolution satellite observations have the potential to fill this gap by frequently collecting observations on a global scale, making it easier to study change over time. This study explored the potential of using the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, which captures images of the entire sunlit face of the Earth at a temporal resolution of once every 1-2 h, to observe vegetation phenology cycles in North America. We assessed the strengths and shortcomings of EPIC-based phenology information in comparison with the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) onboard Landsat 7, and PhenoCam ground-based observations across six different plant functional types. Our results indicated that EPIC could capture and characterize seasonal changes of vegetation across different plant functional types and is particularly consistent in the estimated growing season length. Our results also provided new insights into the complementary features and benefits of the four datasets, which is valuable for improving our understanding of the complex response of vegetation to global climate variability and other disturbances and the impact of phenology changes on ecosystem productivity and global carbon exchange.

TI  - Optimizing Mooring Placement to Constrain Southern Ocean Air-Sea Fluxes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proposals from multiple nations to deploy air-sea flux moorings in the Southern Ocean have raised the question of how to optimize the placement of these moorings in order to maximize their utility, both as contributors to the network of observations assimilated in numerical weather prediction and also as a means to study a broad range of processes driving air-sea fluxes. This study, developed as a contribution to the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS), proposes criteria that can be used to determine mooring siting to obtain best estimates of net air-sea heat flux (Q(net)). Flux moorings are envisioned as one component of a multiplatform observing system, providing valuable in situ point time series measurements to be used alongside satellite data and observations from autonomous platforms and ships. Assimilating models (e.g., numerical weather prediction and reanalysis products) then offer the ability to synthesize the observing system and map properties between observations. This paper develops a framework for designing mooring array configurations to maximize the independence and utility of observations. As a test case, within the meridional band from 35 degrees to 65 degrees S we select eight mooring sites optimized to explain the largest fraction of the total variance (and thus to ensure the least variance of residual components) in the area south of 20 degrees S. Results yield different optimal mooring sites for low-frequency interannual heat fluxes compared with higher-frequency subseasonal fluxes. With eight moorings, we could explain a maximum of 24.6% of high-frequency Q(net) variability or 44.7% of low-frequency Q(net) variability.

TI  - Global River Monitoring Using Semantic Fusion Networks
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Global river monitoring is an important mission within the remote sensing society. One of the main challenges faced by this mission is generating an accurate water mask from remote sensing images (RSI) of rivers (RSIR), especially on a global scale with various river features. Aiming at better water area classification using semantic information, this paper presents a segmentation method for global river monitoring based on semantic clustering and semantic fusion. Firstly, an encoder-decoder network (AEN)-based architecture is proposed to obtain the semantic features from RSIR. Secondly, a clustering-based semantic fusion method is proposed to divide semantic features of RSIR into groups and train convolutional neural networks (CNN) models corresponding to each group using data augmentation and semi-supervised learning. Thirdly, a semantic distance-based segmentation fusion method is proposed for fusing the CNN models result into final segmentation mask. We built a global river dataset that contains multiple river segments from each continent of the world based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The result shows that the F1-score of the proposed segmentation method is 93.32%, which outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, and demonstrates that grouping semantic information helps better segment the RSIR in global scale.

TI  - Application of the Reed-Solomon Algorithm as a Remote Sensing Data Fusion Tool for Land Use Studies
T2  - ALGORITHMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reed-Solomon algorithm is well known in different fields of computer science. The novelty of this study lies in the different interpretation of the algorithm itself and its scope of application for remote sensing, especially at the preparatory stage, i.e., data fusion. A short review of the attempts to use different data fusion approaches in geospatial technologies explains the possible usage of the algorithm. The rationale behind its application for data fusion is to include all possible information from all acquired spectral bands, assuming that complete composite information in the form of one compound image will improve both the quality of visualization and some aspects of further quantitative and qualitative analyses. The concept arose from an empirical, heuristic combination of geographic information systems (GIS), map algebra, and two-dimensional cellular automata. The challenges are related to handling big quantitative data sets and the awareness that these numbers are in fact descriptors of a real-world multidimensional view. An empirical case study makes it easier to understand the operationalization of the Reed-Solomon algorithm for land use studies.

TI  - Investigating the Potential Use of RADARSAT-2 and UAS imagery for Monitoring the Restoration of Peatlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of peatlands is critical to help reduce the effects of climate change and further prevent the loss of habitat for many species of flora and fauna. The objective of this research was to evaluate RADARSAT-2 satellite imagery and high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to determine if they could be used as surrogates for monitoring the success of peatland restoration. Areas of peatland that were being actively harvested, had been restored from past years (1994-2003), and natural shrub bog in Lac St. Jean, Quebec were used as a test case. We compared the Freeman-Durden and Touzi decompositions by applying the Bhattacharyya Distance (BD) statistic to see if the spectral signatures of restored peatland could be separated from harvested peat and natural shrub bog. We flew Unmanned Aerial Surveys (UASs) over the study site to identifySphagnumandPolytrichum strictum, two indicator species of early peatland restoration success. Results showed that the Touzi decomposition was better able to separate the spectral signatures of harvested, restored, and natural shrub bog (BD values closer to 9). Symmetric scattering type alpha s1, Helicity |tau(1,2,3)|, a steep incidence angle, and peak growing season appear to be important for separating the spectral signatures. We had moderate success in detectingSphagnumandPolytrichum strictumvisually by using texture and pattern but were unable to use colour due to differences in sun angle and clouds during the UAS flights. Results suggest that RADARSAT-2 data using the Touzi decomposition and UAS imagery show potential for monitoring peatland restoration success over time.

TI  - Analyses of inter-class spectral separability and classification accuracy of benthic habitat mapping using multispectral image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Theoretically, spectral separability will greatly affect the accuracy of multispectral classification. This study aims to understand the relationship between the inter-class spectral separability and the accuracy of benthic habitat classification using a WorldView-2 multispectral image. The study area for this research is Kemujan Island, Jepara Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. The datasets used are sunglint-corrected bands, Principle Component Analysis (PCA)-derived bands, vegetation indices, and filter occurrence bands. Benthic habitat field data were obtained through a photo-transect survey technique and were used to construct nine levels of benthic habitat hierarchical classification schemes. We used maximum likelihood (ML) and random forest (RF) as the classification algorithms. Spectral separability was calculated using the Jeffries-Matusita separability analysis algorithm. The results from both RF and ML showed that the increased number of class pairs with spectral separability less than 1.0 (S-<1.0) decreased the OA and an increased number of class pairs with S>1.0-1.9 increased the OA. Especially for scheme Level 1 with the greatest number of classes, an increased number of class pairs with S->1.9 to is required to improve the OA. This has proven that the spectral separability between classes does affect the accuracy of benthic habitat classification and there is a significant relationship between spectral separability and the accuracy of benthic habitat classification.

AB  - In the absence of widespread testing, syndromic surveillance approaches may be useful for understanding potential undocumented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. We used publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention FluView Interactive to evaluate its potential for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance. Unlike the prior 3 influenza seasons, we found a 76% decrease in influenza positive tests and a 27% increase in influenza like illness during the weeks since COVID-19 outbreaks began in the United States, which suggests FluView's potential utility for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance.

TI  - Exploring the Atmospheric Dynamics of the Extreme Ultrahot Jupiter KELT-9b Using TESS Photometry
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We carry out a phase-curve analysis of the KELT-9 system using photometric observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The measured secondary eclipse depth and peak-to-peak atmospheric brightness modulation are<CDATA<iand 566 16 ppm, respectively. The planet's brightness variation reaches maximum 31 5 minutes before the midpoint of the secondary eclipse, indicating a 52 09 eastward shift in the dayside hot spot from the substellar point. We also detect stellar pulsations on KELT-9 with a period of 7.58695 0.00091 hr. The dayside emission of KELT-9b in the TESS bandpass is consistent with a blackbody brightness temperature of 4600 100 K. The corresponding nightside brightness temperature is 3040 100 K, comparable to the dayside temperatures of the hottest known exoplanets. In addition, we detect a significant phase-curve signal at the first harmonic of the orbital frequency and a marginal signal at the second harmonic. While the amplitude of the first harmonic component is consistent with the predicted ellipsoidal distortion modulation assuming equilibrium tides, the phase of this photometric variation is shifted relative to the expectation. Placing KELT-9b in the context of other exoplanets with phase-curve observations, we find that the elevated nightside temperature and relatively low day-night temperature contrast agree with the predictions of atmospheric models that include H(2)dissociation and recombination. The nightside temperature of KELT-9b implies an atmospheric composition containing about 50% molecular and 50% atomic hydrogen at 0.1 bar, a nightside emission spectrum that deviates significantly from a blackbody, and a 0.5-2.0 mu m transmission spectrum that is featureless at low resolution.

TI  - Vegetation Changes and Their Response to Global Change Based on NDVI in the Koshi River Basin of Central Himalayas Since 2000
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation forms a main component of the terrestrial biosphere owing to its crucial role in land cover and climate change, which has been of wide concern for experts and scholars. In this study, we used MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, land cover data, meteorological data, and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data to do vegetation change and its relationship with climate change. First, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns and variations of vegetation activity in the Koshi River Basin (KRB) in the central Himalayas from 2000 to 2018. Then, we combined NDVI change with climate factors using the linear method to examine their relationship, after that we used the literature review method to explore the influence of human activities to vegetation change. At the regional scale, the NDVIGS(Growth season NDVI) significantly increased in the KRB in 2000-2018, with significant greening over croplands in KRB in India. Further, the croplands and forest in the KRB in Nepal were mainly influenced by human interference. For example, improvements in agricultural fertilization and irrigation facilities as well as the success of the community forestry program in the KRB in Nepal increased the NDVI(GS)of the local forest. Climate also had a certain impact on the increase in NDVIGS. A significant negative correlation was observed between NDVI(GS)trend and the annual minimum temperature trend (TMN) in the KRB in India, but an insignificant positive correlation was noted between it and the total annual precipitation trend (PRE). NDVI(GS)significantly decreased over a small area, mainly around Kathmandu, due to urbanization. Increases in NDVI(GS)in the KRB have thus been mainly affected by human activities, and climate change has helped increase it to a certain extent.

TI  - In-flight Image Registration and Performance Evaluation for Directional Polarimetric Camera
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision image registration is the key to ensure the in-flight data validity of the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC). This paper introduces the polarization image registration method based on optical wedge and the multi-angle, multi-spectral image registration method based on earth reference grid. The error of the registration performance of the multi-angle and multi-spectral image of DPC are fully investigated, and the use of relative geometric calibration is applied to correct the error and improve the registration performance. To verify the effectiveness of this relative geometric calibration method, we compare the registration effects before and after error correction. The results reveal that the accuracies of DPC in flight multi-angle, multi-spectral and polarized image registration are better than 0.26 pixel, 0.14 pixel and 0.1 pixel respectively, which show an improvement of the registration performance.

TI  - What did China's National Wetland Conservation Program Achieve ? Observations of changes in land cover and ecosystem services in the Sanjiang Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China implemented the National Wetland Conservation Program (NWCP) from 2002 to protect and rehabilitate wetlands. Under the background of sustainable development, assessment on the effectiveness of the NWCP is important to ecosystem management, especially in the Sanjiang Plain, the largest marsh distribution area and hotspot area with wetland loss. To achieve this aim, this study examined the changes in land cover and ecosystem services (ESs) from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2015 in the Sanjiang Plain as well as the nine national nature reserves for wetlands (NNRWs) by means of Landsat series images and the InVEST model. Results reveal that the NWCP played critical roles in reducing wetland loss and improving regional ESs. The shrinkage rate of wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain has been decreased remarkably, with a declined rate of wetland loss from 750 km(2) yr(-1) to 189 km(2) yr(-1). The reduction rate of habitat area in good suitable grade and ecosystem carbon stock declined notably during the period 2000-2015 compared to the period 1990-2000. The amount of water retention increased by 5.4%, while the grain production capacity was enhanced by nine times from 1990 to 2015. Specifically, since 2000, the reduction rate of wetland area in NNRWs (33 km(2) yr(-1)) was obviously lower than that in the entire Sanjiang Plain, whilst various ESs in NNRWs were better than that in the whole Sanjiang Plain. This study is expected to provide an example for evaluating the effectiveness of the NWCP at other regions and support regional wetland conservation management.

TI  - Effect of breast-conserving surgery combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary preservation on the recurrence, metastasis, complications and cosmetic results of early breast cancer patients
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: As one of the main malignant tumors, breast cancer remains a worldwide public health issue. Here, we aimed to analyze the effects of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary preservation on the recurrence, metastasis, complications, and cosmetic results of early breast cancer patients (BCPs).Methods: The clinical data of 143 BCPs admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to January 2019 were collected retrospectively, and all patients were female. Patients (76 cases) undergoing BCS combined with SLNB and axillary preservation treatment were set as the combined group, and 67 cases undergoing traditional modified radical surgery were set as the control group. After the perioperative conditions of patients in the two groups were compared, the patients were followed up for 14 months to record information on the quality of life, recurrence, metastasis, complications, and cosmetic results.Results: The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and extubation time of the combined group were significantly less than the control group (P<0.05); the quality of life of patients in both groups improved after treatment, but the quality of life of patients in the combined group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05); both groups of patients were followed up for 14 months after treatment, and there were no deaths. The rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis were 2.98% and 5.97% in the control group and 5.26% and 6.57% in the combined group, respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05); the incidence of postoperative complications was 14.92% in the control group, which was significantly higher than the incidence of 3.94% of the combined group (P<0.05); the proportion of postoperative cosmetic results with an excellent and good rating was 59.7% in the control group, which was significantly lower than the 93.42% reported in the combined group (P<0.05).Conclusions: BCS combined with SLNB and axillary preservation provided good clinical and cosmetic results and can improve the quality of life of patients and reduce the rate of recurrence and metastasis.

TI  - Impact of<i>FY-3D</i>MWRI Radiance Assimilation in GRAPES 4DVar on Forecasts of Typhoon Shanshan
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study,Fengyun-3D(FY-3D) MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) radiance data were directly assimilated into the Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System (GRAPES) four-dimensional variational (4DVar) system. Quality control procedures were developed for MWRI applications by using algorithms from similar microwave instruments. Compared with theFY-3CMWRI, the bias ofFY-3DMWRI observations did not show a clear node-dependent difference from the numerical weather prediction background simulation. A conventional bias correction approach can therefore be used to remove systematic biases before the assimilation of data. After assimilating the MWRI radiance data into GRAPES, the geopotential height and humidity analysis fields were improved relative to the control experiment. There was a positive impact on the location of the subtropical high, which led to improvements in forecasts of the track of Typhoon Shanshan.

TI  - Changes in spatial patterns of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in China 2000-2018: Impact of clean air policies
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve air quality, China has been implementing strict clean air policies since 2013. These policies not only substantially improved air quality but may also modify the spatial distribution of air pollution, since urban emission sources were under stricter control and some were moved to rural regions with lower air quality improvement targets and lacking of monitoring. Here, we predicted satellite-based monthly PM2.5 concentrations during 2000-2018 at a 1-km resolution with complete spatial-temporal coverage to analyze changes in the spatial pattern of PM2.5 pollution in China. We found that the PM2.5 concentration in urban regions was higher than that in rural regions of the same city by an average of 3.3 mu g/m(3) during 2000-2018. This urban-rural disparity in PM2.5 concentration significantly increased from 2.5 mu g/m(3) in 2000 and peaked in 2007 of 3.8 mu g/m(3), then it sharply declined by 49% during 2013-2018 with the implementation of clean air policies. This shrinkage in the urban-rural PM2.5 gap was partly due to the 1.3 mu g/m(3) greater average decrease in the PM2.5 level in the urban region than in the rural region of the same town during 2013-2018 on average. We also observed that cities that started monitoring earlier experienced greater decreases in the urban-rural PM2.5 difference, and regions surrounding monitor showed significantly greater PM2.5 decrease than regions far away from monitor during 2013-2018. Additionally, clean air policies modified the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and per capita gross domestic product (GDP), leading to a lower PM2.5 level with the same per capita GDP after 2013. Emissions in rural and suburban regions should be considered to further improve air quality in China.

TI  - PoISAR image classification based on object-oriented technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) image classification technology is the basis of the successful application of PoISAR. However, compared with relatively mature PolSAR imaging technology and system design, PoISAR image classification technology lags behind. Aiming at the main problems existing in the research of object-oriented classification of PoISAR images, this paper proposed a new object-oriented classification method, which combines multi-target polarimetric decomposition, ReliefF-PSO_SVM and ensemble learning. First, polarimetric decomposition is implemented for PoISAR image using various methods. Polarimetric parameters extracted using different polarimetric decomposition methods are combined into a multichannel image. Second, the multichannel image is divided into numerous image objects by implementing multi-resolution segmentation. Third, features are extracted from the multichannel image. Fourth. ReliefF-PSO SVM algorithm is applied for feature selection, and N feature subsets with the highest fitness are retained for classification. Each feature subset corresponds to a classification result. Finally, ensemble learning technology is used to integrate the classification results. The study site is located at the southeastern part of Changchun City, Jilin Province. A RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad-Pol image was selected as the data source for this study. The proposed method was applied to land-use classification, and good classification results were obtained. The overall accuracy was 85. 06% and the kappa value was 0. 8006. In addition, three other classification methods were performed for comparison. The comparison results further proved the superiority of the proposed method in PoISAR image classification.

TI  - Evaluation of Ocean Color Remote Sensing Algorithms for Diffuse Attenuation Coefficients and Optical Depths with Data Collected on BGC-Argo Floats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical distribution of irradiance in the ocean is a key input to quantify processes spanning from radiative warming, photosynthesis to photo-oxidation. Here we use a novel dataset of thousands local-noon downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (E-d(490)) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles captured by 103 BGC-Argo floats spanning three years (from October 2012 to January 2016) in the world's ocean, to evaluate several published algorithms and satellite products related to diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d). Our results show: (1) MODIS-Aqua K-d(490) products derived from a blue-to-green algorithm and two semi-analytical algorithms show good consistency with the float-observed values, but the Chla-based one has overestimation in oligotrophic waters; (2) The K-d(PAR) model based on the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) performs well not only at sea-surface but also at depth, except for the oligotrophic waters where K-d(PAR) is underestimated below two penetration depth (2z(pd)), due to the model's assumption of a homogeneous distribution of IOPs in the water column which is not true in most oligotrophic waters with deep chlorophyll-a maxima; (3) In addition, published algorithms for the 1% euphotic-layer depth and the depth of 0.415 mol photons m(-2)d(-1)isolume are evaluated. Algorithms based on Chla generally work well while IOPs-based ones exhibit an overestimation issue in stratified and oligotrophic waters, due to the underestimation of K-d(PAR) at depth.

TI  - MODIS and VIIRS Calibration History and Future Outlook
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The MODIS is a key instrument for NASA's EOS program, currently operated onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively. The VIIRS is a MODIS follow-on instrument for the JPSS program. Adding to the ones operated onboard the S-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites launched in 2011 and 2017, respectively, three nearly identical VIIRS instruments will also be launched. This will enable the data records from MODIS and VIIRS to be extended beyond 2040. In addition to various applications and scientific studies of the Earth's system, long-term data records from MODIS and VIIRS observations will greatly benefit the space-based climate observing system. This is attributed to the high-quality measurements and extensive calibration efforts, from pre-launch to post-launch. This paper provides an overview of MODIS and VIIRS calibration history and approaches applied to establish and maintain sensor calibration traceability and accuracy. It illustrates calibration and performance issues through different phases of the mission using examples derived from ground testing equipment, on-board calibrators, and other calibration targets. Moreover, discussed in this paper are outstanding challenges and future efforts to maintain and improve sensor calibration stability and long-term data quality, and to better support the space-based climate observing system.

TI  - High-Resolution U-Net: Preserving Image Details for Cultivated Land Extraction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient extraction of cultivated land data is of great significance for agricultural resource monitoring and national food security. Deep-learning-based classification of remote-sensing images overcomes the two difficulties of traditional learning methods (e.g., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF)) when extracting the cultivated land: (1) the limited performance when extracting the same land-cover type with the high intra-class spectral variation, such as cultivated land with both vegetation and non-vegetation cover, and (2) the limited generalization ability for handling a large dataset to apply the model to different locations. However, the "pooling" process in most deep convolutional networks, which attempts to enlarge the sensing field of the kernel by involving the upscale process, leads to significant detail loss in the output, including the edges, gradients, and image texture details. To solve this problem, in this study we proposed a new end-to-end extraction algorithm, a high-resolution U-Net (HRU-Net), to preserve the image details by improving the skip connection structure and the loss function of the original U-Net. The proposed HRU-Net was tested in Xinjiang Province, China to extract the cultivated land from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. The result showed that the HRU-Net achieved better performance (Acc: 92.81%; kappa: 0.81; F1-score: 0.90) than the U-Net++ (Acc: 91.74%; kappa: 0.79; F1-score: 0.89), the original U-Net (Acc: 89.83%; kappa: 0.74; F1-score: 0.86), and the Random Forest model (Acc: 76.13%; kappa: 0.48; F1-score: 0.69). The robustness of the proposed model for the intra-class spectral variation and the accuracy of the edge details were also compared, and this showed that the HRU-Net obtained more accurate edge details and had less influence from the intra-class spectral variation. The model proposed in this study can be further applied to other land cover types that have more spectral diversity and require more details of extraction.

TI  - Functional heterogeneity of alveolar macrophage population based on expression of CXCL2
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the major lung-resident macrophages and have contradictory functions. AMs maintain tolerance and tissue homeostasis, but they also initiate strong inflammatory responses. However, such opposing roles within the AM population were not known to be simultaneously generated and coexist. Here, we uncovered heterogeneous AM subpopulations generated in response to two distinct pulmonary fungal infections, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Some AMs are bona fide sentinel cells that produce chemoattractant CXCL2, which also serves as a marker for AM heterogeneity, in the context of pulmonary fungal infections. However, other AMs do not produce CXCL2 and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Instead, they highly produce anti-inflammatory molecules, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and complement component 1q (C1q). These two AM subpopulations have distinct metabolic profiles and phagocytic capacities. We report that polarization of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory AM subpopulations is regulated at both epigenetic and transcriptional levels and that these AM subpopulations are generally highly plastic. Our studies have uncovered the role of C1q expression in programming and sustaining anti-inflammatory AMs. Our finding of the AM heterogeneity upon fungal infections suggests a possible pharmacological intervention target to treat fungal infections by tipping the balance of AM subpopulations.

TI  - Causal Analysis of Accuracy Obtained Using High-Resolution Global Forest Change Data to Identify Forest Loss in Small Forest Plots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying areas of forest loss is a fundamental aspect of sustainable forest management. Global Forest Change (GFC) datasets developed by Hansen et al. (inScience342:850-853, 2013) are publicly available, but the accuracy of these datasets for small forest plots has not been assessed. We used a forest-wide polygon-based approach to assess the accuracy of using GFC data to identify areas of forest loss in an area containing numerous small forest plots. We evaluated the accuracy of detection of individual forest-loss polygons in the GFC dataset in terms of a "recall ratio", the ratio of the spatial overlap of a forest-loss polygon determined from the GFC dataset to the area of a corresponding reference forest-loss polygon, which we determined by visual interpretation of aerial photographs. We analyzed the structural relationships of recall ratio with area of forest loss, tree species, and slope of the forest terrain by using linear non-Gaussian acyclic modelling. We showed that only 11.1% of forest-loss polygons in the reference dataset were successfully identified in the GFC dataset. The inferred structure indicated that recall ratio had the strongest relationships with area of forest loss, forest tree species, and height of the forest canopy. Our results indicate the need for careful consideration of structural relationships when using GFC datasets to identify areas of forest loss in regions where there are small forest plots. Moreover, further studies are required to examine the structural relationships for accuracy of land-use classification in forested areas in various regions and with different forest characteristics.

TI  - Agricultural Evolution: Process, Pattern and Water Resource Effect
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing historical landscape change and its related land-use changes is necessary for understanding agricultural evolution processes and their ecological effects. In our study, the landscape patterns of paddy fields and dry farmland were studied using information obtained from remote-sensing data. Land-use changes related to cultivated land were analyzed based on transition probability index and trajectory computing method. Furthermore, the possible driving force and water resource effect of cultivated land changes were discussed. The results indicated that paddy field and dry farmland expanded by 56.99% and 10.92% in the West Songnen Plain, respectively, compared with their own area in 1990. Trajectory analyses showed that dry farmland was usually more stable than paddy field. Climate warming, wind speed reduction, population growth, technological development, as well as land use policies all drove cultivated land changes. The net water consumption of cultivated land showed an increased trend. To achieve the sustainable development of land-system, optimizing land-use structure as well as configuration between water and soil resources should be given more attention in the future.

TI  - Changes in land cover and ecological stress in Borneo based on remote sensing and an ecological footprint method
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover and ecological stressors are known to reflect the influences of human activities on regional environments and are also indicators of sustainable development. In this research, Borneo was selected as the study area. The data were sourced from Landsat TM image data obtained in 1990, 2000 and 2010, SRTM DEM data, and DMSP/OLS night-time satellite data, along with socioeconomic information, including regional population, biological resource consumption and energy consumption data. The vegetation brightness index (VBI) and the filtered normalized difference built-up index (FNDBI) are proposed, and the overall classification accuracy reached 87% when combined with decision tree classification and visual interpretation methods. Based on the traditional ecological footprint method, a dynamic calculation method for the production factor is proposed. The ecological footprint, ecological carrying capacity, and ecological deficit/surplus of Borneo in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were then calculated, and a method for creating the corresponding grid-based spatial distribution map was proposed. The effects of human activities on land cover and ecological stress in Borneo from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed in this study. The results showed that the tropical rainforests of Borneo decreased by 13% over two decades and dramatically changed to shrublands, plantations, and arable land areas. The ecological pressure increased from the central mountains to the coastal plains, and ecological deficits appeared in the coastal zones with altitudes less than 150 m in the West Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and Sabah regions, which indicated a trend of gradual expansion. Urban construction, plantations, logging, mining, forest fires, and other human activities have interfered with natural systems, and this has led to major pressures being placed on regional sustainable development and ecological security, as well as influencing the ecological stability of other global regions.

TI  - Flow Prediction Using Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture in Irish Catchments
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to a scarcity of in situ streamflow data in ungauged or poorly gauged basins, remote sensing data is an ideal alternative. It offers a valuable perspective into the dynamic patterns that can be difficult to examine in detail with point measurements. For hydrology, soil moisture is one of the pivotal variables which dominates the partitioning of the water and energy budgets. In this study, nine Irish catchments were used to demonstrate the feasibility of using remotely sensed soil moisture for discharge prediction in ungagged basins. Using the conceptual hydrological model "Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing for Transport" (SMART), behavioural parameter sets (BPS) were selected using two different objective functions: the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R-2) for the calibration period. Good NSE scores were obtained from hydrographs produced using the satellite soil moisture BPS. While the mean performance shows the feasibility of using remotely sensed soil moisture, some outliers result in negative NSE scores. This highlights that care needs to be taken with parameterization of hydrological models using remotely sensed soil moisture for ungauged basin.

TI  - Ground deformation and fissure activity of the Yuncheng Basin (China) revealed by multiband time series InSAR
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yuncheng Basin (China) is affected by severe land subsidence and ground fissure hazards, which have caused serious land damage and economic losses to the local inhabitants. Due to the lack of long-term continuous monitoring in the region, the trend of land sub- sidence and fissure activities is unknown, which cannot meet requirements for disaster reduction and disaster prevention. In this study, Envisat ASAR, ALOS PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X are employed to monitor these hazards using time series InSAR methodology. The results showed that there were two obvious subsidence centers occurred in Yuncheng. Compared to the period from 2007 to 2011, the land subsidence rate in the Yuncheng Basin from 2012 to 2015 decreased significantly. Analysis of the differential deformation rate observed by InSAR between the two sides of the ground fissure indicates that fissure activity has weakened in recent years at the cross-section. To explain the phenomena observed by InSAR, FLAC3D was used to study the effect of pumping on ground fissure activ- ity under the condition of pre-existing faults, and the results show that pumping promotes differential activities between two sides of the fault and has a positive impact on the occurrence and the activity of ground fissures. Horizontal rectangular sill with uniform opening model is used to simulate the land subsidence and invert the pumping depth. The results are basically consistent with the local situation.

TI  - Advanced radiative transfer modeling system developed for satellite data assimilation and remote sensing applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - An advanced radiative transfer modeling system (ARMS) has been developed for satellite data assimilation and remote sensing applications. It inherits the capability of other fast radiative transfer models developed mainly for US and European satellite programs but focuses on the radiative transfer components that are specific for the assimilation of the Fengyun satellites and those sensors not included in existing models. The ARMS forward operator includes a fast transmittance module, a new particle absorption and scattering look-up table, surface emissivity and polarimetric radiative transfer solver. The particle optical properties of aerosols and ice clouds are calculated based on a super-spheroidal T-matrix model. The polarimetric two-stream approximation is adopted as the preferred solver to simulate the Stokes vector and their Jacobians. The simulations of ARMS are compared with those of other models and observations of Fengyun satellites, respectively. The comparison shows close agreement between ARMS and other existing fast radiative transfer models. Therefore, ARMS has robust simulation capabilities for existing satellite sensors.

TI  - Four decades of wetland changes in Dongting Lake using Landsat observations during 1978-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake wetland serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity protection, yet it is vulnerable to hydrologic cycle variation (caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change). The impoundment of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has influenced hydrological environment and land cover changes in the wetland. To quantify these influences, long-term land cover variations in the wetland were investigate by applying the Support Vector Machine method to Landsat satellite observations (1978-2018). We also try to explore the driving factors of vegetation changes by combining the classification results with measured hydrological and meteorological data. Some significant results have been revealed as follows:(1) In dry seasons, the most significant changes in Dongting Lake wetland were the vegetation expansion and the water area shrinkage, especially during the pre-TGD period (before 2003). Specifically, the vegetation area increased at a rate of 44.22 km(2)/a and the water decreased a a rate of 37.23 km(2)/a for the period of 1979-2001. But the variation trends of wetland cover types changed after 2003. The vegetation decreased at a rate of 24.36 km(2)/a and water increased a a rate of 20.05 km(2)/a from 2003 to 2017.(2) In we seasons, vegetation (1433.58 +/- 603.48 km(2)) and water area (2153.32 +/- 603.98 km(2)) fluctuated greatly in the pre-TGD period and the variation range narrowed significantly after 2003 (1632.62 +/- 234.39 km(2) of vegetation, 1958.5 +/- 235.04 km(2) of water).(3) Before 2003, the long-term change of vegetation area in dry seasons of the Dongting Lake wetland was strongly linear correlated with inundation area (r = -0.88, p < 0.05), sediment deposition (r = -0.84, p < 0.05) and mean temperature between July and September (r = 0.79, p < 0.05). But these relationships have changed after the operation of the TGD.In all, the variation in hydrological conditions caused by the impoundment of the TGD was likely the main reason for the variation of Dongting Lake wetland in recent decades.

TI  - A Hyperspectral Bidirectional Reflectance Model for Land Surface
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance (HSBR) model for land surface has been developed in this work. The HSBR model includes a very diverse land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database with similar to 40,000 spectra. The BRDF database is saved as Ross-Li parameters, which can generate hyperspectral reflectance spectra at different sensor and solar observation geometries. The HSBR model also provides an improved method for generating hyperspectral surface reflectance using multiband satellite measurements. It is shown that the land surface reflective spectrum can be easily simulated using BRDF parameters or reflectance at few preselected wavelengths. The HSBR model is validated using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) vegetation database and the AVIRIS reflectance product. The simulated reflective spectra fit the measurements very well with standard deviations normally smaller than 0.01 in the unit of reflectivity. The HSBR model could be used to significantly improve the quality of the reflectance products of satellite and airborne sensors. It also plays important role for intercalibration among space-based instruments and other land surface related applications.

TI  - Changes in area and water volume of the Aral Sea in the arid Central Asia over the period of 1960-2018 and their causes
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea (68,478 km(2) in 1960) was the world's fourth largest inland lake in 1960s. However, it shrank sharply over the past six decades, and its changes caused a series of severe environmental issues. In this paper, we reconstructed its variations over the period of 1960 to 2018 by using observation data and remote sensing data, and analyzed their influencing factors. The results show that the area of the Aral Sea shrank dramatically by 60,156.50 km(2) (about 87.85%) and the total loss of water volume was approximately 1,000.51 km(3) over the study period. In 1986, the Aral Sea broken up into the south and the north parts. Since then, the South Aral Sea has shrunk continuously, while both the area and the water volume of the North Aral Sea have had a lithe change and shown a very slightly increasing trend. Through comprehensive analysis, it was found that human activities, especially damming and irrigation, are the dominant factors influencing the long-term variation of the Aral Sea. The increased precipitation and glacier meltwater could not compensate for the water loss of the Aral Sea.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations of Chlorophyll a Concentration and Eutrophication Assessment (1987-2018) of Donghu Lake in Wuhan Using Landsat Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, which reflects the biomass and primary productivity of phytoplankton in water, is an important water quality parameter to assess the eutrophication status of water. The band combinations shown in the images of Donghu Lake (Wuhan City, China) captured by Landsat satellites from 1987 to 2018 were analyzed. The (B4 - B3)/(B4 + B3) [(Green-Red)/(Green+Red)] band combination was employed to construct linear, power, exponential, logarithmic and cubic polynomial models based on Chl-a values in Donghu Lake in April 2016. The correlation coefficient (R-2), the relative error (RE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the cubic model were 0.859, 9.175% and 11.194 mu g/L, respectively and those of the validation model were 0.831, 6.509% and 19.846 mu g/L, respectively. Remote sensing images from 1987 to 2018 were applied to the model and the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in spring and autumn of these years was obtained. At the same time, the eutrophication status of Donghu Lake was monitored and evaluated based on the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI). The results showed that theTLI( n-ary sumation ) of Donghu Lake in April 2016 was 63.49 and the historical data on Chl-a concentration showed that Donghu Lake had been eutrophic. The distribution of Chl-a concentration in Donghu Lake was affected by factors such as construction of bridges and dams, commercial activities and enclosure culture in the lake. The overall distribution of Chl-a concentration in each sub-lake was higher than that in the main lake region and Chl-a concentration was highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter. Based on the data of three long-term (2005-2018) monitoring points in Donghu Lake, the matching patterns between meteorological data and Chl-a concentration were analyzed. It revealed that the Chl-a concentration was relatively high in warmer years or rainy years. The long-term measured data also verified the accuracy of the cubic model for Chl-a concentration. The R-2, RE and RMSE of the validation model were 0.641, 2.518% and 22.606 mu g/L, respectively, which indicated that it was feasible to use Landsat images to retrieve long-term Chl-a concentrations. Based on longitudinal remote sensing data from 1987 to 2018, long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of Chl-a concentrations in Donghu Lake was carried out in this study, providing reference and guidance for lake water quality management in the future.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the relationship between environmental consciousness and scientific paradigms in the different periods of Western civilization's development. The peculiarities of the influence of classical, non-classical and post-non-classical science on the types of environmental consciousness characteristic of modern and postmodern societies are studied. The idea of the existence of a connection between the logical and philosophical attitudes of the New European (classical) science and the formation of the principles of anthropocentric environmental consciousness that have ensured the formation of the anthropogenic civilization is proved. It is determined that, within the framework of the non-classical paradigm, the theoretical and philosophical foundations of the ecocentric model of environmental consciousness are beginning to take shape. In the post-non-classical era, the model of ecocentrism and worldview orientations directed to the development of the strategy for the safe interaction of nature and man is being formed on the basis of the theories of postmodernism and under the influence of modern cognitive practices. The influence of ontological and epistemological attitudes dominating within the framework of scientific paradigms on the formation of principles of nature management in anthropocentric and ecocentric systems of ecological consciousness is traced.

TI  - Moho geometry beneath northern Algeria from gravity data inversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to provide a Moho geometry model for northern Algeria where the few studies that have been carried out concern only restricted areas. The method we used is based on the 3D inversion of the Bouguer anomaly data computed by the Bureau Gravimetrique International (BGI) from satellite data.The proposed Moho depths are roughly comparable to those obtained by previous studies conducted in the NE of Algeria, central part of the Saharan Atlas and according to a NNW-SSE profile from the coast to the Saharan platform. The results we obtained have been also compared to those from more detailed studies conducted in the Betics and Morocco, enabling us to validate the proposed model. The Moho depth accuracy which has been investigated through the variation of the density contrast and the initial depth shows a maximum error of +/- 2.8 km. The main results of this study indicate that the lowest Moho depth (similar to 11 km) is observed in the Algerian Basin and thereby the crust thickness is of about 8 km, while the highest (similar to 34 km) corresponds to the Saharan Atlas and the Aures and Hodna Mountains. Along the coast, the depth of the Moho is about 25 km and increases towards the south to reach 30 km at the southern boundary of the Tell Atlas. It is noteworthy to observe that the crust does not thicken under the Kabylies that would indicate that their root is not enough to isostatically support the topography.

TI  - ResNet-Locust-BN Network-Based Automatic Identification of East Asian Migratory Locust Species and Instars from RGB Images
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Locusts are agricultural pests found in many parts of the world. Developing efficient and accurate locust information acquisition techniques helps in understanding the relation between locust distribution density and structural changes in locust communities. It also helps in understanding the hydrothermal and vegetation growth conditions that affect locusts in their habitats in various parts of the world as well as in providing rapid and accurate warnings on locust plague outbreak. This study is a preliminary attempt to explore whether the batch normalization-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model can be applied used to perform automatic classification of East Asian migratory locust (AM locust),Oxya chinensis(rice locusts), and cotton locusts. In this paper, we present a way of applying the CNN technique to identify species and instars of locusts using the proposed ResNet-Locust-BN model. This model is based on the ResNet architecture and involves introduction of a BatchNorm function before each convolution layer to improve the network's stability, convergence speed, and classification accuracy. Subsequently, locust image data collected in the field were used as input to train the model. By performing comparison experiments of the activation function, initial learning rate, and batch size, we selected ReLU as the preferred activation function. The initial learning rate and batch size were set to 0.1 and 32, respectively. Experiments performed to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed ResNet-Locust-BN model show that the model can effectively distinguish AM locust from rice locusts (93.60% accuracy) and cotton locusts (97.80% accuracy). The model also performed well in identifying the growth status information of AM locusts (third-instar (77.20% accuracy), fifth-instar (88.40% accuracy), and adult (93.80% accuracy)) with an overall accuracy of 90.16%. This is higher than the accuracy scores obtained by using other typical models: AlexNet (73.68%), GoogLeNet (69.12%), ResNet 18 (67.60%), ResNet 50 (80.84%), and VggNet (81.70%). Further, the model has good robustness and fast convergence rate.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of vegetation carbon use efficiency and potential driving meteorological factors in the Yangtze River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of the vegetation dynamics is essential for addressing the potential threats of terrestrial ecosystem. In recent years, the vegetation coverage of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) has increased significantly, yet the spatio-temporal variations and potential driving meteorological factors of carbon use efficiency (CUE) under the context of global warming are still not clear. In this study, MODIS-based public-domain data during 2000-2015 was used to analyze these aspects in the YRB, a large river basin with powerful ecological functions in China. Spatio-temporal variations of CUE in different sub-basins and land cover types were investigated and the correlations with potential driving meteorological factors were examined. Results revealed that CUE in the YRB had strong spatiotemporal variability and varied remarkably in different land cover types. For the whole YRB, the average CUE of vegetated land was 0.519, while the long-term change trend of CUE was obscure. Along the rising altitude, CUE generally showed an increasing trend until the altitude of 3900 m and then followed by a decreasing trend. CUE of grasslands was generally higher than that of croplands, and then forest lands. The inter-annual variation of CUE in the YRB is likely to be driven by precipitation as a strong positive partial correlation between the inter-annual variability of CUE and precipitation was observed in most of sub-basins and land cover types in the YRB. The influence of temperature and relative humidity is also outstanding in certain regions and land cover types. Our findings are useful from the view point of carbon cycle and reasonable land cover management under the context of global warming.

TI  - COMBINING THE ULTRASOUND FEATURES OF PRIMARY TUMOR AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODES CAN REDUCE FALSE -NEGATIVE RATE DURING THE PREDICTION OF HIGH AXILLARY NODE BURDEN IN BI-RADS CATEGORY 4 OR 5 BREAST CANCER LESIONS
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether incorporation of the ultrasound (US) features of the primary tumor and axillary lymph node (ALN) could improve the prediction of high axillary nodal burden (HNB) and, thus, avoid unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A total of 347 patients with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System US category 4 or 5 breast cancer lesions were included. Their pre-operative US features and post-operative pathologic results were collected. The patients were then divided into the following groups based on surgical histology: limited nodal burden (LNB: 0-2 LNs involved) and heavy nodal burden (HNB: >= 3 metastatic LNs). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the most valuable variables for HNB prediction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to assess their values. We found that a non-circumscribed margin, cortical thickness (>= 3 mm) and number (>= 3) of suspicious ALNs are indicators for HNB prediction. The false-negative rate (FNR) in model 1 (cortical thickness + number of suspicious ALNs) was 15.5% versus 3.4% in model 2 (non-circumscribed margin + cortical thickness + number of suspicious ALNs). Our results indicate that combining the US features of the primary tumor and ALNs can reduce the FNR during HNB prediction.

TI  - Calculation of land surface emissivity and retrieval of land surface temperature based on a spectral mixing model
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a key parameter for the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST). Using the linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) to calculate the LSE can estimate the pixel composition at the sub-pixel level, which effectively solves the problem of mixed pixels when using the Landsat thermal infrared band to calculate the surface specific emissivity. In this paper, Landsat OLI/TIRS was used as the data source, surface emissivity was calculated using the LSMM of mixed pixels, and the LST was then obtained using the radiative transfer equation algorithm. M the same time, three threshold methods of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to calculate surface emissivity and then retrieve the LST. By comparing and analysing the inversion results and verifying the accuracy of the measured ground data, the surface emissivity and LST results obtained by the four methods were similar overall. Specifically, the maximum and average values of LST obtained by the LSMM were the highest, while those obtained by the Sobrino threshold method were the lowest, with an average difference of 0.63 degrees C. The difference between the LST inversion results of the LSMM and the other three methods were calculated separately, and the maximum change in LST reached 2.82 degrees C. All three ALST results showed high values in densely urbanised areas and low values in vegetation-covered areas. For urban areas with complex structures, the LSMM can be used to estimate the abundance of each component in a pixel at the sub-pixel scale, which can significantly improve the calculation accuracy of surface emissivity and lead to better LST inversion results.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperature: Recent Research Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) has been used as one of the major parameters in various climate and environmental models. Especially, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST is the most widely used satellite-based LST product due to its spatiotemporal coverage (1 km spatial and sub-daily temporal resolutions) and longevity (> 20 years). However, there is an increasing demand for LST products with finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10-250 m) over regions such as urban areas. Therefore, various methods have been proposed to produce high-resolution MODIS-like LST less than 250 m (e.g., 100 m). The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research trends and challenges for the downscaling of MODIS LST. Based on the recent literature survey for the past decade, the downscaling techniques classified into three groups-kernel-driven, fusion-based, and the combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods-were reviewed with their pros and cons. Then, five open issues and challenges were discussed: uncertainty in LST retrievals, low thermal contrast, the nonlinearity of LST temporal change, cloud contamination, and model generalization. Future research directions of LST downscaling were finally provided.

TI  - Detecting abandoned farmland using harmonic analysis and machine learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critical to inventory abandoned farmland soon after it is generated, to better manage agricultural resources and to prevent negative consequences that would otherwise follow. This study aims to distinguish abandoned farmlands from active croplands-rice paddy and agricultural fields-by discerning the phenological trajectories over a short-term period of three years (Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2018) in Gwanyang City in South Korea. For Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, we fully utilized parameters derived from harmonic analyses of the three vegetation indices (VIs: NDVI, NDWI, and SAVI) extracted from Sentinel-2A imagery. The harmonic analyses proved that higher-order sinusoid components produced better fitting to explain the trajectory of the VIs-the maximum adjusted R-2 was 95.23%-and the multiple VIs diversified the attributes for the classifications. Consequently, the higher-order harmonic components and the additional VIs increased the accuracy when used in SVM classification. The best performing classification was achieved with a composite of harmonic terms derived from the three VIs, yielding overall accuracy of 90.72%, Kappa index of 0.858, and user's accuracy for abandoned farmland of 93.40%. The proposed method here would greatly improve the process of detecting abandoned farmland, despite a relatively short observation period, and enable a rapid response to the occurrence of abandonment.

TI  - Increasing Summer Rainfall and Asymmetrical Diurnal and Seasonal Warming Enhanced Vegetation Greenness in Temperate Deciduous Forests and Grasslands of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate forests and grasslands carry key ecosystem functions and provide essential services. Remote-sensing derived greenness has been widely used to assess the response of ecosystem function to climate and land-cover changes. Although reforestation and grassland restoration have been proposed to enhance the regional greenness in Northern China, the independent contribution of climate without the interference of land-cover change at meso and large scales has rarely been explored. To separate the impacts of climate change on vegetation greenness from those of land-cover/use change, we identified large patches of forests and grasslands in Northern China without land-cover/use changes in 2001-2015 and derived their greenness using MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We found that most deciduous-broadleaved forest patches showed greening, and the significant slope of the annual mean and maximum EVI are 3.97 +/- 0.062 x 10(-3)and 4.8 +/- 0.116 x 10(-3)yr(-1), respectively. On the contrary, grassland patches showed great spatial heterogeneity and only those in the east showed greening. The partial correlation analysis between EVI and climate showed that the greening of grassland patches is primarily supported by the increased growing-season precipitation with mean significant coefficient of 0.72 +/- 0.01. While wet-year (0.57 +/- 0.01) and nongrowing-season precipitation (0.68 +/- 0.01) significantly benefit greening of deciduous-broadleaved forests, the altered temperature seasonality modulates their greening spatial-heterogeneously. The increased growing-season minimum temperature might lengthen the growing season and contribute to the greening for the temperature-limited north as shown by positive partial correlation coefficient of 0.66 +/- 0.01, but might elevate respiration and reduce greening of the forests in the south as shown by negative coefficient of -0.70 +/- 0.01. Daytime warming in growing season is found to favor the drought-tolerant oak dominated forest in the south due to enhanced photosynthesis, but may not favor the forests dominated by less-drought-tolerant birch in the north due to potential water stress. Therefore, grassland greening was essentially promoted by the growing-season precipitation, however, in addition to being driven by precipitation, greening of deciduous forests was regulated spatial-heterogeneously by asymmetrical diurnal and seasonal warming which could be attributed to species composition.

TI  - Field Observations of the Bidirectional Reflectance Characteristics of Lake Ice
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice surface albedo is an essential parameter associating with the energy exchange between water and atmosphere in cold regions, which can be retrieved from satellite remote sensing data. However, reflectivity data is not equal to the ice surface albedo because satellites always have a limited field of view at specific wavelength bands and observational angles. Anisotropy corrections are also needed according to the conditions of underlying surfaces. Since ice has strong forward scattering and its optical properties are sensitive to its physics, there is large difference in reflectance among different ice types and at different observational angles, which results in uncertainties in ice albedo retrievals. The field observations on lake ice were conducted in Wuliangsuhai lake, Inner Mongoliain February 2019. Spectral measurements of surface albedo, bidirectional reflectance distribution function(BRDF) and anisotropy reflectance factor(ARF) were conducted for the five types of lake ice: (I) ice with non-uniform bubbles under overcast sky; (II) ice with sands on surface; (III) ice with big bubbles inside; (N) ice with dense small bubbles inside, and (V) melting ice. The differences among them are discussed. The results reveal that lake ice albedo increases with the solar zenith, except for the melting ice case, showing an opposite trend. The bidirectional reflectance characteristics of ice present an obvious anisotropy. Peak reflectivity takes place in the direction of the forward scattering, and the location is significantly affected by the ice surface condition. The reflected light in the other directions mainly come from volume scattering in ice, which is insensitive to the observed zenith and can be affected by ice's uniformity at shortwave band rather than at longwave band. Results on BRDF indicate that the spectral shape of volume scattering is similar to albedo, but the attenuation rate in the longwave band of BRDF is faster than that of albedo. That is, the energy of volume scatter is more concentrated in the shortwave band. However, in the direction near the reflectivity peak, the energy is more concentrated in the longwave band than in the shortwave band. ARF results reveal that the contribution of volume scattering to surface albedo decrease with wavelength, but the role of surface reflection is on the contrary. More importantly, the order of the ARF was not the same as that of the BRDF, which suggests that the retrieval parameters for the surface albedo of different ice types are not identical even under the same observational angle.

TI  - Estimation and Spatio-temporal Patterns of Carbon Emissions from Grassland Fires in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland fires results in carbon emissions, which directly affects the carbon cycle of ecosystems and the carbon balance. The grassland area of Inner Mongolia accounts for 22% of the total grassland area in China, and many fires occur in the area every year. However, there are few models for estimation of carbon emissions from grassland fires. Accurate estimation of direct carbon emissions from grassland fires is critical to quantifying the contribution of grassland fires to the regional balance of atmospheric carbon. In this study, the regression equations for aboveground biomass (AGB) of grassland in growing season and MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were established through field experiments, then AGB during Nov.-Apr. were retrieved based on that in Oct. and decline rate, finally surface fuel load was obtained for whole year. Based on controlled combustion experiments of different grassland types in Inner Mongolia, the carbon emission rate of grassland fires for each grassland type were determined, then carbon emission was estimated using proposed method and carbon emission rate. Results revealed that annual average surface fuel load of grasslands in Inner Mongolia during 2000-2016 was approximately 1.1978 x 10(12)kg. The total area of grassland which was burned in the Inner Mongolia region over the 17-year period was 5298.75 km(2), with the annual average area of 311.69 km(2). The spatial distribution of grassland surface fuel loads is characterized by decreasing from northeast to southwest in Inner Mongolia. The total carbon emissions from grassland fires amounted to 2.24 x 10(7)kg with an annual average of 1.32 x 10(6)for the study area. The areas with most carbon emissions were mainly concentrated in Old Barag Banner and New Barag Right Banner and on the right side of the Oroqin Autonomous Banner. The spatial characteristics of carbon emission depend on the location of grassland fire, mainly in the northeast of Inner Mongolia include Hulunbuir City, Hinggan League, Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab City. The area and spatial location of grassland fires can directly affect the total amount and spatial distribution of carbon emissions. This study provides a reference for estimating carbon emissions from steppe fires. The model and framework for estimation of carbon emissions from grassland fires established can provide a reference value for estimation of carbon emissions from grassland fires in other regions.

TI  - Detecting and Assessing Nondominant Farmland Area with Long-Term MODIS Time Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While most land use and land cover (LULC) studies have focused on modeling, change detection and driving forces at the class or categorical level, few have focused on the subclass level, especially regarding the quality change within a class such as farmland. The concept of nondominant farmland area (NAF) is proposed in this study to assess within class variability and quantify farmland areas where poor environmental conditions, unsuitable natural factors, natural disasters or unsustainable management practices lead to poor crop growth and thus low yield. A 17-year (2000-2016) time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to develop a NAF extraction model with abnormal features in the NDVI curves and subsequently applied to Heilongjiang province in China. The NAF model was analyzed and assessed from three aspects: agricultural disasters, soil types and medium- and low-yield fields, to determine dominant factors of the NAF patterns. The results suggested that: (1) the NAF model was able to extract a variety of NAF types with an overall accuracy of similar to 80%. The NAF area accumulated more than 8 years in 17 years is 6.20 thousand km(2) in Heilongjiang Province, accounting for 3.75% of the total cultivated land area; (2) the NAF had significant spatial clustering characteristics and temporal variability. 53.24% of the NAF accumulated more than 8 years in 17 years is mainly concentrated in the west of Heilongjiang Province. The inter-annual NAF variability was related with meteorological variations, topography and soil properties; and (3) the spatial and temporal NAF patterns seem to reflect a cumulative impact of meteorological disasters, poor farmland quality, and soil degradation on crop growth. The determinant factors of the observed NAF patterns differed across regions, and must be interpreted in the local context of topography, soil properties and meteorological environment. Spatial and temporal NAF variability could provide useful, diagnostic information for precision farmland management.

TI  - Evaluation of the Biodiversity Conservation Function in Liaohe Delta Wetland, Northeastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific evaluation of the wetland biodiversity conservation function is the basis of balanced wetland protection and development. Our research sought to provide references for the protection of wetland ecological environments as well as the related planning and management policies. The study established a fitting model for evaluating the biodiversity conservation function in the Liaohe Delta, northeastern China. The new model, the Wetland Biodiversity Conservation Indicator (WBCI), was with four input factors, including the vegetation coverage (VC), habitat suitability index (HI), land use and land cover (LULC) index (LI), and threat factor index (TI) of the LULC type. The values assigned to HI and TI were based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) habitat quality models. The weights of all the factors in WBCI were valued with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluated the wetland biodiversity conservation function of Panjin, Liaohe Delta, China, by using the WBCI model based onGaofen-1(GF-1) satellite data in 2018, and the result was verified with InVEST and other models. It showed that the output map was similar to that of InVEST, with the higher-quality habitat including the wetland, tidal flat, water body, and forest, as well as the lower-quality land use types including the paddy field, crop field, construction land, and land used by traffic. The wetland biodiversity conservation function was better in areas less affected by human disturbance, with very abundant species and good-quality habitat. It was poor in areas impacted by more frequent human activities such as the land cultivation, housing, and traffic, which led to the landscape fragmentation. The WBCI model provided a more accurate reflection of the bird distribution than the InVEST model. The WBCI model was able to reflect the difference in quality of each habitat grade, in contrast to the net primary productivity (NPP) method and species distribution models (SDMs). The new model was, therefore, simpler and suitable in reflecting the quality of wetland biodiversity function in the Liaohe Delta.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of water conservation capacity in Ruoergai Plateau
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ruoergai Plateau has an important function in water conservation. In this study, water conservation was simulated using water balance method based on meteorological and remote sensing data. We analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of water conservation function and its influencing factors in Ruoergai Plateau during the period 2001-2017. Results showed that the amount of water conservation (AWC) varied greatly, gradually increasing from the north to the south. During the study period, the proportions of the AWC per unit area <100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-500 and >500 mm were 15.43%, 63.66%, 18.66%, 2.22%, 0.03% and 0, respectively. The average AWC in different regions was following the order of Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture > Hongyuan County > Rouergai County > Maqu County > Luqu County. The average AWC per unit area in the Ruoergai Plateau showed a slight upward trend. The proportions of the areas with significant decrease, moderate decrease, slight decrease, almost constant, slight increase, moderate increase and significant increase in water conservation were 50.64%, 16.81%, 11.64%, 5.20%, 4.52%, 7.31% and 3.88%, respectively. The AWCs in Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture and Rouergai County showed an increasing trend, while the other three counties (Maqu, Luqu, and Hongyuan) showed a decreasing trend during 2001-2017. Precipitation and elevation were the major factors driving spatiotemporal changes of water conservation function.

TI  - Drastic Improvements in Air Quality in Ecuador during the COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the beginning of 2020, the global human population encountered the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite social and economic concerns, this epidemiologic emergency has brought unexpected positive consequences for environmental quality as human activities were reduced. In this paper, the impact of restricted human activities on urban air quality in Ecuador is investigated. This country implemented a particularly strict set of quarantine measures at the very dawn of the exponential growth of infections on March 17, 2020. As a result, significant reductions in the concentrations of NO2 (-68%), SO2 (-48%), CO (-38%) and PM2.5 (-29%) were measured in the capital city of Quito during the first month of quarantine. This large drop in air pollution concentrations occurred at all the monitoring sites in Quito, serving as a valuable proof of the anthropogenic impact on urban air quality. The spatial evolution of atmospheric pollution using observed surface and satellite data, showed different results for the two major cities: Quito and Guayaquil. While the population in Quito adhered to the quarantine measures immediately, in the port city of Guayaquil, quarantine measures were slow to be adopted and, thus, the effect on air quality in Guayaquil occurred more slowly. This lag could have a considerable cost to the mortality rate in the port city, not only due to the spread of the disease but also due to the poor air quality. Overall, the air quality data demonstrate how quickly air quality can improve when emissions are reduced.

TI  - Construction of land surface dynamic feedback for digital soil mapping considering the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall magnitude
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface dynamic feedback (LSDF) information captured by time-series remote sensing data during the soil-drying process after a rainfall event provides effective covariates for digital soil mapping over low-relief areas. However, current methods used to capture LSDF require a uniform rainfall magnitude in the geographic space; a condition that is not often ma for large areas. Here, we propose a LSDF construction method considering the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall magnitudes by adjusting the evaporation variables in the LSDF. For this, the relationships between evaporation and rainfall magnitudes were first established. The LSDFs from various locations for rainfall events with different magnitudes were then adjusted based on these relationships. Using a case study, the adjusted LSDFs after two rainfall events were then used to predict soil texture over a low-relief area. The results showed that the cubic polynomial model performed best when constructing the relationship between evaporation adjustment and rainfall magnitude, giving the highest R-2 value and a low Akaike information criterion. Adjustment to the LSDF decreases with increasing rainfall and the rate of change in the adjustment also decreases with increasing rainfall. For both rainfall events, prediction accuracies with the adjusted LSDFs were higher than those based on the original LSDFs. Furthermore, the greater the adjustment, the greater the improvement in the accuracy. We conclude that the proposed construction method for LSDF, accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall magnitudes, offers improved predictive power for digital soil mapping over large areas.

TI  - On Modeling of Quad-Polarization Radar Scattering From the Ocean Surface With Breaking Waves
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of microwave radar returns based on theoretical electromagnetic scattering models are of great benefit to obtain insight into the microwave scattering mechanism at the ocean surface. In this study, quad-polarized radar backscatters from the regular ocean surface (no breaking waves) are first simulated using a composite surface Bragg model and a second-order small slope approximation model, using three different surface roughness spectral models. The copolarized and cross-polarized radar backscatters, induced by breaking waves, are then quantitatively estimated using two recent empirical models, which are dependent on incidence angles, wind speeds, and wind directions. Model-simulated total radar backscatters, from regular surface waves and breaking waves, are statistically compared with measurements from spaceborne C-band quad-polarization RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar and also calculations from copolarized and cross-polarized geophysical model functions. Results show that simulations of quad-polarization radar backscatter are significantly improved when the effects of breaking waves are incorporated, especially for HH and VH polarizations.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Dynamics and Landscape Ecological Risk on the Mainstream of Tarim River, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tarim River (TR), the longest inland river at an arid area in China, plays a critical role in the sustainable development of the regional ecological environment. This study presents the spatial-temporal variations in the vegetation coverage at regional and pixel scales and its driving factors on the TR mainstream. The latest dataset of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a vegetation coverage index (fc) over the period from 2000-2015 were analyzed with the unary linear regression and the partial correlation. On the basis of land use data, we further built the landscape ecological risk index and assessed the ecological risk level of the mainstream. Our results suggest that the vegetation coverage index demonstrated fluctuations but denoted a generally upward trend in the TR mainstream, the vegetation improvement areas are far greater than the degraded areas during the study period. Apparently, the overflow days in the TR mainstream and the cumulative amount of water transport are the two main factors that dominate the vegetation coverage. The ecological risk level varies throughout the TR with a high-to-low spatial distribution from upstream to downstream, and the overall landscape ecological risk of the whole basin exhibits an upward tendency. Above all, our study provides a framework with the remote sensing data to assess vegetation coverage and landscape ecological risk which can help design and implement reliable strategies for the ecological management and vegetation restoration in the Tarim River Basin.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Sensing Reflectance Derived From the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument Observations Using POLYMER Atmospheric Correction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a five-day revisit frequency over coastal regions and a spatial resolution of 10-60 m, the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) has shown its capacity to provide a reasonably accurate remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data product over water when the standard "black pixel" (BP) atmospheric correction algorithm was applied to the top-of-atmospheric (TOA) reflectance data. Alternative atmospheric correction approaches, such as the POLYnomial-based algorithm applied to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) (POLYMER), may show advantages under nonoptimal observation conditions (e.g., in the presence of strong sun glint). Here, POLYMER is implemented to process the data collected by both MSI and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with the resulting R-rs evaluated with concurrent and colocated in situ R-rs data collected from the AERONET-OC platforms. The results indicate less uncertainties in the MSI R-rs than those in the MODIS R-rs, and also less uncertainties in the MSI R-rs than those reported earlier. This is possibly attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of coastal waters where MODIS coarse-resolution data may suffer, and to the high-quality AERONET-OC data. In addition, for the evaluation data set, MSI R-rs does not appear to suffer from adjacency effects from the AERONET-OC platform and clouds, leading to more coverage than MODIS in nearshore waters. However, MSI R-rs is noisy in relatively clear waters, possibly due to the noisy TOA reflectance in the atmospheric correction bands over clear waters.

TI  - Parcel-level mapping of crops in a smallholder agricultural area: A case of central China using single-temporal VHSR imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of crop patterns in smallholder agricultural areas is essential for guiding local crop yield estimates, agricultural subsidy allocations, and food security policy formulation. The household-operated land management model leads to a highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscape; therefore, fine crop mapping in smallholder agricultural areas remains challenging. By using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images, this study aimed to explore parcel-level crop mapping methods using the case of a typical smallholder agricultural area in Wuhan, China. Object-based image analysis techniques as well as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify WorldView-2 (WV2) images into eight crop-level agricultural land use categories. Several classification models were built using the combination of two classifiers and different image features, including spectral, geometrical, and textural features. The results showed that the classification model using the RF classifier and all 27 selected features had the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 80.04% and a kappa value of 0.78; specifically, the user's and producer's accuracies of rice, cotton, lotus, bare paddy field and bare upland field exceeded 80%. We found that the performance of the RF and SVM classifiers was generally comparable, although as the input features increased, the accuracy of the RF was slightly higher than that of the SVM. The use of spatial features, such as the gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) standard deviation, GLCM correlation, and area of image objects, could help improve the accuracy of parcel-level crop mapping. Our research confirmed the practical value of single-temporal VHRS images and RF classifiers in mapping parcel-level crops in complex agricultural areas. This framework provides a methodological reference for accurately monitoring crop distribution in smallholder agriculture areas to support the development of local precision agriculture.

TI  - Intelligent rolling compaction system for earth-rock dams
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The compaction quality of earth-rock dams primarily depends on manual control of the compaction parameters during construction and random spot tests after construction. However, manual control of the compaction parameters can result in more control errors and quality defects and cannot satisfy the requirements of construction operations under all weather and extreme conditions. Additionally, spot tests with characteristics such as random and destructive detection, low efficiency, and high costs cannot adequately reflect the compaction status of an entire area or satisfy the requirements of rapid mechanised construction. This paper presents an intelligent rolling compaction method based on a new framework of material-machine-information-machine intelligent decision-making for earth-rock dams. Using the proposed system integration method based on three-layer structure, IRC system can be obtained by integrating the continuous compaction control acoustic wave detection (CAWD) system combined with real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS), intelligent decision-making (IDM) system based on the global compaction process-dynamic optimisation method (GCPDOM), unmanned rolling compaction (URC) system based on automatic driving technology, and real-time remote monitoring centre based on the triangle architecture. The implementation of the proposed system in the Qianping Reservoir construction site has shown that its operation is stable and reliable, and it can effectively eliminate the impact of human factors on compaction quality control, thereby significantly improving the compaction quality and construction efficiency of earth-rock dams.

AB  - Accurate measurements of soil moisture are beneficial to our understanding of hydrological processes in the earth system. A multivariable approach using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique is proposed to estimate the soil moisture from Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboardFengyun-3Csatellite. In this study, Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS) products disseminated from NOAA are used as a truth to train the algorithm with the input of MWRI brightness temperatures (TBs) at 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz, TB polarization ratios (PRs) at 10.65, 18.7, and 23.8 GHz, height in digital elevation model (DEM), and soil porosity. The retrieved soil moisture is also validated against the independent SMOPS data, and the correlation coefficient is about 0.8 and mean bias is 0.002 m(3)m(-3)over the period from 1 August 2017 to 31 May 2019. Our retrieval of soil moisture also has a higher correlation with ECMWF ERA5 soil moisture data than the MWRI operational products. In the western part of China, the spatial distribution of MWRI soil moisture is much improved, compared to the MWRI operational products.

TI  - Information extraction and dynamic evaluation of soil salinization with a remote sensing method in a typical county on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamics of soil salinization is of great importance for agricultural production. This study selected Yucheng County, a typical county on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (HHHP) of China, as the study area and evaluated the spatial and temporal variation of soil salinization. Three methods, consisting of principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, tasseled cap (TC) transformation, and optimal band combination (OBC), were used to extract information from an early Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) image from 1984, and their advantages were compared. In addition, OBC was used on a thematic mapper (TM) image from 2009. An iteratively self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used together with prior knowledge of likely classifications to interpret the MSS and TM images for data classification. Finally, a transfer matrix method was used to assess the spatial and temporal variability of soil salinization and analyze the driving factors of soil salinization. Compared to PCA transformation and OBC, TC transformation was a more effective method for extracting soil salinization information from the MSS sensor. The results indicate that a soil area of approximately 298 km(2) was affected by salinity in 1984 in Yucheng County, of which 5.40%, 11.96%, and 12.75% were classified as being subject to slight, moderate, and severe salinization, respectively. In 2009, the saline area was reduced to only 146 km(2), of which 10.70% and 3.75% were characterized by slight to moderate salinization and no severe salinization, respectively. The saline land decreased at an average rate of 6 km(2) per year. This decrease was probably a result of lower groundwater depth, increased organic fertilizer or crop straw in soil, changed land use type, and increased vegetation coverage.

TI  - Snow cover identification and area change in mountainous regions based on Sentinel-2 time series data
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important indicator of global climate change , and also an important freshwater resource in the arid regions of northwest China. Satellite remote sensing is an important way for snow cover identification and area change monitoring due to its large-scale , short-period , and repeated observations. Compared with Landsat TM , Sentinel-2 image has advantages of higher radiation resolution, spectral resolution and spatial resolution, and higher time resolution, which undoubtedly is an important data source for snow research. At small and medium scales , the radiation brightness of high-resolution satellite is affected not only by atmospheric attenuation such as atmospheric water vapor and aerosol, by topographical factors such as terrain shading , slope , aspect , but also by the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( BRDF) , which distorts the surface information. Based on the digital elevation model ( DEM ) , the atmosphere correction and topographic correction preprocessing were carried out synchronously on the basis of the surface BRDF characteristics using the mountain radiative transmission model, with 20 Sentinel-2 images of the middle section of Tianshan Mountain in China from May 2017 to April 2018. Then, snow cover information was accurately extracted by the normalization difference snow index NDSI and the snow reflectance threshold method in the green and near-infrared bands. This method effectively eliminates the effects of water bodies , dense vegetation, shadows , and low radiance pixels on the recognition of snow. Moreover, combined with historical weather data, the variation characteristics of snow cover in the study area were analyzed within one year. Our results have great significance to the research on changes of surface reflectance and energy balance as well as terrestrial ecological environment caused by snow melting.

TI  - Satellite Observations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>Changes and Driving Factors Based Forecasting Over China 2000-2025
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is a challenging environmental problem. Systematic PM(2.5)measurements have started only in 2013, resulting in a lack of historical data which is a key obstacle for the analysis of long-term PM(2.5)trends and forecasting the evolution over this hot region. Satellite data can provide a new approach to derive historical PM(2.5)information provided that the column-integrated aerosol properties can adequately be converted to PM2.5. In this study, a recently developed formulation for the calculation of surface PM(2.5)concentrations using satellite data is introduced and applied to reconstruct a PM(2.5)time series over China from 2000 to 2015. The formulated model is also used to explore the PM(2.5)driving factors related to anthropogenic or meteorological parameters in this historical period. The results show that the annually averaged PM(2.5)over China's polluted regions increased rapidly between 2004 and 2007 (with an average rate of 3.07 mu g m(-3)yr(-1)) to reach values of up to 61.1 mu g m(-3)in 2007, and decreased from 2011 to 2015 with an average rate of -2.61 mu g m(-3)yr(-1), to reach a value of 46.9 mu g m(-3)in 2015. The analysis shows that the increase in PM(2.5)before 2008 was mainly associated with increasing anthropogenic factors, further augmented by the effect of meteorological influences. However, the decrease in PM(2.5)after 2011 is mainly attributed to the effect of pollution control measures on anthropogenic factors, whereas the effects of meteorological factors have continued to increase since 2000. The results also suggest that further reduction in anthropogenic emissions is needed to accelerate the decrease in PM(2.5)concentrations to reach the target of 35 mu g m(-3)over major polluted areas in China before 2025.

TI  - Study on Global Burned Forest Areas Based on Landsat Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are an extremely valuable natural resource for human development. Satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used in global and regional forest monitoring and management. Accurate data on forest degradation and disturbances due to forest fire is important to understand forest ecosystem health and forest cover conditions. For a long time, satellite-based global burned area products were only available at coarse native spatial resolution, which was difficult for detecting small and highly fragmented fires. In order to analyze global burned forest areas at finer spatial resolution, in this study a novel, multi-year 30 meter resolution global burned forest area product was generated and released based on Landsat time series data. Statistics indicate that in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 the total area of burned forest land in the world was 94.14 million hm2, 96.65 million hm2, 59.52 million hm(2), 76.42 million hm2, and 83.70 million hm(2), respectively, with an average value of 82.09 million hm(2). Spatial distribution patterns of global burned forest areas were investigated across different continents and climatic domains. It was found that burned forest areas were mainly distributed in Africa and Oceania, which accounted for approximately 73.85% and 6.81% of the globe, respectively. By climatic domain, the largest burned forest areas occurred in the tropics, with proportions between 88.44% and 95.05% of the world's total during the study period. Multi-year dynamic analysis shows the global burned forest areas varied considerably due to global climate anomalies, e.g., the La Nina phenomenon.

TI  - Unprecedented Temporary Reduction in Global Air Pollution Associated with COVID-19 Forced Confinement: A Continental and City Scale Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortly after the outbreak of the novel infectious disease (COVID-19) started at the end of 2019, it turned into a global pandemic, which caused the lockdown of many countries across the world. Various strict measures were adopted to reduce anthropogenic activities in order to prevent further spread and infection of the disease. In this study, we utilized continental scale remotely sensed data along with city scale in situ air quality observations for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2015-2019) to provide an early insight on air pollution changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, by combining both continental and city scales. For the continental scale analysis, data of NO2, SO2, and O-3 were acquired from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). For city scale analysis, data of NO2, CO, PM2.5, O-3, and SO2 were derived from ground-based air quality observations. Results from satellite observations at the continental scale showed that concentrations of NO2, SO2, and AOD substantially dropped in 2020 during the lockdown period compared to their averages for the baseline period over all continents, with a maximum reduction of similar to 33% for NO2 in East Asia, similar to 41% for SO2 in East Asia, and similar to 37% for AOD in South Asia. In the case of O-3, the maximum overall reduction was observed as similar to 11% in Europe, followed by similar to 10% in North America, while a slight increase was found in other study regions. These findings align with ground-based air quality observations, which showed that pollutants such as NO2, CO, PM2.5, and SO2 during the 2020 lockdown period decreased significantly except that O-3 had varying patterns in different cities. Specifically, a maximum reduction of similar to 49% in NO2 was found in London, similar to 43% in CO in Wuhan, similar to 38% in PM2.5 in Chennai, and similar to 48% in SO2 in Beijing. In the case of urban O-3, a maximum reduction of similar to 43% was found in Wuhan, but a significant increase of similar to 47% was observed in Chennai. It is obvious that restricted human activities during the lockdown have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality, especially across the metropolitan cities.

TI  - A Deep Neural Networks Approach for Augmenting Samples of Land Cover Classification
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is one of key indicators for modeling ecological, environmental, and climatic processes, which changes frequently due to natural factors and anthropogenic activities. The changes demand various samples for updating land cover maps, although in reality the number of samples is always insufficient. Sample augment methods can fill this gap, but these methods still face difficulties, especially for high-resolution remote sensing data. The difficulties include the following: (1) excessive human involvement, which is mostly caused by human interpretation, even by active learning-based methods; (2) large variations of segmented land cover objects, which affects the generalization to unseen areas especially for proposed methods that are validated in small study areas. To solve these problems, we proposed a sample augment method incorporating the deep neural networks using a Gaofen-2 image. To avoid error accumulation, the neural network-based sample augment (NNSA) framework employs non-iterative procedure, and augments from 184 image objects with labels to 75,112 samples. The overall accuracy (OA) of NNSA is 20% higher than that of label propagation (LP) in reference to expert interpreted results; the LP has an OA of 61.16%. The accuracy decreases by approximately 10% in the coastal validation area, which has different characteristics from the inland samples. We also compared the iterative and non-iterative strategies without external information added. The results of the validation area containing original samples show that non-iterative methods have a higher OA and a lower sample imbalance. The NNSA method that augments sample size with higher accuracy can benefit the update of land cover information.

TI  - A Data Fusion Modeling Framework for Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature from Landsat-8 and Modis Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical state variable of land surface energy equilibrium and a key indicator of environmental change such as climate change, urban heat island, and freezing-thawing hazard. The high spatial and temporal resolution datasets are urgently needed for a variety of environmental change studies, especially in remote areas with few LST observation stations. MODIS and Landsat satellites have complementary characteristics in terms of spatial and temporal resolution for LST retrieval. To make full use of their respective advantages, this paper developed a pixel-based multi-spatial resolution adaptive fusion modeling framework (called pMSRAFM). As an instance of this framework, the data fusion model for joint retrieval of LST from Landsat-8 and MODIS data was implemented to generate the synthetic LST with Landsat-like spatial resolution and MODIS temporal information. The performance of pMSRAFM was tested and validated in the Heihe River Basin located in China. The results of six experiments showed that the fused LST was high similarity to the direct Landsat-derived LST with structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.83 and the index of agreement (d) of 0.84. The range ofSSIMwas 0.65-0.88, the root mean square error(RMSE)yielded a range of 1.6-3.4 degrees C, and the averagedbiaswas 0.6 degrees C. Furthermore, the temporal information of MODIS LST was retained and optimized in the synthetic LST. TheRMSEranged from 0.7 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C with an average value of 1.1 degrees C. When compared with in situ LST observations, the mean absolute error andbiaswere reduced after fusion with the mean absolute bias of 1.3 degrees C. The validation results that fused LST possesses the spatial pattern of Landsat-derived LSTs and inherits most of the temporal properties of MODIS LSTs at the same time, so it can provide more accurate and credible information. Consequently, pMSRAFM can be served as a promising and practical fusion framework to prepare a high-quality LST spatiotemporal dataset for various applications in environment studies.

TI  - Estimating fractional vegetation cover from leaf area index and clumping index based on the gap probability theory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gap probability theory provides a theoretical equation to calculate fractional vegetation cover (FVC). However, the main algorithms used in present FVC products generation are still the linear mixture model and machine learning methods. The reason to limit the gap probability theory applied in the product algorithm is the availability and accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI) products. With the improvement of the LAI and CI products, it is necessary to assess whether the algorithm based on gap probability theory using the present products can improve the accuracy of FVC products. In this study, we generated the FVC estimates based on the gap probability theory (FVCgap) with a resolution of 500 m every 8 days for Europe. FVCgap estimates were validated with field FVC measurements of ImagineS from 2013 to 2015 for crop types. Two existing FVC products, Geoland2 Versionl (GEOV1) and Multisource data Synergized Quantitative remote sensing production system (MuSyQ), were used to inter-compare with the FVCgap estimates. FVCgap estimates showed a better agreement with field FVC measurements, with lowest root mean square error (RMSE) (0.1211) and bias (0.0224), than GEOV1 and MuSyQ FVC products. The inter-annual and seasonal variations of FVCgap estimates were also showed the most consistent with field measurements.

TI  - Lake area monitoring based on land surface temperature in the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake area change in the Tibetan plateau is an important indicator for climate change assessment. To overcome the temporal inconsistency of optical remote sensing-based lake area detections, a land surface temperature (LST)-based detection scheme was proposed by utilizing the big difference between land and water surface temperatures. A trend test conducted by the Mann-Kendall (MK) method was successfully applied to investigate lake area variation from 2000 to 2018 with the use of the annual mean temperature information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST daily product. A comparison with the monitoring results from Landsat images indicates the proposed method can provide spatial distributions of lake area change with high accuracy. More importantly, the temporal variation of annual mean LST provides a special way to detect the abrupt change year (ACY) in lake area.The ACYs of most lakes mainly occur from 2004 to 2012. For an individual lake, the ACY offers vital information about the lake area change process. In summary, this work demonstrates the good potential of the LST-based method for lake area monitoring and assessment.

TI  - Reconstruction of Cloud-free Sentinel-2 Image Time-series Using an Extended Spatiotemporal Image Fusion Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series for medium spatial resolution satellite imagery are a valuable resource for environmental assessment and monitoring at regional and local scales. Sentinel-2 satellites from the European Space Agency (ESA) feature a multispectral instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands and spatial resolutions from 10 m to 60 m, offering a revisit range from 5 days at the equator to a daily approach of the poles. Since their launch, the Sentinel-2 MSI image time-series from satellites have been used widely in various environmental studies. However, the values of Sentinel-2 image time-series have not been fully realized and their usage is impeded by cloud contamination on images, especially in cloudy regions. To increase cloud-free image availability and usage of the time-series, this study attempted to reconstruct a Sentinel-2 cloud-free image time-series using an extended spatiotemporal image fusion approach. First, a spatiotemporal image fusion model was applied to predict synthetic Sentinel-2 images when clear-sky images were not available. Second, the cloudy and cloud shadow pixels of the cloud contaminated images were identified based on analysis of the differences of the synthetic and observation image pairs. Third, the cloudy and cloud shadow pixels were replaced by the corresponding pixels of its synthetic image. Lastly, the pixels from the synthetic image were radiometrically calibrated to the observation image via a normalization process. With these processes, we can reconstruct a full length cloud-free Sentinel-2 MSI image time-series to maximize the values of observation information by keeping observed cloud-free pixels and calibrating the synthetized images by using the observed cloud-free pixels as references for better quality.

TI  - Generating a Spatio-Temporal Complete 30 m Leaf Area Index from Field and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for vegetation monitoring and land surface ecosystem research. Although a variety of LAI products have been generated, the moderate to coarse spatial resolution and low temporal resolution of these products are insufficient for regional-scale analysis. In this study, a modified ensemble Kalman filter model (MEnKF) was proposed to generate spatio-temporal complete 30 m LAI data. High-quality, filtered historical Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data were used to obtain the LAI background, and an LAI temporal dynamic model was constructed based on it. An improved back-propagation (BP) neural network based on a simulated annealing algorithm (SA-BP) was constructed with paired Landsat surface reflectance data and field LAI data to generate a 30 m LAI. The MEnKF was used to estimate the spatio-temporal complete LAI beginning from the LAI peak value position where Landsat observations were available. The spatio-temporal 30 m LAI was estimated in farmland (Pshenichne), grassland (Zhangbei), and woodland (Genhe) sites. The results indicate that the MEnKF-estimated LAI is consistent with the field measurements for all sites (the coefficient of determination (R-2)=0.70; root mean squared error (RMSE)=0.40) and is better than that of the conventional sequence data assimilation algorithm (R-2=0.40; RMSE=0.78). The regional LAI captures the vegetation growth pattern and is consistent with the Landsat LAI, with an R-2 larger than 0.65 and an RMSE less than 0.51. The proposed MEnKF algorithm, which effectively avoids error accumulation in the data assimilation scheme, is an efficient method for spatio-temporal complete 30 m LAI estimation.

TI  - Methods of Rapid Quality Assessment for National-Scale Land Surface Change Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing rapid access to land surface change data and information is a goal of the U.S. Geological Survey. Through the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative, we have initiated a monitoring capability that involves generating a suite of 10 annual land cover and land surface change datasets across the United States at a 30-m spatial resolution. During the LCMAP automated production, on a tile-by-tile basis, erroneous data can occasionally be generated due to hardware or software failure. While crucial to assure the quality of the data, rapid evaluation of results at the pixel level during production is a substantial challenge because of the massive data volumes. Traditionally, product quality relies on the validation after production, which is inefficient to reproduce the whole product when an error occurs. This paper presents a method for automatically evaluating LCMAP results during the production phase based on 14 indices to quickly find and flag erroneous tiles in the LCMAP products. The methods involved two types of comparisons: comparing LCMAP values across the temporal record to measure internal consistency and calculating the agreement with multiple intervals of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data to measure the consistency with existing products. We developed indices on a tile-by-tile basis in order to quickly find and flag potential erroneous tiles by comparing with surrounding tiles using local outlier factor analysis. The analysis integrates all indices into a local outlier score (LOS) to detect erroneous tiles that are distinct from neighboring tiles. Our analysis showed that the methods were sensitive to partially erroneous tiles in the simulated data with a LOS higher than 2. The rapid quality assessment methods also successfully identified erroneous tiles during the LCMAP production, in which land surface change results were not properly saved to the products. The LOS map and indices for rapid quality assessment also point to directions for further investigations. A map of all LOS values by tile for the published LCMAP shows all LOS values are below 2. We also investigated tiles with high LOS to ensure the distinction with neighboring tiles was reasonable. An index in this study shows the overall agreement between LCMAP and NLCD on a tile basis is above 71.5% and has an average at 89.1% across the 422 tiles in the conterminous United States. The workflow is suitable for other studies with a large volume of image products.

TI  - Assessment of Leaf Chlorophyll Content Models for Winter Wheat Using Landsat-8 Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a critical index to characterize crop growth conditions, photosynthetic capacity, and physiological status. Its dynamic change characteristics are of great significance for monitoring crop growth conditions and understanding the process of material and energy exchange between crops and the environment. Extensive research has focused on LCC retrieval with hyperspectral data onboard various sensor platforms. Nevertheless, limited attention has been paid to LCC inversion from multispectral data, such as the data from Landsat-8, and the potentials and capabilities of the data for crop LCC estimation have not been fully explored. The present study made use of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery and the corresponding field experimental data to evaluate their capabilities and potentials for LCC modeling using four different retrieval methods: vegetation indices (VIs), machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs), lookup-table (LUT)-based inversion, and hybrid regression approaches. The results showed that the modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) exhibited the best estimate accuracy for LCC retrieval with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.99 mu g/cm(2)and a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 10.49%. Several other vegetation indices that were established from red and near-infrared (NIR) bands also exhibited good accuracy. Models established from Gaussian process regression (GPR) achieved the highest accuracy for LCC retrieval (RMSE = 5.50 mu g/cm(2), RRMSE = 9.62%) compared with other MLRAs. Moreover, red and NIR bands outweighed other bands in terms of GPR modelling. LUT-based inversion methods with the "K(x) = -log (x) + x" cost function that belongs to the "minimum contrast estimates" family showed the best estimation results (RMSE = 8.08 mu g/cm(2), RRMSE = 14.14%), and the addition of multiple solution regularization strategies effectively improved the inversion accuracy. For hybrid regression methods, the use of active learning (AL) techniques together with GPR for LCC modelling significantly increased the estimation accuracy, and the combination of entropy query by bagging (EQB) AL and GPR had the best accuracy for LCC estimation (RMSE = 12.43 mu g/cm(2), RRMSE = 21.77%). Overall, our study suggest that Landsat-8 OLI data are suitable for crop LCC retrieval and could provide a basis for LCC estimation with similar multispectral datasets.

TI  - Association of higher axillary pathologic complete response rate with breast pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To investigate the association of axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) rate among breast cancer patients with pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT).Methods: The retrospective clinical data of 1,903 patients who were treated with NCT between March, 2010 and December, 2018, were collected from one Chinese database and analyzed. The correlations between clinicopathological characteristics and breast pCR with axillary pCR were calculated by chi(2) test. Binary logistic regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis. The relative risk of positive axillary nodes after NCT in patients with and without breast pCR was analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by initial N stage and tumor subtype.Results: The rate of axillary pCR was increased in the cases with initial cN0, Ki67 high expression, HR+HER2+/HR-HER2+/TN subtypes, and breast pCR. After NCT, the relative risk of nodal disease burden was 4.81 in patients without breast pCR compared with patients with breast pCR. The relative risk of positive nodal status in patients with cN0, cN1, cN2, and cN3 disease without vs. with breast pCR was 6.45, 4.88, 5.69 and 6.24, respectively. The relative risk of positive nodal status in patients with HR+HER2-, HR+HER2+, HR-HER2+, and TN disease was 4.02, 4.50, 3.82 and 4.18, respectively. Of cN0 patients with breast pCR, only 4 out of 44 (9%) with HER2-positive disease had 1 or 2 axillary lymph node metastases at final surgical pathology compared to 30 out of 98 (31%) of those without breast pCR. There was no evidence of positive nodal residue among all 21 patients (100%) with TN disease compared to 65% (36 of 55) of patients without breast pCR.Conclusions: Nodal status is strongly correlated with breast pCR after NCT. Patients with initial cN0/1 TN/HER2 positive disease who achieve breast pCR at surgery have a low risk of nodal metastasis. These results suggest that the failure rate of missing positive lymph nodes among those patients was very low and that it is safe for such patients to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NCT. This study also provides a theoretical basis for clinical trials focused on the avoidance of axillary surgery in selected patients.

TI  - Crop Growth Stage GPP-Driven Spectral Model for Evaluation of Cultivated Land Quality Using GA-BPNN
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate evaluation of cultivated land quality (CLQ) using remotely sensed images plays an important role for national food security and social stability. Current approaches for evaluating CLQ do not consider spectral response relationships between CLQ and spectral indicators based on crop growth stages. This study aimed to propose an accurate spectral model to evaluate CLQ based on late rice phenology. In order to increase the accuracy of evaluation, the Empirical Bayes Kriging (EBK) interpolation was first performed to scale down gross primary production (GPP) products from a 500 m spatial resolution to 30 m. As an indicator, the ability of MODIS-GPPs from critical growth stages (tillering, jointing, heading, and maturity stages) was then investigated by combining Pearson correlation analysis and variance inflation factor (VIF) to select the phases of CLQ evaluation. Finally, a linear Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and two nonlinear models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Genetic Algorithm-Based Back Propagation Neural Network (GA-BPNN), were driven to develop an accurate spectral model of evaluating CLQ based on MODIS-GPPs. The models were tested and compared in the Conghua and Zengcheng districts of Guangzhou City, Guangdong, China. The results showed that based on field measured GPP data, the validation accuracy of 30 m spatial resolution MODIS GPP products with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.43 and normalized RMSE (NRMSE) of 1.59% was higher than that of the 500 m MODIS GPP products, indicating that the downscaled 30 m MODIS GPP products by EBK were more appropriate than the 500 m products. Compared with PLSR (R-2 = 0.38 and RMSE = 87.97) and SVR (R-2 = 0.64 and RMSE = 64.38), the GA-BPNN model (R-2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 60.12) was more accurate to evaluate CLQ, implying a non-linear relationship of CLQ with the GPP spectral indicator. This is the first study to improve the accuracy of estimating CLQ using the rice growth stage GPP-driven spectral model by GA-BPNN and can thus advance the literature in this field.

TI  - Prognosis and Management of <i>BRAF</i> V600E-Mutated Pregnancy-Associated Melanoma
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Approximately one third of women who develop melanoma at childbearing age are diagnosed during gestation or the postpartum period, facing pregnancy-associated melanoma (PAM). However, only some retrospective studies with heterogeneous data have analyzed the impact of pregnancy on melanoma development, and no evidence exists about the behavior and the management ofBRAF-mutated disease. Subjects, Materials, and Methods In order to better describe the evolution ofBRAFV600E-mutated PAM, we present here all consecutive cases diagnosed in our site during the last 7 years, recording oncological, obstetrical, and perinatal parameters, as well as the therapeutic decisions for both melanoma and gestation. Based on our institutional experience, we weigh the current published evidence and discuss upcoming clinical considerations about the prognosis of PAM, the role ofBRAFstatus, and the possible treatment options during pregnancy in localized or advanced/metastatic disease. Five women were diagnosed with newly metastatic or relapsedBRAFV600E-mutated PAM (four during gestation and one in the 1st year postpartum) between 2012 and 2019. All of them developed extensive metastatic disease with multiple organ involvement, and four developed brain metastases. All cases experienced melanoma progression in less than 6 months under targeted therapy and died soon independently of the followed sequence of treatments. All the neonates were delivered alive and healthy, but one developed melanoma earlier than the second year of life. Results Reviewing the literature to confirm our unfavorable outcomes, no specific data onBRAF-mutated PAM were retrieved and current evidence still supports that the prognosis of PAM should be guided by the established risk factors, whereas the management of advanced/metastatic PAM should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Conclusion More data are required to ascertain whetherBRAF-mutated profile adversely affects PAM outcome, although the clinicians should be aware to detect any potential melanoma lesion during pregnancy as soon as possible, treating it locally, regardless of itsBRAFstatus. Implications for Practice The prognosis and management of pregnancy-associated melanoma whetherBRAF-mutated or wild type, is currently guided by the same parameters as in the nonpregnant condition. In this special nontrial subpopulation,BRAF-mutated status seems to have a detrimental effect on disease outcome, independently of the following treatments. In early stage melanoma, wide local excision with or without sentinel lymph node dissection may be curative at any trimester of gestation, while in advanced/metastatic setting, therapeutic strategy including immune-checkpoint or BRAF/MEK inhibitors, is more challenging, regardless ofBRAFstatus, and should be based on an individualized decision in each case at a multidisciplinary level.

TI  - Application of magnetic resonance computer-aided diagnosis for preoperatively determining invasive disease in ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze kinetic and morphologic features using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to predict occult invasive components in cases of biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We enrolled 138 patients with 141 breasts who underwent preoperative breast MRI and were diagnosed with DCIS via ultrasonography (US)-guided core needle biopsy performed at our institution during January 2009 to December 2012. Their clinical, mammographic, ultrasonographic, MRI, and final histologic findings were retrospectively reviewed. Their mammographic, ultrasonographic, and MRI findings were analyzed according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CAD findings of detectability, initial (fast, medium, and slow) and delay (persistent, plateau, and washout) phase enhancement kinetic descriptor, peak enhancement percentage, and lesion size were evaluated. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using independentttest and chi(2)or Fisher exact test, respectively. Independent factors for predicting the presence of invasive component were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Final histologic findings revealed that 55 breasts (39%) had DCIS with an invasive component. MRI-detected, CAD-detected, or pathologic lesion size (P = .002,P = .001,P < .001, respectively), delay washout kinetics and detectability on CAD (P P = .004, respectively), presence of symptoms (P = .01),presence of comedonecrosis (P < .001), nuclear grade (P = .001), abnormality on mammography (P = .02), or US (P = .03) were significantly different between pure DCIS and the DCIS with an invasive component group on univariate analysis. Of those findings, multivariate analysis revealed that delay washout on CAD (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96-9.69;P = .0003) and pathologic size (OR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.05-1.57;P = .014) were independent predictive factors for the presence of an invasive component. Delay washout kinetic features measured by CAD and pathologic tumor size are potentially useful for predicting occult invasion in cases of biopsy-proven DCIS. Breast MRI including a CAD system would be helpful for predicting invasive components in cases of biopsy-proven DCIS and for selecting patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - A comparison of baleen whale density estimates derived from overlapping satellite imagery and a shipborne survey
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As whales recover from commercial exploitation, they are increasing in abundance in habitats that they have been absent from for decades. However, studying the recovery and habitat use patterns of whales, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions, frequently poses logistical and economic challenges. Here we trial a new approach for measuring whale density in a remote area, using Very-High-Resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery. This approach has capacity to provide sightings data to complement and assist traditional sightings surveys. We compare at-sea whale density estimates to estimates derived from satellite imagery collected at a similar time, and use suction-cup archival logger data to make an adjustment for surface availability. We demonstrate that satellite imagery can provide useful data on whale occurrence and density. Densities, when unadjusted for surface availability are shown to be considerably lower than those estimated by the ship survey. However, adjusted for surface availability and weather conditions (0.13 whales per km(2), CV=0.38), they fall within an order of magnitude of those derived by traditional line-transect estimates (0.33 whales per km(2), CV=0.09). Satellite surveys represent an exciting development for high-resolution image-based cetacean observation at sea, particularly in inaccessible regions, presenting opportunities for ongoing and future research.

TI  - Pre-operative axillary ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology performance and predictive factors of false negatives in axillary lymph node involvement in early breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females worldwide. Axillary lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor in pre-operative evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of AUS during the initial breast cancer diagnosis and the contribution of ultrasound with guided FNAC (AUS + FNAC) in cases of suspicious node. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at the Lorraine Cancer Institute between 1 January and 31 December 2015. It included patients with early breast cancer, all of whom received AUS. If axillary node involvement was suspected, FNAC was performed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed depending on FNAC results. Results In total, 292 patients were included. 88 patients (30.1%) had a suspicious lymph node on ultrasound and had FNAC, of whom 53 tested positive for axillary node involvement (60.2%). Among the 35 patients who tested negative with FNAC, 15 had axillary metastatic involvement. Performance of AUS + FNAC was better than that of AUS alone, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of approximately 44.5%, 100%, 100% and 72.4%, respectively, and accuracy of approximately 77.4%. Luminal A subgroup, axillary involvement of less than two positive nodes or nodal tumor of less than 7 mm are independent factors of false negative rate. Conclusions AUS performance would seem to be improved by FNAC, with a false negative rate of approximately 26%. It may be possible to reduce the false negative rate of AUS if its contributing factors are taken into consideration, along with the impact of specific echographic signs as revealed by experienced radiologists.

TI  - Relationship between Sentinel-2 orbital data and in situ monitoring of coffee rust
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley & Broome) is the main coffee disease in Brazil. Coffee rust control is calendar-based and performed by applying chemicals in order to avoid the outburst of disease epidemics. The aim of this work was to identify coffee rust using multispectral orbital sensing through analyses utilising vegetation indices and coffee rust incidence, defoliation and yield data obtained in situ. Field samples were georeferenced using a high-accuracy global navigation satellite system receiver in two plots, in a 42-year-old, leaf rust susceptible coffee cultivar. Conventional chemical control of rust was performed in only one of the plots to serve as control. Coffee rust incidence in areas with and without chemical control was assessed over 5 months, from December 2018 to April 2019, a period with optimal environmental conditions for disease occurrence. Following analyses of different vegetation indices and data sampled in the coffee crop, Pearson's correlations between the variables were verified. Reported correlations occurred mainly among coffee rust incidence levels in February 2019 and vegetation indices calculated using Sentinel-2 images from August 2018, September 2018 and February 2019 [IRECI r=0.566; IRECI r=0.493; NDMI r=-0.518; NDVI(RE1) r=-0.562; CI(RE1) r=-0.573; MSR(RE1) r=-0.569], in areas without coffee rust control. Indices based on relationships between bands in the Red-Edge and Near Infra-Red regions were more sensitive to spectral changes in vegetation due to variation in coffee rust occurrence over time.

TI  - Acellular dermal matrix combined with oxidized regenerated cellulose for partial breast reconstruction Two case reports
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Filling materials for partial defect of the breast have rarely been developed because of safety and durability. Patient concerns: Two female patients (ages, 53 and 50 years) with breast cancer underwent partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Diagnosis: Core needle biopsy revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma in both patients. Breast ultrasound showed hypoechoic nodules with irregular margins. Breast magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregularly shaped enhancing mass with duct extension in Patient 1 and irregularly shaped multifocal, enhancing masses with non-mass enhancement in Patient 2. Intervention: A combination method using acellular dermal matrix and oxidized regenerated cellulose was used for partial breast reconstruction. The safety and cosmetic outcomes were evaluated for both patients. Outcomes: There were no significant complications, and the breast shape and volume were well maintained, even 2 years after surgery. There was no postoperative tumor recurrence. Conclusion: The combination of acellular dermal matrix and oxidized regenerated cellulose for partial breast reconstruction can be a good option based on oncological safety and cosmetic outcome.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on Wintering Ground of Japanese Anchovy (<i>Engraulis japonicus</i>) Using Marine Geospatial Statistics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and fluctuations in abundance of small pelagic species such as anchovy are largely affected by climate change. We hypothesized that the future projected rise in temperature will result to a northward shift of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) habitat and a subsequent increase in relative abundance. To test this hypothesis, we explored the link between Japanese anchovy abundance and environmental conditions using machine-learning and statistical models. The models were fitted with catch per unit effort (CPUE) as the response variable and remotely sensed data of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), assimilated information of sea surface salinity (SSS), meridional and zonal ocean currents, and depth as environmental covariates. Our results showed that the abundance of E. japonicus was significantly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, salinity front and SST highlight strong relationships with winter CPUE distribution. Based on these models, the results reinforced our hypothesis and showed that the warming ocean will drive a substantial shift in Japanese anchovy habitat in the China seas. SST and CPUE showed negative correlations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. These findings underpin ramifications of the climate-driven habitat shift of small pelagic fish species on the regional marine ecosystem in the China seas.

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning models for rice dry biomass estimation and mapping using quad-source optical imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several machine learning regression models have been advanced for the estimation of crop biophysical parameters with optical satellite imagery. However, literature on the comparative performances of such models is still limited in range and scope, especially under multiple data sources, despite the potential of multi-source imagery to improving crop monitoring in cloudy areas. To fill in this knowledge gap, this study explored the synergistic use of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, China's environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting satellites (HJ-1 A and B) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data to evaluate four machine learning regression models that include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), for rice dry biomass estimation and mapping. Taking a major rice cultivation area in southeast China as case study during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons, a cross-calibrated time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was obtained from the quad-source optical imagery and on which the aforementioned models were applied, respectively. Results indicate that in the before rice heading scenario, the most accurate dry biomass estimates were obtained by the GBDT model (R(2)of 0.82 and RMSE of 191.8 g/m(2)) followed by the RF model (R(2)of 0.79 and RMSE of 197.8 g/m(2)). After heading, the k-NN model performed best (R(2)of 0.43 and RMSE of 452.1 g/m(2)) followed by the RF model (R(2)of 0.42 and RMSE of 464.7 g/m(2)). Whist the k-NN model performed least in the before heading scenario, SVM performed least in the after heading scenario. These findings may suggest that machine learning regression models based on an ensemble of decision trees (RF and GBDT) are more suitable for the estimation of rice dry biomass, at least with optical satellite imagery. Studies that would extend the evaluation of these machine learning models, to other parameters like leaf area index, and to microwave imagery, are hereby recommended.

TI  - Movements of Juvenile Green Turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) in the Nearshore Waters of the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite telemetry is a valuable tool for examining long-term, large scale movements of highly migratory species. Tracking data can be used by resource managers to protect habitat and ensure recovery of threatened and endangered species. Few tracking studies have focused on habitat use patterns of juvenile, neritic stage turtles. Satellite tracking surveys were conducted to assess juvenile green turtle movements in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico during 2006-2010. Fifteen turtles were equipped with platform terminal transmitters (PTT; 3 rehabilitated, 12 wild). Mean track duration was 129 days (range: 16-344 days). A hierarchical switching state-space model (hSSM) was applied to extrapolate population level foraging/resident versus migratory movements. All turtles displayed residency in Texas bays during summer months (March-November) while five individuals exhibited seasonal migrations into Mexican waters following passage of strong cold fronts in December and January. Winter (e.g., Mexico) versus summer (e.g., Texas) core areas were not significantly different. Winter 95% contours were significantly larger than summer (summer: 125.4 +/- 47.5 km(2), n = 15; winter: 274.4 +/- 252.9 km(2), n = 5). Space-time hot spot analysis provided a new and unique approach for conducting spatiotemporal cluster analysis, and was applied to migratory turtles to determine monthly changes in distribution and habitat associations. Changes in hot spots over time were detected within the lower regions of the Laguna Madre with punctuated intervals of hot spot activity. Upper regions of the Laguna Madre were identified as new hot spots in the later part of the year (e.g., Fall/Winter). Within core areas in Texas, seagrasses comprised an average density of 32.4% while 87.5% of the total available seagrass habitat occurred within the 95% KDE contour. Based on PTT and historic tide station surface water temperatures, all turtles tracked over winter migrations and residencies (n = 5) remained within waters > 15 degrees C, suggesting a threshold temperature at which migration behavior may be initiated. Continued recovery of threatened and endangered sea turtle populations depends on a comprehensive examination of patterns in habitat use. These data suggest cooperation between the United States and Mexico is needed to protect critical habitat and enhance recovery of this species.

TI  - Rediscovering Tomkins' polarity theory: Humanism, normativism, and the psychological basis of left-right ideological conflict in the US and Sweden
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to Silvan Tomkins' polarity theory, ideological thought is universally structured by a clash between two opposing worldviews. On the left, a humanistic worldview seeks to uphold the intrinsic value of the person; on the right, a normative worldview holds that human worth is contingent upon conformity to rules. In this article, we situate humanism and normativism within the context of contemporary models of political ideology as a function of motivated social cognition, beliefs about the social world, and personality traits. In four studies conducted in the U.S. and Sweden, normativism was robustly associated with rightist (or conservative) self-placement; conservative issue preferences; resistance to change and acceptance of inequality; right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; system justification and its underlying epistemic and existential motives to reduce uncertainty and threat; and a lack of openness, emotionality, and honesty-humility. Humanism exhibited the opposite relations to most of these constructs, but it was largely unrelated to epistemic and existential needs. Humanism was strongly associated with preferences for equality, openness to change, and low levels of authoritarianism, social dominance, and general and economic system justification. We conclude that polarity theory possesses considerable potential to explain how conflicts between worldviews shape contemporary politics.

TI  - Multi-scale remote sensing to support insurance policies in agriculture: from mid-term to instantaneous deductions
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is today one of the biggest issues for farmers. The increasing number of natural disasters and change of seasonal trends is making insurance companies more interested in new technologies that can somehow support them in quantifying and mapping risks. Remotely sensed data, with special focus on free ones, can certainly provide the most of information they need, making possible to better calibrate insurance fees in space and time. In this work, a prototype of service based on free remotely sensed data is proposed with the aim of supporting insurance companies' strategies. The service is thought to calibrate annual insurance rates, longing for their reduction at such level that new customers could be attracted. The study moves from the entire Piemonte region (NW Italy), to specifically focus onto the Cuneo province (Southern Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. MODIS MOD13Q1-v6 and Sentinel-2 L2A image time series were jointly used. NDVI maps from MODIS data were useful to describe the midterm phenological trends of main crops at regional level in the period 2000-2018; differently, Sentinel-2 data permitted to map local crop differences at field level in 2016 and 2017 years. With reference to MODIS data, the average phenological behavior of main crop classes in the area, obtained from the CORINE Land Cover map Level 3, was considered using a time series decomposition approach. Trend analyses showed that the most of the crop classes alternated three phases (about 7 years) suggesting that, presently, this is probably the time horizon to be considered to tune mid-term algorithms for risk estimates in the agricultural context. Crop classes trends were consequently split into three phases and each of them modeled by a first-order polynomial function used to update correspondent insurance risk rate. Sentinel-2 data were used to map phenological anomalies at field level for the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons; shifts from class average behavior were considered to locally and temporarily tune insurance premium around its average trend as described at the previous step. Synthesizing, one can say that this approach, integrating MODIS and Sentnel-2 data, makes possible to locally and temporarily calibrate premiums of indexed insurance policies by describing the average trends of crop performance (NDVI) at regional level by MODIS data and refining it at field and specific crop level by Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Efficient multi-scale Gaussian process regression for massive remote sensing data with satGP v0.1.2
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides a global view to processes on Earth that has unique benefits compared to making measurements on the ground, such as global coverage and enormous data volume. The typical downsides are spatial and temporal gaps and potentially low data quality. Meaning-ful statistical inference from such data requires overcoming these problems and developing efficient and robust computational tools. We design and implement a computationally efficient multi-scale Gaussian process (GP) software pack-age, satGP, geared towards remote sensing applications. The software is able to handle problems of enormous sizes and to compute marginals and sample from the random field conditioning on at least hundreds of millions of observations. This is achieved by optimizing the computation by, e.g., randomization and splitting the problem into parallel local subproblems which aggressively discard uninformative data.We describe the mean function of the Gaussian process by approximating marginals of a Markov random field (MRF). Variability around the mean is modeled with a multi-scale covariance kernel, which consists of Matern, exponential, and periodic components. We also demonstrate how winds can be used to inform covariances locally. The covariance kernel parameters are learned by calculating an approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimate, and the validity of both the multi-scale approach and the method used to learn the kernel parameters is verified in synthetic experiments.We apply these techniques to a moderate size ozone data set produced by an atmospheric chemistry model and to the very large number of observations retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. The satGP software is released under an open-source license.

TI  - Effect of land use and land cover changes on water quality in the Nawuni Catchment of the White Volta Basin, Northern Region, Ghana
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution of freshwater resources is gaining global attention due to increasing freshwater stress and scarcity. This study assessed land use and land cover changes (LULCC) in the Nawuni Catchment of the White Volta Basin and how the change affects water quality in the area. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational land imager of the Nawuni Catchment of the White Volta Basin were acquired and used for this study. These images were analysed to ascertain the influence of land use and land cover changes on water quality parameters such as turbidity, ammonia and total coliform counts for a 10-year period (2007 to 2017). The results of LULCC revealed an increased expanse of grassland/farmland (4.1%), settlement (0.1%), bare land (9.4%) and closed savannah (1.2%), whilst opened savannah (14.7%) and water body (0.1%) recorded a decreasing trend. The study showed an increase in the levels of turbidity and ammonia and a decrease in total coliforms over the study period (2007 to 2017). The study also revealed a positive relationship between LULC categories and water quality parameters, implying that LULCC contribute to the change in water quality in the area. The study therefore recommends frequent water quality monitoring and LULC planning and management to curb pollution of the river basin.

TI  - Semi-field evaluation of freestanding transfluthrin passive emanators and the BG sentinel trap as a "push-pull control strategy" against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSpatial repellents that drive mosquitoes away from treated areas, and odour-baited traps, that attract and kill mosquitoes, can be combined and work synergistically in a push-pull system. Push-pull systems have been shown to reduce house entry and outdoor biting rates of malaria vectors and so have the potential to control other outdoor biting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti that transmit arboviral diseases. In this study, semi-field experiments were conducted to evaluate whether a push-pull system could be used to reduce bites from Aedes mosquitoes.MethodsThe push and pull under investigation consisted of two freestanding transfluthrin passive emanators (FTPE) and a BG sentinel trap (BGS) respectively. The FTPE contained hessian strips treated with 5.25 g of transfluthrin active ingredient. The efficacies of FTPE and BGS alone and in combination were evaluated by human landing catch in a large semi-field system in Tanzania. We also investigated the protection of FTPE over six months. The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with binomial distribution.ResultsTwo FTPE had a protective efficacy (PE) of 61.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 52.2-69.9%) against the human landing of Ae. aegypti. The BGS did not significantly reduce mosquito landings; the PE was 2.1% (95% CI: -2.9-7.2%). The push-pull provided a PE of 64.5% (95% CI: 59.1-69.9%). However, there was no significant difference in the PE between the push-pull and the two FTPE against Ae. aegypti (P=0.30). The FTPE offered significant protection against Ae. aegypti at month three, with a PE of 46.4% (95% CI: 41.1-51.8%), but not at six months with a PE of 2.2% (95% CI: -9.0-14.0%).ConclusionsThe PE of the FTPE and the full push-pull are similar, indicative that bite prevention is primarily due to the activity of the FTPE. While these results are encouraging for the FTPE, further work is needed for a push-pull system to be recommended for Ae. aegypti control. The three-month protection against Ae. aegypti bites suggests that FTPE would be a useful additional control tool during dengue outbreaks, that does not require regular user compliance.

TI  - Examining the impact of polycentric urban form on air pollution: evidence from China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies on megacities have reported less air pollution in polycentric form urban than monocentric form urban. However, findings from these studies do not imply that increasing air pollution in region or country is accompanied by the expanding megacities. Using satellite night-light data, this study investigates the impact of polycentric urban form at the provincial level on PM(2.5)concentrations in China while controlling for variables of urban population size, energy consumption, and the weather. The results reveal that the PM(2.5)concentrations are reduced by 1.46% to 2.67%, with a 1% increase in polycentric urban form. The similar impact has also been observed in the South China, but larger in the Central China. Further studies show that the urban form-air pollution relationship mainly influenced by transportation distance and enhanced by rising per capita income. The findings suggest that regional planning and policies favoring polycentric urban patterns should be strengthened to alleviate air pollution.

TI  - A robust spectral angle index for remotely assessing soybean canopy chlorophyll content in different growing stages
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Timely and accurate estimates of canopy chlorophyll (Chl) a and b content are crucial for crop growth monitoring and agricultural management. Crop canopy reflectance depends on many factors, which can be divided into the following categories: (i) leaf effects (e.g., leaf pigments), (ii) canopy effects (e.g., Leaf Area Index [LAI]), and (iii) soil background reflectance (e.g., soil reflectance). The estimation of leaf variables, such as Chl contents, from reflectance at the canopy scale is usually less accurate than that at the leaf scale. In this study, we propose a Visible and Near-infrared (NIR) Angle Index (VNAI) to estimate the Chl content of soybean canopy, and soybean canopy Chl maps are produced using visible and NIR unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. The VNAI is insensitive to LAI and can be used for the multi-stage estimation of crop canopy Chl content. Results Eleven previously used vegetation indices (VIs) (e.g., Pigment-specific Normalized Difference Index) were selected for performance comparison. The results showed that (i) most previously used Chl VIs were significantly correlated with LAI, and the proposed VNAI was more sensitive to Chl content than LAI; (ii) the VNAI-based estimates of Chl content were more accurate than those based on the other investigated VIs using (1) simulated, (2) real (field), and (3) real (UAV) datasets. Conclusions Most previously used Chl VIs were significantly correlated with LAI whereas the proposed VNAI was more sensitive to Chl content than to LAI, indicating that the VNAI may be more strongly correlated with Chl content than these previously used VIs. Multi-stage estimations of the Chl content of cropland obtained using the VNAI and broadband remote sensing images may help to obtain Chl maps with high temporal and spatial resolution.

TI  - Genomic evidence of recent hybridization between sea turtles at Abrolhos Archipelago and its association to low reproductive output
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybridization between sea turtle species occurs with particularly high frequency at two adjacent nesting areas in northeastern Brazil. To understand the outcomes of hybridization and their consequences for sea turtle conservation, we need to evaluate the extent of hybridization occurrence and possible deleterious effects in the hybrid progeny. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis of the existence of a new hybrid spot offshore of Brazil's northeastern coast. The Abrolhos Archipelago is surrounded by the largest and richest coral reefs in the South Atlantic and is known to be a nesting site for loggerhead turtles (Carettacaretta). In this study, we performed a multidisciplinary investigation into levels of hybridization in sea turtles and their reproductive output in the Abrolhos beaches. Genetic data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and six autosomal markers showed that there are first-generation hybrid females nesting in Abrolhos, resulting from crossings between hawksbill males (Eretmochelysimbricata) and loggerhead females, and backcrossed hatchlings from both parental species. The type and extent of hybridization were characterized using genomic data obtained with the 3RAD method, which confirmed backcrossing between F1 hybrids and loggerhead turtles. The reproductive output data of Abrolhos nests suggests a disadvantage of hybrids when compared to loggerheads. For the first time, we have shown the association between hybridization and low reproductive success, which may represent a threat to sea turtle conservation.

TI  - Gaps in Online Breast Cancer Treatment Information for Older Women
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background For women older than 70 years with early-stage breast cancer, the routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and adjuvant radiotherapy offers no overall survival benefit and may be perceived as undesirable by many women. National guidelines allow possible omission of these practices for older women. This study aimed to assess the availability of web-based educational materials targeting older women and their age-specific treatment recommendations. Methods The study systematically assessed the websites of the top 25 "Best Hospitals for Cancer" ranked by theU.S. News & World Report,as well as the websites of four prominent national cancer organizations. Results Websites for the leading cancer hospitals and national cancer organizations contain extremely limited information directed toward older patients with breast cancer. Both SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy are described as treatments "typically," "most often," or "usually" used in combination with breast-conserving surgery without circumstances noted for possible omission. Specifically, no hospital website and only one national organization in this study included information on the recommendation to avoid routine SLNB. Only two hospitals and two national organizations included information suggesting possible omission of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients older than 70 years. Conclusion The absence of online material for older patients with breast cancer represents a gap potentially contributing to overtreatment by framing SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy as necessary. Informational resources available to women aged 70 years or older may aid in informed physician-patient communication and decision-making, which may reduce SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy for patients who might opt out of these procedures if fully informed about them.

AB  - A ground-based, high-spectral-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer has been operational in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (9.01 degrees N latitude, 38.76 degrees E longitude; 2443m altitude above sea level), since May 2009 to obtain information on column abundances and profiles of various constituents in the atmosphere. Vertical profile and column abundances of methane and nitrous oxide are derived from solar absorption measurements taken by FTIR for a period that covers May 2009 to March 2013 using the retrieval code PROFFIT (V9.5). A detailed error analysis of CH4 and N2O retrieval are performed. Averaging kernels of the target gases shows that the major contribution to the retrieved information comes from the measurement. Thus, average degrees of freedom for signals are found to be 2.1 and 3.4, from the retrieval of CH4 and N2O for the total observed FTIR spectra. Methane and nitrous oxide volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles and column amounts retrieved from FTIR spectra are compared with data from the reduced spectral resolution Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research/Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IMK/IAA) MIPAS (Version V5R_CH4_224 and V5R_N2O_224), the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) (MLS v3.3 of N2O and CH4 derived from MLS v3.3 products of CO, N2O, and H2O), and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) sensors on board satellites. The averaged mean relative difference between FTIR methane and the three correlative instruments MIPAS, MLS, and AIRS are 4.2 %, 5.8 %, and 5.3% in the altitude ranges of 20 to 27 km, respectively. However, the biases below 20 km are negative, which indicates the profile of CH4 from FTIR is less than the profiles derived from correlative instruments by -4.9%, -1.8%, and -2.8%. The averaged positive bias between FTIR nitrous oxide and correlative instrument, MIPAS, in the altitude range of 20 to 27 km is 7.8 %, and a negative bias of -4% at altitudes below 20 km. An averaged positive bias of 9.3% in the altitude range of 17 to 27 km is obtained for FTIR N2O with MLS. In all the comparisons of CH4 from FTIR with data from MIPAS, MLS, and AIRS, sensors on board satellites indicate a negative bias below 20 km and a positive bias above 20 km. The mean error between partial-column amounts of methane from MIPAS and the ground-based FTIR is -5.5%, with a standard deviation of 5% that shows very good agreement as exhibited by relative differences between vertical profiles. Thus, the retrieved CH4 and N2O VMR and column amounts from Addis Ababa, tropical site, is found to exhibit very good agreement with all coincident satellite observations. Therefore, the bias obtained from the comparison is comparable to the precision of FTIR measurement, which allows the use of data in further scientific studies as it represents a unique environment of tropical Africa, a region poorly investigated in the past.

TI  - Assessment of dual-polarized interference due to precipitation for high-capacity satellite communication systems in Nigeria
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-capacity satellite systems are specially designed to provide several gigahertz-allotted spectra for multiple spot beams. The reliability of the communication links at high frequencies is often subjected to rain attenuation. In addition to rain attenuation, rain-induced cross-polarization is an important factor for dual-polarization microwave radio communication systems operating at such frequencies. Dual-polarized communication systems adopting frequency reuse usually encounter interference due to a change of transmission energy from one polarization state to another. Signal degradation as a result of some degree of noise causes reduction in the quality of signal between the two orthogonal channels-cross-polarization discrimination (XPD). Therefore, this study assesses the level of degradation due to interference on dual-polarized communication systems for millimeter wave's band over some selected locations in Nigeria using 5 years (2008-2012) data collected at tropical data acquisition network of the Centre for Atmospheric Research Anyigba. Assessment of dual-polarized interference is based on cumulative distribution of XPD at different frequencies, effect of Earth station receiver frequencies on XPD, XPD-CPA (Co-polar attenuation) relationship and XPD-rain rate relations. Influence of polarization tilt angle for linear and circular polarization on XPD was also assessed. The specific result shows that XPD is extremely low at high rain rates for frequency up to 20 GHz. Depolarization effect is better at the lowest availability with higher value of XPD, and its performance contributes to system availability at the low exceedance probabilities. Port Harcourt, Nsukka, Yola and Sokoto experiences increased interference at receiver stations than other locations considered in this study, especially at Q/V band frequencies. Additional fade margin and appropriate mitigation methods for link availability and good quality of service will be required for sustainability.

TI  - Dynamics of Vegetation Change and Its Relationship with Nature and Human Activities - A Case Study of Poyang Lake Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage directly affects the quality of a regional ecological environment. Current analyzes of the factors driving vegetation coverage do not focus on human activities. Poyang Lake is an internationally important wetland. This study is based on 814 MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 2000 to 2017 in the Poyang Lake Basin. Natural effects (temperature, precipitation, terrain niche index) and human activity intensity are employed to analyze the driving forces of NDVI changes. The results demonstrate the following: NDVI in the Poyang Lake Basin fluctuated and increased over the 18 years examined. Spatially, NDVI significantly decreased around the central city, and NDVI significantly increased on both sides of the river. NDVI changes are less affected by topographic factors and are more affected by climatic factors and human activities. Among the climatic factors, the correlation between NDVI and temperature was greater than that between NDVI and precipitation. Climatic factors had a greater impact on NDVI than human activities throughout the study area. However, in areas with significant NDVI changes, the correlation between climatic factors and NDVI was not obvious, and the correlation between human activities and NDVI was more obvious than in other areas. Therefore, from 2000 to 2017, the vegetation coverage of the Poyang Lake Basin generally showed an increasing trend; climatic factors had a greater impact on the overall vegetation coverage of the basin than human activities, but significant changes in vegetation coverage were caused by human activities.

TI  - Changing the Default: A Prospective Study of Reducing Discharge Opioid Prescription after Lumpectomy and Sentinel Node Biopsy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Whether routinely prescribed opioids are necessary for pain control after discharge among lumpectomy/sentinel node biopsy (Lump/SLNB) patients is unclear. We hypothesize that Lump/SLNB patients could be discharged without opioids, with a failure rate < 10%. This study prospectively examines outcomes after changing standard discharge prescription from an opioid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to NSAID/acetaminophen.Patients and Methods. Standard discharge pain medication orders included opioids in the first 3-month study period and were changed to NSAID/acetaminophen in the second 3-month period. Patient-reported medication consumption and pain scores were collected by post-discharge survey. Frequency of discharge with opioid, NSAID/acetaminophen failure rate, opioid use, and pain scores were examined.Results. From May to October 2019, 663 patients had Lump/SLNB: 371 in the opioid study period and 292 in the NSAID period. In the opioid period, 92% (342/371) of patients were prescribed an opioid at discharge; of 142 patients who documented opioid use on the survey, 86 (61%) used zero tablets. Among 56 (39%) patients who used opioids, the median number taken by POD 5 was 4. After the change to NSAID/acetaminophen, rates of opioid prescription decreased to 14% (41/292). The NSAID/acetaminophen failure rate was 2% (5/251). Among survey respondents, there was no significant difference in the maximum reported pain scores (POD 1-5) between the opioid period and the NSAID period (p = 0.7).Conclusions. In Lump/SLNB patients, a change to default discharge with NSAID/acetaminophen resulted in a 78% absolute reduction in opioid prescription, with a failure rate of 2% and no difference in patient-reported pain scores. Most Lump/SLNB patients can be discharged with NSAID/acetaminophen.

TI  - Mapping and assessing the impact of small-scale ephemeral water sources on wildlife in an African seasonal savannah
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In many savannah regions of Africa, pronounced seasonal variability in rainfall results in wildlife being restricted to floodplains and other habitats adjacent to permanent surface water in the dry season. During the wet season, rainfall fills small-scale, ephemeral water sources that allow wildlife to exploit forage and other resources far from permanent surface water. These water sources remain difficult to quantify, however, due to their small and ephemeral nature, and as a result are rarely included in quantitative studies of wildlife distribution, abundance, and movement. Our goal was to map ephemeral water in Bwabwata National Park in Namibia using two different approaches and to relate measures of ephemeral water to the abundance, distribution, and movement of two large wildlife species. We used high-resolution Google Earth and Esri World imagery to visually identify waterholes. Additionally, we used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to map ephemeral water across the study area using the Normalized Difference Water Index. With these mapped waterhole layers and data from GPS-collared individuals of African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), we evaluated the importance of ephemeral water in conditioning abundance and movement of these two species. The two approaches to mapping ephemeral water resulted in the visual identification of nearly 10,000 waterholes, and a predicted ephemeral water layer of similar to 76% accuracy. The inclusion of ephemeral water into models of abundance and movement resulted in improved goodness of fit relative to those without water, and water impacts on abundance and movement were among the strongest of all variables considered. The potential importance of ephemeral water in conditioning the movements and distributions of large herbivores in African savannahs has been difficult to quantify relative to vegetation drivers. Our results suggest research into ephemeral water impacts deserves more attention.

TI  - Identifying artificially drained pasture soils using machine learning and Earth observation imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many areas of the globe, the installation of artificial drains on naturally poorly drained soils is a necessary part of farm management. Identifying the location of artificially drained areas is an important step in achieving environmentally sustainable agricultural production. However, in many regions, data on the presence or the distribution of artificial drainage systems are rare. We outline an approach to identify artificially drained soils using Earth observation (EO) satellite imagery and digital elevation data. The method exploits the contrasting phenology of grass during a peak growth stage to identify artificially drained and undrained soils. Two machine-learning techniques, support vector machine and random forest, were tested. Classification accuracy up to 91% was achieved using photointerpreted accuracy points using higher resolution satellite imagery. Additional investigations would be required to establish whether the drained conditions identified were a result of artificial drainage or from naturally well-drained soils occurring within larger soil units. Herein, the Republic of Ireland is used as a test case. Based on our findings, the area of artificially drained grassland within the study area could be revised upward, with 44% (or similar to 345, 000 ha) of pasture currently classed as "poorly drained" identified as "artificially drained." At one location, a change in the modeled drainage condition at field level was demonstrated following drain installation. The presented method demonstrates the ability of EO satellites to quickly and accurately map field drainage status at farm management scales over a wide area. This has the potential to improve management decisions at local scales, but also has implications in terms of national policy development and regulation in areas such as water quality and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Revisiting the Concentration Observations and Source Apportionment of Atmospheric Ammonia
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - While China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan on particulate matter since 2013 has reduced sulfate significantly, aerosol ammonium nitrate remains high in East China. As the high nitrate abundances are strongly linked with ammonia, reducing ammonia emissions is becoming increasingly important to improve the air quality of China. Although satellite data provide evidence of substantial increases in atmospheric ammonia concentrations over major agricultural regions, long-term surface observation of ammonia concentrations are sparse. In addition, there is still no consensus on whether agricultural or non-agricultural emissions dominate the urban ammonia budget. Identifying the ammonia source by nitrogen isotope helps in designing a mitigation strategy for policymakers, but existing methods have not been well validated. Revisiting the concentration measurements and identifying source apportionment of atmospheric ammonia is thus an essential step towards reducing ammonia emissions.

TI  - Patterns of failure after adjuvant "sandwich" chemo-radio-chemotherapy in locally advanced (stage III-IVA) endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate oncological outcomes and patterns of recurrence of patients undergoing adjuvant "sandwich" chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer. Methods This is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating chart of consecutive patients undergoing chemo-radio-chemotherapy for FIGO stage III-IVA endometrial caner. Results The study population included 45 patients who had adjuvant sandwich regimen. Median age of the study population was 66 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed with endometrioid histology and with stage III disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 15 patients developed recurrent disease. Three-year disease-free and overall survivals was 45% and 81%, respectively. Three-years site-specific disease-free survival was 85%, 92% and 48% for local, loco-regional, and distant recurrence, respectively. All patients included in the study had nodal dissection. Nodal assessment included: sentinel node mapping, sentinel node mapping plus backup lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy in 15, 6 and 24 patients, respectively. The latter group included four patients detected by suspected enlarged nodes, intraoperatively. Even after the exclusion of patients with enlarged nodes, the type of nodal assessment did not impact on survival outcomes (p > 0.2). Positive peritoneal cytology was the only factor associated with an increased risk of developing (any site) recurrence and distant-specific recurrence, independently. No factor predicted for overall survival. Conclusion Adjuvant "sandwich" chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer guarantee promising local and loco-regional controls, but distant failure rate is high, thus suggesting the need for applying other systemic treatment strategies for these patients.

TI  - A simple model for PIFs extraction at digital change detection approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric normalization using pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) is one of the best methods of image-based atmospheric correction. However, one of the main challenges of this approach is the correct selection of PIFs. So far many efforts have been made to automate radiometric correction using PIFs, although the capability of all these automated methods has been proven in various studies, their application requires intermediate to advanced statistical and computational knowledge and their application is beyond the reach of most conventional remote sensing users. Therefore, in this research, a straightforward simple method is proposed based on the definition of PIFs that automatically identifies these areas and uses them on a regression procedure for automatic normalization. The study area is Hara Protection Area (the Hara international wetland), which has sub-tropical climate and due to surface homogeneity of its mangrove forests can be used as a pilot for natural, and homogeneous ecosystems such as forested areas. To create an automatic PIFs extraction in this area, initially, we masked areas that should not be in the PIFs by applying some thresholds. At this stage, water, vegetation and mountainous areas were filtered. Then, the radiometric resolution of the two different sensor images was identical, and using the differential histogram shape of the two images, unvaried areas were extracted. To validate the accuracy of the proposed method, absolute radiometric correction using atmospheric and topographic correction (ATCOR), fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes (FLAASH) and atmospheric correction (ATMOSC) methods, and relative radiometric correction using both empirical line calibration method and dark object subtraction method and automatic radiometric correction using QUick atmospheric correction (QUAC) and autonomous atmospheric correction (IMAGINE AAIC) were applied on the data. The output of all atmospheric correction methods and the proposed method was applied in the image algebra change detection in the form of a difference and with a threshold of twice the standard deviation from the mean to be checked by 219 points. The results of validation and qualitative studies of the histogram comparisons proved the proper functioning of the proposed method (kappa greater than 0.8), and using cross tables, the performance of the proposed method is similar to that of the empirical line calibration method (more than 76%). Finally, a few unique features in the current research proposal, including simplicity, automation, negligible systematic error, the possibility of using in a biomarker degradation warning system, the independence on the type of sensor used, distinguish it from other radiometric correction methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study of diversity climates is as complicated as the study of diversity itself. Despite the call for more sophisticated and multi-dimensional approaches to the study of diversity climates, few empirical efforts have been designed to do so, as the literature remains replete with work bifurcating and labeling diversity climates as positive or negative, productive or unproductive. Results from this study provide empirical support that worldview climate is indeed multi-dimensional, comprised of three distinctive, yet overlapping dimensions: productive, unproductive, and provocative. Implications for both scholars and practitioners, as well as directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Melanoma in pregnancy: certainties unborn
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma diagnosed during childbearing period or up to 1 year after delivery is defined as pregnancy-associated melanoma (PAM). There is some evidence that PAM has worse prognosis if compared with melanoma in nonpregnant women, although literature is still inconclusive. Many biological mechanisms could explain this behavior, such as hormonal and immune status, increased lymphangiogenesis but also delay in diagnostic and therapeutic management. If PAM is suspected, a prompt excisional biopsy under local anesthesia can be performed regardless of the gestational period. Conversely, additional staging procedures (such as sentinel lymph node biopsy or imaging) and systemic therapy are still debatable during pregnancy. A multidisciplinary tailored approach should be preferred, together with exhaustive counseling of the mother.

TI  - The impact of refugee settlements on land use changes and vegetation degradation in West Nile Sub-region, Uganda
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Uganda continues to experience high-refugee population influx that is beyond the established settlement capacities. Little information is available on the present and future impacts of settling refugees and host-communities on landuse changes and vegetation degradation. This study used Sentinel-2 images (20m) of 2016-2019 and Dinamica Ego-software to determine the current and future spatial areal-extent of changes in 2022. Findings revealed a rarefied increase in areas under subsistence-farming, builtups and refugee-settlements while the losses were seen in savannah-grasslands, wetlands and woodlands. In 2021, the most significant increases in the land will be experienced in builtup-areas, settlements and commercial farming. The most degraded vegetation types were savannah-grassland, woodlands and tree-plantations. These were primarily attributed to unending activities of deforestation, bush-burning, high-refugee population, land-conflicts with host-communities and wetland reclamation. Thus, unless sustainable farming and energy-saving practices are promoted and adopted, the landscape is likely to remain not even with remnants of green-cover.

TI  - In the shadow of sociology: Bateson through the lens of Durkheim
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLASSICAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gregory Bateson developed his transdisciplinary thinking in the shadow of sociology, but his ideas are not generally viewed as part of the field of classical sociology. This article will explain this exclusion by arguing that Bateson's way of theorising - while attempting to make progress in the understanding of reality - returns to ideas that were already rejected within the field in which he first worked. Furthermore, as a reading of Bateson through the lens of Durkheim will show, Bateson's theories fail to provide a better understanding of social reality than those of his predecessors. This type of critical analysis demonstrates the weakness of some of Bateson's central claims and contributes to a more in-depth understanding and reassessment of his ideas from a sociological perspective. Pointing out that Bateson's critique of the modern worldview is based on a pre-critical and pre-modern philosophy of wholeness is not to invalidate Bateson's foundational intuition that our current mode of thinking challenges our chances of surviving as a species. However, in order to make a theoretically convincing argument concerning how our thinking challenges our survival, a more critical understanding of the relation between mind and society than the one Bateson offers is required.

TI  - Analysis of regional economic development based on land use and land cover change information derived from Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of economic activities is of great significance for understanding regional economic development level and policymaking. As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development, and economic growth leads to increased demand for land as well as changes in land utilization form. As an important means of earth observation, remote-sensing technology can obtain the information of land use and land cover change (LUCC) related to economic activities. This study proposes a method for analysing regional economic situations based on remote-sensing technology, from which LUCC information extraction, sensitivity factor selection, model construction and accuracy evaluation were implemented. This approach was validated with experiments in Zhoushan City, China. The results show that the economic statistical index is most sensitive to the construction land area, and the average correlation coefficient between the actual data and the predicted data is 0.949, and the average of mean relative error is 14.21%. Therefore, this paper suggests that LUCC could be utilised as an explanatory indicator for estimating economic development at the regional level, and the potential applications of remotely-sensed image in economic activity monitoring are worth pursuing.

TI  - Land use change analysis of Daishan Island using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze land use change on Daishan Island using a multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. Four Landsat optical remote sensing images were collected from 1987, 1996, 2007, and 2016, and eight land cover types were recognized and extracted using the collected time series imagery. In addition, a land use-type transfer matrix was used for temporal analysis of land use conditions. The experimental results reveal that the total area of Daishan Island increased slightly in the past 30 years, during which time the shipbuilding industry rapidly grew and the salt mining industry gradually shrank. The industry changed greatly but there was no large-scale land reclamation. Moreover, forested area increased, which was conducive to the sustainable development of Daishan Island.
