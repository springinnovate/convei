TI  - New Approach for Temporal Stability Evaluation of Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) are one of the most popular methods for in-flight vicarious radiometric calibration of Earth remote sensing satellites. The fundamental question of PICS temporal stability has not been adequately addressed. However, the main purpose of this work is to evaluate the temporal stability of a few PICS using a new approach. The analysis was performed over six PICS (Libya 1, Libya 4, Niger 1, Niger 2, Egypt 1 and Sudan 1). The concept of a Virtual Constellation was developed to provide greater temporal coverage and also to overcome the dependence limitation of any specific characteristic derived from one particular sensor. TOA reflectance data from four sensors consistently demonstrating stable calibration to within 5%-the Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Sentinel-2A MSI (Multispectral Instrument)-were merged into a seamless dataset. Instead of using the traditional method of trend analysis (Student's T test), a nonparametric Seasonal Mann-Kendall test was used for determining the PICS stability. The analysis results indicate that Libya 4 and Egypt 1 do not exhibit any monotonic trend in six reflective solar bands common to all of the studied sensors, indicating temporal stability. A decreasing monotonic trend was statistically detected in all bands, except SWIR 2, for Sudan 1 and the Green and Red bands for Niger 1. An increasing trend was detected in the Blue band for Niger 2 and the NIR band for Libya 1. These results do not suggest abandoning PICS as a viable calibration source. Rather, they indicate that PICS temporal stability cannot be assumed and should be regularly monitored as part of the sensor calibration process.

TI  - Ionospheric Peak Parameters Retrieved from FY-3C Radio Occultation: A Statistical Comparison with Measurements from COSMIC RO and Digisondes Over the Globe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, two ionospheric peak parameters (ICPs), NmF2 and hmF2, derived from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) ionospheric electron density profiles (EDPs) obtained by Feng-Yun 3C (FY-3C) mission are compared with those derived from the observations of the Constellation Observing System for the Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) mission and the measurements from 24 digisonde stations distributed around the world during the year from 2014 to 2017. The FY-3C derived ICPs and the COSMIC-derived ICPs are provided by the National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC) and the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC), respectively. The correlation and bias analyses are carried out in the comparison under the collocation criterion with the time interval of 1 h and the space interval of 3 degrees in latitude and 5 degrees in longitude. When comparing the ICPs derived from the two RO missions, the difference in the azimuth of occultation planes (DAOPs) between the matched pairs is limited to be within 20 degrees. The comparison results are analyzed for different solar activity periods, and solar elevation angle (SEA) is taken for the first time as a factor that represents the comprehensive impacts of latitude zones, seasons, and local time of the observations. The results are shown as follows: (1) Both the COSMIC RO-derived and the digisonde-observed ICPs are in good agreement with the FY-3C RO-derived ones. The correlation coefficient (CC) between the NmF2 and hmF2 derived by COSMIC RO and FY-3C RO is 0.965 and 0.916, respectively, while the correlation coefficient between the NmF2 and hmF2 derived by digisonde and FY-3C RO is 0.924 and 0.832, respectively. The quality of FY-3C RO-derived ICPs are reliable enough for further applications. (2) The CC of NmF2 is, in general, higher than that of hmF2 when comparing FY-3C RO with other observations, and the overall MAB and MRB of FY-3C RO-derived ICPs during the higher solar activity period are higher than the ones during the lower solar activity period. The difference between the two RO missions is much smaller than that one between FY-3C RO and digisonde. (3) For a certain solar activity period, the standard deviations of the absolute bias (SDAB) and the standard deviations of the relative bias (SDRB) of FY-3C RO-derived ICPs compared with digisonde-derived ones generally increases with the increase of SEA, while the SDAB and SDRB of FY-3C RO-derived ICPs both get the minimum values for the AOP interval near to 90 degrees.

TI  - Azimuth Sidelobes Suppression Using Multi-Azimuth Angle Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method is proposed for azimuth sidelobes suppression using multi-pass squinted (MPS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. For MPS SAR, the radar observes the scene with different squint angles and heights on each pass. The MPS SAR mode acquisition geometry is given first. Then, 2D signals are focused and the images are registered to the master image. Based on the new signal model, elevation processing and incoherent addition are introduced in detail, which are the main parts for azimuth sidelobes suppression. Moreover, parameter design criteria in incoherent addition are derived for the best performance. With the proposed parameter optimization step, the new method has a prominent azimuth sidelobes suppression effect with a slightly better azimuth resolution, as verified by experimental results on both simulated point targets and TerraSAR-X data.

TI  - Inland Waters Suspended Solids Concentration Retrieval Based on PSO-LSSVM for UAV-Borne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended solids concentration (SSC) is an important indicator of the degree of water pollution. However, when using an empirical or semi-empirical model adapted to some of the inland waters to estimate SSC on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral images, the accuracy is often not sufficient. Thus, in this study, we attempted to use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal parameters of the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model for the quantitative inversion of SSC. A reservoir and a polluted riverway were selected as the study areas. The spectral data of the 36-point and 29-point 400-900 nm wavelength range on the UAV-borne images were extracted. Compared with the semi-empirical model, the random forest (RF) algorithm and the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm combined with partial least squares (PLS), the accuracy of the PSO-LSSVM algorithm in predicting the SSC was significantly improved. The training samples had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.68 mg/L, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.66% at the reservoir. For the polluted riverway, PSO-LSSVM also performed well. Finally, the established SSC inversion model was applied to UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) images. The results confirmed that the distribution of the predicted SSC was consistent with the observed results in the field, which proves that PSO-LSSVM is a feasible approach for the SSC inversion of UAV-borne HRS images.

TI  - Analysis of reflectance spectra of tropical seagrass species and their value for mapping using multispectral satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of the distribution of individual seagrass species is essential for any attempts to manage seagrass ecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how the spectra of different seagrass species vary, in order to establish their unique absorption features and how these can be utilised for mapping by making use of remote-sensing images. This paper presents measurements of the reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm for nine tropical species of seagrass. Continuum removal and multispectral resampling procedures were applied to the spectra. Dendrogram analysis was carried out to identify species clustering as the basis for a mapping scheme. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) approaches were employed for the classification of seagrass species using WorldView-2 images and measured spectra as the input endmember. Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and an image segmentation approach using CTA (Object-Based Image Analysis - OBIA) were performed as a means of comparison. The results indicate that the absorption features and overall shape of the spectra for all seagrass species are relatively similar, and implied that the major differences are attributable to the absolute reflectance values. Consequently, SAM and SID produced results of low accuracy (<30%), whereas, CTA and OBIA delivered results exhibiting higher accuracy (60-92%). The use of a spectral-based classification algorithm was ineffective for the classification and mapping of seagrass species using multispectral images. The utilisation of absolute reflectance values was beneficial for the classification of seagrass species having similar spectral shape.

TI  - A new approach to predict normalized difference vegetation index using time-delay neural network in the arid and semi-arid grassland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been used to conduct important research on plant growth and vegetation productivity. In this paper, a new approach to predict NDVI based on precipitation in the grass-growing season for the arid and semi-arid grassland is proposed using time-delay neural network (TDNN). To intuitively know the ability of TDNN to learn the relationship between NDVI and precipitation and to predict NDVI, the performance of the TDNN model is compared with back propagation neural network (BPNN) trained with the same data. The results indicate that TDNN works well to predict precipitation. Moreover, the relationship between precipitation and NDVI can be predicted accurately by the proposed TDNN model. The results show the goodness-of-fit between the observed NDVI and predicted NDVI measured by the determination coefficient of R-2 being 0.999 from the TDNN model, with the mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to be 0.23%, 0.20, and 0.19, respectively. The analysis shows that the proposed method can result in an accurate NDVI prediction. Thus, the algorithm is applied to predict the NDVI during the grass-growing season for the validation of the approach. This validation results suggest the potential application of this approach for reduction of overgrazing pressure and vegetation restoration in the arid and semi-arid grassland.

TI  - Mapping Urban Areas Using a Combination of Remote Sensing and Geolocation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are essential to daily human life; however, the urbanization process also brings about problems, especially in China. Urban mapping at large scales relies heavily on remote sensing (RS) data, which cannot capture socioeconomic features well. Geolocation datasets contain patterns of human movement, which are closely related to the extent of urbanization. However, the integration of RS and geolocation data for urban mapping is performed mostly at the city level or finer scales due to the limitations of geolocation datasets. Tencent provides a large-scale location request density (LRD) dataset with a finer temporal resolution, and makes large-scale urban mapping possible. The objective of this study is to combine multi-source features from RS and geolocation datasets to extract information on urban areas at large scales, including night-time lights, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, population density, LRD, accessibility, and road networks. The random forest (RF) classifier is introduced to deal with these high-dimension features on a 0.01 degree grid. High spatial resolution land cover (LC) products and the normalized difference built-up index from Landsat are used to label all of the samples. The RF prediction results are evaluated using validation samples and compared with LC products for four typical cities. The results show that night-time lights and LRD features contributed the most to the urban prediction results. A total of 176,266 km(2) of urban areas in China were extracted using the RF classifier, with an overall accuracy of 90.79% and a kappa coefficient of 0.790. Compared with existing LC products, our results are more consistent with the manually interpreted urban boundaries in the four selected cities. Our results reveal the potential of Tencent LRD data for the extraction of large-scale urban areas, and the reliability of the RF classifier based on a combination of RS and geolocation data.

TI  - Large-Scale Crop Mapping Based on Machine Learning and Parallel Computation with Grids
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping provides important information in agricultural applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the inconsistent availability of remote sensing data caused by the irregular time series and limited coverage of the images, together with the low spatial resolution of the classification results. In this study, we proposed a new efficient method based on grids to address the inconsistent availability of the high-medium resolution images for large-scale crop classification. First, we proposed a method to block the remote sensing data into grids to solve the problem of temporal inconsistency. Then, a parallel computing technique was introduced to improve the calculation efficiency on the grid scale. Experiments were designed to evaluate the applicability of this method for different high-medium spatial resolution remote sensing images and different machine learning algorithms and to compare the results with the widely used nonparallel method. The computational experiments showed that the proposed method was successful at identifying large-scale crop distribution using common high-medium resolution remote sensing images (GF-1 WFV images and Sentinel-2) and common machine learning classifiers (the random forest algorithm and support vector machine). Finally, we mapped the croplands in Heilongjiang Province in 2015, 2016, 2017, which used a random forest classifier with the time series GF-1 WFV images spectral features, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Ultimately, the accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix. The results showed that the classification accuracy reached 88%, 82%, and 85% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In addition, with the help of parallel computing, the calculation speed was significantly improved by at least seven-fold. This indicates that using the grid framework to block the data for classification is feasible for crop mapping in large areas and has great application potential in the future.

TI  - A Dark Target Detection Method Based on the Adjacency Effect: A Case Study on Crack Detection
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dark target detection is important for engineering applications but the existing methods do not consider the imaging environment of dark targets, such as the adjacency effect. The adjacency effect will affect the quantitative applications of remote sensing, especially for high contrast images and images with ever-increasing resolution. Further, most studies have focused on how to eliminate the adjacency effect and there is almost no research about the application of the adjacency effect. However, the adjacency effect leads to some unique characteristics for the dark target surrounded by a bright background. This paper utilizes these characteristics to assist in the detection of the dark object, and the low-high threshold detection strategy and the adaptive threshold selection method under the assumption of Gaussian distribution are designed. Meanwhile, preliminary case experiments are carried out on the crack detection of concrete slope protection. Finally, the experiment results show that it is feasible to utilize the adjacency effect for dark target detection.

TI  - Monitoring the Variation of Vegetation Water Content with Machine Learning Methods: Point-Surface Fusion of MODIS Products and GNSS-IR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is recognized as an important parameter in vegetation growth studies, natural disasters such as forest fires, and drought prediction. Recently, the Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) has emerged as an important technique for monitoring vegetation information. The normalized microwave reflection index (NMRI) was developed to reflect the change of VWC based on this fact. However, NMRI uses local site-based data, and the sparse distribution hinders the application of NMRI. In this study, we obtained a 500 m spatially continuous NMRI product by integrating GNSS-IR site data with other VWC-related products using the point-surface fusion technique. The auxiliary data in the fusion process include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross primary productivity (GPP), and precipitation. Meanwhile, the fusion performance of three machine learning methods, i.e., the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and random forest (RF) are compared and analyzed. The machine learning methods achieve satisfactory results, with cross-validation R values of 0.71-0.83 and RMSEs of 0.025-0.037. The results show a clear improvement over the traditional multiple linear regression method, which achieves R (RMSE) values of only about 0.4 (0.045). It indicates that the machine learning methods can better learn the complex nonlinear relationship between NMRI and the input VWC-related index. Among the machine learning methods, the RF model obtained the best results. Long time-series NMRI images with a 500 m spatial resolution in the western part of the continental U.S. were then obtained. The results show that the spatial distribution of the NMRI product is consistent with a drought situation from 2012 to 2014 in the U.S., which verifies the feasibility of analyzing and predicting drought times and distribution ranges by using the 500 m fusion product.

TI  - Improved Bathymetric Mapping of Coastal and Lake Environments Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The bathymetry of nearshore coastal environments and lakes is constantly reworking because of the change in the patterns of energy dispersal and related sediment transport pathways. Therefore, updated and accurate bathymetric models are a crucial component in providing necessary information for scientific, managerial, and geographical studies. Recent advances in satellite technology revolutionized the acquisition of bathymetric profiles, offering new vistas in mapping. This contribution analyzed the suitability of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images for bathymetric mapping of coastal and lake environments. The bathymetric algorithm was developed using an empirical approach and a random forest (RF) model based on the available high-resolution LiDAR bathymetric data for Mobile Bay, Tampa Bay, and Lake Huron regions obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). Our results demonstrate that the satellite-derived bathymetry is efficient for retrieving depths up to 10 m for coastal regions and up to 30 m for the lake environment. While using the empirical approach, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varied between 1.99 m and 4.74 m for the three regions. The RF model, on the other hand, provided an improved bathymetric model with RMSE between 1.13 m and 1.95 m. The comparative assessment suggests that Sentinel-2 has a slight edge over Landsat-8 images while employing the empirical approach. On the other hand, the RF model shows that Landsat-8 retrieves a better bathymetric model than Sentinel-2. Our work demonstrated that the freely available Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imageries proved to be reliable data for acquiring updated bathymetric information for large areas in a short period.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Retrieval of Forest Aboveground Biomass from Combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from regional carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. However, passive optical remote sensing, which is the most widely used remote sensing data for retrieving vegetation parameters, is constrained by spectral saturation problems and cloud cover. On the other hand, LiDAR data, which have been extensively used to estimate forest structure attributes, cannot provide sufficient spectral information of vegetation canopies. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel synergistic approach to estimating biomass by integrating LiDAR data with Landsat 8 imagery through a deep learning-based workflow. First the relationships between biomass and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LiDAR metrics were separately investigated. Next, two groups of combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were designed and explored to identify their performances in biomass estimation. Finally, five prediction models, including K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, the deep learning model, i.e., Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE), and multiple stepwise linear regressions, were individually used to estimate biomass with input variables of different scenarios, i.e., (i) all the COLI1 (ACOLI1), (ii) all the COLI2 (ACOLI2), (iii) ACOLI1 and all the optical (AO) and LiDAR variables (AL), and (iv) ACOLI2, AO and AL. Results showed that univariate models with the combined optical and LiDAR indices as explanatory variables presented better modeling performance than those with either optical or LiDAR data alone, regardless of the combination mode. The SSAE model obtained the best performance compared to the other tested prediction algorithms for the forest biomass estimation. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by the SSAE model with inputs of combined optical and LiDAR variables (i.e., ACOLI1, AO and AL) that yielded an R-2 of 0.935, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.67 Mg/ha, and relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 11.407%. It was concluded that the presented combined indices were simple and effective by integrating LiDAR-derived structure information with Landsat 8 spectral data for estimating forest biomass. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of Landsat 8 and LiDAR integrated information resulted in accurate estimation of forest biomass. The presented modeling workflow will greatly facilitate future forest biomass estimation and carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Fusion of Remote Sensing and Internet Data to Calculate Urban Floor Area Ratio
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The floor area ratio is a comprehensive index that plays an important role in urban planning and sustainable development. Remote sensing data are widely used in floor area ratio calculations because they can produce both two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional stereo information on buildings. However, remote sensing is not adequate for calculating the number of floors in a building. In this paper, a simple and practical pixel-level model is established through defining a quantitative relationship among the floor area ratio, building density, and average number of floors (ANF). The floor area ratios are calculated by combining remote sensing data with publicly available Internet data. It incorporates supplemental map data and street-level views from Internet maps to confirm building types and the number of floors, thereby enabling more-accurate floor area ratio calculations. The proposed method is tested in the Tiantongyuan neighborhood, Changping District, Beijing, and the results show that it can accurately approximate the number of floors in buildings. Inaccuracies in the value of the floor area ratio were found to be primarily due to the uncertainties in building density calculations. After performing systematic error correction, the building density (BD) and floor area ratio were each calculated with the relative accuracy exceeding 90%. Moreover, the experiments verified that the fusion of internet map data with remote sensing data has innate advantages for floor area ratio calculations.

TI  - Evaluation of ESA Active, Passive and Combined Soil Moisture Products Using Upscaled Ground Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project combines multi-sensors at different microwave frequencies to derive three harmonized soil moisture products using active, passive and combined approaches. These long-term soil moisture products assist in understanding the global water and carbon cycles. However, extensive validations are a prerequisite before applying the retrieved soil moisture into climatic or hydrological models. To fulfill this objective, we assess the performances of three CCI soil moisture products (active, passive and combined) with respect to in-situ soil moisture networks located in China, Spain and Canada. In order to compensate the scale differences between ground stations and the CCI product's coarse resolution, we adopted two upscaling approaches of Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation and simple Arithmetic Mean (AM). The temporal agreements between the satellite retrieved and ground-measured soil moisture were quantified using the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), RMSE, correlation coefficients (R) and bias. Furthermore, the temporal variability of the CCI soil moisture is interpreted and verified with respect to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation observations. The results show that the temporal variations of CCI soil moisture agreed with the in-situ ground measurements and the precipitation observations over the China and Spain test sites. In contrast, a significant overestimation was observed over the Canada test sites, which may be due to the strong heterogeneity in soil and vegetation characteristics in accordance with the reported poor performance of soil moisture retrieval there. However, despite a retrieval bias, the relatively temporal variation of the CCI soil moisture also followed the ground measurements. For all the three test sites, the soil moisture retrieved from the combined approach outperformed the active-only and passive-only methods, with ubRMSE of 0.034, 0.050, and 0.050-0.054 m(3)/m(3) over the test sites in China, Spain and Canada, respectively. Thus, the CCI combined soil moisture product is suggested to drive the climatic and hydrological studies.

TI  - Multispectral and Radar Data for the Setting of Gold Mineralization in the South Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based multi-sensor data coupled with field and microscopic investigations are used to unravel the setting and controls of gold mineralization in the Wadi Beitan-Wadi Rahaba area in the South Eastern Desert of Egypt. The satellite-based multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data promoted a vibrant litho-tectonic understanding and abetted in assessing the regional structural control of the scattered gold occurrences in the study area. The herein detailed approach includes band rationing, principal component and independent component analyses, directional filtering, and automated and semi-automated lineament extraction techniques to Landsat 8- Operational Land Imager (OLI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and Sentinel-1B data. Results of optical and SAR data processed as grayscale raster images of band ratios, Relative Absorption Band Depth (RBD), and (mafic-carbonate-hydrous) mineralogical indices are used to extract the representative pixels (regions of interest). The extracted pixels are then converted to vector shape files and are finally imported into the ArcMap environment. Similarly, manually and automatically extracted lineaments are merged with the band ratios and mineralogical indices vector layers. The data fusion approach used herein reveals no particular spatial association between gold occurrences and certain lithological units, but shows a preferential distribution of gold-quartz veins in zones of chlorite-epidote alteration overlapping with high-density intersections of lineaments. Structural features including en-echelon arrays of quartz veins and intense recrystallization and sub-grain development textures are consistent with vein formation and gold deposition syn-kinematic with the host shear zones. The mineralized, central-shear quartz veins, and the associated strong stretching lineation affirm vein formation amid stress build-up and stress relaxation of an enduring oblique convergence (assigned as Najd-related sinistral transpression; 640-610 Ma). As the main outcome of this research, we present a priority map with zones defined as high potential targets for undiscovered gold resources.

TI  - Assessment of land use/land cover changes induced by Jizan Dam, Saudi Arabia, and their effect on soil organic carbon
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change has been influenced by human activity and has altered an enormous part of the natural landscapes of developing countries. Meanwhile, as the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. The objectives of this study were to assess the land cover and existing land use changes in Jizan Basin, Jizan Province, Saudi Arabia, as an aftermath when Jizan Dam started working, and, subsequently, to assess soil organic carbon distribution in different land uses in the study area. Three cloud-free Landsat MSS, ETM+, and OLI images covering the study area were employed for analysis. Images were acquired in years 1972, 2000, and 2017, respectively. All images were manipulated using ERDAS Imagine 10 software to achieve the aims of this study. The final output maps have been produced using Arc GIS 10.1. Different methods of data transformation and analysis were applied including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). A supervised classification approach was applied to categorize the images in different land cover classes. Five land use/land cover classes were identified: vegetation, bare soil (sand), bare soil (rocks), urban area, and water bodies. The results show that the vegetation of Jizan Basin increased between 1972 and 2017. The area increased 4% of its total area between 1972 and 2000 with an average annual increment of 0.45%. This annual rate increased to 1.05% during the period of 2000-2017. The major change has been found in the bare area (sand) cover which decreased during the period of 2000-2017 to about 42km(2) (9%). The results prevail that there is a significant increase in vegetated land in Jizan Basin which could be connected to Jizan Dam construction. It is important to mention that in conducting the present study, actual clear land cover changes took place as the result of agricultural land development. These changes in land cover influenced soil organic carbon sequestration.

TI  - First assessment of the plant phenology index (PPI) for estimating gross primary productivity in African semi-arid ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of semi-arid ecosystems in the global carbon cycle as sinks for CO2 emissions has recently been highlighted. Africa is a carbon sink and nearly half its area comprises and and semi-arid ecosystems. However, there are uncertainties regarding CO2 fluxes for semi-arid ecosystems in Africa, particularly savannas and dry tropical woodlands. In order to improve on existing remote-sensing based methods for estimating carbon uptake across semi-arid Africa we applied and tested the recently developed plant phenology index (PPD. We developed a PPI-based model estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) that accounts for canopy water stress, and compared it against three other Earth observation-based GPP models: the temperature and greenness (T-G) model, the greenness and radiation (GoR) model and a light use efficiency model (MOD17). The models were evaluated against in situ data from four semi-arid sites in Africa with varying tree canopy cover (3-65%). Evaluation results from the four GPP models showed reasonable agreement with in situ GPP measured from eddy covariance fltut towers (EC GPP) based on coefficient of variation (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The Gott model produced R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 1.45 g C m(-2) d(-1), and BIC = 678; the T-G model produced R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 1.57 g C m(-2) d(-1), and BIC = 707; the MOD17 model produced R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 1.98 g C and BIC = 800. The PPI-based GPP model was able to capture the magnitude of EC GPP better than the other tested models (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.32 g C Mm(-2) d(-1), and BIC = 631). These results show that a PPI-based GPP model is a promising tool for the estimation of GPP in the semi-arid ecosystems of Africa.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long -term land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics information is essential to understand the trends and make necessary land management interventions, such as in the highlands of Ethiopia. This study analyzed six decades of LULC dynamics of Wanka watershed, Northwestern Ethiopian highlands. Two sets of aerial photographs (1957 and 2017), SPOT 5 and sentinel satellite imageries were analyzed. In addition, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify the drivers and impact of LULC change. It was found that cultivated and rural settlement land (CRSL), bare land, and urban built up area have been continuously expanded at the expenses of mainly forest and shrub lands. Over the entire study period (1957-2017) while the bare land and CRSL have increased by about 59% and 20% respectively, forest and shrub lands have declined by 59% and 57% respectively. Urban built up area has also expanded. The impact of population pressure and expansion of CRSL land were considerable. The trend of LULC dynamics in the study watershed implies adverse impact on the quality and quantity of the land resource. Hence, appropriate land use planning and strategies that reduce expansion of cultivated land need to be practiced.

TI  - Twenty Years of ASTER Contributions to Lithologic Mapping and Mineral Exploration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer is one of five instruments operating on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra platform. Launched in 1999, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) has been acquiring optical data for 20 years. ASTER is a joint project between Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; and U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Numerous reports of geologic mapping and mineral exploration applications of ASTER data attest to the unique capabilities of the instrument. Until 2000, Landsat was the instrument of choice to provide surface composition information. Its scanners had two broadband short wave infrared (SWIR) bands and a single thermal infrared band. A single SWIR band amalgamated all diagnostic absorption features in the 2-2.5 micron wavelength region into a single band, providing no information on mineral composition. Clays, carbonates, and sulfates could only be detected as a single group. The single thermal infrared (TIR) band provided no information on silicate composition (felsic vs. mafic igneous rocks; quartz content of sedimentary rocks). Since 2000, all of these mineralogical distinctions, and more, could be accomplished due to ASTER's unique, high spatial resolution multispectral bands: six in the SWIR and five in the TIR. The data have sufficient information to provide good results using the simplest techniques, like band ratios, or more sophisticated analyses, like machine learning. A robust archive of images facilitated use of the data for global exploration and mapping.

TI  - Spatial prediction of landslide-susceptible zones in El-Qaa area, Egypt, using an integrated approach based on GIS statistical analysis
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility locations is a crucial task to support risk management and development plans in mountainous areas, such as El-Qaa area. The study aims to delineate landslide-susceptible zones that can cause enormous damage to property, infrastructure, and loss of life. An innovative integrated approach using remote sensing, geographic information systems, and geophysical techniques was used in the current work to evaluate landslide susceptibility locations. Magnetic data were supported by information derived from geologic, geomorphologic, topographic, and seismic data to reveal the landslides-prone zones. Several factors contributing to landslide susceptibility in El-Qaa area were determined, such as distance to faults, lithology, stream power index, slope, density of earthquake events, distance to epicenters, tilt derivative of magnetic data, distance to drainages, aspect, and topographic wetness index. A unique landslide susceptibility model (LSM) was developed in this study by integration all the spatial data that represent the contributing factors. The bivariate statistical index method was constructed to assign logic ranks and weights for the causative factors and their classes representing their realistic relations with landslide susceptibility in El-Qaa area. The landslide susceptibility map classifies El-Qaa area into five relative susceptibility zones: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The very high- and high-susceptibility zones are distributed in the eastern side of El-Qaa area where structurally controlled channels, steep topography to downhill lands, and Precambrian basement rocks are located. The resulting susceptibility map was tested and validated using the landslide locations that were delineated from field survey and satellite images at high resolution. The integrated methodology shows a more realistic landslide susceptibility map and adds a powerful tool to design a fruitful management plan in mountainous areas.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of satellite-based remote-sensing data and the geographical information system (GIS) for the exploration of groundwater resources has developed a revolution in the field of groundwater research, which assists in evaluating, observing, and preserving groundwater resources. In the present paper, various groundwater potential zones for the assessment of groundwater recharge zone availability have been delineated using remote-sensing and GIS techniques. Landsat 8 satellite imageries were used to prepare various thematic layers such as: lithology, altitude, slope, and groundwater table map from the inventoried tube well data. These layers were then transformed into raster data using the feature to raster converter tool in the ArcGIS 9.3 software. The raster maps of these factors are allocated a fixed score and weight computed from multi-influencing factor (MIF) technique. Subjective weights are assigned to the respective thematic layers and overlaid in GIS platform for the identification of potential groundwater recharge zones within the study area using weighted overlay index analysis (WOIA). The groundwater potential zones thus obtained were divided into five categories, viz., very poor, poor, good, moderate, and excellent zones. The results reveal that the areas of excellent groundwater potential are estimated to permit precipitated water percolates into subsurface and ultimately contributes to recharge the groundwater. These results suggest that the high potential zones will have a key role in future expansion of drinking water and irrigation development in the study area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcano eruptions of Anak Krakatau had a great impact on the coastal area at the western part of Java island in Indonesia. In the middle of 2018, the volcanic activity at Anak Krakatau in Indonesia increased. Since June 2018, the eruption begun, accompanied by volcanic earthquakes, emission, and tremor vibration. However, on December 22, 2018, the eruption of Anak Krakatau caused a landslide on the southwest part of the volcano. The landslide also caused a tsunami in coastal area and caused many people to become victims in Banten province. There were significant geomorphological changes at Anak Krakatau Island where the volcano is situated. In this study, we monitored the geomorphological change of the Anak Krakatau Island and calculated the total area of the island for pre-eruption, post-eruption, and recent times. By using SNAP 6.0 program and ArcMap 10.4, Sentinel-1 data were processed to generate maps and calculate the extent of the island. The geomorphological changes were successfully detected and quantified. This kind study using all-weather satellite radar imagery can be used to detect and calculate the total area of any geomorphological change from future volcanic activity.

TI  - Computational modeling for climate change: Simulating and visualizing a resilient landscape architecture design approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastlines are changing, wildfires are raging, cities are getting hotter, and spatial designers are charged with the task of designing to mitigate these unknowns. This research examines computational digital workflows to understand and alleviate the impacts of climate change on urban landscapes. The methodology includes two separate simulation and visualization workflows. The first workflow uses an animated particle fluid simulator in combination with geographic information systems data, Photoshop software, and three-dimensional modeling and animation software to simulate erosion and sedimentation patterns, coastal inundation, and sea level rise. The second workflow integrates building information modeling data, computational fluid dynamics simulators, and parameters from EnergyPlus and Landsat to produce typologies and strategies for mitigating urban heat island effects. The effectiveness of these workflows is demonstrated by inserting design prototypes into modeled environments to visualize their success or failure. The result of these efforts is a suite of workflows which have the potential to vastly improve the efficacy with which architects and landscape architects use existing data to address the urgency of climate change.

TI  - The concept of human being in the Yakut language
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the means of verbalization of the concept of human being in the Yakut language. The semantics of the word kihi is analyzed. The main conceptual models of the man are identified through the observation of lexical meaning, derived forms, collocations, synonyms and antonyms of the word. Language data allow creating a human model based on gender marking and national identity. The human being is represented as an ideal: "perfect being," "standard," "noble," "insider," "emotional person" with a set of positive and negative qualities. The criteria for the qualities of a human being are the equality and the norms accepted in society. A good man is opposed to the bad person whose behavior goes beyond the conventional. Therefore, the man has the following characteristics: insider, kind, respected, sociable, human and constant. Its antithesis is the image of the stranger, a poor, not respected, and despised by society. A man always has a choice between good and evil. Overall, the Yakut language represents the syncretic image of the epic (pagan) and modern man having adopted the features of the Christian worldview.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Initial Lumpectomy (SNAIL Study)-a Prospective Validation Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tertiary oncology center clinicians are commonly faced with the problem of managing patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer made after lumpectomy in the Primary Health Care (PHC) setting. There are no studies or guidelines that address the further surgical management in this group of patients regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and need for breast post-operative cavity excision. Prospective observational study was planned to evaluate the feasibility of SLNB and defining the need for definitive breast surgery in patients diagnosed with breast cancer after lumpectomy in PHC. The study was carried out from January 2015 to August 2017 in Tata Medical Center, India, approved by institutional review board (EC/TMC/36/14). Seventy patients who underwent lumpectomy with a definitive histological analysis of breast cancer were included in this study. Each patient had definitive breast surgery and SLNB using subareoral blue dye injection followed by validation axillary dissection. The identification rate (IR) for SLNB was 92% (64/70). The median number of SLNs removed was 2 (IQR 1, 3). There were 2 patients with false negative results resulting in false negative rate (FNR) of 11%. Overall, SLNB procedure has the sensitivity of 89%, NPV of 96%, and accuracy was 97%. Peri-areoral incision of initial surgery was associated with low IR (84%) and high FNR (33%). Final histopathology showed residual invasive cancer in 43% and ductal carcinoma in situ in 14% of patients. Among 21 patients where initial lumpectomy histopathology margin was free of cancer, residual malignancy was found in 57% of patients. Prior excision of lumps for breast cancer does not affect the accuracy of SLNB. Peri-areoral scar may be associated with high FNR and low IR, although further studies are needed to validate this statement. Definitive breast surgery is required for all patients, irrespective of initial lumpectomy histopathological margin status.

TI  - Economic damages of rice crop due to flood 2010 and its mitigations in Larkana division using geo-spatial tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the crop damages due to flood and to develop flood risk maps in order to mitigate its future damages. For that purpose, field and satellite data was used to assess economic damages of Rice crop, prepare flood risk maps and to delineate possible flow paths for safe disposal of flood runoff in case of any future breach on the right side of the Indus river. For the current study, Landsat data for the years 2009 and 2011 along with ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were analyzed with ArcGIS 10.3, and ERDAS IMAGINE. The results of the study showed that about 247973.024 tons rice of worth 11.425 billion Pakistani rupees was damaged due to flood 2010 in Larkana Division. Moreover, the created flood risk map showed that most of the area of Larkana and Qamber-Shandadkot has low elevation. Therefore, the risk of floods to these areas is high, while the Kashmore-Kandhkot district has a comparatively high altitude. Thus, the risk of flood is low in that district. The most prolonged flood flow path delineated from DEM using geospatial tools shows that the flow path starts from the southern part of Kashmore-Kandhkot, and then it enters Shikarpur and eventually disposes-off into Hamal Lake in Qamber-Shandadkot which could be used for safe disposal in future flood scenarios to moderate the flood damages.

TI  - Sea surface temperature inversion model for infrared remote sensing images based on deep neural network
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional sea surface temperature (SST) inversion model has a complicated parameter fitting process and poor adaptability in different sea areas. This paper presents an infrared remote sensing inversion model of SST based on deep neural network to refine the situation. The training data are the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared remote sensing data on sunny days and measured data from buoy in Bohai. The accuracy of inversion results is analyzed, the determination coefficient of inversion and measured values is 0.98, the standard error is 0.71 degrees C and the mean absolute deviation is 0.85 degrees C, the results show good accuracy of the model. The accuracy of Bohai SST inversion results is compared with SST products from the MODIS sensors and the inversion model is applied to other sea areas, demonstrating the credibility and portability of the model. The data experiments in this paper prove the feasibility of the model, which provides ideas for global SST inversion.

TI  - Intraoperative Detection of Efferent Lymphatic Vessels Emerging from Lymph Node during Lymphatic Microsurgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although the usefulness of efferent lymphaticovenular anastomosis (ELVA) in lymphatic microsurgery has been reported, the optimal method to distinguish efferent from afferent lymphatics is not yet established. We propose a novel technique to detect efferent lymphatics appropriate for anastomosis.Methods In total, 62 groin lymph nodes (LNs) of 46 limbs were divided into four groups based on the findings of indocyanine green lymphography: n =15 in normal, 15 in dermal backflow stage 0, 18 in stage I, and 14 in stage II groups. The target LN and afferent lymphatic connecting it were preoperatively detected using ultrasonography. Intraoperatively, 0.05 mL patent blue dye was slowly manually injected from the afferent lymphatic; the lymphatic(s) subsequently stained was diagnosed as the efferent lymphatic(s) emerging from the node. The success rates of efferent lymphatic detection, sizes of LN, and diameter of efferent lymphatics were compared among the groups.Results Both LN size and diameter of efferent lymphatic were significantly larger in the stage 0 and I groups than the other groups ( p <0.01). Efferent lymphatic could be stained in 13, 13, 18, and 9 LNs in the normal and stage 0, I, and II groups, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the stage I and II groups regarding the success rate of efferent lymphatic detection ( p =0.04).Conclusion Efferent lymphatics could be detected using patent blue dye in 85.5% of the cases. The patients in early-stage lymphostasis might be the most appropriate candidates for ELVA.

TI  - Crop suitability analysis in water resource management of Paschim Medinipur District, India: a remote sensing approach
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study on crop suitability analysis is a prerequisite for achieving optimum utilization of the available land resources for sustainable agricultural production. To assess the suitability of crop type for a particular land area, at least five parameters are considered, i.e., physical properties of soil, chemical properties of soil, groundwater availability, irrigation status and climatic condition. The present study area, i.e. Keshpur, Salboni and Midnapore Blocks of Paschim Medinipur District in West Bengal, has the problem of overproduction of same crops resulting in steep fall in price. To overcome this problem, the specific crop suitability in a particular area was undertaken using Geospatial overlay technique. The methodology adopted was to use Landsat ETM+ satellite images in the evaluation of physical and chemical attributes of soil, groundwater level, drainage network system, irrigation, land use and land cover of the study area. Then on the basis of the overlay maps, a crop suitability map was prepared and the result shows that few portions are suitable for groundnut cultivation. The lowland part of the study area and the river basin are most suitable for cultivation of paddy, vegetables, potato and some other crops. It was found that better land-use management could be applied in different land components as the conventional land assessment techniques agonize from the limitation of same cropping technique though it is suitable for different crops. It is observed from the study that though the area is highly fertile according to physicochemical properties of the soil different crop should be cultivated using the suitability characteristic of the soil and furthermore it will boost the income of the marginal farmers.

TI  - Development and validation of improved PM<sub>2.5</sub> models for public health applications using remotely sensed aerosol and meteorological data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from different retrieval algorithms have been correlated with ground measurements of fine particulate matter less than 2.5m (PM2.5). Several MODIS AOD products from different satellites (Aqua vs. Terra), retrieval algorithms (Dark Target vs. Deep Blue), collections (5.1 vs. 6), and spatial resolutions (10km vs. 3km) for cities in the Western, Midwestern, and Southeastern USA have been evaluated. We developed and validated PM2.5 prediction models using remotely sensed AOD data. These models were further improved by incorporating meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind gust, and wind direction) from the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2). Adding these meteorological data significantly improved the simulation quality of all the PM2.5 models, especially in the Western USA. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind gust were significant meteorological variables throughout the year in the Western USA. Wind speed was the most significant meteorological variable for the cold season while for the warm season, temperature was the most prominent one in the Midwestern and Southeastern USA. Using this satellite-derived PM2.5 data can improve the spatial coverage, especially in areas where PM2.5 ground monitors are lacking, and studying the connections between PM2.5 and public health concerns including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the USA can be further advanced.

TI  - Environmental Health Promotion of a Contaminated Site in Mexico
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Entangled in complex ecological, sociocultural, and economic systems, current environmental health problems require integrated participatory approaches. Alpuyeca, a semi-urban, highly marginalized community in South-Central Mexico burdened by lead and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination, dengue fever, and intestinal diseases, illustrates this. Its residents are distinctive, however, for their concerted actions in the face of environmental problems and the presence of defenders of a prehispanic worldview based on the protection of nature. This article addresses the health impacts of an integrated environmental health promotion strategy implemented through a participatory action research intervention based on qualitative and quantitative methods. Different actors, sectors, dimensions, and knowledge types were harmonized in a collaborative space created specifically for our interdisciplinary research team, community residents and local authorities. Reflections, plans and actions were developed collectively in this space with the view of finding solutions anchored in the local culture. Results included sharp reductions in blood-lead concentrations among children, in entomological indices, and in PCB contamination, as well as capacity strengthening. Medium-level community participation was achieved. This work contributes evidence that participatory environmental health research can be effective in analyzing and reducing problems in communities with multiple environmental health concerns. It complements ecohealth and environmental health literacy approaches.

TI  - CIRCULAR BEAUTY AN APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY AESTHETICS FOR THE CAPITALOCENE
T2  - ARTE Y POLITICAS DE IDENTIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aesthetics are not independent of the time in which they are located, nor of the ideology they support or answer; on the contrary, they can become a very important vector that facilitates changes in the worldview, as we have seen in the sociopolitical revolutions of the last century. Unlike the aesthetics of postmodernity, with their epidermic and scarcely critical condition, the times of the ecological crisis of the Capitalocene and of the transition to more sustainable societies demand a very different creativity and aesthetics (Albelda, Parreno y Marrero, 2018). This article defends the need to recover the identity and teleological role that art and aesthetics have played in the past. In this context, we will identify the foundational aspects of a circular aesthetic, and the indissoluble union with the ecological ethics from which it departs. Likewise, we will argue about the amplitude of the concept of circularity that, transcending the most known aspects linked to the recycling of materials, acquires an important moral function linked to the weak anthropocentrism, expressing the acceptance of individual fugacity, and even of culture and species, from a holistic perspective (Spier, 2011).

TI  - Understanding Sea Level Change in the South Pacific During the Late 20th Century and Early 21st Century
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatially nonuniform sea level rise was observed in the South Pacific with high trends of up to 8 mm/year in the southwest subtropical Pacific and much lower values in the eastern ocean during the 1993 to 2015 altimetry data period. Negative trends were observed further south. In recent decades, these trends have been interpreted as a spin-up of subtropical gyre circulation. Here an analysis of altimetry data and data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 is presented, which attempts to separate natural climate variability from sea level changes. In order to quantify the impact of natural variability, a multiple linear regression was performed between sea level and dominant climate indices in the region, with the latter representing interannual to interdecadal climate variability. Our results indicate that the observed pattern cannot completely be explained by the climate modes but that a large residual trend remains.Plain Language Summary Sea level change is important in the context of climate change. The global mean sea level has risen about 20 cm in the last century. However, sea level change is not globally uniform but varies regionally due to different factors. These factors are a mixture of natural and human-induced contributions. Satellite data provide a global picture of sea level change. These observations started in the early 1990s. During the period 1993 to 2015 for which the satellite data are available, a spatial nonuniform trend has been observed in the South Pacific, with a maximum in the western part, east of New Zealand. The main objective of this work is to analyze whether this trend can be explained with natural climate variability or whether it is human influenced. Apart from the observations, model data that simulate the climate of the past century are used in order to answer that question. The results of this work indicate that the observed sea level pattern during 1993 to 2015 cannot be explained by natural variability alone.

TI  - Mapping of mosquito-borne diseases in Kolkata Municipal Corporation using GIS and AHP based decision making approach
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are those which transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Stagnant water bodies are often preferable for breeding sites of mosquitos. But from breeding eggs to final stage, there are many factors responsible for its incubation, maturation and growth enough to bite and transmit diseases. The main aim of present study is to focus on associated environmental factors that provide suitable breeding sites and susceptibility mapping of mosquito-borne-diseases through geospatial technique and decision making approach. Analytic hierarchy process as a decision making approach was integrated with geographic information system to map of mosquito-borne diseases in Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Choice based various ranking was used to decide the weights of selected factors through establishing pairwise comparison matrix. Initially, 10 relevant environmental factors were chosen to determine their weight through pairwise comparison matrix. Concomitantly, weight of each causative factor was used as geo-database to support overlay analysis. Consistency ratio was calculated to check the decision process and significance measurement. The consistency ratio of decision factors was calculated as 0.0470, which is < 0.1 and considered as consistent and acceptable. The study analysis shows that proximity to water bodies is a major responsible factor and subsequently moisture content, water index, availability of shadow area and presence of vegetation are also influential factors in prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases. The present result shows the high applicability of satellite data and spatial technique in epidemic diseases zonation.

TI  - The impact of drought and decline in groundwater levels on the spread of sand dunes in the plain in Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand dunes are one of the types of Iran desert regions, which are occupying a significant extension of deserts area of Iran. The study area is part of Yazd-Ardakan with an area of 34,028.8 hectares in Yazd province. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the decline in groundwater levels and increasing drought on spreading sand dunes. To map land use during the three decades in 1986, 1994, 2002 and 2016 were extracted from Landsat satellite images. Using different processes and methods of artificial neural networks, ARTMAP fuzzy is obtained land use map for mentioned years. To investigate the relationship of these changes, decline in groundwater level of the water table level statistics of 23 wells in 1982, 1995, 2009 and 2016 using of ArcGIS software to kriging method interpolated and rate of water loss were calculated. Also, drought index SPI by software DIP and method of interpolation inverse distance were estimated during this time interval and were compared to the number of days of dust per year. The area of sand dunes has reached from 15% in 1986 to 33% in 2016. In 1982, half of the area has been groundwater at a depth of 30-50 m from ground level in the event that there had been not from 2009 other water at this depth, and in the years 2009 and 2016, 60% of the area is located at a depth of 50-70 m and 10% at depths greater than 100 m, and the maximum of drought index value in the area is -1.19 and its minimum is - 0.66. The southern part had an area of drop in ground water and growth of sand dunes and also drought index value is greater.

TI  - Impact of the industrial sector on surface temperatures in Jubail City, Saudi Arabia using remote sensing techniques
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Jubail is an industrial city that has registered the highest growth in Saudi Arabia in recent years, and it is important to understand the potential effects of this growth on both the environment and the City's residents. The collaboration between the industry and the academic researches and scientific technologies would contribute to achieve a proper management to reduce the potential industrial risks on the environment and living organisms. In this study, we used remote sensing technology using Landsat 8 satellite images to calculate and analyze surface temperatures in Jubail Industrial City. Previous observations of Jubail using Landsat 7 satellite images from 2001 demonstrated that a heat island is centered above the industrial area. Heat islands can lead to serious environmental and health issues. The land surface temperatures observed in this study (29-77.2 degrees C) are, to some extent, consistent with those of a previous study (33-85 degrees C); however, increased industrial activity in Jubail has led to an expansion of heat coverage, both inland and offshore. Our study illustrates the importance of remote sensing data for detecting and understanding historical climate change in industrial urban areas, thus providing valuable data for future management planning.

TI  - WORLDVIEW ORIENTATIONS OF RELIGIOUS LITERATURE AS AN AGENT OF SOCIALIZATION IN THE MODERN SOCIETY
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the concept and the essence of religious socialization as well as the role of religious literature in the socialization of individuals. The authors suggest a classification of religious texts and give recommendations regarding usage of religious literature as an agent of socialization in the modern society. The relevance of this topic lies in the fact that local cultures might lose their identities when borrowing the features typical for other world cultures. As a result, the process of individual socialization often includes the adoption of immoral and anti-spiritual ideas. However, religious literature, as one of the agents of socialization, can exercise a positive influence on this process. Scientific novelty of the paper consists in the analysis of factors involved in religious socialization and determination of the function of religious literature in this process.

TI  - Glacier Monitoring Using Frequency Domain Offset Tracking Applied to Sentinel-1 Images: A Product Performance Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission has now reached its maturity, and is acquiring high-quality images with a high revisit time, allowing for effective continuous monitoring of our rapidly changing planet. The purpose of this work is to assess the performance of the different synthetic aperture radar products made available by the European Space Agency through the Sentinels Data Hub against glacier displacement monitoring with offset tracking methodology. In particular, four classes of products have been tested: the medium resolution ground range detected, the high-resolution ground range detected, acquired in both interferometric wide and extra-wide swath, and the single look complex. The first are detected pre-processed images with about 40, 25, and 10-m pixel spacing, respectively. The last category, the most commonly adopted for the application at issue, represents the standard coherent synthetic aperture radar product, delivered in unprocessed focused complex format with pixel spacing ranging from 14 to 20 m in azimuth and from approximately 2 to 6 m in range, depending on the acquisition area and mode. Tests have been performed on data acquired over four glaciers, i.e., the Petermann Glacier, the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, the Jackobshavn Isbrae and the Thwaites Glacier. They revealed that the displacements estimated using interferometric wide swath single look complex and high-resolution ground range detected products are fully comparable, even at computational level. As a result, considering the differences in memory consumption and pre-processing requirements presented by these two kinds of product, detected formats should be preferred for facing the application.

TI  - Quantification of spatial temporal variability of snow cover and hydro-climatic variables based on multi-source remote sensing data in the Swat watershed, Hindukush Mountains, Pakistan
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern part of Hindukush Mountains has a perplexing environment due to the influence of adjacent mountains of Himalaya, Karakoram, and Tibetan Plateau. Although reliable evidences of climate change are available; however, a clear knowledge of snow cover dynamics in the context of climate change is missing for this region. In this study, we used various remotely sensed (TRMM precipitation product, while MODIS temperature and snow cover products) and gauge-based datasets to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of climatic variables and their turn effects over the snow cover area (SCA) and river discharge in the Swat watershed, northern Hindukush Mountains, Pakistan. The Mann-Kendall method and Sen's slope estimator were used to estimate the trends in SCA and hydro-climatic variables, at 5% significant level (P = 0.05). Results show that the winter and springs temperatures have increased (at the rate of 0.079 and 0.059 degrees C year(-1), respectively), while decreasing in the summer and autumn (at the rate of 0.049 and 0.070 degrees C year(-1), respectively). Basin-wide increasing tendency of precipitation was identified with a highest increasing rate of 3.563 mm year(-1) in the spring season. A decreasing trend in the winter SCA (at the rate of -0.275% year(-1)) and increasing trends in other seasons were identified. An increasing tendency of river discharge on annual and seasonal scales was also witnessed. The seasonal variations in discharge showed significant positive and negative relationships with temperature and SCA, respectively. We conclude that the future variations in the temperature and SCA in the higher altitudes of the Swat watershed could substantially affect the seasonality of the river discharge. Moreover, it implies that the effect of ongoing global warming on the SCA in the snowmelt-dominated river basins needs to be considered for sustainable regional planning and management of water resources, hydropower production, and downstream irrigation scheduling.

TI  - Predicting Spatial Habitat Changes of Haftad-Gholleh Protected Area in Markazi Province, Iran.
T2  - Iranian Journal of Applied Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Haftad-Gholleh Area has recently encountered many changes. In this study, by using landsat images of the years 1996 and 2016, landuse maps were classified into four classes including: agriculture, rangeland, residential areas, and rocks. Land Change Modeler (LCM) and Habitat and Biodiversity Modeler (HBM) modules in the Idrisi GIS software were used to analyze the land use changes and habitat evaluation for the prediction of the land uses status in 2016, based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Markov Chain analysis and logistic regression. The results showed that most of the changes in the landscape of the region between 1996 and 2016 were related, respectively, to attrition, aggregation and creation indicators; between the years 2016 to 2041, they can be related, respectively, to the creation and dissection indicators. The habitat evaluation showed that 4.5% of the habitat was decreased in 2016, as compared to 1996. With the continuation of this trend, 6.5% of the habitat will fall in 2041, as compared to 2016. Receiver Operating Characteridtic (ROC) of the model also specified that the desirability model validity was equal to 0.9558, showing the excellent performance of logistic regression method. In general, this can be an important principle approach preventing from changes in the habitat of wild sheep to other land uses.

TI  - Breaking the news: Belief in fake news and conspiracist beliefs
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Politically-slanted fake news (FN)-manufactured disinformation, hoaxes, and satire appearing to present true information about events-is currently receiving extensive attention in the mainstream media. However, it is currently unclear what factors may influence an individual's likelihood to believe in FN, outside of political identity. As FN is often conspiratorial in nature and usually negative, it was theorised that conspiracist belief, and factors that have been found to relate to a conspiratorial worldview (i.e., dangerous worldview and schizotypy), may also relate to political FN. Method A correlational design (N = 125, M = 27.6, SD = 4.26), was used to examine predictors of FN. Results Political viewpoint was a consistent predictor of FN endorsement. Conspiratorial worldview and schizotypal personality also predicted FN belief, with weaker or less consistent prediction by other variables including dangerous worldview, normlessness, and randomness beliefs. Partial correlation analysis suggested that most variables related to FN through their association with conspiracist ideation and political identity beliefs. Conclusion Prior political beliefs and the tendency for conspiracist ideation appear particularly important for individuals' endorsement of FN, regardless of prior exposure to the specific news presented. As such, conspiracy theory (CT) belief and its underlying mechanisms appear a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial FN belief. Implications and limitations are discussed.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of spectral indexes for identify high Andean wetlands
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - High Andean wetlands are habitats critical to life forms that have adapted to these extreme high mountain ecosystems, and for living beings that inhabit the lower parts of the basin; they are spaces that contain high diversity of flora and fauna characteristic of these places and are strongly associated with the water component. There lies the importance of identifying and monitoring ecosystems, using easy applicable methods and allowing results every two weeks approximately, they are inexpensive and highly reliable. Methods of monitoring in short periods, they are economically profitable and provide reliable information, they correspond to the evaluations by satellite images, specifically applying the methods of spectral indices. Thereby, the objective of the research was to evaluate the performance of six indices, considered to be the most used to identify high Andean wetlands (humidity index at surface level, normalized difference water index, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, index of vegetation to the surface and tasseled CAP vegetation), in periods of low precipitation, using imagery Landsat 8 OLI. Comparing the performance of those indexes in the identification of wetlands through cross-validation and bootstrap statistical learning, the index that showed better performance was tasseled CAP vegetation, revealing the lowest value of the average of the mean square error of iterations between the test failure rate and training. The index tasseled CAP vegetation, shows greater reliability to identify and evaluate high Andean wetlands.

TI  - Could land surface phenology be used to discriminate Mediterranean pine species?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) can improve the monitoring of forest areas and their change processes. The aim of this study was to characterize the temporal dynamics in Mediterranean pines and evaluate the potential of LSP for species discrimination. We used 661 mono-specific plots for five different Pinus species (Pinus halepensis, P. pima, P. pinaster, P. sylvestris, P. nigra) and the MOD13Q1-NDVI time series (2000-2016) to perform the analyses. The time series were smoothed to extract the phenological parameters and calculate multi-temporal metrics, to synthesize the inter-annual variability. The potential of ISP for discriminating between Pinus species was evaluated by the application of the Random Forest (RF) classifier from different subsets of explanatory variables: i) the smooth time series; ii) the multi-temporal metrics; and iii) the multi-temporal metrics plus the auxiliary physical variables. This latter subset was also used as input to a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm to better explain the differences between Pinus species regarding LSP parameters and other environmental drivers. The analysis showed two different patterns: an important NDVI decrease during the summer for P. halepensis, P. pinea, and P. pinaster, and lower NDVI variation along the year for P. sylvestris. P. nigra showed a heterogeneous infra-specific behavior, having locations with different patterns. We distinguished Pinus species plots with a global accuracy of 0.82, when we used multi-temporal metrics of LSP and auxiliary physical variables. More generally, the Mediterranean Pinus species could be differentiated considering the 23rd of July as the start of season and 179 km and 1100 m as distance to the coastline and elevation, respectively.

TI  - Hyperspectral Imaging Retrieval Using MODIS Satellite Sensors Applied to Volcanic Ash Clouds Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a method for hyperspectral retrieval using multispectral satellite images. The method consists of the use of training spectral data with a compressive capability. By using principal component analysis (PCA), a proper number of basis vectors are extracted. These vectors are properly combined and weighted by the sensors' responses from visible MODIS channels, achieving as a result the retrieval of hyperspectral images. Once MODIS channels are used for hyperspectral retrieval, the training spectra are projected over the recovered data, and the ground-based process used for training can be reliably detected. To probe the method, we use only four visible images from MODIS for large-scale ash clouds' monitoring from volcanic eruptions. A high-spectral resolution data of reflectances from ash was measured in the laboratory. Using PCA, we select four basis vectors, which combined with MODIS sensors responses, allows estimating hyperspectral images. By comparing both the estimated hyperspectral images and the training spectra, it is feasible to identify the presence of ash clouds at a pixel-by-pixel level, even in the presence of water clouds. Finally, by using a radiometric model applied over hyperspectral retrieved data, the relative concentration of the volcanic ash in the cloud is obtained. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the classical method based on temperature differences (using infrared MODIS channels), and the results show an excellent match, outperforming the infrared-based approach. This proposal opens new avenues to increase the potential of multispectral remote systems, which can be even extended to other applications and spectral bands for remote sensing. The results show that the method could play an essential role by providing more accurate information of volcanic ash spatial dispersion, enabling one to prevent several hazards related to volcanic ash where volcanoes' monitoring is not feasible.

TI  - Runoff from glacier ice and seasonal snow in High Asia: separating melt water sources in river flow
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Across High Asia, the amount, timing, and spatial patterns of snow and ice melt play key roles in providing water for downstream irrigation, hydropower generation, and general consumption. The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.

AB  - Disaster response presents major challenges for robotics and computer vision alike. The Cyber-Enhanced Canine Suit is a suit equipped with a camera, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and various other sensors, to be worn by search and rescue (SAR) dogs for the purpose of enhancing SAR dog operations. This paper presents an image recognition system for use in disaster scenarios and its integration with the Cyber-Enhanced Canine Suit platform. The system's intended use is to spot personal items of missing individuals or other visual clues in video streams from various disaster response platforms. The system facilitates quick learning of targets from limited data and makes providing that data quick and easy. It also provides backtrack recognition functionality, to rapidly find novel targets in the seen footage. We evaluated the recognition system on footage gathered in the field, obtaining promising results. Integrated with the Cyber-Enhanced Canine Suit, the system can automatically plot detections of search targets onto a map display, to provide operators with a quick overview of what was seen where.

TI  - Change detection techniques for remote sensing applications: a survey
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Change detection captures the spatial changes from multi temporal satellite images due to manmade or natural phenomenon. It is of great importance in remote sensing, monitoring environmental changes and land use -land cover change detection. Remote sensing satellites acquire satellite images at varying resolutions and use these for change detection. This paper briefly analyses various change detection methods and the challenges and issues faced as part of change detection. Over the years, a wide range of methods have been developed for analyzing remote sensing data and newer methods are still being developed. Timely and accurate change detection of Earth's surface features provides the basis for evaluating the relationships and interactions between human and natural phenomena for the better management of resources. In general, change detection applies multi-temporal datasets to quantitatively analyse the temporal effects of the phenomenon. As such, this study attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the fundamental processes required for change detection. The study also gives a brief account of the main techniques of change detection and discusses the need for development of enhanced change detection methods.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land use and land cover changes are often referred for the anthropogenic modification of Earth's surface. The extents of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Adama Wereda at three different periods (2002, 2010, and 2017) were generated using data from various Landsat sensors namely ETM+, TM and OLI TIRS. This work focused on a change detection analysis using post classification comparison (PCC) and change detection matrix (CDM). These images were geometrically corrected and image processing operations for instance: radiometric correction, using spectral radiance model was carried out, followed by land cover categorisation into water bodies, built up, bare land, sparse vegetation and dense vegetation employing Knowledge, pixel and indices based classification in ERDAS imagine software. The generated data of both change detection techniques from 2002 to 2017 revealed interesting aspect that build up, dense vegetation and sparse vegetation increased in area of approximately 160%, 30% and 78% respectively at the expense of barren land which decreased at 8.5%, but there is not much change in the water bodies. It was also noticed that both the algorithms gives similar values but with negligible deviation. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the contemporary landscape structure of the Monumental Zone (MZ)-1 at the Bagan Cultural Heritage Site in the Dry Zone of Myanmar. With respect to hundreds of medieval monuments, how local residents in the residential areas within the MZ-1 manage the landscape was the focus of the current study, conducted with two objectives: (1) Identifying land covers as features of the contemporary landscape on the basis of land use and (2) evaluating how the features interrelate. The landscape features were identified by the analysis of Landsat 8 satellite imagery, followed by variance analysis for comparison of the features' areas, and interrelationships of features were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Vegetated features were identified in coexistence with non-vegetated ones, while crop coverage and non-vegetated features were smaller than the area of the other two vegetated features. Semi-natural woody vegetation was found in proximity to monuments and was dependent on the occurrence of the shrub-prone patch that, in turn, was triggered by the expansion of exposed land containing a large segment of cultivatable area. The current study suggests the need to prioritise timely land use and management, focusing on local agricultural activity for safeguarding the heritage as well as the historical settings.

TI  - Validation of 2015 Lake Erie MODIS image spectral decomposition using visible derivative spectroscopy and field campaign data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely identification of color-producing agents (CPAs) in Lake Erie is a challenging, but vital aspect of monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs). In particular, HABs that include large amounts of cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) can be toxic to humans, posing a threat to drinking water, in addition to recreational and economic use of lake Erie. The optical signal of lake Erie is complex (Becker et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2017), typically comprised of phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), detritus, and terrigenous inorganic particles, varying in composition both spatially and temporally. The Kent State University (KSU) spectral decomposition method effectively partitions CPAs using a varimax-rotated, principal component analysis (VPCA) of visible reflectance spectra measured using lab, field or satellite instruments (Ali et al., 2013; Ortiz et al., 2017, 2013). We analyze 2015 imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and field samples collected during the early 2015 cyanoHAB season. We identified four primary CPA spectral signatures, and the spatial distribution of each identified CPA, in the reflectance spectra datasets of both the MODIS and lab-measured water samples. The KSU spectral decomposition method results in mixtures of specific pigments, pigment degradation products, and minerals that describe the optically complex water. We found very good agreement between the KSU VPCA spectral decomposition results and in situ measurements, indicating that this method may be a powerful tool for rapid CyanoHAB monitoring and assessment in large lakes using instruments that provide moderate resolution imagery (03 to 1 km(2)).

TI  - GIS Approach for Determining the Optimum Spatiotemporal Plan for Beekeeping and Honey Production in Hot-Arid Subtropical Ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) technology have seldom been used in apiculture. We applied these tools to map the optimum honey bee colony carrying capacity and estimate honey production during the honey flow of 'Talh' trees (Acacia gerrardii Benth. [Fabaceae: Mimosoideae]) in the Rawdat-Khuraim oasis, central Saudi Arabia. A SPOT 5 panchromatic image (2.5-m resolution) was used to delineate the distribution of Talh trees. ArcGIS was used in image processing and data management, analysis, and visualization. The outputs were maps of Talh distribution, an optimum spatiotemporal beekeeping plan, and predicted potential honey yield. Each Talh tree was predicted to produce a theoretical maximum of 8.5-kg Talh honey per season. Under the current nonoptimum distribution of apiaries, Rawdat-Khuraim produces 4,876-kg honey per season. Optimally, it should produce 9,619-kg honey per season from 1,278 colonies distributed in 12 beekeeping sites. This study provides a technical approach for the use of RS and GIS in describing, planning, and managing honey flows and predicting honey harvest through a spatiotemporal workflow.

In contrast to the poor prognosis associated with advanced stages of disease, early stage disease has a favorable prognosis. Early stage gastric cancer (ESGC) is defined as cancer in which the depth of invasion is limited to the submucosal layer of the stomach on histologic examination, regardless of lymph node status. ESGC that meets standard or expanded criteria can be treated via endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection. Similar indications for endoscopic interventions exist for gastroesophageal junction and esophageal malignancies.

TI  - Smartphone geospatial apps for dengue control, prevention, prediction, and education: MOSapp, DISapp, and the mosquito perception index (MPI)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - India has the largest number of dengue cases in the world, contributing approximately 34% of the global burden. The framework for a geospatially enabled early warning and adaptive response system (EWARS) was first proposed in 2008. It was meant to be a decision support system for enhancing traditional surveillance methods for preventing mosquito-borne diseases in India by utilizing remote sensing data and fuzzy logic-based mathematical predictive modeling. This conceptual paper presents a significant evolution of EWARS such that it synthesizes inputs from not only traditional surveillance and reporting systems for dengue but also from the public via participatory disease surveillance. Two smartphone-based applications have been developed to support EWARS. The firstMOSappallows field health workers to upload surveillance data and collect key data on environmental parameters by both direct observation and via portable microclimate stations. The secondDISappcollects relevant information directly from the community to support participatory disease surveillance. It also gives the user a real-time estimate of the risk of exposure to dengue in proximity to their home and has an educational component that provides information on relevant preventive measures. Both applications utilize a new mosquito abundance measurethe mosquito perception index (MPI)as reported by the user. These data streams will feed into the EWARS model to generate dynamic risk maps that can guide resource optimization and strengthen disease surveillance, prevention, and response. It is anticipated that such an approach can assist in addressing gaps in the current system of dengue surveillance and control in India.

TI  - Analysis of the aerosol and the ozone observations at a southwest peninsular coastal station using microtops sunphotometer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the variations of aerosol optical depth, total column ozone and water vapour, measured by a Microtops-II (MICRO-processor based Total Ozone Portable Spectrometer) ozonometer/sunphotometer over a coastal station in southwest peninsular India, Kochi. Observations of ozone and aerosols are analysed for a period, May 2012 to May 2013. Satellite data sets available over the region are also analysed, and a comparison is made with the in situ data. Sunphotometer measured 1020 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) shows a temporal variability with an increase in AOD during the summer (high value of 0.35 in May 2012) and fewer values near 0.2 during the winter and the post-monsoon seasons. Satellite observations also show a similar pattern of variability with high AOD during the summer. Water vapour is maximum (near 3.5 cm) during the pre-monsoon and the summer monsoon and minimum (below 2 cm in January 2013) during the winter. Ozone shows seasonal variability with a minimum concentration during the winter (230 Dobson Unit (DU) in January 2013) and maximum (280 DU in May 2012) during the summer. OMI (Ozone measuring Instrument) onboard Aura satellite overestimates the column ozone by 10 DU in comparison with the Microtops ozonometer. However, the sunphotometer and satellite observations show a similar pattern of temporal variability with a small difference in magnitude during certain months. The zonal ozone distribution shows a seasonal variability with a reverse gradient between the summer and the winter.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Automatic Lithological Mapping Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study from Souk Arbaa Sahel, Sidi Ifni Inlier, Western Anti-Atlas, Morocco
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data proved to be a valuable resource in a variety of earth science applications. Using high-dimensional data with advanced methods such as machine learning algorithms (MLAs), a sub-domain of artificial intelligence, enhances lithological mapping by spectral classification. Support vector machines (SVM) are one of the most popular MLAs with the ability to define non-linear decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature space by solving a quadratic optimization problem. This paper describes a supervised classification method considering SVM for lithological mapping in the region of Souk Arbaa Sahel belonging to the Sidi Ifni inlier, located in southern Morocco (Western Anti-Atlas). The aims of this study were (1) to refine the existing lithological map of this region, and (2) to evaluate and study the performance of the SVM approach by using combined spectral features of Landsat 8 OLI with digital elevation model (DEM) geomorphometric attributes of ALOS/PALSAR data. We performed an SVM classification method to allow the joint use of geomorphometric features and multispectral data of Landsat 8 OLI. The results indicated an overall classification accuracy of 85%. From the results obtained, we can conclude that the classification approach produced an image containing lithological units which easily identified formations such as silt, alluvium, limestone, dolomite, conglomerate, sandstone, rhyolite, andesite, granodiorite, quartzite, lutite, and ignimbrite, coinciding with those already existing on the published geological map. This result confirms the ability of SVM as a supervised learning algorithm for lithological mapping purposes.

TI  - Prospective clinical trial of robotic sentinel lymph node assessment with isosulfane blue (ISB) and indocyanine green (ICG) in endometrial cancer and the impact of ultrastaging (NCT01818739)
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To assess the performance sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and effect of ultrastaging in clinically early stage endometrial cancer.Methods. Patients with endometrial cancer prospectively enrolled after informed consent was obtained. The cervix was injected superficially with 1 mL of ISB and 1 mL of ICG (diluted 1:25) at 3 and 9 o'clock each. SLN biopsy was followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy (aortic lymphadenectomy at the discretion of the surgeon). Lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed by standard sectioning with H & E; ultrastaging of SLN was done retrospectively and blinded to treating physicians.Results. 204 patients received dye injections. In 184 (90.2%) patients at least one SLN was identified. Of all patients, 138 ( 68%) had bilateral mapping. In the patients with successful mapping of a hemipelvis, ICG detected SLNs in 83% and ISB in 64% of cases (p < 0.0001). Median BMI (kg/m(2)) for patients with successful mapping was 35.7 compared to 40.1 for those who did not map (p = 0.01). Twenty-three (11.3%) patients had positive LNs. Applying the SLN algorithm, positive nodes were detected in 21/23 (91.3%). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.9% (95% Cl: 96.01% to 99.71%). Eleven patients had positive SLN with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) or micrometastases detected on ultrastaging. Including these patients, 34 (17%) had positive LNs, increasing the NPV to 99% and sensitivity to 94%. There were no recurrences in patients with ITCs only.Conclusions. SLN assessment in endometrial cancer is feasible and safe with high NPV (99%). ICG was more effective in detecting SLN compared to ISB. Although ultrastaging detected additional positive LNs, treatment based on standard sectioning appears reasonable but further research is needed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of so-called Early Warning Systems (EWS) had grown exponentially from its birth in the mid-twentieth century. That growth has been in number, sophistication and application realms (earthquakes, floods, global warming, hurricanes...). This paper analyses the use of Early Warning Systems in the contemporary logics of biosurveillance. In order to do this, we will offer an analysis of documentary material and images, both pertaining to the study case focused on epidemics and biosecurity we conducted for three years. The aim is to illustrate the features of the contemporary biosurveillance logics. Finally, we will conclude by saying that in these logics of biosurveillance are brewing a profound change in the way life is monitored. We have called it biomonitorization: life is no longer just passive and controlled by different devices; now, it also plays an active, surveilling and monitorizing role. Then, citizens become biocitizens.

TI  - Implementation of an end-to-end model of the Gulf of Lions ecosystem (NW Mediterranean Sea). I. Parameterization, calibration and evaluation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - An end-to-end model named OSMOSE-GoL has been built for the Gulf of Lions, the main French Mediterranean fishing area. This spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model Eco3-MS/SYMPHONIE (LTL - low trophic level model) to OSMOSE (HTL - high trophic level model). It includes 15 compartments of living organisms, five from the LTL model (ie. nanophytoplankton, microphytoplankton, nanozooplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and ten from the HTL model (northern krill, southern shortfin squid, European pilchard, European anchovy, European sprat, Atlantic horse mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, European hake and Atlantic bluefin tuna). With the exception of northern krill and European sprat, all HTL species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure. The modeled species represent more than 70% of annual catches in this area. This paper presents the parameterization, calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass, landings, diet and trophic level data for HTL groups. For most species, the diets in output of OSMOSE-GoL are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species. However, some differences were observed. Various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data. Benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the HTL predators were not modeled in OSMOSE-GoL. Field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations, while our data concern the period 2001-2004 and the entire modeled domain. Inter- and intra-annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences. The model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the HTL compartments. These values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous Ecopath model for the same area and period. Even though some improvements are still possible, this model may already be of use to explore fishery or Marine Protected Areas scenarios for socio-ecosystem management issues.

TI  - Comparing Thresholding with Machine Learning Classifiers for Mapping Complex Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small reservoirs play an important role in mining, industries, and agriculture, but storage levels or stage changes are very dynamic. Accurate and up-to-date maps of surface water storage and distribution are invaluable for informing decisions relating to water security, flood monitoring, and water resources management. Satellite remote sensing is an effective way of monitoring the dynamics of surface waterbodies over large areas. The European Space Agency (ESA) has recently launched constellations of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites carrying C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and a multispectral imaging radiometer, respectively. The constellations improve global coverage of remotely sensed imagery and enable the development of near real-time operational products. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for the application of fully automatic, feasible, and accurate retrieval methods for mapping and monitoring waterbodies. The mapping of waterbodies can take advantage of the synthesis of SAR and multispectral remote sensing data in order to increase classification accuracy. This study compares automatic thresholding to machine learning, when applied to delineate waterbodies with diverse spectral and spatial characteristics. Automatic thresholding was applied to near-concurrent normalized difference water index (NDWI) (generated from S2 optical imagery) and VH backscatter features (generated from S1 SAR data). Machine learning was applied to a comprehensive set of features derived from S1 and S2 data. During our field surveys, we observed that the waterbodies visited had different sizes and varying levels of turbidity, sedimentation, and eutrophication. Five machine learning algorithms (MLAs), namely decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), random forest (RF), and two implementations of the support vector machine (SVM) were considered. Several experiments were carried out to better understand the complexities involved in mapping spectrally and spatially complex waterbodies. It was found that the combination of multispectral indices with SAR data is highly beneficial for classifying complex waterbodies and that the proposed thresholding approach classified waterbodies with an overall classification accuracy of 89.3%. However, the varying concentrations of suspended sediments (turbidity), dissolved particles, and aquatic plants negatively affected the classification accuracies of the proposed method, whereas the MLAs (SVM in particular) were less sensitive to such variations. The main disadvantage of using MLAs for operational waterbody mapping is the requirement for suitable training samples, representing both water and non-water land covers. The dynamic nature of reservoirs (many reservoirs are depleted at least once a year) makes the re-use of training data unfeasible. The study found that aggregating (combining) the thresholding results of two SAR and multispectral features, namely the S1 VH polarisation and the S2 NDWI, respectively, provided better overall accuracies than when thresholding was applied to any of the individual features considered. The accuracies of this dual thresholding technique were comparable to those of machine learning and may thus offer a viable solution for automatic mapping of waterbodies.

Contrary to this practice, this article argues that there are feasible ways of defending scientism as a set of ideologies for political reform. Rejecting an essentialist approach to scientism as well as the view that ideologies have a solely negative effect on history, it argues that the political effect of ideologies inspired by a belief system (including scientism and various religions) must be judged case by case-and that the appearance of complex politico-scientific problems such as the climate problem in effect warrants some kind of ideological scientism.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature from MODIS Dataset with Random Forest Approach over Alpine Vegetated Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated three different downscaling approaches to enhance spatial resolution of thermal imagery over Alpine vegetated areas. Due to the topographical and land-cover complexity and to the sparse distribution of meteorological stations in the region, the remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) at regional scale is of major area of interest for environmental applications. Even though the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST fills the gap regarding high temporal resolution and length of the time-series, its spatial resolution is not adequate for mountainous areas. Given this limitation, random forest algorithm for downscaling LST to 250 m spatial resolution was evaluated. This study exploits daily MODIS LST with a spatial resolution of 1 km to obtain sub-pixel information at 250 m spatial resolution. The nonlinear relationship between coarse resolution MODIS LST (CR) and fine resolution (FR) explanatory variables was performed by building three different models including: (i) all pixels (BM), (ii) only pixels with more than 90% of vegetation content (EM1) and (iii) only pixels with 75% threshold of homogeneity for vegetated land-cover classes (EM2). We considered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) as predictors. The performances of the thermal downscaling methods were evaluated by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the downscaled dataset and Landsat LST. Validation indicated that the error values for vegetation fraction (EM1, EM2) were smaller than for basic modelling (BM). BM model determined averaged RMSE of 2.3 K and MAE of 1.8 K. Enhanced methods (EM1 and EM2) gave slightly better results yielding 2.2 K and 1.7 K for RMSE and MAE, respectively. In contrast to the EMs, BM showed a reduction of 22% and 18% of RMSE and MAE respectively with regard to Landsat and the original MODIS LST. Despite some limitations, mainly due to cloud contamination effect and coarse resolution pixel heterogeneity, random forest downscaling exhibits a large potential for producing improved LST maps.

TI  - Skin Cancer: Squamous and Basal Cell Carcinomas.
T2  - FP essentials
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer during their lifetime; 97% of these cancers will be nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) comprises approximately 80% of NMSCs and most of the remainder are cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The predominant risk factor for NMSC is exposure to solar UV radiation. Skin type also plays a role, with a higher incidence of NMSCs among fairer-skinned individuals. Immunocompromise can increase the risk. Biopsy of suspicious lesions should be obtained to determine histologic subtype and guide treatment. Surgical techniques include excision, curettage and electrodessication, and Mohs micrographic surgery. Nonsurgical therapies such as topical therapy or photodynamic therapy may be used for BCC lesions if surgical techniques are not appropriate. Staging and sentinel lymph node biopsy are reserved for patients with large infiltrative lesions. The prognosis for patients with NMSC is extremely favorable. Because of the low risk of metastasis, significant morbidity or mortality is rare. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends skin examinations for all patients with NMSC at least annually. Primary interventions for prevention include counseling on reducing sun exposure, use of UV-protective clothing and sunscreen, and discouragement of tanning bed use.

AB  - The materials on the History of Buddhism in Kalmykia expand the research into specifically Buddhist art represented by the work of author S.G. Batyreva. There is distinctive spirituality with its own nature in the canonic figures dating back to Tibetan artistic tradition. Local style of the old-Kalmyk art is manifested both in individual formal details of the image in the figures overall aesthetic interpretation expressing the groups' worldview. The canonization of folklore characters followed by the introduction of brands, symbolic attributes and the appearance of emphasized symmetrical frontal composition is particularly noticeable in the initial stage of the assimilation of Buddhism. Generally in Kalmyk tradition laconic, poorly developed (in terms of the plot) symmetric scenes prevail, expressing tendency to the emphasized personification of the main character, which is the icon's center and the object of worship for believers.

TI  - Estimating soil water characteristic curve using landscape features and soil thermal properties
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is a very important soil function with several environmental applications. Using pedotransfer functions as a quick and easy way to estimate the SWCC has been proposed to avoid its difficult and time-consuming measurements. Although numerous studies have been conducted on pedotransfer functions, the use of landscape features and soil thermal properties as predictors to estimate SWCC has received little attention. Therefore, in this study, the landscape data and soil thermal properties were used as predictors to estimate SWCC. We used 157 soil samples collected from an area within the central part of the U.S. Great Plains by Mohanty et al. (2002). By developing pedotransfer functions, SWCC was estimated using the landscape features and soil thermal properties in 21 pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Splitting the data, 100 and 57 soil samples were used for training and testing, respectively. The results showed that the landscape and geographic data did not provide an accurate estimate of the SWCC, while the soil thermal properties were very effective in the estimation of SWCC. Such a result may be due to the effect of soil textural and structural properties on both soil moisture and thermal properties. Also, comparing the results of the PTFs of this study and those of previously developed PTFs confirmed the superiority of the PTFs developed in this study.

TI  - The spectrum of benign dermal dendritic melanocytic proliferations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Dermal melanocytoses (DMs) comprise a heterogeneous group of benign lesions, located on skin and mucous membranes, characterized by dendritic melanocytes in the dermis. Although they share common histopathological features, some variants may present only as bluish or grey patches, some only as papules/nodules/plaques and others may show combination of all of these lesions. Despite the fact that blue naevus (BN) is typically characterized with papulonodular lesions, its variants may show all of the aforementioned presentations. Mongolian spot, naevus of Ota and naevus of Ito are patchy DMs distinguished by their specific localizations. Apart from these classical forms, many atypical variants without unique clinicopathological characteristics have been described in the literature making the nomenclature of DMs more complicated. However, congenital dermal melanocytosis and acquired dermal melanocytosis seem to be crucial umbrella terms that encompass all patchy DMs in atypical locations. Papules or subcutaneous nodules on patchy lesions and association of epidermal pigmentation presenting as brownish patches may be encountered as rare features of DMs. On the other hand, delayed-onset subcutaneous nodules may be typical presentations of melanoma in patchy DMs; therefore, they deserve special attention. Large plaque-type BN with subcutaneous cellular nodules is a newly described entity, harbouring clinical features of various DMs together and has a high risk of melanoma. The whole spectrum of dermal dendritic melanocytic proliferations is discussed including novelties and controversial issues.

TI  - SUHI analysis using Local Climate Zones-A comparison of 50 cities
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) has been hampered by the lack of a consistent framework to permit consistent interpretation between cities. Local Climate Zones (LCZ) are a universal description of local scale landscape types based on expected variation at neighbourhood scale (>= 1km(2)) in and around cities. In this study, we investigate the suitability of the LCZ scheme for SUHI studies based on 50 cities from across the globe. For comparability we use an annual temperature cycle model for MODIS land surface temperature (LST) at different overpass times and multi-year mean Landsat 8 LST. The SUHI analysis shows significant differences in the intra-urban estimate of SUHI for different built LCZ types. Substantial variability of SUHI within LCZ classes and between cities exists and SUHI patterns vary by time of day. Landsat derived estimates have very high correlations to those from MODIS at a similar time. The use of an LCZ approach combined with annual SUHI estimates provides a promising approach for a consistent and comprehensive SUHI analysis framework subject to further work to assess the spatial scale of matching LST and LCZ data, filter for topographic effects, and include the phenological status.

TI  - Comparison of satellite reflectance algorithms for estimating turbidity and cyanobacterial concentrations in productive freshwaters using hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident surface observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed 37 satellite reflectance algorithms and 321 variants for five satellites for estimating turbidity in a freshwater inland lake in Ohio using coincident real hyperspectral aircraft imagery converted to relative reflectance and dense coincident surface observations. This study is part of an effort to develop simple proxies for turbidity and algal blooms and to evaluate their performance and portability between satellite imagers for regional operational turbidity and algal bloom monitoring. Turbidity algorithms were then applied to synthetic satellite images and compared to in situ measurements of turbidity, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS) and phycocyanin as an indicator of cyanobacterial/blue green algal (BGA) abundance. Several turbidity algorithms worked well with real Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and synthetic WorldView-2, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3/MERIS/OLCI imagery. A simple red band algorithm for MODIS imagery and a new fluorescence line height algorithm for Landsat-8 imagery had limited performance with regard to turbidity estimation. Blue-Green Algae/Phycocyanin (BGA/PC) and Chl-a algorithms were the most widely applicable algorithms for turbidity estimation because strong co-variance of turbidity, TSS, Chl-a, and BGA made them mutual proxies in this experiment.

TI  - Atmospheric Forcing of Coastal Upwelling in the Southern Baltic Sea Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the atmospheric forcing of upwelling occurrence along differently oriented coastlines of the southern Baltic Sea basin. The mean daily sea surface temperature (SST) data from the summer seasons (June-August) of the years 1982-2017 made the basis for the detection of upwelling cases. For the atmospheric part of the analysis, monthly indices of four macroscale circulation patterns were used: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Scandinavian (SCAND), East Atlantic (EA) and East Atlantic/Western Russia (EATL/WRUS). In order to identify the local airflows and wind conditions, zonal and meridional regional circulation indices were constructed and introduced to the analysis. Within the southern Baltic Sea basin, upwelling occurs most frequently along the zonally oriented southern coasts of Sweden, and least frequently along the southern (Polish) and eastern (Lithuanian-Latvian) coasts. Among the macroscale circulation patterns, the SCAND has the strongest impact on the horizontal flow of surface sea waters in the southern Baltic, which triggers upwelling. The summer NAO and EA appeared to have a weak effect on upwelling occurrence, and EATL/WRUS have the smallest impact. Local circulation indices allowed us to recognize the atmospheric control of upwelling frequency better than the indices of the macroscale patterns. Anomalies in upwelling frequency are their highest at the positive/negative phase of the zonal circulation, particularly along the southern and eastern coast of the southern Baltic Sea basin.

TI  - The Dialect Dictionary as a Kind of Supertext
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a hypothesis according to which the dialect dictionary, which combines the attributes of explanatory and encyclopedic dictionaries, is qualified as a supertext of a special type. The problem is examined on the basis of the following lexicographic source: Slovar' russkikh starozhil'cheskikh govorov yuga Tyumenskoy oblasti: v 2 t. [Dictionary of Russian old-timer dialects of the south of Tyumen Oblast: in 2 vols] [11]. The analysis of the dictionary integrity is based on the concept of "super-text", existing in the Russian science in its literary and linguistic interpretation.The presented analysis of the dialect lexicographic work has allowed to come to the following conclusions. This dictionary, as well as ones similar to it, can be qualified as a special supertext. It consists of the same-type texts (dictionary entries), it has a coherence (integrity) with a spatial and temporal dimension. The dictionary reflects the generalized personality of the dialect speaker with his/her moral attitudes and life values and at the same time it has a cross-personality.The interpretation of the dialect vocabulary as a supertext gives the opportunity to come to a conclusion about the worldview categories of the generalized speaker of the studied dialect. Some of the categories are passeism, non-agentivity, special aspects of personal space reflection, the communicative "modesty tactics" which reflects naive fatalism and a tendency not to blend in, stereotyped behavior, accuracy and detailed description of the object in the case of verbal communication.In such texts, both thematic and modal commonness is manifested, allowing to combine them into "quasi-texts" in order to describe their modality more accurately. In this case, the degree of the coherence is not as high as that of other types of supertexts.Another specificity of this kind of supertext is the communicative framework peculiarity, i.e. reflecting the positions of the collective addresser and addressee, the dual nature of the former. Under these circumstances, the compilers of the dictionary and the addressee definitely perceive the text as something integral. This is a conditionally closed supertext with a significant degree of structural certainty, in spite of the fact that its components are not texts, but textoids. However, their systemic qualities allow to see the model of a whole in them - the dictionary supertext. Both formal and substantive criteria provide a basis for classifying the dictionary as a class of supertexts taking into account its specifics. Further consideration of the dialect dictionary as a supertext implies its ideographic interpretation.

TI  - Structural and functional characterization of the dry forest in central Argentine Chaco
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we studied the composition, structure and functioning of the woody vegetation of a 1000-ha area of the Central Argentine Chaco. First, we identified, through Landsat satellite image processing, three different vegetation classes: two forest types and a savanna. Each class was field surveyed to analyze the composition and structure of the woody plant community. Functioning was assessed through the enhanced vegetation index - a proxy of productivity - obtained from the MODIS sensor. The forest classes showed no differences in composition but some differences in structural attributes, particularly in the density of the dominant tree species in the area, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco. As expected, the savanna showed less density and basal area of woody plants, with a relative high proportion of tree species seedlings and heliophilous shrubs. The forest class with less density of A. quebracho-blanco presented higher productivity. This could be related to a higher ability of the shrub layer to intercept radiation because shrubs are under an open canopy, as has been noted for early successional stages. Additionally, we found that annual mean productivity for the three classes showed a negative trend in the period 2000-2014. Our results provide valuable information since there are no studies addressing relationships between structural and functional attributes at local level in the Chaco Region.

AB  - In modern times humanity is facing a crisis in many spheres, the spiritual and moral one being most urgent. Resort to the ethnocultural tradition based on the ethical-aesthetic ideas, local customary practices and traditional (adat) laws seems most effective to overcome the crisis phenomena. In this connection, the preservation of ethnocultural identity comes to the fore. The leading feature of modern literature is the interest to ethnic self-identity as a defensive reaction to globalization and leveling of the individual's self-categorization. Emotive prose and poetry by Adyghe and Karachay-Balkarian authors have been analyzed in the article with the view of determining the forms of manifestation of the heroes' ethnic identity, establishing the role of traditional concepts and archetypical ideas in the formation of the ethnic self-categorization and the development of their worldview.

TI  - A Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM) for Use over Diverse Land Surfaces Using Multi-Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance (SR) estimation is the most critical preprocessing step for deriving geophysical parameters in multi-sensor remote sensing. Most state-of-the-art SR estimation methods, such as the vector version of the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV) radiative transfer (RT) model, depend on accurate information on aerosol and atmospheric gases. In this study, a Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM) based on the equations from 6SV RT model, without integrating information of aerosol particles and atmospheric gasses, is proposed and tested using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data from 2000 to 2018. For evaluation purposes, (i) the SREM SR retrievals are validated against in situ SR measurements collected by Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) from the South Dakota State University (SDSU) site, USA; (ii) cross-comparison between the SREM and Landsat spectral SR products, i.e., Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) and Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC), are conducted over 11 urban (2013-2018), 13 vegetated (2013-2018), and 11 desert/arid (2000 to 2018) sites located over different climatic zones at a global scale; (iii) the performance of the SREM spectral SR retrievals for low to high aerosol loadings is evaluated; (iv) spatio-temporal cross-comparison is conducted for six Landsat paths/rows located in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States of America from 2013 to 2018 to consider a large variety of land surfaces and atmospheric conditions; (v) cross-comparison is also performed for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) calculated from both the SREM and Landsat SR data; (vi) the SREM is also applied to the Sentinel-2A and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data to explore its applicability; and (vii) errors in the SR retrievals are reported using the mean bias error (MBE), root mean squared deviation (RMSD), and mean systematic error (MSE). Results depict significant and strong positive Pearson's correlation (r), small MBE, RMSD, and MSE for each spectral band against in situ ASD data and Landsat (LEDAPS and LaSRC) SR products. Consistency in SREM performance against Sentinel-2A (r = 0.994, MBE = -0.009, and RMSD = 0.014) and MODIS (r = 0.925, MBE = 0.007, and RMSD = 0.014) data suggests that SREM can be applied to other multispectral satellites data. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential and promise of SREM for use over diverse surfaces and under varying atmospheric conditions using multi-sensor data on a global scale.

TI  - The impact of phytoplankton community composition on optical properties and satellite observations of the 2017 western Lake Erie algal bloom
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the early 2000s Lake Erie has seen a dramatic increase in phytoplankton biomass, manifested in particular by the rise in the severity of cyanobacteria blooms and the prevalence of potentially toxic taxa such as Microcystis. Satellite remote sensing has provided a unique capacity for the synoptic detection of these blooms, enabling spatial and temporal trends in their extent and severity to be documented. Algorithms for satellite detection of Lake Erie algal blooms often rely on a single consistent relationship between algal or cyanobacterial biomass and spectral indices such as the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) or Cyanobacteria Index (CI). Blooms, however, are known to vary significantly in community composition over space and time. A suite of phytoplankton and optical property measurements during the western Lake Erie algal bloom of 2017 showed highly diverse bloom composition with variable absorption and backscatter properties. Elevated backscattering coefficients were observed in the Maumee Bay, likely due to phytoplankton cell morphology and buoyancy regulating gas vacuoles, compared with typically Planktothrix dominated blooms in Sandusky Bay. MCI and CI calibrated to historical chlorophyll observations and applied to Sentinel 3's OLCI sensor accurately captured the 2017 bloom in Maumee Bay but underestimated the Sandusky Bay bloom by nearly 80%. The phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria Aphanothece and Synechococcus were found in abundance throughout the western and central basins, resulting in substantial biomass underestimations using blue to green ratio-based algorithms. Potential misrepresentation of bloom severity resulting from phytoplankton optical properties should be considered in assessments of bloom conditions on Lake Erie.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Whilst theorists in physics have been striving for a 'theory of everything' to explain the interconnections of matter across time and space (Hawking, 2006), western social theories are largely segmented and situated within a limited scope of time and space with little attention to the multiple dimensions of reality that western physics and indigenous knowledge have already validated (Blackstock, 2009a,b). Ten years ago, I developed the Breath of Life theory (Blackstock, 2011) to provoke a conversation about Indigenous ontological approaches that place human experience in an interconnected web of reality across time, space and dimensions of reality. The overall goal was to engage other theorists into the communal building of a 'theory of everything' to inform social sciences and to highlight the richness of Indigenous ontology and epistemology. This article revisits the Breath of Life theory and argues that a greater emphasis on equity within and between the relational worldview principles (Cross, 2007) would be a useful modification.

T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageUsing a combination of remote sensing data,Pinus pinasterAit. andPinus pineaL. were distinguished at individual tree level in mixed Mediterranean stands with over 95% accuracy. This approach is easily applicable over large areas, enhancing the economic value of non-wood forest products, stone pine nuts, and resin, and aiding forest managers to accurately predict this production.ContextThe discrimination of tree species at individual level in mixed Mediterranean forest based on remote sensing is a field which has gained greater importance. In these stands, the capacity to predict the quality and quantity of non-wood forest products is particularly important due to the very different goods the two species produce.AimsTo assess the potential of using low-density airborne LiDAR data combined with high-resolution Pleiades images to discriminate two different pine species in mixed Mediterranean forest (Pinus pinea L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.) at individual tree level.MethodsA Random Forest model was trained using plots from the pure stand dataset, determining which LiDAR and satellite variables allow us to obtain better discrimination between groups. The model constructed was then validated by classifying individuals in an independent set of pure and mixed stands.ResultsThe model combining LiDAR and Pleiades data provided greater accuracy (83.3% and 63% in pure and mixed validation stands, respectively) than the models which only use one type of covariables.ConclusionThe automatic crown delineation tool developed allows two very similar species in mixed Mediterranean conifer forest to be discriminated using continuous spatial information at the surface: Pleiades images and open source LiDAR data. This approach is easily applicable over large areas, enhancing the economic value of non-wood forest products and aiding forest managers to accurately predict production.

TI  - Low-volume disease in endometrial cancer: The role of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nodal assessment represents an integral part of staging procedure for endometrial cancer. The widespread diffusion of sentinel node mapping determinates a phenomenon of migration from stage I to stage III disease, especially for low-risk endometrial cancer patients. The adoption of sentinel node mapping and pathological ultrastaging increase the detection of low volume disease (i.e., micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells), being low volume disease detected in >30% of patients with positive nodes. The prognostic role of low volume disease is discussed as well as the possible adjuvant strategies for patients diagnosed with micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells. The role of further prospective treatments in endometrial cancer, including molecular and genetic profiling, is critically reviewed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping vs. lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node mapping is increasingly being utilized for endometrial cancer staging. However, only limited evidence supporting the adoption of sentinel node mapping instead of conventional lymphadenectomy is still available. Here, we aimed to review the current evidence comparing sentinel node mapping and lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer staging. This systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Six comparative studies were included. Overall, 3536 patients were included: 1249 (35.3%) and 2287 (64.7%), undergoing sentinel node mapping and lymphadenectomy, respectively. Pooled data suggested that positive pelvic nodes were detected in 184 out of 1249 (14.7%) patients having sentinel node mapping and 228 out of 2287 (9.9%) patients having lymphadenectomy (OR: 2.03; (95%CI: 1.30 to 3.18); p = 0.002). No difference in detection of positive nodes located in the paraaortic was observed (OR: 93 (95% CI: 0.39 to 2.18); p = 0.86). Overall recurrence rate was 43% and 73% after sentinel node mapping and lymphadenectomy, respectively (OR: 0.90 (95%CI: 0.58 to 1.38); p = 0.63). Similarly, nodal recurrences were statistically similar between groups (1.2% vs. 1.7%; OR: 1.51 (95%CI: 0.70 to 329); p = 0.29). In conclusion, our meta-analysis underlines that sentinel node mapping is non-inferior to standard lymphadenectomy in term of detection of paraaortic nodal involvement and recurrence rates (any site and nodal recurrence); while, focusing on the ability to detect positive pelvic nodes, sentinel node mapping could be consider superior to lymphadenectomy. Further randomized studies are needed to asses long term effectiveness of sentinel node mapping. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

TI  - Comet assay in ecogenotoxicology: Applications in <i>Mytilus</i> sp
T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Review
AB  - The comet assay is a sensitive technique to detect DNA damage caused by exposure to genotoxic chemical and physical agents and is widely used in ecotoxicology. The assay has been applied in aquatic species, mainly fish and bivalves, in field biomonitoring programs and in experimental studies. The aim of the present study was to retrieve and review the published evidence to define the role of the comet assay in the assessment of genotoxic pollutants. The study focused on the application of the test in Willis sp, used as a sentinel organism. Twenty-one biomonitoring studies, carried out in wild and in transplanted mussels, were evaluated. An increase of the comet parameters in animals from polluted areas with respect to the controls was observed in the majority of the studies with a large variability (frequency ratio:1.2-14.5) associated with types and extent of exposure to pollutants. Three studies out of 21 reported a lack of response. Heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides were the main types of chemicals detected in sediments and/or mussel tissues from polluted areas. Twenty-nine laboratory studies were retrieved showing the sensitivity of the comet assay in detecting DNA damage in mussels exposed to the most relevant pollutants and mixtures of relevant contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, anti-fouling agents or crude oil. The comet test also appeared to be a suitable approach to detect the genotoxic effects of nanoparticles. In some studies problems in the interpretation of data or discrepancies between the results from different laboratories were noted. Critical steps in experimental protocol and characterization of pollution, environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, food availability, physiological and pathological status of the animals are important factors which should be controlled and considered in the analysis of the results.

TI  - Methods for tree cover extraction from high resolution orthophotos and airborne LiDAR scanning in Spanish <i>dehesas</i>
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dehesas are high value agroecosystems that benefit from the effect tree cover has on pastures. Such effect occurs when tree cover is incomplete and homogeneous. Tree cover may be characterized from field data or through visual interpretation of remote sensing data, both time-consuming tasks. An alternative is the extraction of tree cover from aerial imagery using automated methods, on spectral derivate products (i.e. NDVI) or LiDAR point clouds. This study focuses on assessing and comparing methods for tree cover estimation from high resolution orthophotos and airborne laser scanning (ALS). RGB image processing based on thresholding of the 'Excess Green minus Excess Red' index with the Otsu method produced acceptable results (80%), lower than that obtained by thresholding the digital canopy model obtained from the ALS data (87%) or when combining RGB and LiDAR data (87.5%). The RGB information was found to be useful for tree delineation, although very vulnerable to confusion with the grass or shrubs. The ALS based extraction suffered for less confusion as it differentiated between trees and the remaining vegetation using the height. These results show that analysis of historical orthophotographs may be successfully used to evaluate the effects of management changes while LiDAR data may provide a substantial increase in the accuracy for the latter period. Combining RGB and Lidar data did not result in significant improvements over using LIDAR data alone.

TI  - Audit Policies Under the Sentinel Effect: Deterrence-Driven Algorithms
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fraud, waste, and abuse are significant problems in major industries such as healthcare, particularly when third-party payers such as Medicare are involved. Auditors looking for fraudulent activities use scoring models to select practitioners or claims that are likely to be fraudulent. In addition to the direct benefits of the audit effect, which evokes a response by auditing fraudulent individuals, the sentinel effect provides second-order benefits. Yet current auditing algorithms do not take the sentinel effect into account. In this paper, we present an algorithm that supports a deterrence-driven audit approach in the presence of audit and sentinel effects. Our results indicate that a significant reduction in healthcare excess costs can be achieved, while maintaining fairness, when auditing policies take sentinel effects into account.

TI  - Comparison of Hyperspectral Techniques for Urban Tree Diversity Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to assess the capabilities of Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) hyperspectral satellite data in order to discriminate urban tree diversity. Four dimension reduction methods and two classifiers are tested, using two learning methods and applied with four in situ sample datasets. An airborne HySpex image (408 bands/2 m) was acquired in July 2015 from which prototypal spaceborne hyperspectral images (named HYPXIM) at 4 m and 8 m and a multispectral Sentinel2 image at 10 m have been simulated for the purpose of this study. A comparison is made using these methods and datasets. The influence of dimension reduction methods is assessed on hyperspectral (HySpex and HYPXIM) and Sentinel2 datasets. The influence of conventional classifiers (Support Vector Machine -SVM- and Random Forest -RF-) and learning methods is evaluated on all image datasets (reduced and non-reduced hyperspectral and Sentinel2 datasets). Results show that HYPXIM 4 m and HySpex 2 m reduced by Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) provide the greatest classification of 14 species using the SVM with an overall accuracy of 78.4% (+/- 1.5) and a kappa index of agreement of 0.7. More generally, the learning methods have a stronger influence than classifiers, or even than dimensional reduction methods, on urban tree diversity classification. Prototypal HYPXIM images appear to present a great compromise (192 spectral bands/4 m resolution) for urban vegetation applications compared to HySpex or Sentinel2 images.

TI  - The Application of 1% Methylene Blue Dye As a Single Technique in Breast Cancer Sentinel Node Biopsy
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we injected 1% methylene blue dye (MBD) into the subareolar or peritumoral space of the breast. In the case of breast conserving surgery (BCS), a separate incision in the lower axilla hairline was made to find the sentinel nodes (SNs). In mastectomy, the SNs were identified through the same mastectomy incision. The SNs were described as blue nodes or nodes with lymphatic blue channels. An anatomical landmark in the axilla was used to facilitate SNs identification. The SNs metastases were evaluated by intraoperative frozen section analysis and histopathology examination as it is a gold standard. Here, we described the MBD as the lone technique in breast cancer sentinel node biopsy (SNB) which could be useful when radioisotope tracer or patent or isosulfan blue dye (PBD) cannot be provided.

T2  - MITOLOGIAS HOY-REVISTA DE PENSAMIENTO CRITICA Y ESTUDIOS LITERARIOS LATINOAMERICANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Abakua secret societies have historically been associated with crime and delinquency within the Cuban national identity. A careful look reveals, however, the need to rethink the nature of these societies of mutual aid based on a complex mythical-religious universe. Building on Sikan's genesis myth, they present an unique worldview within the spectrum of Afro-Cuban cults, including the Abakua cult. The following essay explores the function of this myth and the Abakua presence in texts by Alejo Carpentier and Lydia Cabrera, and their relationship with a generic hybridity marked by ethnographic and literary elements. With this purpose, this work is oriented towards the examination and deconstruction of literary representations of the black presence in Cuba and its effects on the configuration of the literary work.

T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ImportanceThe lymphatic and the hematogenous pathways have been proposed for disease progression in cutaneous melanoma, but association with recurrence has not been studied separately to date. ObjectiveTo identify the risk factors associated with lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective cohort study included 1177 patients with malignant melanoma treated at Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. Data were retrieved from the melanoma database from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2015, and analyzed from June 1 to 30, 2018. ExposureMalignant melanoma at stages I to II. Main Outcomes and MeasuresAnalyses of survival free of lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. ResultsFor the 1177 patients included in the study analysis (51.1% women; median age at diagnosis, 55 years [interquartile range, 42-68 years), median follow-up was 75 months (interquartile range, 33-121 months); 108 (9.2%) developed lymphatic metastasis, and 108 (9.2%) developed hematogenous metastasis. In the multivariate analysis, being older than 55 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1), tumor in the head/neck (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9) and acral locations (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5), greater Breslow thickness (HR for >4.00 mm, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.4-12.4), and presence of vascular invasion (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 0.9-10.6) were associated with lymphatic spreading. Hematogenous metastasis was associated with greater Breslow thickness (HR for >4.00 mm, 10.4; 95% CI, 3.6-29.7), the absence of regression (HR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0), TERT promoter mutations (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), and BRAF mutations (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.6). Conclusions and RelevanceRisk factors associated with lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis differ. Follow-up and adjuvant treatment strategies may therefore need to be adapted to individual clinical, histopathologic, and molecular characteristics.

Starting from the category called "Prehispanic Mythical Gothic", the concept of terror is analyzed, together with the symbolic dimension explicit in the Amerindian mythical motives and worldview. This study proposes prehispanic myth as the originator and organizer of the literary matter of these selected stories and establishes, from them, a connection to other Latin American texts that share this same aesthetic vision.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerated retreat of glaciers and the reduction of glacier ice reserves caused by climate change can significantly affect regional water resources and hydrological cycles. Changes in glacier thickness are among the key indicators that reflect this process. We analyzed changes observed in the elevation of glacier surfaces in the Gongga Mountains (GGM) using multi-temporal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from topographic maps, SRTM, ICESat and ZY-3 data. The results showed that the mean rate of change in glacier surface altitude in the GGM was similar to-26.7 +/- 2.03 m (0.54 +/- 0.04 m a(-1)) between 1966 and 2015. The mean melt rates differed over different time periods, latterly showing an accelerating trend. As a general rule, glaciers appear to be losing more volume at lower than at higher elevations. Further analysis of these results suggests that supraglacial debris coverage in the GGM promotes higher rates of mass loss.

T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextAn increased interest in the restoration of peatlands for delivering multiple benefits requires a greater understanding of the extent and location of natural and artificial features that contribute to degradation.ObjectivesWe assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas.MethodsAirborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area.ResultsUsing fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29km(2) or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded.ConclusionsUsing a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring.

T2  - MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Redox stress is a well-known contributor to aging and diseases in skin. Reductants such as dithiothreitol (DTT) can trigger a stress response by disrupting disulfide bonds. However, the quantitative response of the cellular proteome to reductants has not been explored, particularly in cells such as fibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we have used a robust, unbiased, label-free SWATH-MS proteomic approach to quantitate the response of skin fibroblast cells to DTT in the presence or absence of the growth factor PDGF. Of the 4487 proteins identified, only 42 proteins showed a statistically significant change of 2-fold or more with reductive stress. Our proteomics data show that reductive stress results in the loss of a small subset of reductant-sensitive proteins (including the collagens COL1A1/2 and COL3A1, and the myopathy-associated collagens COL6A1/2/3), and the down-regulation of targets downstream of the MAPK pathway. We show that a reducing environment alters signaling through the PDGF-associated MAPK/Akt pathways, inducing chronic dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in a growth factor-independent manner. Our data highlights collagens as sentinel molecules for redox stress downstream of MAPK/Akt, and identifies intervention points to modulate the redox environment to target skin diseases and conditions associated with erroneous matrix deposition.

Our data highlights collagens as sentinel molecules for redox stress downstream of MAPK/Akt, and identifies intervention points to modulate the redox environment to target skin diseases and conditions associated with erroneous matrix deposition.

TI  - Reductive Stress Selectively Disrupts Collagen Homeostasis and Modifies Growth Factor-independent Signaling Through the MAPK/Akt Pathway in Human Dermal Fibroblasts.
T2  - Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Redox stress is a well-known contributor to aging and diseases in skin. Reductants such as dithiothreitol (DTT) can trigger a stress response by disrupting disulfide bonds. However, the quantitative response of the cellular proteome to reductants has not been explored, particularly in cells such as fibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we have used a robust, unbiased, label-free SWATH-MS proteomic approach to quantitate the response of skin fibroblast cells to DTT in the presence or absence of the growth factor PDGF. Of the 4487 proteins identified, only 42 proteins showed a statistically significant change of 2-fold or more with reductive stress. Our proteomics data show that reductive stress results in the loss of a small subset of reductant-sensitive proteins (including the collagens COL1A1/2 and COL3A1, and the myopathy-associated collagens COL6A1/2/3), and the down-regulation of targets downstream of the MAPK pathway. We show that a reducing environment alters signaling through the PDGF-associated MAPK/Akt pathways, inducing chronic dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in a growth factor-independent manner. Our data highlights collagens as sentinel molecules for redox stress downstream of MAPK/Akt, and identifies intervention points to modulate the redox environment to target skin diseases and conditions associated with erroneous matrix deposition.

TI  - Gentoo penguins as sentinels of climate change at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Archipelago, Southern Ocean
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some upper trophic level predators, such as marine mammals, seabirds and large predatory fish have been shown to be useful sentinels for marine ecosystems. Through their demography, diet and foraging behaviour, ecosystem changes associated with climate change can be monitored. The local marine ecosystem at the Prince Edward Archipelago in the Southern Indian Ocean is heavily influenced by the position of the dynamic sub-Antarctic front (SAF) that varies inter-annually in terms of its influence on the local environment. If the SAF migrates southwards, as climate change models have predicted, the abundance of autochthonous and allochthonous prey found within the vicinity of the archipelago will decrease and increase, respectively. We investigated the diet of an inshore forager at the archipelago, the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, as a possible sentinel to the expected changes in the prey assemblages in local waters, due to the southward migration of the SAF. We collected stomach content samples from gentoo penguins, using the water off-loading technique, monthly over three years (1994-1996) and then annually during 2012, 2014 and 2015. Prey assemblages within the diet was found to coincide with the proximity of the SAF to the Prince Edward Archipelago as well as the annual life cycles of prey. Due to the plasticity these penguins exhibit in their diet and foraging behaviour, we suggest that they are important sentinel species for the local marine ecosystem of the Prince Edward Archipelago. Regular sample collection from these birds, albeit stomach content samples and/or tissues for stable isotope analysis, should be collected so that variability in the ecosystem can be easily monitored.

TI  - Evaluation of ten machine learning methods for estimating terrestrial evapotranspiration from remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration (ET), or surface latent heat exchange (LE), is of great utility for many applications. Machine learning (ML) methods have been extensively used in many disciplines, but so far little work has been performed systematically comparing ML methods for ET retrieval. This paper provides an evaluation of ten ML methods for estimating daily ET based on daily Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) radiation data and high-level Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) data products and ground measured ET data from 184 flux tower sites. Measurements of accuracy (RMSE, R-2, and bias) and run time were made for each of ten ML methods with a smaller training data set (n = 7910 data points) and a larger training data set (n = 69,752 data points). Inclusion of more input variables improved algorithm performance but had little effect on run time. The best results were obtained with the larger training data set using the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) regression tree (validation RMSE = 19.91 W/m(2)) and three hidden layer neural network (validation RMSE = 20.94 W/m(2)), although the less computationally demanding random kernel (RKS) algorithm also produced good results (validation RMSE = 22.22 W/m(2)). Comparison of results from sites with different ecosystem types showed the best results for evergreen, shrub, and grassland sites, and the weakest results for wetland sites. Generally, performance was not improved by training with data from only the same ecosystem type.

TI  - Ricoeur on Truth in Religious Discourse: A Reclamation
T2  - HORIZONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fields of comparative theology and interreligious dialogue have largely presupposed the possibility of interreligious learning, but there have been few attempts to provide a philosophical framework for such learning. Utilizing the philosophical hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur, I argue that evaluations of religious truth should be understood holistically and contextually. In interreligious engagements, tensions are created in and questions are raised for one's own worldview. If one proceeds to imaginatively enter into another's worldview and finds resources there that enable one to alleviate those tensions and answer those questions, as well as make sense of one's reality in a broad way, then one may properly deem such beliefs to be true. Interreligious learning is thus construed as the recognition of truth that enables one to productively orient oneself to reality. The result is a provisional philosophical framework for understanding religious truth and interreligious learning.

TI  - Hyperechoic Abdominal Fat A Sentinel Sign of Inflammation
T2  - ULTRASOUND QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most useful sonographic signs of acute abdominal inflammation is the identification of increased echogenicity of the surrounding fat. Hyperechoic fat results from vasodilation and edema extending from an adjacent source of infection or inflammation. These changes are mediated by such factors such as bradykinin, histamine, and various cytokines. The recognition of hyperechoic fat on sonography may be an important indicator of the primary source of pathology. In addition, it often reflects a more advanced degree of transmural pathology, such as "walled-off" perforation of a hollow viscus. This pictorial essay will present a variety of examples of hyperechoic inflamed fat involving different abdominal organs and will illustrate the diagnostic value of this finding.

AB  - Inpatient suicide is a common sentinel event. However, evidence supporting effective inpatient suicide prevention measures is currently lacking. In this project, health care failure mode and effect analysis was used in a general hospital quality improvement process to identify suicide risk and reduce inpatient suicide behavior. Interventions were designed to improve steps in the process with the highest risk of failure, resulting in significantly higher consultation rates and reduction of attempted suicide.

TI  - Establishment and seasonal activity in New Zealand of Mastrus ridens, a gregarious ectoparasitoid of codling moth Cydia pomonella
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of Mastrus ridens Horstmann (Hym: Ichneumonidae) in New Zealand, from introductions in 2012-2015, was assessed in 2016. Two assessment techniques were used: (1) 10-cm wide corrugated cardboard trunk bands deployed throughout the summer and winter periods to catch wild codling moth larvae and their parasitoids; and (2) sentinel, laboratory reared, codling moth larvae, cocooned within narrow, 2-cm wide corrugated cardboard bands, deployed on a monthly rotation throughout the spring and summer. Trunk band recoveries showed at least a low rate of establishment of Mastrus ridens across the country. Mastrus ridens females attacked sentinel hosts from early spring (prior to pupation of wild hosts) until late autumn. This evidence for multi-voltinism (compared with one or two generations of their host) signals a potentially effective parasitoid. Four other codling moth parasitoids were also recovered frequently from either wild or sentinel codling moth larvae, with differences between regions. The extent to which they may disrupt or enhance biocontrol by M. ridens remains to be investigated.

M3  - Article
AB  - We report a fatal tracheoinnominate artery fistula (TIF) in a 13-year-old female patient with long-term tracheostomy tube dependence due to chronic respiratory failure. Thirteen years after placement of her tracheostomy tube, the patient experienced two separate episodes of sentinel bleeding prior to a fatal hemorrhagic event. Diagnostic evaluation after the sentinel events was mostly nonconclusive. This case highlights the risk of TIF in pediatric age group, even years after initial tracheostomy tube placement, and the need for a high index of suspicion for TIF when children present with unexplained tracheal bleeding.

TI  - Landsat-Based Estimation of Seasonal Water Cover and Change in Arid and Semi-Arid Central Asia (2000-2015)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is of great importance to ecosystems and economies. Crucial to understanding hydrological variability and its relationships to human activities at large scales, open-access satellite datasets and big-data computational methods are now enabling the global mapping of the distribution and changes of inland water over time. A machine-learning algorithm, previously used only to map water at single points in time, was applied over 16 years of the USGS Landsat archive to detect and map surface water over central Asia from 2000 to 2015 at a 30-m, monthly resolution. The resulting dataset had an overall classification accuracy of 99.59% (+/- 0.32% standard error), 98.24% (+/- 1.02%) user's accuracy, and 87.12% (+/- 3.21%) producer's accuracy for water class. This study describes the temporal extension of the algorithm and the application of the dataset to present patterns of regional surface water cover and change. The findings indicate that smaller water bodies are dramatically changing in two specific ecological zones: the Kazakh Steppe and the Tian Shan Montane Steppe and Meadows. Both the maximum and minimum extent of water bodies have decreased over the 16-year period, but the rate of decrease of the maxima was double that of the minima. Coverage decreased in each month from April to October, and a significant decrease in water area was found in April and May. These results indicate that the dataset can provide insights into the behavior of surface water across central Asia through time, and that the method can be further developed for regional and global applications.

TI  - Application of satellite altimetry in understanding river-wetland flow interactions of Kosi river
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood-plain wetlands are the seasonal water bodies formed along a river. These wetlands become active during the monsoon season, which frequently grow in size with seasonal floods and eventually dry up during the non-monsoon season. The flow interaction between flood-plain wetlands and the river sometimes vary over a very short period in response to rapid rise in the river water level due to high precipitation in its upstream catchment. Understanding the complex flow interactions between the river and its associated flood-plain wetlands with field-based measurements of wetland hydrologic characteristics is always a challenging task. To overcome these challenges, an attempt has been made to utilise Topex/Poseidon satellite altimetry-derived water levels into a hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS) to study river and wetland flow interactions in the lower reach of the Kosi river in India. The satellite altimetry-derived water levels and Landsat satellite images on the Kosi wetlands are used to develop volume-elevation relation. HEC-RAS is setup over the study area and calibrated for different values of manning's roughness coefficient (n) for the river bank and the main channel of the river for the period of 1993-1996. Unsteady flow simulations are carried out for different monsoon seasons to simulate daily river flow interaction (inflow/outflow) between river and wetlands. Statistical analysis is performed between the altimetry-derived and the model-simulated water levels. It is found that simulated water levels are in good agreement (R2=0.87, root mean square error of 0.84m and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.85) with altimetry-derived water levels. The analysis of simulations indicates that interactions between the wetland and the river are bidirectional with most of the flow coming out from the river during the month of August and leaving out from the wetlands during the month of September. The wetlands respond in three different ways, i.e., (i) gaining stage, (ii) wetland and river in equilibrium and (iii) loosing stage, which is reflected on water levels of the river and wetland. This study demonstrates complex interaction processes happening between the Kosi river and its surrounding wetlands.

TI  - Seasonal climatic effects and feedbacks of anthropogenic heat release due to global energy consumption with CAM5
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat release (AHR) is the heat generated in global energy consumption, which has not been considered in global climate models generally. The global high-resolution AHR from 1992 to 2013, which is estimated by using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) satellite data, is implemented into the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). The seasonal climatic effects and possible feedbacks of AHR are examined in this study. The modeling results show that AHR increases the global annual mean surface temperature and land surface temperature by 0.02 +/- 0.01K (1 sigma uncertainty) and 0.05 +/- 0.02K (1 sigma uncertainty), respectively. The global climatic effect of AHR varies with season: with a stronger climatic effect in the boreal winter leading to global mean land surface temperature increases by 0.10 +/- 0.01K (1 sigma uncertainty). In the selected regions (40 degrees N-60 degrees N, 0 degrees E-45 degrees E) of Central and Western Europe the average surface temperature increases by 0.46K in the boreal summer, and in the selected regions (45 degrees N-75 degrees N, 30 degrees E-140 degrees E) of northern Eurasia the average surface temperature increases by 0.83K in the boreal winter. AHR changes the height and thermodynamic structure of the global planetary boundary layer, as well as the stability of the lower troposphere, which affects the global atmospheric circulation and low cloud fraction. In addition, at the surface both the shortwave radiation flux in the boreal summer and the down-welling longwave flux in the boreal winter change significantly, as a result of the change in low clouds caused by the effect of AHR. This study suggests a possible new mechanism of AHR effect on global climate through changing the global low-cloud fraction, which is crucial for global energy balance, by modifying the thermodynamic structure and stability of the lower troposphere. Thus this study improves our understanding of the global climate change caused by human activities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FUTURES STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research proposes sustainability-oriented foresight education as a transformative intervention for societies genuinely seeking to create economic and ecological well being for future generations. Taiwan has started to enter a critical stage in developing a more environmentally-minded and futures-oriented worldview. While related prior research mostly emphasizes macro-level institutional change, this study focuses on evaluating the possibilities for encouraging sustainability-consciousness among young citizens through higher education. Students of the course "Environmental Changes and Sustainable Futures" were the participants in a quasi-experimental research design with pre- and post-measurements, and using participatory learning, reflective journals, and scenario workshops as the tools of pedagogical intervention. The results suggest that through a process of integrative learning, a culture of forward-thinking and visioning for sustainable alternative futures is emerging. Most importantly, student participants show promise as potential change agents for creating alternative environmental values and sustainable behaviors.

TI  - A New Deep Learning Algorithm for SAR Scene Classification Based on Spatial Statistical Modeling and Features Re-Calibration
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scene classification is challenging but widely applied, in which deep learning can play a pivotal role because of its hierarchical feature learning ability. In the paper, we propose a new scene classification framework, named Feature Recalibration Network with Multi-scale Spatial Features (FRN-MSF), to achieve high accuracy in SAR-based scene classification. First, a Multi-Scale Omnidirectional Gaussian Derivative Filter (MSOGDF) is constructed. Then, Multi-scale Spatial Features (MSF) of SAR scenes are generated by weighting MSOGDF, a Gray Level Gradient Co-occurrence Matrix (GLGCM) and Gabor transformation. These features were processed by the Feature Recalibration Network (FRN) to learn high-level features. In the network, the Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC), Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Block and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are integrated. Finally, these learned features will be classified by the Softmax function. Eleven types of SAR scenes obtained from four systems combining different bands and resolutions were trained and tested, and a mean accuracy of 98.18% was obtained. To validate the generality of FRN-MSF, five types of SAR scenes sampled from two additional large-scale Gaofen-3 and TerraSAR-X images were evaluated for classification. The mean accuracy of the five types reached 94.56%; while the mean accuracy for the same five types of the former tested 11 types of scene was 96%. The high accuracy indicates that the FRN-MSF is promising for SAR scene classification without losing generality.

TI  - Diffuse Auroral Electron and Ion Precipitation Effects on RCM-E Comparisons With Satellite Data During the 17 March 2013 Storm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of scattering of electrons from whistler chorus waves and of ions due to field line curvature on diffuse precipitating particle fluxes and ionospheric conductance during the large 17 March 2013 storm are examined using the self-consistent Rice Convection Model Equilibrium (RCM-E) model. Electrons are found to dominate the diffuse precipitating particle integrated energy flux, with large fluxes from similar to 21:00 magnetic local time (MLT) eastward to similar to 11:00 MLT during the storm main phase. Simulated proton and oxygen ion precipitation due to field line curvature scattering is sporadic and localized, occurring where model magnetic field lines are significantly stretched on the night side at equatorial geocentric radial distances r(0) greater than or similar to 8 R E and/or at r(0) similar to 5.5 to 6.5 R-E from dusk to midnight where the partial ring current field has perturbed the magnetic field. The precipitating protons likewise contribute sporadically to the storm time Hall and Pedersen conductance in localized regions whereas the precipitating electrons are the dominate storm time contributor to enhanced Hall and Pedersen conductance at auroral magnetic latitudes on the night and morning side. The RCM-E model can reproduce general features of the Van Allen Probe/MagEIS observed trapped electron differential flux spectrograms over energies of similar to 37 to 150 keV. The simulations with a parameterized electron loss model also reproduce reasonably well the storm time Defense Meteorological Satellite Program integrated electron energy flux at 850 km at satellite crossings from predawn to midmorning. However, model-data agreement is not as good from dusk to premidnight where there are large uncertainties in the electron loss model.

TI  - Application of FY-4 atmospheric vertical sounder in weather forecast
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main instrument of FY-4 which was launched on Dec. 11th, 2016, Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is the first hyperspectral infrared atmospheric vertical sounder working on geostationary orbit internationally. This instrument is mainly used for vertical atmospheric sounding and gains atmospheric temperature, humidity, and disturbances. The observed data of FY-4 GIIRS is assimilated into the GRAPES Global Forecast System in real time. It is the first time to realize the satellite hyperspectral detection and real-time data assimilation of wide range sensitive area sat a high frequency and will have a significant impact on the current meteorological forecasting capability, in particular, for the prediction of typhoon intensity and track, the accuracy can be greatly improved. In this paper, we present the measuring principle of the atmospheric vertical sounder and the on-orbit performance and operation of GIIRS, and the development of hyperspectral infrared atmospheric vertical sounder in the future is also prospected.

TI  - A New Application of Random Forest Algorithm to Estimate Coverage of Moss-Dominated Biological Soil Crusts in Semi-Arid Mu Us Sandy Land, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play an essential role in desert ecosystems. Knowledge of the distribution and disappearance of BSCs is vital for the management of ecosystems and for desertification researches. However, the major remote sensing approaches used to extract BSCs are multispectral indices, which lack accuracy, and hyperspectral indices, which have lower data availability and require a higher computational effort. This study employs random forest (RF) models to optimize the extraction of BSCs using band combinations similar to the two multispectral BSC indices (Crust Index-CI; Biological Soil Crust Index-BSCI), but covering all possible band combinations. Simulated multispectral datasets resampled from in-situ hyperspectral data were used to extract BSC information. Multispectral datasets (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets) were then used to detect BSC coverage in Mu Us Sandy Land, located in northern China, where BSCs dominated by moss are widely distributed. The results show that (i) the spectral curves of moss-dominated BSCs are different from those of other typical land surfaces, (ii) the BSC coverage can be predicted using the simulated multispectral data (mean square error (MSE) < 0.01), (iii) Sentinel-2 satellite datasets with CI-based band combinations provided a reliable RF model for detecting moss-dominated BSCs (10-fold validation, R-2 = 0.947; ground validation, R-2 = 0.906). In conclusion, application of the RF algorithm to the Sentinel-2 dataset can precisely and effectively map BSCs dominated by moss. This new application can be used as a theoretical basis for detecting BSCs in other arid and semi-arid lands within desert ecosystems.

TI  - Retrieval Algorithm of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Turbid Waters from Satellite HY-1C Coastal Zone Imager Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite HY-1C was successfully launched in September 2018 with the Coastal Zone Imager (CZI) onboard, which can provide optical images of 50-m resolution at four broad bands (blue, green, red and near-infrared). In this study, 305 sets of in-situ measurements collected between 2005 and 2015 in the Bohai, Yellow and East China seas were used to assess the performance of HY-1C in retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration in the coastal waters. The results showed that two algorithms based on blue-green band ratios (OC3 and OC3L) performed well. The median of the ratio of retrieved to in-situ values was about 1.1, and the median absolute percentage difference was about 40 %. After applying the two algorithms to HY-1C CZI data of Jiaozhou Bay (Qingdao, China), the spatial distribution of retrieved Chl-a data was found to be in good agreement with results based on data from another satellite (Landsat-8 OLI) with a median absolute percentage difference less than 15 %. The results showed that the broadband channels of the HY-1C CZI can retrieve Chl-a concentration in turbid waters, which indicates potential for its application in coastal water quality and eutrophication monitoring.

TI  - Impact of center pivot irrigation on vegetation dynamics in a farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China: A case study in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Center pivot irrigation (CPI) has expanded rapidly in recent years due to drought in the Farming-Pastoral Ecotone of Northern China (FPENC). However, it is worth questioning whether the promotion of CPI will have adverse effects on highly vulnerable regions. Therefore, we quantify the CPI change patterns in FPENC and its vegetation cover response using trend analysis and spatial correlation methods in conjunction with Landsat images and MODIS data from 2000 to 2017. CPIs in Ulanqab are mainly distributed in the Houshan area, which is characterized by poor hydrothermal conditions. Policy orientation led to obvious phased characteristics of CPI, showing first an increasing trend from 2002 to 2015 and then a sharply decreasing trend by nearly 32.02% from 2015 to 2017. It is not sustainable to vigorously popularize CPI aimed at improving the agricultural production conditions in the Farming-Pastoral Ecotone of Northern China. During the growing season, the expansion of CPI will aggravate the degree of water stress in the area, causing vegetation degradation within 10,000m surrounding the CPIs and "pseudo-improvement" of the vegetation inside the CPIs. In the 0-10,000m buffer range, the correlation coefficient between the kernel density of CPI buffer pixels (CBKDE) and the kernel density of significantly degraded pixels (DPKDE) was largest in spring (0.243), followed by autumn (0.231) and summer (0.227). Furthermore, the degree of vegetation degradation was positively correlated with the size of CPIs, with correlation coefficients of 0.233 (R-large), 0.167 (R-medium) and 0.144 (R-small), respectively. These results can provide a strong basis for decision-making in formulating sustainable agricultural development strategies.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Golden Tide Based on High-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing in the South Yellow Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new marine ecological disaster called the golden tide occurred in the Southern Yellow Sea at the end of 2016. This disaster damaged the Porphyra yezoensis aquaculture in the Jiangsu Shoal, causing a direct economic loss of nearly 500 million CNY. The floating brown macroalgae in the golden tide was identified as Sargassum horneri, which have been frequently growing in coastal waters in recent years. Effectively detecting this golden tide using traditional satellites is difficult because of the small patches or slicks of bloom. This study used multi-source and high-resolution satellite data to identify the floating Sargassum with a maximum multispectral resolution of 4 m (GF-2). Satellite and in-situ spectral data were used to analyze the spectral characteristics of the Sargassum and compare them with those of Ulva. Both sets of spectral characteristics exhibited the "red-edge" effect, and the difference was obvious between the green and red bands. Combined with the normalized difference vegetation index algorithm, monitoring and backtracking were performed for the golden tide disaster. Results show that the golden tide originated from the Rongcheng-Haiyang sea area of the Shandong peninsula and drifted to the south and westward. In early December 2016, Sargassum affected the sea area of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province. In late December 2016, it arrived at the Jiangsu Shoal and finally entered the Yangtze River estuary around mid-January 2017. The drifting path was mainly controlled by wind vector products. A comprehensive analysis of environmental factors showed that the sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a in the South Yellow Sea were higher than normal during the golden tide disaster, which may be attributed to the rapid growth of the Sargassum biomass. Therefore, this study hypothesizes that an internal cause exists between the golden tide and the abovementioned factors

TI  - OccVis: a visual analytics system for occultation data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The FY-3C satellite returns more than 250,000 occultation data each year, each of which records high vertical resolution profiles of various climatic parameters in the range of 0-1000km above the Earth. These long-term, stable, and globally distributed observations can be used to improve climate modeling and analyze trends in spatial climate. However, traditional methods based on small samples meet challenges in analyzing the multi-dimensional occultation data in large volume. In this paper, we developed OccVis-a visual analytics system for multi-dimensional and multi-scale comparative analysis of occultation data. With a novel workflow, a series of data processing methods are proposed to support data correcting, patching, and clustering. Moreover, a matrix view with two modes is presented for overview, and a detail view along with time series view is provided for further analysis. Domain scientists can easily utilize our system to visually and interactively explore multivariable occultation data at different time and space scales. Finally, we conduct case studies in climate modeling of ionosphere and obtain several preliminary results to demonstrate the usage and effectiveness of our system.

TI  - Estimating age-stratified influenza-associated invasive pneumococcal disease in England: A time-series model based on population surveillance data
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMeasures of the contribution of influenza to Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, both in the seasonal and pandemic setting, are needed to predict the burden of secondary bacterial infections in future pandemics to inform stockpiling. The magnitude of the interaction between these two pathogens has been difficult to quantify because both infections are mainly clinically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms; a combined viral-bacterial testing is rarely performed in routine clinical practice; and surveillance data suffer from confounding problems common to all ecological studies. We proposed a novel multivariate model for age-stratified disease incidence, incorporating contact patterns and estimating disease transmission within and across groups.Methods and findingsWe used surveillance data from England over the years 2009 to 2017. Influenza infections were identified through the virological testing of samples taken from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness (ILI) within the sentinel scheme run by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases were routinely reported to Public Health England (PHE) by all the microbiology laboratories included in the national surveillance system. IPD counts at week t, conditional on the previous time point t-1, were assumed to be negative binomially distributed. Influenza counts were linearly included in the model for the mean IPD counts along with an endemic component describing some seasonal background and an autoregressive component mimicking pneumococcal transmission. Using age-specific counts, Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based model selection suggested that the best fit was obtained when the endemic component was expressed as a function of observed temperature and rainfall. Pneumococcal transmission within the same age group was estimated to explain 33.0% (confidence interval [CI] 24.9%-39.9%) of new cases in the elderly, whereas 50.7% (CI 38.8%-63.2%) of incidence in adults aged 15-44 years was attributed to transmission from another age group. The contribution of influenza on IPD during the 2009 pandemic also appeared to vary greatly across subgroups, being highest in school-age children and adults (18.3%, CI 9.4%-28.2%, and 6.07%, CI 2.83%-9.76%, respectively). Other viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, also seemed to have an impact on IPD: RSV contributed 1.87% (CI 0.89%-3.08%) to pneumococcal infections in the 65+ group, whereas 2.14% (CI 0.87%-3.57%) of cases in the group of 45- to 64-year-olds were attributed to rhinovirus. The validity of this modelling strategy relies on the assumption that viral surveillance adequately represents the true incidence of influenza in the population, whereas the small numbers of IPD cases observed in the younger age groups led to significant uncertainty around some parameter estimates.ConclusionsOur estimates suggested that a pandemic wave of influenza A/H1N1 with comparable severity to the 2009 pandemic could have a modest impact on school-age children and adults in terms of IPD and a small to negligible impact on infants and the elderly. The seasonal impact of other viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus was instead more important in the older population groups.

TI  - Exploring mechanisms for spring bloom evolution: contrasting 2008 and 2012 blooms in the southwest Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations from two research cruises made in 2008 and 2012 to east of New Zealand are put into context with satellite data to contrast and compare surface chlorophyll a evolution in the two years in order to explore mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom development in the southwest Pacific Ocean.In 2008, surface chlorophyll a largely followed the long-term climatological cycle, and 2008 can be considered a canonical year, where the autumn bloom is triggered by increasing vertical mixing at the end of summer and the spring bloom is triggered by decreasing vertical mixing at the end of winter. In contrast, 2012 was anomalous in that there was no autumn bloom, and in early spring there were several periods of sustained increase in surface chlorophyll a that did not become fully developed spring blooms. (In this region, we consider spring blooms to occur when surface chlorophyll a exceeds 0.5 mg m(-3)). These events can be related to alternating episodes of increased or decreased vertical mixing. The eventual spring bloom in October was driven by increased ocean cooling and wind stress (i.e. increased mixing) and paradoxically was driven by mechanisms considered more appropriate for autumn rather than spring blooms.

TI  - Is tumor bed boost necessary in patients who achieved ypCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast conserving therapy? (KROG 12-05 and 16-16)
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This multi-institutional study intended to investigate the effect of tumor bed boost in patients who achieved pathologic complete response (ypCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and breast-conserving therapy (BCT).Materials and methods: We identified 180 patients who initially had lymph node (LN) metastasis and achieved ypCR (ypT0/isN0) following NAC and BCT from the 13 institutions of the Korean Radiation Oncology Group (KROG) 16-16 and KROG 12-05. The effect of tumor bed boost on loco-regional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates was analyzed.Results: In all patients, five-year LRC, DFS and OS rates were 97.5%, 95.4%, and 99.4%, respectively. Tumor bed boost was performed in 158 (87.8%) patients. Advanced N-stage (cN2-3, p = 0.036), close resection margin (p < 0.001), and sentinel lymph node biopsy (p = 0.040) were unfavorable factors for DFS. Tumor bed boost was not a significant factor for LRC, DFS, and OS.Conclusions: This study suggests the benefit of tumor bed boost might be minimal in ypCR patients following NAC and BCT. Larger prospective studies are needed to address this issue. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Influenza is a very important respiratory infectious disease that causes seasonal epidemics and pandemics. A well-organized surveillance system is necessary to monitor and respond effectively to the epidemiologic features of influenza. Korea currently operates a national influenza surveillance system based on the clinical sentinel surveillance system, laboratory sentinel surveillance system, and hospitalization and mortality surveillance system.However, there is a need for a better national surveillance system due to a demand for various pieces of information related to influenza. This article discusses the general aspects of influenza surveillance systems and the future direction of the national influenza surveillance system of Korea.

AB  - Assessment of the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and the brightness temperature (BT) is necessary for estimating the SST using the BT data derived from the earth observation satellite sensors. This research assessed the relationship between the in-situ-measured SST data and the BT data derived from the Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensors through the linear regression analysis. The statistical results derived from the developed regression model show the following: the SST and BT datasets have a strong and positive relationship, and the BT data is the significant parameter for measuring the SST. In the future research, the various regression models will be compared to select the most appropriate model for estimating the SST using the BT data.

TI  - Upper extremity disability and quality of life after breast cancer treatment in the Greater Plains Collaborative clinical research network
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeChronic upper extremity disability (UED) is common after breast cancer treatment but under-identified and under-treated. Although UED has been linked to quality of life (QoL), the role of UED as mediator between contemporary treatment practices and QoL has not been quantified. This investigation describes UED in a contemporary sample of breast cancer patients and examines its relationship with personal and treatment factors and QoL.MethodsEight hundred and thirty-three women diagnosed at eight medical institutions during 2013-2014 with microscopically confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive stage I-III breast cancer were surveyed an average of 22 months after diagnosis. UED was measured with a modified QuickDASH and QoL with the FACT-B. The questionnaire also collected treatments, sociodemographic information, comorbidity, body mass index, and a 3-item health literacy screener.ResultsWomen who received post-mastectomy radiation and chemotherapy experienced significantly worse UED and QoL. Women who had lower income, lower health literacy and prior diabetes, arthritis or shoulder diagnoses had worse UED. Patients with worse UED reported significantly worse QoL. Income and health literacy were independently associated with QoL after adjustment for UED but treatment and prior conditions were not, indicating mediation by UED. UED mediated 52-79% of the effect of mastectomy-based treatments on QoL as compared with unilateral mastectomy without radiation. UED and QoL did not differ by type of axillary surgery or post-mastectomy reconstruction.ConclusionsA large portion of treatment effect on QoL is mediated by UED. Rehabilitation practices that prevent and alleviate UED are likely to improve QoL for breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Ushering in the New Era of Radiometric Intercomparison of Multispectral Sensors with Precision SNO Analysis
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A nadir-only framework of the radiometric intercomparison of multispectral sensors using simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) is examined at the 1-km regimes and below using four polar-orbiting multispectral sensors: the twin MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite, and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) in the Sentinel-3A satellite. The study is carried out in the context of isolating the on-orbit calibration of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) under the nadir-only restriction. With a homogeneity-ranked, sample size constrained procedure designed to minimize scene-based variability and noise, the overall approach successfully stabilizes the radiometric ratio and tightens the precision of each SNO-generated comparison event. Improvements to the multiyear comparison time series are demonstrated for different conditions of area size, sample size, and other refinements. The time series demonstrate the capability at 1% precision or better under general conditions but can attain as low as 0.2% in best cases. Solar zenith angle is examined not to be important in the nadir-only framework, but the spectral mismatch between two bands can give rise to significant yearly modulation in the comparison time series. A broad-scaled scene-based variability of similar to 2%, the scaling phenomenon, is shown to have pervasive presence in both northern and the southern polar regions to impact inter-RSB comparison. Finally, this paper highlights the multi-instrument cross-comparisons that are certain to take on a more important role in the coming era of high-performing multispectral instruments.

TI  - EFFECTS OF RAINFALL ON THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCEAN DURING SPURS-2
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The salinity variability of the upper ocean is influenced by surface heat, momentum, and freshwater fluxes, which are in turn affected by atmospheric conditions. It is necessary to accurately measure these surface fluxes within their atmospheric environment to understand the linkages between rain events and the resulting upper-ocean salinity balance that occurs at cloud scales. We describe a comprehensive set of atmospheric and oceanic data collected during the second Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS-2) experiment in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These measurements included direct estimates of heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes using direct covariance flux systems on R/V Roger Revelle and a 3 m discus buoy. These are the first successful direct measurements of evaporation from a buoy over an extended period. The atmospheric moisture budget is estimated from a combination of data, including measured freshwater fluxes, upper air sounding data, and satellite data. This analysis reconfirms the important role of moisture convergence beneath the Intertropical Convergence Zone in this region. We perform an analysis of the near-surface vertical salinity structure and its relationship to these surface fluxes, highlighting the roles of stabilization by solar insolation and precipitation and the effects of rainfall on mixing of the upper ocean.

TI  - Long-term exposure to higher temperature increases the thermal sensitivity of grazer metabolism and movement
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological studies of global warming impacts have many constraints. Organisms are often exposed to higher temperatures for short periods of time, probably underestimating their ability to acclimate or adapt relative to slower but real rates of warming. Many studies also focus on a limited number of traits and miss the multifaceted effects that warming may have on organisms, from physiology to behaviour. Organisms exhibit different movement traits, some of which are primarily driven by metabolic processes and others by decision-making, which should influence the extent to which temperature affects them. We collected snails from streams that have been differentially heated by geothermal activity for decades to determine how long-term exposure to different temperatures affected their metabolism and movement. Additionally, we collected snails from a cold stream (5 degrees C) and measured their metabolism and movement at higher temperatures (short-term exposure). We used respirometry to measure metabolic rates and automated in situ image-based tracking to quantify several movement traits from 5 to 21 degrees C. Long-term exposure to higher temperatures resulted in a greater thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate compared to snails exposed for short durations, highlighting the need for caution when conducting acute temperature exposures in global warming research. Average speed, which is largely driven by metabolism, also increased more with temperature for long-term exposure compared to short-term exposure. Movement traits we interpret as more decision-based, such as time spent moving and trajectory shape, were less affected by temperature. Step length increased and step angle decreased at higher temperatures for both long- and short-term exposure, resulting in overall straighter trajectories. The power-law exponent of the step length distributions and fractal dimension of trajectories were independent of temperature, however, suggesting that snails retained the same movement strategy. The observed changes in snail movement at higher temperatures should lead to higher encounter rates and more efficient searching, providing a behavioural mechanism for stronger plant-herbivore interactions in warmer environments. Our research is among the first to show that temperature has contrasting effects on different movement traits, which may be determined by the metabolic contribution to those behaviours.

TI  - Object based burned area mapping with random forest algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very important to map the burned forest areas economically, quickly and with the high accuracy of issues such as damage assessment studies, fire risk analysis, and management of forest regeneration processes. Remote sensing methods give advantages such as fast, easy-to-use and high accuracy for burned area mapping. Recent years machine learning algorithms have become more popular in satellite image classification, due to the effective solutions for the analysis of complex datasets which have a large number of variables. In this study, the success of object based random forest algorithm was investigated for burned forest area mapping. For this purpose, Object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed using Landsat 8 image of the Adrasan and Kumluca fires which occurred in 24 - 27 June 2016. The study consisted of five steps. In the first step, the multi-resolution image segmentation was performed for obtaining image objects from Landsat 8 spectral bands. In the second step, the image object metrics such as spectral index and layer values were calculated for all image objects. In the third step, a random forest classifier model was developed. Then, the developed model applied to the test site for classification of the burned area. Finally, the obtained results evaluated with confusion matrix based on the randomly sampled points. According to the results, we obtained 0.089 commission error (CE) with 0.014 omission error (OE). An overall accuracy was obtained as 0.99. The results show that this approach is very useful to be used to determine burned forest areas.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in the Wetland Landscape Pattern of the Yellow River Delta from 1976 to 2016 Based on Satellite Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta wetland is the youngest wetland ecosystem in China's warm temperate zone. To better understand how its landscape pattern has changed over time and the underlying factors responsible, this study analyzed the dynamic changes of wetlands using five Landsat series of images, namely MSS (Mulri Spectral Scanner), TM (Thematic Mapper), and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors in 1976, 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016. Object-oriented classification and the combination of spatial and spectral features and both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), as well as brightness characteristic indices, were used to classify the images in eCognition software. Landscape pattern changes in the Yellow River Delta over the past 40 years were then delineated using transition matrix and landscape index methods. Results show that: 1) from 1976 to 2016, the total area of wetlands in the study area decreased from 2594.76 to 2491.79 km(2), while that of natural wetlands decreased by 954.03 km(2) whereas human-made wetlands increased by 851.06 km(2). 2) The transformation of natural wetlands was extensive: 31.34% of those covered by Suaeda heteropteras were transformed into reservoirs and ponds, and 24.71% with Phragmites australis coverage were transformed into dry farmland. Some human-made wetlands were transformed into non-wetlands types: 1.55% of reservoirs and ponds became construction land, and likewise 21.27% were transformed into dry farmland. 3) From 1976 to 2016, as the intensity of human activities increased, the number of landscape types in the study area continuously increased. Patches were scattered and more fragmented. The whole landscape became more complex. In short, over the past 40 years, the wetlands of the Yellow River Delta have been degraded, with the area of natural wetlands substantially reduced. Human activities were the dominant forces driving these changes in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - An updated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocol for pathological evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes for melanoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a highly accurate staging procedure and the most important prognostic factor in melanoma patients. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group aimed to design an updated evolved SLN protocol for the histopathological workup and reporting. We herein recommend extending the distance between steps according to the short axis dimension of the lymph node and optimise both conventional sectioning and staining procedures including immunohisto-chemistry. We also provide guidance on the description of the spatial localisation of melanoma deposits in a SLN. The histopathological features to be reported include the following: presence or absence of the metastasis, the intranodal location of the metastasis (subcapsular, parenchymal, combined, extensive confluent and extensive multifocal), the number of the metastatic deposits (1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20 and > 20), the maximum dimension of the largest metastasis (indicating its site) and the presence of extracapsular extension and of naevus cells. This updated EORTC protocol is expected to clarify and simplify the existing procedures, ensuring a reasonable workload for the laboratory and for the pathologists resulting in cost saving with no loss, and possible increase, in accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Azimuth Cutoff Implementation to Retrieve Sea Surface Wind Speed From SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) azimuth cutoff method is thoroughly revised and a new and general implementation is proposed. The key roles of the pixel spacing, the size of the image box, and the texture of the SAR scene are analyzed and optimized in terms of azimuth cutoff (lambda(c)) estimation. The reliability of the lambda(c) estimation is analyzed by measuring the distance between the measured and fitted autocorrelation functions. This analysis shows that it is of paramount importance to filter unfeasible/unreliable lambda(c) values. To identify those values in an objective way, a criterion that is based on the chi(2) test performed over a large data set of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery is defined and proven to be effective. The new robust implementation of the lambda(c) estimation at about 1-km grid spacing is then used to produce averaged lambda(c) at about 10-km grid spacing. The performance of the new estimation procedure, analyzed using a lambda(c)-to-wind-speed forward model, is shown to provide improved wind speed retrievals, with a root-mean-square error of 1.8-2 m/s when verified against independent numerical weather prediction model output and scatterometer winds.

TI  - Radio-guided vs clip-guided localization of nonpalpable mass-like lesions of the breast from a screened population: A propensity score-matched study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesAn accurate localization is mandatory to tailor breast lumpectomy in nonpalpable cancers. The aim of this study was to compare radio-guided localization (ROLL) vs ultrasound localization of a titanium clip with collagen (TCC) in nonpalpable mass-like breast cancers.MethodsTwo hundred seventy-three consecutive patients were reviewed: 64 patients were localized by TCC and 209 patients by ROLL. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed. Margin status and reintervention rates were compared. Adequacy of resection was expressed as the calculated resection ratio (CRR) considering lesion size. Loco-regional and distant recurrence rates were assessed with ROLL vs TCC.ResultsNo differences were found with ROLL vs TCC in clear margins (90.6% vs 89.1%; odds ratio, 0.74; P=0.64) or reoperations (6.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.529). ROLL allowed more tailored resections compared with TCC (adjusted CRR, 1.7 vs 2.7; P=0.0008), particularly in lesions with associated extensive intraductal component (CRR, 3.0 vs 4.5; P=0.017). Loco-regional recurrence occurred in 1.9% of ROLL patients vs 3.2% of TCC cases (P=0.628).ConclusionsROLL and TCC are equally effective to excise nonpalpable mass-like breast cancers with clear margins, providing similar loco-regional control. However, ROLL allows more tailored breast resections, particularly in lesions with the associated extensive intraductal component.

TI  - The prognostic significance of aortic lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer: Potential implications for selective aortic lymph node assessment
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the prognostic impact of aortic vs. pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis among women with endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. Using data from the SEER 18 Registries we identified 3650 women with LN positive (stage IIIC) EC. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests to compare mortality between women with stage IIIC1 and IIIC2 disease. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between stage Ill sub-stage (IIIC1 vs. IIIC2) and survival.Results. Endometrioid tumors were more common among women with stage IIIC1 than IIIC2 tumors (62.5% vs. 54.3%) while, non-endometrioid histologies were more common among stage IIIC2. In the multivariable model, stage IIIC2 was associated with higher all-cause (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.22-1.69) and EC-specific mortality (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.25-1.77) compared with IIIC1. Women with non-endometrioid EC had poor survival, in particular, women with carcinosarcomas had higher EC-specific mortality compared to women with endometrioid EC (HR = 3.32, 95% CI = 2.71-4.07). When stratifying women according to substage, older age and non-endometrioid histology were associated with higher EC-specific mortality. Compared to women with a pelvic-only LN dissection, women with pelvic and aortic dissections had lower all-cause (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63-0.88) and EC-specific (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.95) mortality.Conclusion. Women with aortic LN positive EC are more likely to die from their disease. Older women and non-endometrioid histologies are more likely to have aortic LN involvement. Compared to women with a pelvic-only LN dissection, women with pelvic and aortic dissections had lower EC mortality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping land cover change in northern Brazil with limited training data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in the Amazon has important implications for biodiversity and climate change. However, land cover monitoring in this tropical forest is a challenge because it covers such a large area and the land cover change often occurs quickly, and sometimes cyclically. Here we adapt a method which eliminates the need to collect new training data samples for each update of an existing land cover map. We use the state-of-the-art probabilistic classifier Import Vector Machines and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes of the area surrounding Novo Progresso, northern Brazil, to create an initial land cover map for 2013 with associated classification probabilities. We then conduct spectral change detection between 2013 and 2015 using a pair of Landsat images in order to identify the areas where land cover has changed between the two dates, and then reclassify these areas using a supervised classification algorithm, using pixels from the unchanged areas of the map as training data. In this study, we use the pixels with the highest classification probabilities to train the classifier for 2015 and compare the results to those obtained when pixels are chosen randomly. The use of probabilities in the selection of training samples improves the results compared to a random selection, with the highest overall accuracy achieved when 250 training samples with high probabilities are used. For training sample sizes greater than 1000, the differences in overall accuracy between the two approaches to training sample selection are reduced. The final updated 2015 map has an overall accuracy of 80.1%, compared to an overall accuracy of 82.5% for the 2013 map. The results show that this probabilistic method has potential to efficiently map the dynamic land cover change in the Amazon with limited training data, although some challenges remain.

TI  - The Odyssey of Deaf Epistemology: A Search for Meaning-Making
T2  - AMERICAN ANNALS OF THE DEAF
M3  - Article
AB  - Deaf epistemology made a crucial contribution to an understanding of a Deaf worldview, yet did not quite encompass the "D/deaf experience." It started the conversation but seemingly stalled. In an expansion on earlier studies of Deaf epistemology, the researchers considered the question "What does it mean to be D/deaf?" D/deaf participants submitted narratives that were analyzed for common themes via grounded theory research methodology. Six open codes were identified: school, cultural capital, deficit/The Struggle, difference/empowerment, accessibility/technology, hearing technology. These themes were captured by two axial codes: journey and sense of belonging. The core category was determined to be situated homecoming, reflecting the apex of a long, frustrating journey. In a transition from a largely etic to an emic exploration of Deaf epistemology, new insights were developed about what it means to be D/deaf, as well as a new way of theorizing about Deaf epistemology.

TI  - Leaf chlorophyll content retrieval of wheat by simulated RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an important physiological indicator of the actual health status of individual plants. An accurate estimation of LCC can therefore provide valuable information for precision field management. Red-edge information from hyperspectral data has been widely used to estimate crop LCC. However, after the advent of red-edge bands in satellite imagery, no systematic evaluation of the performance of satellite data has been conducted. Toward this end, we analyze herein the performance of winter wheat LCC retrieval of currant and forthcoming satellites (RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP) and their new red-edge bands by using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a vegetation-index-based approach. These satellite spectral data were obtained by resampling ground-measured hyperspectral data under various field conditions and according to specific spectral response functions and spectral resolution. The results showed: 1) This study confirmed that RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data are suitable for winter wheat LCC retrieval. For the PLSR approach, Sentinel-2 data provided more accurate estimates of LCC (R-2=0.755, 0.844, 0.805 for 2002, 2010, and 2002+2010) than do RapidEye data (R-2=0.689, 0.710, 0.707 for 2002, 2010, and 2002+2010) and EnMAP data (R-2=0.735, 0.867, 0.771 for 2002, 2010, and 2002+2010). For index-based approaches, the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index, which is a vegetation index with two red-edge bands, was the most sensitive and robust index for LCC for both the Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data (R-2=0.628), and the indices (NDRE1, SRRE1 and CIRE1) with a single red-edge band were the most sensitive and robust indices for the RapidEye data (R-2 >= 0.420); 2) According to the analysis of the effect of the wavelength and number of used red-edge spectral bands on LCC retrieval, the short-wavelength red-edge bands (from 699 to 734 nm) provided more accurate predictions when using the PLSR approach, whereas the long-wavelength red-edge bands (740 to 783 nm) gave more accurate predictions when using the vegetation indice (VI) approach. In addition, the prediction accuracy of RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data was improved gradually because of more number of red-edge bands and higher spectral resolution; VI regression models that contain a single or multiple red-edge bands provided more accurate predictions of LCC than those without red-edge bands, but for normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-, simple ratio (SR)- and chlorophyll index (CI)-like index, two red-edge bands index didn't significantly improve the predictive accuracy of LCC than those indices with a single red-edge band. Although satellite data with higher spectral resolution and a greater number of red-edge bands marginally improve the accuracy of estimates of crop LCC, the level of this improvement remains insufficient because of higher spectral resolution, which results in a worse signal-to-noise ratio. The results of this study are helpful to accurately monitor LCC of winter wheat in large-area and provide some valuable advice for design of red-edge spectral bands of satellite sensor in future.

TI  - Floating Raft Aquaculture Area Automatic Extraction Based on Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the extraction of floating raft aquaculture areas from remote sensing images, the method of visual interpretation is time-consuming and laborious, and the traditional machine learning method has poor generalization ability and fitting ability for remote sensing data. To overcome these two problems, this paper proposes a method based on using a fully convolutional neural network to automatically extract floating raft aquaculture areas. The proposed method uses multiple convolution layers, pooling layers and nonlinear ReLU functions to extract nonlinear and invariant deep features of floating raft aquaculture areas, which effectively improves the accuracy of recognizing floating raft aquaculture areas. At the same time, L2 regularization and dropout strategies are added to the neural network model to avoid overfitting. The offshore area of Lianyungang in China was selected as the research region of the floating raft aquaculture. The experimental results show that the proposed method area in this paper effectively identifies and extracts the aquaculture areas.

TI  - The relationships between urban-rural temperature difference and vegetation in eight cities of the Great Plains
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpreting the relationship between urban heat island (UHI) and urban vegetation is a basis for understanding the impacts of underlying surfaces on UHI. The calculation of UHI intensity (UHII) requires observations from paired stations in both urban and rural areas. Due to the limited number of paired meteorological stations, many studies have used remotely sensed land surface temperature, but these time-series land surface temperature data are often heavily affected by cloud cover and other factors. These factors, together with the algorithm for inversion of land surface temperature, lead to accuracy problems in detecting the UHII, especially in cities with weak UHII. Based on meteorological observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet, a world-class network, we quantified the UHII and trends in eight cities of the Great Plains, USA, where data from at least one pair of urban and rural meteorological stations were available. We examined the changes and variability in urban temperature, UHII, vegetation condition (as measured by enhanced vegetation index, EVI), and evapotranspiration (ET). We found that both UHI and urban cold islands (UCI) occurred among the eight cities during 2000-2014 (as measured by impervious surface area). Unlike what is generally considered, UHII in only three cities significantly decreased as EVI and ET increased (p<0.1), indicating that the UHI or UCI cannot be completely explained simply from the perspective of the underlying surface. Increased vegetative cover (signaled by EVI) can increase ET, and thereby effectively mitigate the UHI. Each study station clearly showed that the underlying surface or vegetation affects urban-rural temperature, and that these factors should be considered during analysis of the UHI effect over time.

TI  - Du Pont Turns 150: Corporate Culture as Public Culture
T2  - ENTERPRISE & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article details the ways in which the executives of Du Pont used the chemical company's 150th-anniversary festivities in 1952 and its associated sponsored media as an opportunity to explicitly link the history of the company with the history of the nation. This was an attempt to legitimatize the company's existence and its ultraconservative worldview, espouse free trade, and fight antitrust litigation. This article explores the conflation of private and public history in Du Pont-sponsored anniversary materials to illustrate how corporate public relations meant for private corporate consumption reverberated into a shared American public culture.

TI  - Soil erosion vulnerability in the southern part of the Meia Ponte watershed, Goias, Brazil
T2  - Idesia
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a serious environmental problem that can cause numerous types of damage to society and the environment, and thus require preventive measures. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil erosion vulnerability in the southern region of the Meia Ponte watershed, Goias, Brazil, considering two situations: natural and anthropic cover conditions. For the analysis, we used remote sensing data represented by several parameters: lithology, soil class, slope, rain intensity, vegetation index, vicinity of roads, and land use and occupation. For each variable, we established a scale of weights according to erosive susceptibility for natural and anthropogenic environments. Multicriteria analysis, which allows the combination of qualitative and quantitative information in the analysis of erosive susceptibility, was used through the relationship between soil use and land occupation. In the southern part of the Meia Ponte River watershed, the anthropic factor showed greater influence. The factors that increase erosive susceptibility were soil use and occupation, low vegetation index, and high slope. The southern part of the Meia Ponte watershed presents medium natural erosive susceptibility in most of the study area.

TI  - Post-disaster assessment of 2017 catastrophic Xinmo landslide (China) by spaceborne SAR interferometry
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and effective post-disaster assessment is of significance for the design of rescue plan, taking disaster mitigation measures and disaster analysis. Field investigation and remote sensing methods are the common ways to perform post-disaster assessment, which are usually limited by dense cloud coverage, potential risk, and tough transportation etc. in the mountainous area. In this paper, we employ the 2017 catastrophic Xinmo landslide (Sichuan, China) to demonstrate the feasibility of using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to perform timely and effective post-disaster assessment. With C-band Sentinel-1 data, we propose to combine interferometric coherence to recognize the stable area, which helps us successfully identify landslide source area and boundaries in a space-based remote sensing way. Complementarily, X-band TanDEM-X SAR data allow us to generate a precise pre-failure high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), which provides us the ability to accurately estimate the depletion volume and accumulation volume of Xinmo landslide. The results prove that spaceborne SAR can provide a quick, valuable, and unique assistance for post-disaster assessment of landslides from a space remote sensing way. At some conditions (bad weather, clouds, etc.), it can provide reliable alternative.

TI  - The Problem of Overpopulation: Proenvironmental Concerns and Behavior Predict Reproductive Attitudes
T2  - ECOPSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human overpopulation continues to be a pressing problem for the health and viability of the environment, which impacts the survival and well-being of human populations. Limiting the number of offspring one produces or deciding to remain child-free may be viewed as a proenvironmental behavior (PEB) that can significantly reduce one's carbon footprint. Nonetheless, few researchers have examined the relations between environmental concerns, reported PEB, and reproductive attitudes. The goal of the current study was to examine the above relations in a sample of 200 Canadian undergraduates. Environmental concern as part of an ecologically conscious worldview (the New Ecological Paradigm) was found to negatively predict pro-reproductive attitudes. In contrast, more self-oriented (egoistic) and human-centric (altruistic) environmental concerns positively predicted pro-reproductive attitudes. Additionally, self-reported PEB was found to negatively predict pro-reproductive attitudes. All of the above relations were found to be statistically significant while controlling for the influence of age, sex, and religious status. These findings add to a limited empirical literature on environmental concerns, PEB, and attitudes toward reproducing, which can help inform discussion regarding the environmental issues associated with human overpopulation and potential ways to mitigate these dilemmas.

TI  - Application of the MODIS MOD 17 Net Primary Production product in grassland carrying capacity assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based grassland carrying capacity assessments are not commonly applied in rangeland management. Possible reasons for this include non-equilibrium thinking in rangeland management, and the costliness of existing remotely sensed biomass estimation that carrying capacity assessments require. Here, we present a less demanding approach for grassland biomass estimation using the MODIS Net Primary Production (NPP) product and demonstrate its use in carrying capacity assessment over the mountain grasslands of Azerbaijan. Based on publicly available estimates of the fraction of total NPP partitioned to aboveground NPP (fANPP) we calculate the aboveground biomass produced from 2005 to 2014. Validation of the predicted aboveground biomass with independent field biomass data collected in 2007 and 2008 confirmed the accuracy of the aboveground biomass product and hence we considered it appropriate for further use in the carrying capacity assessment. A first assessment approach, which allowed for consumption of 65% of aboveground biomass, resulted in an average carrying capacity of 12.6 sheep per ha. A second more realistic approach, which further restricted grazing on slopes steeper than 10%, resulted in a stocking density of 6.20 sheep per ha and a carrying capacity of 3.93 million sheep. Our analysis reveals overgrazing of the mountain grasslands because the current livestock population which consists of at least 8 million sheep, 0.5 million goats and an unknown number of cattle exceeds the predicted carrying capacity of 3.93 million sheep. We consider that the geographically explicit advice on sustainable stocking densities is particularly attractive to regulate grazing intensity in geographically varied terrain such as the mountain grasslands of Azerbaijan. We further conclude that the approach, given its generic nature and the free availability of most input data, could be replicated elsewhere. Hence, we advise considering its use where traditional carrying capacity assessments are difficult to implement.

TI  - Serological surveillance of influenza in an English sentinel network: pilot study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rapidly undertaken age-stratified serology studies can produce valuable data about a new emerging infection including background population immunity and seroincidence during an influenza pandemic. Traditionally seroepidemiology studies have used surplus laboratory sera with little or no clinical information or have been expensive detailed population based studies. We propose collecting population based sera from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), a sentinel network with extensive clinical data.Aim To pilot a mechanism to undertake population based surveys that collect serological specimens and associated patient data to measure seropositivity and seroincidence due to seasonal influenza, and create a population based serology bank.Methods and analysis Setting and Participants: We will recruit 6 RCGP RSC practices already taking nasopharyngeal virology swabs. Patients who attend a scheduled blood test will be consented to donate additional blood samples. Approximately 100-150 blood samples will be collected from each of the following age bands -18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years.Methods We will send the samples to the Public Health England (PHE) Seroepidemiology Unit for processing and storage. These samples will be tested for influenza antibodies, using haemagglutination inhibition assays. Serology results will be pseudonymised, sent to the RCGP RSC and combined using existing processes at the RCGP RSC secure hub. The influenza seroprevalence results from the RCGP cohort will be compared against those from the annual PHE influenza residual serosurvey.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by the Proportionate Review Sub-Committee of the London - Camden & Kings Cross on 6 February 2018. This study received approval from Health Research Authority on 7 February 2018. On completion the results will be made available via peer-reviewed journals.

T2  - JOURNAL DE MYCOLOGIE MEDICALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. - Yeasts of the Candida genus are one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. We aimed to identify yeasts obtained from blood cultures of patients interned at tertiary hospitals in Brazil.Methods. - We evaluated some of the major virulence factors of Candida spp., including the ability to adhere to human buccal epithelial cells, biofilm formation, hemolytic and phospholipase activity.Results. - We analyzed 70 isolates of Candida spp. obtained from March 2011 and March 2015. Candida spp. showed different peculiarities in terms of expression of virulence factors evaluated in vitro. C. albicans strains were more adherent to HBEC than all the other Candida species. C tropicalis strains were considered strong biofilm producers. Strains belonging to the C parapsilosis species complex were able to produce hemolysins, while C glabrata was also able to lyse erythrocytes and to produce phospholipase.Conclusion. - These results suggest that Non-Candida albicans Candida species are also able to express virulence factors which play an important role in bloodstream infectious caused by these yeasts.

TI  - A multisensoral approach for high-resolution land cover and pasture degradation mapping in the humid tropics: A case study of the fragmented landscape of Rio de Janeiro
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture degradation is of increasing global concern as it enforces erosion processes and impacts the carbon storage capacities of the soil. Reliable methods for pasture degradation mapping are thus of great use to provide important information for sustainable landscape planning. Our research focusses on the Guapi-Macacu watershed (Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil) as part of the biodiversity hotspot Mata Atlantica. The area is characterized by strong forest fragmentation and pasture degradation. We investigate the suitability of RapidEye and Landsat 5 TM data in comparison to a high-resolution image composite product based on RapidEye and downscaled Landsat 5 TM SWIR bands for land cover classification and pasture degradation mapping. Land cover classification results improved significantly for the image composite product (overall accuracy (OAA) 89%) compared to the application of RapidEye (OAA 87%) or Landsat 5 TM (OAA 85%) data alone. Pasture degradation was mapped using degradation class thresholds derived from field data and vegetation cover fractions on a per pixel basis and modelled using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). The pasture degradation map based on the image composite achieved an overall accuracy of 77.5%, compared to 75% (RapidEye) and 61% (Landsat 5 TM). We further tested the relationship between degradation and slope class and concluded that more than 90% of the pastures on slopes > 10 degrees show signs of degradation, whereby on above 20 slopes the portion of moderate to strong degradation is above 57%.

TI  - A Bootstrap-Based Approach for Improving Measurements by Retarding Potential Analyzers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Retarding potential analyzers are frequently flown on small satellites as in situ ion probes, from which can be derived a number of ion plasma parameters from a current-voltage relationship (I-V curve). The traditional method of analyzing retarding potential analyzer data produces inaccuracies in derived estimates when there is significant noise present in the instrument measurements. In this study we investigate the dependencies between parameters that produce uncertainties in noisy I-V curves. It is found that multiple combinations of ion velocity and spacecraft floating potential can produce I-V curves that lie within the noise envelope, which renders it difficult for a traditional curve fitting technique to objectively and accurately estimate parameters from a noisy I-V curve. In this paper we propose BATFORD-a bootstrap resampling-based technique to improve the accuracies of parameter estimates. It is particularly useful when signal-to-noise ratios are low. The algorithm is tested against a traditional curve fitting method for a simulated data set comprising I-V curves for the middle- and low-latitude ionosphere at low Earth orbit altitudes around 450 km, where O+ is the predominant species. BATFORD is found to provide more robust and reliable estimates assuming generalized noise distribution characteristics. As further validation, the algorithm is applied to satellite data from an orbit with deep plasma bubbles and hence low signal levels.

T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a high resolution glacier database in the Changme Khangpu Basin (CKB) using LANDSAT 8 (2014) and Sentinel-2A image (2016), mapping of 81 glaciers that cover a 75.78 +/- 1.54 km(2) area. Composite maps of land surface temperature, slope and Normalized differential Snow Index have been successfully utilized in delineating near accurate debris cover boundary of glaciers. The cumulative controlling parameters of aspect, elevation, slope, and debris cover have been assessed to evaluate the nature of glacier distribution and dynamics. The local topographic settings seem to have significantly determined the glacier distribution in the CKB. Almost 20% area erstwhile under glacier cover has been lost since 1975 at an average rate of -0.453 +/- 0.001 km(2)a(-1). The recent decade (2001-2016) has witnessed a higher rate of area shrinkage (-0.665 +/- 0.243 km(2)a(-1)), compared to a relatively lower rate of recession (-0.170 +/- 0.536 km(2)a(-1)) between 1988 and 2001. The lower rates of glacial recession can most likely be induced regionally due to relatively cooler decadal late summer temperatures and peak in the monsoon spell. Glaciers with western and north-western aspects showed more vulnerability to area loss than the rest of the aspects. Lower altitude glaciers have receded faster than ones perched up on higher elevations. The rate of glacier area recession has been nearly twice that on clean glaciers as compared to debris-covered glaciers in the CKB.

T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study describes the land use and land cover dynamics in Eastern Arunachal Pradesh from 1985 to 2005 using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Landsat-MSS, IRS-LISS-I and LISS-III data for the period 1985, 1995 and 2005 were used to prepare the land use/land cover (LULC) map at 1:250K for different periods. Post-classification change detection technique for quantifying the changes for twelve major land use and land cover types was analyzed. The study signifies that the region experiences expansion in crop land and built-up area and decline in forest area. Crop land and built-up area has increased by 665.41 km(2) and 16.72 km(2), respectively, from 1985 to 2005. On the other hand, forest area has declined by 699.37 km(2) during the period. The study showed that topography and increasing population play an important role in shaping the LULC pattern. The study further revealed the importance of satellite remote sensing and GIS as an effective approach for analyzing the direction, rate and spatial pattern of land use dynamics. It is believed that this type of study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management in this part of the North East India in the near future.

M3  - Article
AB  - The first reflections regarding social enterprises is to try to understand and investigate the specificities that make them unique; therefore, the present document seeks to delimit the nature of these types of organization from the way they are configured and the purpose for which they have been created. To do this, it is considered important to visualize the worldview that is built in the organizational dynamics through the values that unite its members beyond profit and competitiveness, evoking the fusion of different logics such as ecotourism, community and the company. The present case study was conducted in an Ejido community with indigenous Otomi roots in Atarjea, El Carricillo, Guanajuato. The methodology used in the inquiry was qualitative with in-depth semi-structured interviews. Among the main findings, it has been found that the values of the community are the amalgam that sustains the logic of social enterprise in such a way that actions and efforts are directed towards seeking the common well-being.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe main surgical treatment for invasive malignant melanoma consists of wide surgical and examination of the sentinel node and in selected cases complete lymph node dissection. The aim of this review is to present data for the optimal surgical management of patients with malignant melanoma.Recent FindingsA surgical excision margin of 1-2cm is recommended for invasive melanoma depending on the thickness of the melanoma. Sentinel node biopsy may be considered for patients with at least T1b melanomas thickness 0.8 to 1.0mm or less than 0.8mm Breslow thickness with ulceration, classified as T1b lesion, per recent AJCC guidelines. Two randomized controlled trials have been publishedDeCOG (German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group Selective Lymphadenectomy) and MSLT-2 (Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial) comparing the complete lymph node dissection (CLND) with observation after positive sentinel node biopsy. In the MSLT-2 study, the disease control rate was improved in the immediate CLND group compared with observation but there was no difference in 3-year melanoma specific survival (86%1.3% and 86%+/- 1.2%, respectively; p=0.42). Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) or isolated limb infusion (ILI) with melphalan and actinomycin D is recommended for large and multiple in-transit metastases and satellite metastases in the extremities when local excision is considered ineffective or too extensive.Summary p id=Par3 In light of new adjuvant treatment options and new indications for checkpoint inhibitors, and the lack of survival benefit after CLND, we can expect open surgery to decrease in melanoma disease.

TI  - Child development center-based sentinel surveillance of soil-transmitted helminthiases in preschool-age children in selected local government units in the Philippines
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) remains a public health concern in developing countries, such as the Philippines. Preschool-age children (PSAC) are among the high-risk groups for STH. Data on the status of STH in PSAC are needed to help guide policy formulation and program implementation; however, in the usual setting, such data may remain limited. This study aimed to describe the parasitologic status of PSAC in selected local government units (LGUs) in the Philippines through sentinel surveillance methodology in a child-development center (CDC)-based setting.This cross-sectional study, which included 1732 PSAC in selected barangays (a village or the smallest administrative unit in the country) in the provinces of Cavite, Guimaras, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Davao del Norte and cities of Iloilo and Lapu-Lapu in the Philippines, utilized Kato-Katz technique to determine parasitologic status. A single Kato-Katz smear was prepared from the adult-thumb sized stool sample submitted by each participant. Ten percent of Kato-Katz slides examined by field microscopists were re-examined by a reference microscopist as part of quality control.Results showed a prevalence of any STH infection and a moderate-heavy ((M - H)) intensity prevalence of 24.9% and 10.3%, respectively. Five cases of schistosomiasis were found in Lapu-Lapu City and Davao del Norte. While the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) - Integrated Helminth Control Program (IHCP) target for prevalence of any STH of less than 50% was attained, none of the barangays or villages met the World Health Organization (WHO) target for (M - H) intensity STH prevalence of less than 1%, despite the program being implemented for almost a decade.Sentinel surveillance in PSAC, possibly adopting a CDC-based approach, may be implemented biannually in the Philippines and other countries where a similar early child care development system exist to generate data needed to guide policy formulation and program implementation. Preventive chemotherapy through facility based mass drug administration (MDA), such as CDC-based MDA, may be explored to improve the mode of MDA delivery and coverage in PSAC.

TI  - Determination of Opium Poppy (Papaver Somniferum) Parcels Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Narcotic plants contain substances that cause unusual excitation and subsequent depression of the central nervous system. Many narcotic plants contain substances that have medicinal properties and are used primarily as pain relievers. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is one of the most cultivated narcotic plants. The planning of Opium poppy growing is controlled by United Nations and Drugs and Medicines Control Program. This study was conducted to establish a basis for determining the traceability of poppy cultivating areas using remote sensing in the large plain. A very high-resolution QuickBird-2 satellite image was used in the study. The software of ERDAS Imagine and eCognition Developer was performed for image processing and classification. A variety of classification methods were performed on the satellite image. ArcGIS software was used for accuracy assessment, ground control, and map production of the poppy cultivating area. The accuracy of classification methods was compared. The producer-user accuracy was estimated as 97.99% using spectral difference sub-segmentation process of multiresolution segmentation algorithm in object-based classifications method. This algorithm can be a practical approach for determining of opium poppy parcels in the large plain.

TI  - Ship Target Detection Based on CFAR and Deep Learning SAR Image
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship activity has become more and more frequent with the development of maritime transportation. Therefore, the rapid and accurate positioning performance of marine vessels is becoming more and more important. Because SAR images have the characteristics of all-weather detection, the analysis of SAR images becomes a marine ship. An important method of detection, but the existing ship detection methods have the disadvantages of low precision and slow speed. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method based on deep learning to realize the fast and accurate automatic detection of marine ships through RadarSat -2 data is simulated. The results show that the proposed method effectively describes the ship's target characteristics and the accuracy is greatly improved.

TI  - Learning Deep Ship Detector in SAR Images From Scratch
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep learning-based methods have brought new ideas for ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, several challenges still exist: 1) deep models contain millions of parameters, whereas the available annotated samples are not sufficient in number for training. Therefore, most deep detectors have to fine-tune networks pre-trained on ImageNet, which incurs learning bias due to the huge domain mismatch between SAR images and ImageNet images. Furthermore, it has a little flexibility to redesign the network structure; and 2) ships in SAR images are relatively small in size and densely clustered, whereas most deep detectors have poor performance with small objects due to the rough feature map used for detection and the extreme foreground-background imbalance. To address these problems, this paper proposes an effective approach to learn deep ship detector from scratch. First, we design a condensed backbone network, which consists of several dense blocks. Hence, earlier layers can receive additional supervision from the objective function through the dense connections, which makes it easy to train. In addition, feature reuse strategy is adopted to make it highly parameter efficient. Therefore, the backbone network could be freely designed and effectively trained from scratch without using a large amount of annotated samples. Second, we improve the cross-entropy loss to address the foreground-background imbalance and predict multi-scale ship proposals from several intermediate layers to improve the recall rate. Then, position-sensitive score maps are adopted to encode position information into each ship proposal for discrimination. The comparison results on the Sentinel-1 data set show that: 1) learning ship detector from scratch achieved better performance than ImageNet pre-trained model-based detectors and 2) our method ismore effective than existing algorithms for detecting the small and densely clustered ships.

TI  - "Positive parochialism", local belonging and ecological concerns: Revisiting Common Ground's Parish Maps project
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scepticism about the value of parochialism and local belonging has been a persistent feature of geographical scholarship, which has advocated a relational account of place and a cosmopolitan worldview. This paper revisits the Parish Maps project that was instigated in 1987 by UK arts and environment charity Common Ground, which led to the creation of thousands of maps across the UK and beyond, and was appraised in 1996 by Crouch and Matless in this journal. Drawing on archival materials and in-depth interviews, we examine the legacy of the project. We argue that Common Ground's vision for Parish Maps represents a "positive parochialism" that confidently asserts the validity of the parish without retreating towards insularity. We complicate this by revealing diverse ways that communities took up Common Ground's vision. We conclude by arguing that the view of parochialism manifest by Parish Maps offers a foundation for ecological concern that remains relevant today, with places offering the potential for solidarities that bring together local and incomer. This "positive parochialism" disturbs assumptions that local attachments are necessarily exclusive and indicates the unresolved challenge of finding ways to realise the value of affect and creative environmental engagement in wider policy and land-use planning.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy after primary systemic therapy in node positive breast cancer patients: Time trend, imaging staging power and nodal downstaging according to molecular subtype
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The management of axilla after Primary Systemic Therapy (PST) for breast cancer is a highly debated field. Despite the proven axillary downstaging occurring after PST, there is still some degree of reluctance in applying sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in the neoadjuvant setting.Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis on 181 PST patients with axillary positive nodes at presentation treated between 2005 and 2017 at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan. The aim was to observe the application time trend of SNB, to determine the imaging staging power and the axillary downstaging according to molecular subtypes.Results: Median follow-up after surgery was 32.5(IQR: 12-59) months. After PST, 119 (65.7%) patients had no clinically palpable nodes, 72 (39.7%) converted to NO on final imaging and 34 (18.8%) underwent SNB with an increasing application trend. Axillary-US showed the highest accuracy (693%) in re-staging axilla after PST. Staging power of preoperative testing varied with tumour biology: Positive Predictive Value was higher in Luminal A (80% for clinical examination and 100% for axillary-US) and Luminal B (72% and 70.5%) tumours, whilst Negative Predictive Value was higher in HER2 positive (100% and 93.3%), and triple negative (71.4% and 93.3%) tumours. Ninety five (52.5%) patients experienced axillary downstaging after PST, by molecular subtype 15% (3/20) in Luminal A, 46.4% (45/97) in Luminal B, 90.9% (20/22) in HER2+ and 70.3% (26/37) in triple negative breast tumours.Conclusion: SNB application after PST for breast cancer in node positive patients at presentation is increasing. Pre-operative axillary imaging and tumour biology help identify patients who might be candidates for SNB as a single staging procedure.

TI  - Sub-Pixel Crop Type Classification Using PROBA-V 100 m NDVI Time Series and Reference Data from Sentinel-2 Classifications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a sub-pixel classification of crop types in Bulgaria from PROBA-V 100 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Two sub-pixel classification methods, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were used where the output was a set of area fraction images (AFIs) at 100 m resolution with pixels containing estimated area fractions of each class. High-resolution maps of two test sites derived from Sentinel-2 classifications were used to obtain training data for the sub-pixel classifications. The estimated area fractions have a good correspondence with the true area fractions when aggregated to regions of 10 x 10 km(2), especially when the SVR method was used. For the five dominant classes in the test sites the R-2 obtained after the aggregation was 86% (winter cereals), 81% (sunflower), 92% (broad-leaved forest), 89% (maize), and 67% (grasslands) when the SVR method was used.

M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - BackgroundSeveral new medications have shown improved survival rates in high-risk patients with melanoma.ObjectiveThe aim of this article is to discuss the new medications and outline their roles, the expected benefit from each and the risk of adverse events. We explain the place of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration (US-FNA) in assessing and treating patients with melanoma.DiscussionIpilimumab has limited efficacy and a very concerning complication profile. More than 50% of patients taking ipilimumab have severe or life-threatening adverse events. BRAF inhibitors have greater efficacy and fewer adverse events than ipilimumab. Combining BRAF inhibitors with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors enhances their effect and improves the overall adverse event profile. BRAF inhibitors are only effective when the melanoma has a BRAF gene mutation, something that occurs in only 50% of cases. Programmed cell death protein 1 medications are also more effective and have a much more acceptable adverse event profile than ipilimumab. Both SLNB and US-FNA can detect early node involvement in patients with melanoma, although US-FNA is a safer procedure.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - BackgroundMaximising survival for patients with invasive melanoma hinges on early diagnosis of primary melanoma and appropriate management. Despite well-documented guidelines, many patients with melanoma have not been managed ideally.ObjectiveThe aim of this paper is to identify suboptimal aspects of melanoma management.DiscussionDelayed or erroneous diagnosis is more likely to occur when a shave or punch biopsy is used to obtain histopathology. Wherever feasible, local excision with a narrow margin is the preferred biopsy choice for a suspected melanoma. The Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma remains the greatest predictor of outcome. Ulceration is associated with a poorer prognosis. Most invasive melanomas are managed with a margin of >= 10 mm of normal tissue. Patients who have developed one primary melanoma are at high risk of a second tumour. Ongoing management includes regular lifelong skin checks. Targeted approaches to improve occupational or lifestyle exposure to ultraviolet radiation are useful. Imaging is largely used when metastases are suspected on the basis of clinical symptoms or signs.

TI  - Zirconia layers: Structure, residual stress and fracture strength
T2  - ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanical strength of zirconia layers on Zy-4 substrate is investigated. Different synthesis routes were used to produce zirconia layers of few micrometers thickness. Microstructures and residual stresses were fully characterized. The results of multiple cracking tests show that the distance between cracks, and the deflection applied at cracking initiation depend only on the full layer thickness, but not on the residual stresses and the microstructure either. Using finite element calculations, the strength of layers was determined. A fracture induced by a crack like defect is accurate with the experimental results if the residual stresses state are not taken into account in the model.

TI  - Improving Preprocedure Time Out Compliance Using Remote Audiovisual Observation
T2  - AORN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Health care organization leaders can help prevent surgical errors by ensuring compliance with standardized preprocedure time outs that require the active participation and engagement of the entire surgical team. Some surgical department leaders have used remote video observation without audio to monitor compliance with the time out. After a sentinel event occurred, leaders at our large academic medical center initiated a quality improvement project to audit compliance with the standardized preprocedure time out. We used remote audiovisual observation to ensure that all members of the procedure team were adhering strictly to the elements of the preprocedure time out in all invasive procedure areas. Since the beginning of this remote auditing process, team member compliance with the standardized preprocedure time out has improved.

TI  - Chelonid Alphaherpesvirus 5 DNA in Fibropapillomatosis-Affected Chelonia mydas
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibropapillomatosis is a panzootic and chronic disease among Chelonia mydas-usually associated with anthropogenic impacts. This study contributes towards understanding fibropapillomatosis implications for C. mydas populations as a reflector of environmental quality, via prevalence and histological, molecular and blood analyses at a World Heritage site in southern Brazil. Sixty-three juvenile C. mydas (31.3-54.5 cm curved carapace length-CCL) were sampled during two years. Eighteen specimens (similar to 29%) had tumours (which were biopsied), while 45 had none. Degenerative changes in the epidermis and Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 DNA detection with three variants support a herpesvirus infection. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that variants A and B were similar to a herpesvirus lineage from the Atlantic group, but variant C was similar to a herpesvirus from the eastern Pacific lineage and represents the first published case for marine turtles off Brazil. Significantly lower levels of seven blood parameters, but greater numbers of eosinophils, were observed in tumour-afflicted animals. These observations were attributed to metabolism efficiencies and/or differences in diet associated with temporal-recruitment bias and disease development, and greater non-specific immune stimulation. While most animals had adequate body condition independent of disease, longer-term studies are required to elucidate any protracted population effects.

TI  - Spatial modeling of an urban Brazilian heat island in a tropical continental climate
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because climate aspects should be an important consideration when structuring urban spaces, this paper reports the results of combined field measurements and surface sensing data analyzed using statistical calculations. This was undertaken with the goal of detecting intra-urban air temperature patterns in a Brazilian city with a tropical continental climate (Paranavai, Parana State) through spatial modeling of an urban heat island. The air temperature data used were collected through mobile transects and used with Landsat 8 satellite as well as SRTM radar images for direct correlations of surface features (land use, NDVI, hypsometry and surface temperature). The model was executed in the IDRISI program based on linear regression and a final multi-criteria regression. In analyzing the heat island effect in Paranavai, significant differences were found. The municipal public policy implemented in 2005 that chiefly addresses urban tree planting is assumed to have positive effects and can be considered as an example for other tropical cities. Based on our collective analyses and assessment, the modeling results lead to the conclusion that satisfactory results can be obtained by associating measured field data with surface characteristics, which represents an advance in the spatialization of local climatic data.

TI  - Tectonic Analysis of Lineaments in the Gara Anticline, Kurdistan, Northern Iraq
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images were used to interpret the tectonic origin of lineaments in the Gara anticline. This anticline is one of the largest structures in the Zagros fold-thrust belt of Iraqi Kurdistan, near the northeastern boundary of the Arabian Plate. Lineaments of the Gara anticline were visually mapped on QuickBird images using the ESRI ArcGIS software and automatically extracted from Landsat 8 OLI data using the lineament extraction (LINE) module of PCI Geomatics software. The linear features obtained by both methods were statistically analyzed according to their orientation, length, frequency and density to provide a useful quantitative framework for interpreting the tectonic origin of these structures. Lineament orientations indicate a good symmetric relationship to the hinge of the Gara anticline. The results obtained from both techniques show five major sets: a hinge-perpendicular extension set (N 05 degrees E), a hinge-parallel extension set (N 85 degrees W) and three hinge-oblique shear-hybrid sets (N 45 degrees E, N 45 degrees W and N 75 degrees E). These dominant trends are consistent with previous field studies. Most of the lineaments in the Gara anticline are tectonic in origin and probably developed during the growth of the Gara anticline by a regional N-S-directed compression in the Mid Miocene time.

AB  - This letter proposes a new method for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) denoising. More precisely, it seeks to address a new statistical approach for weights computation in nonlocal (NL) approaches. The aim is to present a simple criterion using M-estimators and to detect similar pixels in an image. A binary hypothesis test is used to select similar pixels which will be used for covariance matrix estimation together with associated weights. The method is then compared with an advanced state-of-the-art PolSAR denoising method named NL-SAR. The filter performances are measured by a set of different indicators, including relative errors on incoherent target decomposition parameters, coherences, polarimetric signatures, and edge preservation on a set of simulated PolSAR images. Finally, results for RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data are presented.

TI  - An Efficient Approach to Remove Thick Cloud in VNIR Bands of Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-free remote sensing images are required for many applications, such as land cover classification, land surface temperature retrieval and agricultural-drought monitoring. Cloud cover in remote sensing images can be pervasive, dynamic and often unavoidable. Current techniques of cloud removal for the VNIR (visible and near-infrared) bands still encounters the problem of pixel values estimated for the cloudy area incomparable and inconsistent with the cloud-free region in the target image. In this paper, we proposed an efficient approach to remove thick clouds and their shadows in VNIR bands using multi-temporal images with good maintenance of DN (digital number) value consistency. We constructed the spectral similarity between the target image and reference one for DN value estimation of the cloudy pixels. The information reconstruction was done with 10 neighboring cloud-free pair-pixels with the highest similarity over a small window centering the cloudy pixel between target and reference images. Four Landsat5 TM images around Nanjing city of Jiangsu Province in Eastern China were used to validate the approach over four representative surface patterns (mountain, plain, water and city) for diverse sizes of cloud cover. Comparison with the conventional approaches indicates high accuracy of the approach in cloud removal for the VNIR bands. The approach was applied to the Landsat8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image on 29 April 2016 in Nanjing area using two reference images. Very good consistency was achieved in the resulted images, which confirms that the proposed approach could be served as an alternative for cloud removal in the VNIR bands using multi-temporal images.

TI  - A Framework for Global Characterization of Soil Properties Using Repeat Hyperspectral Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging spectroscopy offers the potential to quantify the soil properties over large areas based on its reflectance spectra. Soils are heterogeneous mixtures of minerals, air, water, and organic matter leading to complex manifestations of reflectance in the different parts of the visible-shortwave infrared spectra. Due to this complexity, data-driven modeling approaches are found to be most suitable for characterizing the relationships between soil spectra and the corresponding soil properties. Proposed spaceborne hyperspectral missions, such as Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, offer the possibility of repeating global spectral measurements in a 16- to 20-day revisit period. Soil attributes on the landscape vary at different rates. In particular, the soil textural attributes (percentage of sand, silt, and clay) may be assumed to remain invariant compared to chemical constituents during multiple consecutive 16-to 20-day satellite revisit period. We present a theoretical retrieval framework for assimilating repeat spaceborne soil spectral measurements into a previously developed lasso algorithm-based ensemble modeling framework for the global-scale characterization of soil textural attributes. The repeat spectral assimilation with each overpass of the satellite leads to the development of an enriched "dynamic soil spectral library" which spatially propagates the improvement in the characterization of soil textural properties globally, given the uncertain variations in other auxiliary factors, such as moisture and organic matter, affecting soil reflectance.

TI  - Stand density and carbon storage in cypress-tupelo wetland forests of the Mississippi River delta
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested wetlands play a vital role in the coastal zone, but their vulnerability to coastal change-and the impact to high-value ecosystem services-is not as well established as that of more seaward systems such as saltmarsh and mangroves. To address this need, we develop field-based stand density classes, then classify baldcypress-water tupelo (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich var. distichurm Nyssa aquatica L) stand density on the Mississippi River delta using a multitemporal ordination of reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Approximately 29, 50, and 21% of forest was classified as full canopy, intermediate, and open canopy, respectively. We estimate stand-level live-stem carbon stocks and annual accumulation rates of 96, 67, and 39 t-C ha(-1) and 1.9, 1.4 and 0.8 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for full-canopy, intermediate, and open-canopy forest, respectively. Regional live-stem carbon stocks are similar to 69 t-C ha(-1), and total carbon and annual increment for all forest analyzed are similar to 17 Mt-C and similar to 0.34 Mt-C yr-1. Much of the cypress-tupelo forest on the delta stores carbon at rates significantly below the potential of fully stocked stands, yet overall rates of accumulation are comparable to other forest types and coastal systems. Delta-wide, there is a well-defined coastward gradient of stand density, which has important implications for the future of deltaic forests and their ecosystem services. The similarities between forest density gradients and well-documented marsh loss patterns in the region suggest that the same processes driving coastal marsh loss-relative sea level rise exacerbated by human activity-are likely responsible for a second, more gradual interface of land loss at the marsh-forest boundary. Results highlight the potential response of coastal forests to continued environmental change-and associated impacts to the carbon cycle-and provide a baseline for detecting future change to forests on the Mississippi River delta.

TI  - Extent of Forest Depletion from 1986-2015 as a Consequence of Land use in Andoni Local Government Areas of Rivers State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigated the extent of forest depletion between 1986 and 2015 in Andoni LGA, Rivers State, Nigeria. Landsat images of 1986, 2000 and 2015 were employed for the study. Image classifications were done in Erdas Imagine using supervised classification with maximum likelihood module whereby six major classes of landuse were identified namely forest, built up area, waterbodies, mangrove, cultivated land, and bareground/sand. The area in square kilometers of each land use type in each year was computed in ArcGIS 10.0 and simple calculations were used to compute the change and percentage change of each landuse from one period to the other. Landuse probability of change to other landuse in 2025, 2035 and 2045 were done Idrisi Selva 17.0. Findings showed that forest coverage was 125.95 km(2) (39.56%) in 1986 and 74.14 km(2) (23.29%) in 2015. Forest, cultivated land, and waterbodies decreased by 41.14%, 80.8% and 76.52% while built up area, mangrove and bareground/sand increased by 303.64%, 18.67% and 3.64% from 1986 to 2015. Bareground/sand and built-up areas replaced forest with 21.23 km(2) (38.40%) and 20.26km(2) (3.64%) respectively. The study predicted that 3.68% of bareground/sand, 0.47% of mangrove and 3.51% of built up area had probability of replacing forest by 2025 while 5.09%, 2.1% and 7.32% of bareground/sand, mangrove and built up area had the probability of changing to forest by 2045. The study recommended that strict legislation, policies and strategies should be put in place to protect the forests from undue exploitation. Copyright (C) 2019 Eludoyin et al.

TI  - Discussing suicidality with depressed patients: an observational study in Dutch sentinel general practices
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This paper aims to describe the degree to which general practitioners (GPs) explore suicidal behaviour among depressed patients in the Netherlands.Design An observational study of consultations between GPs and depressed patients.Setting 39 sentinel GP practices within the Netherlands in 2017.Participants Patients with a registration of depression.Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome measure is suicide exploration by the GP. Secondary outcome measures at patient level, assessed by surveying GPs, include prevalence and severity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures at GP level include follow-up actions of GP and reasons not to explore suicidality.Results A total of 1034 questionnaires were included in the analyses. GPs assessed and explored suicidality in 44% of patients with depression (66% in patients with a new episode of depression). GPs explored suicidal feelings more often in patients with a new episode of depression (OR 4.027, p<0.001, 95% CI 2.924 to 5.588), male patients (OR 1.709, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.256 to 2.330) or younger patients (OR 1.017, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.009 to 1.026). Multilevel analysis showed that 22% of the variation in suicide exploration is due to differences in GP practice. Thirty-eight per cent of the patients who were asked by their GP, reported (severe) suicidal ideation. Most GPs (68%) did not explore suicidal feelings because they thought the patient would not be suicidal.Conclusion GPs explored suicidal thoughts in less than half of all depressed patients and in two-thirds of patients with a new episode of depression. Suicide prevention training is recommended to enhance suicide exploration.

TI  - Disentangling Climate and Disturbance Effects on Regional Vegetation Greening Trends
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity of northern latitude forests is an important driver of the terrestrial carbon cycle and is already responding to climate change. Studies of the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for northern latitudes indicate recent changes in plant productivity. These detected greening and browning trends are often attributed to a lengthening of the growing season from warming temperatures. Yet, disturbance-recovery dynamics are strong drivers of productivity and can mask direct effects of climate change. Here, we analyze 1-km resolution NDVI data from 1989 to 2014 for the northern latitude forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for changes in plant productivity to address the following questions: (1) To what degree has greening taken place in the GYE over the past three decades? and (2) What is the relative importance of disturbance and climate in explaining NDVI trends? We found that the spatial extents of statistically significant productivity trends were limited to local greening and browning areas. Disturbance history, predominately fire disturbance, was a major driver of these detected NDVI trends. After accounting for fire-, insect-, and human-caused disturbances, increasing productivity trends remained. Productivity of northern latitude forests is generally considered temperature-limited; yet, we found that precipitation was a key driver of greening in the GYE.

TI  - Prospective Multicenter Feasibility Study of Laparoscopic Sentinel Basin Dissection after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Early Gastric Cancer: SENORITA 2 Trial Protocol
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Although standard radical gastrectomy is recommended after noncurative resection of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer in most cases, residual tumor and lymph node metastasis have not been identified after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of sentinel node navigation surgery after noncurative ESD. Materials and Methods: This trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter prospective phase II trial. Patients who underwent ESD for clinical stage T1N0M0 gastric cancer with noncurative resections were eligible. Qualified investigators who completed the prior phase III trial (SENORITA 1) are exclusively allowed to participate. In this study, 2 detection methods will be used: 1) intraoperative endoscopic submucosal injection of dual tracer, including radioisotope and indocyanine green (ICG) with sentinel basins detected using gamma-probe; 2) endoscopic injection of ICG, with sentinel basins detected using a fluorescence imaging system. Standard laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy will be performed. Sample size is calculated based on the inferior confidence interval of the detection rate of 95%, and the calculated accrual is 237 patients. The primary endpoint is detection rate, and the secondary endpoints are sensitivity and postoperative complications. Conclusions: This study is expected to clarify the feasibility of laparoscopic sentinel basin dissection after noncurative ESD. If the feasibility is demonstrated, a multicenter phase III trial will be initiated to compare laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery versus laparoscopic standard gastrectomy in early gastric cancer after endoscopic resection.

TI  - Monitoring Variation in Sea Surface Temperature in the Nakdong River Estuary, Korea, Using Multiple Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual and monthly sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the coastal waters around Nakdong River, Korea, were analyzed using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. SST values derived from MODIS data were consistent with the in-situ data (R-2 = 0.63), whereas Landsat-derived SST values were moderately correlated with in-situ data (R-2 = 0.44). The mean annual SST over 18 years was 21.7 degrees C. The coldest temperatures were recorded in 2001, and the warmest were recorded in 2016. SSTs were higher during the summer than in the winter, mainly because of higher air temperatures in summer. Across all years, March was the coldest month, with a mean SST of 14.4 degrees C, whereas August was the warmest month at 28 degrees C. As MODIS data have a spatial resolution of 4 km, it cannot be used to detect SST variation at fine spatial scales (least 100 m or less). However, it can be monitored temporal trends in SST. Spatially detailed SST variation was monitored using Landsat data. According to the Landsat data, warm SSTs were measured in the area extending from the southwest to northeast of the Nakdong Estuary, which is an area affected by the Kuroshio Current. Climate data are needed in addition to image data to accurately monitor SST variation in the future.

TI  - Fakhr al-Din al-Razi on the Question 'Why Worship God?'
T2  - JOURNAL OF QURANIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A recurring concern of Fakhr (d. 606/1210) in his Qur'anic commentary, al-Tafsir al-kabir, is the presentation of an intellectual justification for the all-important Islamic doctrine that God alone is deserving of worship. When surveying al-Razi.' s arguments, they turn out to follow the same general line of reasoning: he who is creator is deserving of worship. This, however, might be seen to entail a difficulty (which al-Razi himself was actually aware of) in that unless God is the only creator, it does not seem clear why He alone, and no other entity, should be deserving of worship. The following question thus arises: do al-Razi's arguments hinge on an occasionalist worldview? Or do they allow for secondary causality?This article discusses some of the arguments al-Razi puts forward in the Tafsir for God's sole right to be worshipped. In doing so, special attention is paid to the position on causality that underlies them. It will be seen that al-Razi presents various arguments, some of which rest on an occasionalist worldview, and some of which assume secondary causality. Interestingly, his line of argument changes depending on the underlying position. The reasons as to why al-Razi presents arguments based on two mutually exclusive positions (one of which he himself does not subscribe to) are also addressed.

TI  - Light as a Significant Concept of Medieval Religious Consciousness (As Exemplified in 'The Hagiography of Theodosius of the Kyiv Caves')
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the linguistic forms of representation of the concept of light in a work of religious content XII-XIII centuries. "The Lives of Theodosius of the Caves." Under the influence of the Christian worldview, the concept of light is enriched and saturated with new meanings, the idea of the positive properties of which has developed in mythological consciousness. The method of conceptual analysis of lexical units used in the research process allows us to draw conclusions about the linguistic picture of the world of the medieval man, his spiritual and moral values, and the methods of component and contextual analysis allow us to characterize the semantic content of the lexemes of the studied field. The juxtaposition of light and darkness is a significant conceptual opposition with an axiological orientation. For the consciousness of a medieval man, light is understood as a phenomenon of the physical plane associated with the divine plan. Representatives of the lexical and semantic group 'light' are examined in contexts and not only the frequency of their use is shown, but also a place in the religious picture of the world, since it is the concept of 'light' that occupies one of the key places in it, entering the field of the concept of 'holiness". Light is one of the most significant attributes of God, and its distribution to a person testifies to the chosenness and holiness. The use of a large number of lexemes with light meaning in characterizing Theodosius reflects the religious picture of the world of the Middle Ages. Along with the lexeme light, the monument analyzes both the derivatives of the given basis of the form with various word-formation meanings: personal, abstract, tool, and other LSG 'light' lexical units. The adjective light, which has a wide range of meanings and is used to characterize the most significant church events, plays a special role in the text of the "The Lives". Functionally, the lexemes of this group perform not only a nominative, but also an expressive function, have a pronounced appreciation, and are part of stable formulas that perform text-forming functions in works of church subjects. The results of the study can be applied in the practice of linguistic and ethnolinguistic analysis of the basic concepts of Russian culture, they refine the data on the evolution of a person's views on the idea of light in Russian culture, thereby are important for the development of ethnolinguistics, linguoculturology, cognitive science.

TI  - Detection of Urban Development in Uyo (Nigeria) Using Remote Sensing
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Uyo is one of the fastest-growing cities in Nigeria. In recent years, there has been a widespread change in land use, yet to date, there is no thorough mapping of vegetation change across the area. This study focuses on land use change, urban development, and the driving forces behind natural vegetation loss in Uyo. Based on time series Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) image data, the relationships between urban land development and its influencing factors from 1985 to 2018 were analyzed using remote sensing (RS) and time series data. The results show eight land use cover classes. Three of these (forest, swamp vegetation, and mixed vegetation) are related to natural vegetation, and three (sparse built-up, dense built-up, and borrow pit) are direct consequences of urban infrastructure development changes to the landscape. Swamp vegetation, mixed vegetation, and forest are the most affected land use classes. Thus, the rapid growth of infrastructure and industrial centers and the rural and urban mobility of labor have resulted in an increased growth of built-up land. Additionally, the growth pattern of built-up land in Uyo corresponds with socioeconomic interviews conducted in the area. Land use changes in Uyo could be attributed to changes in economic structure, urbanization through infrastructure development, and population growth. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis shows a trend of decreasing vegetation in Uyo, which suggests that changes in economic structure represent a key driver of vegetation loss. Furthermore, the implementation of scientific and national policies by government agencies directed at reducing the effects of urbanization growth should be strengthened, in order to calm the disagreement between urban developers and environmental managers and promote sustainable land use.

TI  - An Exploration of Latina/o Respondent Scores on the Personality Assessment Inventory
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite broad agreement regarding the need for multicultural considerations in applied practice, to date there continues to be a relative scarcity of research on underrepresented groups and personality assessment. This exploratory study is an initial comparison of non-clinical Latino (N=97) and European American (EA) (N=123) college students on selected scales of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey 1991). Latinos were hypothesized to produce higher scores than EAs on PAI scales reflecting worldview, spirituality, fatalism, family orientation, interpersonal style, experience of stress, and social environment. The selected PAI scales addressed socially desirable responding (Positive Impression Management - PIM); approach to completing the PAI (Infrequency - INF); health concerns (Somatic Complaints - SOM); traumatic and phobic endorsement (Anxiety Related Disorders - ARD); hypervigilance, persecution, and resentment (Paranoia - PAR); unusual and bizarre conceptions and beliefs (Schizophrenia - SCZ); perceived lack of social support (Non-Support - NON); current or recent life stressors (Stress - STR); relational style (Interpersonal Warmth - WRM); and an overall measure of psychological distress (Mean Clinical Elevation - MCE). Results revealed Latinos produced significantly higher scores than EAs on the INF, ARD, PAR, SCZ, NON, and STR scales. Contrary to hypothesis, EAs produced higher WRM scores. Overall, even in this non-clinical student sample, when compared to EAs, the Latino participants produced scores indicative of greater psychological distress and psychopathology (MCE). This exploratory study can inform future research with Latinos and the PAI and offers considerations and cautions for clinical use of the measure.

TI  - RegisTree: a registration algorithm to enhance forest inventory plot georeferencing
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageThe accuracy of remote sensing-based models of forest attributes could be improved by controlling the spatial registration of field and remote sensing data. We have demonstrated the potential of an algorithm matching plot-level field tree positions with lidar canopy height models and derived local maxima to achieve a precise registration automatically.ContextThe accuracy of remote sensing-based estimates of forest parameters depends on the quality of the spatial registration of the training data.AimsThis study introduces an algorithm called RegisTree to correct field plot positions by matching a spatialized field tree height map with lidar canopy height models (CHMs).MethodsRegisTree is based on a point (field positions) to surface (CHM) adjustment approach modified to ensure that at least one field tree position corresponds to CHM local maxima.ResultsRegisTree has been validated with respect to positioning errors and the performance of lidar-derived estimation of plot volume. Overall, RegisTree enabled to register field plots surveyed in a range of forest conditions with a precision of 1.5m (1.23m), but a higher performance for conifer plots, and a limited efficiency in homogeneous stands, having similar heights. Improved plot positions were found to have a limited impact on volume predictions under the range of tested conditions, with a gain up to 1.3%.Conclusion RegisTree could be used to improve the forest plot position from field surveys collected with low-grade GPS and to contribute to the development of processing chains of 3D remote sensing-based models of forest parameters.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variations in satellite-based soil moisture and vegetation indices over Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a crucial role in vegetation growth. However, the long-term influence of soil moisture on vegetation growth was not sufficiently understood in many regions, especially in developing countries, due to the lack of ground measurements. Remote sensing data provide a promising way to overcome this limitation. In this study, a long-term spatiotemporal variation in remote sensing surface soil moisture (SSM) and vegetation indices (VIs) and their relationship during 1988-2015 were analyzed over Iran. Trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall test was applied for the detection of the trends in soil moisture and VIs time series. Also, the validity of the dry gets drier, wet gets wetter (DGDWGW) paradigm was examined throughout the country. Finally, the consistency between SSM and vegetation indices trends was investigated using homogeneity Chi-squared test. The results showed that the monthly average of the SSM over 45% of Iran is lower than 0.15m(3)/m(3). Seasonal average of SSM is 0.17 and 0.12m(3)/m(3) in spring and winter, respectively. On average, monthly SSM trends are downward in 70% of Iran, which 30% of those is statistically significant. Over the past 28years, about 50% and 35% of Iran got drier with rates of 0.24x10(-2) (spring) and 0.78x10(-3) (summer) m(3)/m(3) per year. According to DGDWGW paradigm examining, 14% of Iran follows the DGDWGW paradigm. Summer and spring normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index values are less than 0.1 in about 45% and 65% of the areas, respectively. The NDVI values are decreased in 40% of Iran in the last 28years, of which half of those are statistically significant. SSM trends were consistent with vegetation indices using a homogeneity test. About 45% of SSM trends agree in sign with NDVI values. Life zone in the Southeast of Iran is arid desert scrubs, and in this area with sparse vegetation cover, mixing the spectral of soil and vegetation causes a serious problem in vegetation indices representing therefore the prominent mismatch between SSM and vegetation indices trends which were observed in Southeast of Iran.

TI  - The diameter of metastasis in positive sentinel lymph node biopsy affects axillary tumor load in early breast cancer
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after positive sentinel lymph biopsy (SLNB) has become a standard procedure for breast cancer patients with one or two metastatic lymph nodes. Here the aim was model development for selection for ALND. Material and methods We analyzed 323 positive SLNB breast cancer patients, who afterwards underwent ALND. In 126 (39%), there were positive additional axillary lymph nodes. Specimens of resected lymph nodes were scanned and the volumes of tumors (expressed as diameter in mm) were calculated. The maximal diameter of metastasis in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNDmax) and axillary lymph nodes (ALN(Dsum)) indicated tumor load in the resected lymph nodes. ALN(Dsum) higher or equal to 5 mm was defined as high and present in 62 patients (21%). Results Risk factors for high ALN(Dsum) were primary tumor diameter (P = 0.0092), histopathological type (P = 0.0173), number of positive SLNs (P = 0.0012), type of metastasis (P = 0.0025), molecular type (P = 0.0037), SLNDmax (P = 0.0001), and Her-2 status (P = 0.0093). Independent variables for high ALN(Dsum) were SLNDmax (P < 0.0001), number of positive SLNs (P = 0.0237) and primary tumor diameter (P = 0.0296). Conclusions Twenty-one percent patients with positive SLNB are at risk of high ALN(Dsum). SLNDmax is the strong predictive factor for high ALN(Dsum) after positive ALND.

TI  - Refined Model-Based and Feature-Driven Extraction of Buildings from PolSAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) building extraction plays an important role in urban planning, disaster management, etc. In this paper, a building extraction method using refined model-based decomposition and robust scattering feature is proposed. On the one hand, the newly proposed refined five-component decomposition and its derived scattering powers are applied to detect the buildings. On the other hand, by combining the matrix elements and co-polarization correlation coefficient, a robust feature is proposed to discriminate buildings and non-buildings. Both these two preliminary extraction results are obtained through thresholding segmentation. Finally, they are fused via the HX Markov random fields so as to further improve the extraction accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated with Gaofen-3 and uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR full PolSAR data over different test sites. Outputs show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and provides an overall accuracy of over 90%.

TI  - Comparative analyzes and use of evapotranspiration obtained through remote sensing to identify deforested areas in the Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) with a focus on the influence of the current level of Amazonian deforestation through comparative statistics of different land cover. The study area comprised the state of Rondonia, Brazil, which was subdivided into homogeneous regions regarding ET using cluster analysis. In addition, we analyzed the use of a logistic regression model to create deforestation maps in the Amazon based on ET fields. We used orbital data on ET and land cover type from the MOD16 product and the Amazon Forest Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES), respectively, considering the period from 2000 to 2014. The cluster analysis results showed that for the study area, three homogeneous sub-regions were sufficient to represent the ET variability, mainly considering the intensity and seasonal pattern of this process. Regarding the impacts after changing from forest to deforested area, the analyses indicated that the ET of deforested areas decreased by an average of 28% in the dry period and increased by 4% in the rainy season. The effects observed in the rainy season were not significant at 5% significance according to the Student t-test, unlike the dry period, which presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). In general, the results indicated that MOD16 data can provide a satisfactory representation of the change in ET in large areas of the Brazilian Amazon. Logistic regression analysis showed that the spatial pattern of deforestation can be identified by biophysical factors such as ET with 87% accuracy, despite the spatial/temporal variability present in the region. These results support this approach as an effective tool for spatial identification of Amazonian deforestation.

TI  - Flood hazard assessment and mapping of River Swat using HEC-RAS 2D model and high-resolution 12-m TanDEM-X DEM (WorldDEM)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most devastating and recurring natural hazards and have caused extensive economic losses to human lives and infrastructures around the world. Swat valley in northern Pakistan is prone to frequent floods and was severely affected by the Flood2010 in the recent past. Flood hazard assessment is a non-structural strategy for flood mitigation in addition to the structure measure. In this study, 60 km long reach of the River Swat (Khwazakhela Bridge-Chakdara Bridge) was modeled using the HEC-RAS 2D model and high-resolution 12-m WorldDEM. The model was calibrated and validated for only historical maximum flood event, i.e., Flood2010 using Manning's 'n' values, flood stage at the Chakdara Bridge and satellite imagery-based Flood2010-observed extent. In addition, flood model sensitivity to the DEM was carried out and simulated maximum depth was 12, 13, 14, and 25 m for the 12-m WorldDEM, 30-m SRTM, 30-m ALOS and 30-m ASTER DEMs, respectively. Designed hydrographs were prepared for 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year return periods based on the Flood2010-observed hydrograph. Finally, the model was simulated for 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year return periods with full momentum equation as the calculation method. Simulated extents based on the 12-m WorldDEM were used for the preparation of flood hazard maps. Landcover exposure to the designed flood events shows that agriculture including orchards is the major potential affected class with affected areas up to 55 Km(2). The developed flood hazard maps will enable the policy makers to mainstream flood hazard assessment in the planning and development process for mitigating flood hazard in Swat Valley.

TI  - Assessment of rainwater harvesting sites in a part of North-West Delhi, India using geomatic tools
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was conducted with an aim to provide practical solution for the groundwater management in three villages namely Singhola, Ghoga and Dhirpur of the North-West Delhi, India. LANDSAT remote-sensing datasets for the last four decades (1977-2018) were assessed to determine changes in vegetation cover at the selected sites. The Google Earth Engine was used to determine how values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were found to have varied spatially and over time for the selected sites. Strong correlations were found between the NDVI values of surface features including waterbodies, forest land, agricultural land and urban areas in Singhola, Ghoga and Dhirpur, respectively. The relative infiltration capacity of soils was highest (92.9%) and lowest (57%) for Singhola and Dhirpur, respectively, due to spatial differences in soil texture. In each village, locations exhibiting a higher soil infiltration capacity could be used for implementing managed aquifer recharge schemes using rainwater harvested from rooftops in the villages. This assessment indicated that the village of Ghoga has the highest potential (3,76,98,013.08m(3)) for aquifer recharge through rooftop rainwater harvesting as compared to the other two villages.

TI  - Predation pressure in maize across Europe and in Argentina: an intercontinental comparison
T2  - INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Humankind draws important benefits from large-scale ecological processes termed ecosystem services, yet the status of several of them is declining. Reliable monitoring methods are essential for tracking the status of ecosystem services. Predation is the mainstay of natural pest control, a key ecosystem service. We used green plasticine caterpillars to monitor predation pressure, and to obtain baseline data on predator activity in transgenic Bt versus non-Bt maize fields in Old and New World countries. Predation pressure was measured at ground and canopy levels using an identical, small-plot experimental design in four European countries (Denmark, Slovakia, Romania and Italy) and Argentina. Total predation rate in maize was 11.7%d(-1) (min. 7.2%d(-1) in Argentina, max. 29.0%d(-1) in Romania). Artificial caterpillars were attacked both by invertebrates (mostly chewing insects with 42.0% of the attack marks, and ants with 7.1%, but also predatory and parasitoid wasps, spiders and slugs), and vertebrates (small mammals 25.5%, and birds 20.2%). Total predation at ground level (15.7%d(-1)) was significantly higher than in maize canopies (6.0%d(-1)) in all countries, except Argentina. We found no significant differences between predator pressure in Bt versus non-Bt maize plots. The artificial caterpillar method provided comparable, quantitative data on predation intensity, and proved to be suitable for monitoring natural pest control. This method usefully expands the existing toolkit by directly measuring ecological function rather than structure.

T2  - Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map and analyze the habitat suitability of orangutan species based on remote sensing image technology, in the forest area of Hulu Sungai Utara Regency, South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The total area suitable for orangutan habitat in the forest area of Hulu Sungai Utara Regency is 4,950 hectares. Based on the results of the field survey and analysis of Citra Sentinel-2, the location of suitable habitat for orangutans is visually located within peatswamp forests or peatswamp shrub and bushes. The use of the thresholding method for quantitative parameters of habitat, from the results of this study, can be seen to be quite efficient in mapping areas suitable for orangutan habitat. However, to improve the accuracy of the mapping, in the future it is necessary to consider conducting a prior statistical analysis before thresholding. For example data normality test, data homogeneity test, and data correlation test.

TI  - Analysis of Possible Triggering Mechanisms of Severe Thunderstorms in the Tropical Central Andes of Peru, Mantaro Valley
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study is to analyze the triggering mechanisms of three thunderstorms (TSs) associated with severe rainfall, hail and lightening in the tropical central Andes of Peru, specifically above the Huancayo observatory (12.04S, 75.32 W, 3313 m a.s.l.) located in the Mantaro valley during the spring-summer season (2015-2016). For this purpose, we used a set of in-situ pluviometric observations, satellite remote sensing data, the Compact Meteorological Ka-Band Cloud Radar (MIRA-35C), the Boundary Layer Tropospheric Radar and downscaling model simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (resolutions: 18 km, 6 km and 2 km), and the Advance Regional Prediction System (ARPS) (resolution: 0.5 km) models in order to analyze the dynamic of the atmosphere in the synoptic, meso and local scales processes that control the occurrence of the three TS events. The results show that at synoptic scale, the TSs are characterized by the southern displacement of the South-east Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone up to latitudes higher than 35S, by the weakening and south-eastern displacement of the Bolivian high-North east low system and by the intrusion of westerly winds along the west side of the central Andes at upper and medium levels of the atmosphere. At meso-scale, apparently, two important moisture fluxes from opposite directions are filtered through the passes along the Andes: one from the north-west and the other from the south-east directions converge and trigger the deep convection into the Mantaro valley. These moisture fluxes are generated by the intrusion of the sea-breeze from the Pacific ocean along the west of the Andes coupling with upper and middle westerly winds and by the thermally induced moisture fluxes coming from the South American low level jet at the east side of the Andes. At the local scale, there is a low-level conditional instability in the previous hours as well as during the occurrence of the TSs above the Huancayo observatory. In addition, the simulation results indicated the possibility of generation of inertial gravity waves in the Amazon basin, associated with geostrophic adjustment which transports energy and moisture into the central Andes plateau and consequently intensifies the thunderstorms above the Mantaro valley.

T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Oncologic outcomes with nipple-sparing mastectomy continue to be established. The authors examine oncologic trends, outcomes, and risk factors, including tumor-to-nipple distance, in therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomies.Methods: Demographics, outcomes, and overall trends for all nipple-sparing mastectomies performed for a therapeutic indication from 2006 to 2017 were analyzed. Oncologic outcomes were investigated with specific focus on recurrence and associated factors, including tumor-to-nipple distance.Results: A total of 496 therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomies were performed, with an average follow-up time of 48.25 months. The most common tumor types were invasive carcinoma (52.4 percent) and ductal carcinoma in situ (50.4 percent). Sentinel lymph node sampling was performed in 79.8 percent of nipple-sparing mastectomies; 4.1 percent had positive frozen sentinel lymph node biopsy results, whereas 15.7 percent had positive nodal status on permanent pathologic examination. The most common pathologic cancer stage was stage IA (42.5 percent) followed by stage 0 (31.3 percent). The rate of local recurrence was 1.6 percent (n = 8), and the rate of regional recurrence was 0.6 percent (n = 3). In all, 171 nipple-sparing mastectomies had magnetic resonance imaging available with which to assess tumor-to-nipple distance. Tumor-to-nipple distance of 1 cm or less (25.0 percent versus 2.4 percent; p = 0.0031/p = 0.1129) and of 2 cm or less (8.7 percent versus 2.0 percent; p = 0.0218/p = 0.1345) trended to higher rates of locoregional recurrence. In univariate analysis, tumor-to-nipple distance of 1 cm or less was the only significant risk factor for recurrence (OR, 13.5833; p = 0.0385). No factors were significant in regression analysis.Conclusions: In early stage and in situ breast carcinoma, therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomy appears oncologically safe, with a locoregional recurrence rate of 2.0 percent. Tumor-to-nipple distances of 1 cm or less and 2 cm or less trended to higher recurrence rates.

This paper presents an approach to assess urban indicators such as green volume and soil sealing with very high accuracy and based on a wide range of different sensors (aerial stereo images, QuickBird, WorldView 2 and 3, Sentinel 2, HRSC, LIDAR). A framework using regression tree methods was developed and successfully applied in a case study (the city of Potsdam, Germany) resulting in a long time series dating back 25 years. The methodology offers the opportunity to analyze urban development in detail and to understand the functional relationships of urban planning processes. Demands for effective climate change adaptation, especially in terms of reducing heat stress, can thus be better defined.

TI  - Impact of Fractional Calculus on Correlation Coefficient between Available Potassium and Spectrum Data in Ground Hyperspectral and Landsat 8 Image
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the level of potassium can interfere with the normal circulation process of biosphere materials, the available potassium is an important index to measure the ability of soil to supply potassium to crops. There are rarely studies on the inversion of available potassium content using ground hyperspectral remote sensing and Landsat 8 multispectral satellite data. Pretreatment of saline soil field hyperspectral data based on fractional differential has rarely been reported, and the corresponding relationship between spectrum and available potassium content has not yet been reported. Because traditional integer-order differential preprocessing methods ignore important spectral information at fractional-order, it is easy to reduce the accuracy of inversion model. This paper explores spectral preprocessing effect based on Grunwald-Letnikov fractional differential (order interval is 0.2) between zero-order and second-order. Field spectra of saline soil were collected in Fukang City of Xinjiang. The maximum absolute of correlation coefficient between ground hyperspectral reflectance and available potassium content for five mathematical transformations appears in the fractional-order. We also studied the tendency of correlation coefficient under different fractional-order based on seven bands corresponding to the Landsat 8 image. We found that fractional derivative can significantly improve the correlation, and the maximum absolute of correlation coefficient under five spectral transformations is in Band 2, which is 0.715766 for the band at 467 nm. This study deeply mined the potential information of spectra and made up for the gap of fractional differential for field hyperspectral data, providing a new perspective for field hyperspectral technology to monitor the content of soil available potassium.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evaluation of inundated areas using MODIS imagery at a catchment scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatiotemporal analysis of surface water is important for managing water resources. The main objectives of this study were: 1) to assess different remote sensing algorithms' ability to accurately determine flood extent using MODIS imagery, and 2) to study the temporal dynamics of inundated areas and corresponding return periods in a large catchment in New South Wales, Australia.The different water detection alternatives used included the Open Water Likelihood (OWL) algorithm, the Brakenridge algorithm for single images (BRAK) and composite images (BRAKC), the Islam methodology (ISL), a combination of Normalized Difference Indices (NDIS), and an ensemble of these. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used as a reference to benchmark the performance of the algorithms. Occurrence probability maps derived from inundation images and estimated flood extent frequency curves were compared against the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset of the Joint Research Centre.The ISL methodology indicated the best performance compared with "ground truth" inundated images derived from Landsat, while the temporal performance of the BRAK algorithm indicated significant noise based on daily imagery. The remaining approaches generally matched stream discharge peaks. Maximum cross-correlation coefficients between daily discharge and inundated areas were calculated for different time lags, indicating high spatial variability across the catchment. Accumulated rainfall accounted for up to 40 and 60% of the variation in inundation extent in daily and composite images, respectively. The ensemble technique outperformed the other algorithms to describe the dynamics of flooding, followed by the NDIS and ISL algorithms. The occurrence probability images and flood frequency curves indicated a higher inundation extent than the GSW product for return periods greater than two years, which can be explained by the different temporal resolutions. The results of this study can be applied in water resources planning and flood mitigation efforts.

TI  - Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA in tissue from primary cervical cancer tumor, pelvic lymph nodes and recurrent disease
T2  - PAPILLOMAVIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genotyping in primary tumor, pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) and recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer patients.Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. From 2003 to 2015, 282 patients underwent surgery for cervical cancer in the Department of Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Twenty-nine recurrent cases were identified. HPV DNA genotyping was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the primary tumor, PLN, and recurrent disease.Results: In the primary tumor, HPV DNA was detectable in 18(72%) of 25 tissue specimens from recurrent cases and in 15(83%) of 18 controls. HPV DNA-positive PLN was significantly associated with recurrence, 83%(95%CI: 52-98%), compared to patients with HPV-negative PLN, 38%(95%CI: 18-62%)(p < 0.05). HPV DNA genotyping was positive in eight of 12(67%) patients with recurrent disease. The genotype was identical in all three tissues types.The positive predictive value for recurrence was the same for detection of HPV-DNA and metastases in the PLN, with reasonable sensitivity. The negative predictive value for recurrence, however, was best for HPV-DNA, 62%(95%CI: 38-98%).Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that the presence of HPV in pelvic lymph nodes is associated with an increased risk of recurrence.

TI  - Greek Morphemes in Medical Latin Teaching
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The teaching of the Latin language and medical terminology in universities of medical profile presupposes the formation students' main cultural competencies that help them navigate in the increasingly complex world, reveals their creative abilities and readiness to self-development, and contributes to formation of their clear worldview coordinates. The paper deals with the problem of rather poor language skills of students, and proposes some ways of its solution. The article also provides a historical digression to compare this situation in relation to the pre-revolutionary time and today. The authors have developed and presented methods and techniques of learning of the Greek terminological elements in the Latin medical terminology in the situation when students have not got any knowledge of classical languages. The developed method can be used also in the implementation of educational programmes in other Humanities because of similarities of the situation with linguistic knowledge and because of the main tasks of training not only highly qualified specialists, but also well-rounded individuals.

TI  - Cloud remote sensing with EPIC/DSCOVR observations: A sensitivity study with radiative transfer simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) views nearly the whole sunlit face of the Earth with 10 spectral bands ranging from the UV to the near infrared, including two oxygen absorbing bands centered at 764 nm (A-band) and 687.75 nm (B-band). Clouds are among the primary remote sensing targets using EPIC images because of their important impacts on the Earth's radiation budget. In order to facilitate the EPIC cloud data product development, we have built a radiative transfer simulator featuring flexible cloud microphysical parameters, gas absorptions, and the instrument line shape functions for each EPIC band. The radiative transfer simulator is used to explore the sensitivity of EPIC observations on liquid-phase cloud microphysical parameters, including optical depth, geometric thickness, and cloud top height. We found that the ratios of the reflectances in the oxygen A and B bands to their respective continuum measurements can be used to increase the confidence level of cloud masking over scenes with sun-glint. In addition, the 388 nm band can be used to differentiate low and high clouds with the uncertainty of roughly 2-3 km. Combining this information with the oxygen absorption bands, the cloud geometric thickness can be obtained with the rough uncertainty of 3-4 km. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trends in axillary lymph node dissection for early-stage breast cancer in Europe: Impact of evidence on practice
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data from recently published trials have provided practice-changing recommendations for the surgical approach to the axilla in breast cancer. Patients with T1-2 lesions, treated with breast conservation, who have not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have 1-2 positive sentinel nodes (Z0011-criteria) may avoid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We aim to describe the dissemination of this practice in Europe over an extended period of time.Methods: Our source of data was the eusomaDB, a central data warehouse of prospectively collected information of the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA). We identified cases fulfilling Z0011-criteria from 2005 to 2016 from 34 European breast centers and report trends in ALND. Data derived from Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Netherlands.Results: 6671 patients fulfilled Z0011-criteria. Rates of ALND showed a statistically significant decrease from 2010 (89%) to 2011 (73%), reaching 46% in 2016 (p < 0.001). After multivariable analysis, factors associated with higher probability of ALND were earlier year of surgery, younger age, increasing tumor size and grade, and being operated in Italy (p < 0.001). The minimum and maximal rates of ALND in the most recent two-year period (2015-2016) were 0% and 83% in two centers located in different countries (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Our study demonstrates, a decrease in rates of ALND that started after year 2010 through the end of the study period. Wide differences were observed among centers and countries indicating the need to spread unified clinical guidelines in Europe to allow for homogeneous evidence-based practice patterns.

TI  - Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification Using Kernel Collaborative Representation Based Residual Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new framework is proposed for the fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data based on the extinction profiles (EPs), local binary pattern (LBP), and kernel collaborative representation classification. Specifically, EP and LBP features are extracted from both sources. Then, the derived features of each source are classified by collaborative representation-based classifier with Tikhonov regularization (KCRT). Reconstruction residuals are fused to produce the final label assignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion.

TI  - Inter-/intra-zonal seasonal variability of the surface urban heat island based on local climate zones in three central European cities
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes inter- and intra-zonal seasonal variability of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) within the methodological framework of local climate zones (LCZs) in three central European cities (Prague, Brno and Novi Sad). These cities differ in urban area and structure as well as in topography and hinterland land-cover features. LCZs were delineated on the basis of a GIS-based classification method. Land surface temperature (LST) was derived from LANDSAT-8 scenes in the period 2013-2018. The first step was to detect seasonal SUHI intensity differences for built LCZ types and LST for land-cover types of LCZ. The results revealed the highest differences in summer and spring, and lowest in winter. The highest SUHI intensity values occur in densely built-up and industrial zones, and the lowest in sparsely-built city outskirts. The coolest LCZs based on LST were dense trees and water areas in spring and summer. The second step aimed to analyze the effects of vegetation on SUHI formation. Hence, 11 land cover subclasses (from dense trees to bush/scrub) were defined in order to research intra-zonal seasonal LST variability. The height and density of vegetation have substantial effects on intra-zonal variability of LST in land-cover types of LCZ, whereas differences between forest subclasses were relatively low. Finally, the character of the vegetation had a substantial influence on intra-zonal LCZ variability of LST and SUHI formation. Further research in this field could contribute to better understanding of micro- and mezzo-climate-scale patterns, as well as better adaptation to climate change in urban areas.

TI  - Snow line elevation variability under the effect of climate variations in the Zagros Mountains: case study of Oshtorankooh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zagros Mountains are one of the key water sources for Iran and recession of the snow line would have an impact on regional water resources. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) data obtained from 2000 to 2016 to investigate the upward retreat of the Temporary Snow Line Elevation (TSLE) for the months with the greatest snowfall and highest snow lines (December, January, and February) in the Oshtorankooh region. In addition, to gain a better insight into the impact of recent climate change on the snow cover in Oshtorankooh and its TSLE variations, the Mann-Kendall and TSA non-parametric tests were used for the time period 2000-2016. The results showed an upward retreat of the TSLE. The ground surface temperature observations analyzed using the MODIS data show a temperature increase of 0.52-0.99 degrees C (Aqua MODIS) and 0.82-1.12 degrees C (Terra MODIS) in the same time period. According to the Mann-Kendall and TSA methods, climatic parameters have changed during recent years in most of the studied stations and climate change is responsible for Oshtorankooh TSLE variation, so that the TSLE during the studied statistical period demonstrated an upward movement in four orientations (North, South, East, West).The largest variation between December and the other months (January and February) was observed between 2004 and 2016 247.18 km(2), 76.05 km(2), and 249.64 km(2), respectively.

TI  - Remote sensing image fusion via compressive sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing-based method to pan-sharpen the low-resolution multispectral (LRM) data, with the help of high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) data. In order to successfully implement the compressive sensing theory in pan-sharpening, two requirements should be satisfied: (i) forming a comprehensive dictionary in which the estimated coefficient vectors are sparse; and (ii) there is no correlation between the constructed dictionary and the measurement matrix. To fulfill these, we propose two novel strategies. The first is to construct a dictionary that is trained with patches across different image scales. Patches at different scales or equivalently multiscale patches provide texture atoms without requiring any external database or any prior atoms. The redundancy of the dictionary is removed through K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD). Second, we design an iterative l(1) - l(2) minimization algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to seek the sparse coefficient vectors. The proposed algorithm stacks missing high-resolution multispectral (HRM) data with the captured LRM data, so that the latter is used as a constraint for the estimation of the former during the process of seeking the representation coefficients. Three datasets are used to test the performance of the proposed method. A comparative study between the proposed method and several state-ofthe-art ones shows its effectiveness in dealing with complex structures of remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Assessment of desertification in Eritrea: land degradation based on Landsat images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective way in monitoring desertification dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we used a decision tree method based on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index), and vegetation cover proportion to quantify and analyze the desertification in Eritrea using Landsat data of the 1970s, 1980s and 2014. The results demonstrate that the NDVI value and the annual mean precipitation declined while the temperature increased over the past 40 a. Strongly desertified land increased from 4.82x10(4) km(2) (38.5%) in the 1970s to 8.38x10(4) km(2) (66.9%) in 2014: approximately 85% of the land of the country was under serious desertification, which significantly occurred in arid and semi-arid lowlands of the country (eastern, northern, and western lowlands) with relatively scarce precipitation and high temperature. The non-desertified area, mostly located in the sub-humid eastern escarpment, also declined from approximately 2.1% to 0.5%. The study concludes that the desertification is a cause of serious land degradation in Eritrea and may link to climate changes, such as low and unpredictable precipitation, and prolonged drought.

T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) and Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) dynamics at the regional scale is of fundamental importance to many hydrological and ecological studies. This need becomes even more critical in arid and semi-arid regions, where there are a lack of in situ observations. In this regard, satellite-based Soil Moisture (SM) data is promising due to the temporal resolution of acquisitions and the spatial coverage of observations. Satellite-based SM products are only able to estimate moisture from the soil top layer; however, linking SSM with RZSM would provide valuable information on land surface-atmosphere interactions. In the present study, satellite-based SSM data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are first compared with the few available SM in situ observations, and are then coupled with the Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) model to estimate RZSM in Iran. The comparison between in situ SM observations and satellite data showed that the SMAP satellite products provide more accurate description of SSM with an average correlation coefficient (R) of 0.55, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.078 m(3) m(-3) and a Bias of 0.033 m(3)( )m(-3). Thereafter, the SMAP satellite products were coupled with SMAR model, providing a description of the RZSM with performances that are strongly influenced by the misalignment between point and pixel processes measured in the preliminary comparison of SSM data.

TI  - Sampling strategies for monitoring and evaluation of morbidity targets for soil-transmitted helminths
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The current World Health Organization (WHO) target for the three major soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections is to reduce prevalence of moderate-to-heavy infections to below 1% by 2020. In terms of monitoring and evaluation (M&E), the current WHO guidelines for control of STHs recommend evaluation of infection levels in school-age children (SAC) after five to six years of preventive chemotherapy (PC), using the standard Kato-Katz faecal smear. Here, we assess the predictive performance of various sampling designs for the evaluation of the morbidity target.Methodology/Principal findings Using two mathematical models for STH transmission and control, we simulate how the number of villages and SAC sampled affect the ability of survey results in sentinel villages to predict the achievement of the morbidity target in PC implementation units (e.g. district). As PC is stopped when the prevalence of infection in SAC in sentinel villages is less than 1%, we estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of this indicator for meeting the morbidity target in the whole district. The PPV varies by species and PC strategy, and it is generally higher in areas with lower pre-control prevalence. Sampling a fixed number of SAC spread out over 10 instead of 5 sentinel villages may increase the PPV by up to 20 percentage points. If every SAC in a village is tested, a higher number of villages may increase the PPV by up to 80 percentage points. Increasing the proportion of SAC tested per village does not result in a relevant increase of PPV.Conclusions/Significance Although the WHO guidelines provide a combined strategy to control the three STH species, the efficacy of PC strategies clearly differs by species. There is added value in considering more villages within implementation units for M&E of morbidity targets, the extent varying by STH species. A better understanding of pre- and post-control local STH prevalence levels is essential for an adequate M&E strategy including the definition of morbidity targets at the appropriate geographical scale.Author summary Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) affect approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide. The World Health Organization target for STHs is to achieve <1% prevalence of moderate-to-heavy infection among school-age children (SAC) through preventive chemotherapy (PC) with albendazole or mebendazole. For monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of STH infections, it is recommended to assess the infection levels in SAC after five to six years of treatment and to stop PC if the prevalence of infection is <1%. In this study, we use two mathematical models to assess the predictive performance of different sampling designs for the evaluation of the morbidity target. We find that the efficacy of PC strategies differs significantly by species and pre-control infection levels. Achieving 1% prevalence of infection in sentinel villages may still imply a prevalence of moderate-to-heavy infections >1% in the entire PC implementation unit. Evaluating the prevalence of any infection over a higher number of sentinel villages improves the accuracy in assessing the morbidity target at the implementation unit level, even when a lower proportion of SAC per village is tested. A better understanding of pre- and post-control local STH prevalence levels through large scale data collection is essential for the definition of an adequate M&E strategy for STH control.

TI  - Assessment of Texture Features for Bermudagrass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>) Detection in Sugarcane Plantations
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane products contribute significantly to the Brazilian economy, generating U.S. $12.2 billion in revenue in 2018. Identifying and monitoring factors that induce yield reduction, such as weed occurrence, is thus imperative. The detection of Bermudagrass in sugarcane crops using remote sensing data, however, is a challenge considering their spectral similarity. To overcome this limitation, this paper aims to explore the potential of texture features derived from images acquired by an optical sensor onboard anunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect Bermudagrass in sugarcane. Aerial images with a spatial resolution of 2 cm were acquired from a sugarcane field in Brazil. The Green-Red Vegetation Index and several texture metrics derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix were calculated to perform an automatic classification using arandom forest algorithm. Adding texture metrics to the classification process improved the overall accuracy from 83.00% to 92.54%, and this improvement was greater considering larger window sizes, since they representeda texture transition between two targets. Production losses induced by Bermudagrass presence reached 12.1 tons x ha(-1) in the study site. This study not only demonstrated the capacity of UAV images to overcome the well-known limitation of detecting Bermudagrass in sugarcane crops, but also highlighted the importance of texture for high-accuracy quantification of weed invasion in sugarcane crops.

TI  - A Multi-dimensional Measure of Environmental Behavior: Exploring the Predictive Power of Connectedness to Nature, Ecological Worldview and Environmental Concern
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we examine the multi-dimensional structure of environmental behavior and its potential domains. Factor analysis reveals six behavioral domains: civic actions, policy support, recycling, transportation choices, behaviors in a household setting and consumerism. We use the Connectedness to Nature and Inclusion of Nature in Self scales to measure connection with nature, the New Environmental Paradigm to measure ecological worldviews, and Environmental Motives Scale to assess people's environmental concern. We further explore the predictive power of connectedness to nature, ecological worldview, and environmental concern for explaining the diverse behavioral domains. Connectedness to nature and ecological worldview were more predictive of civic actions, recycling, household behaviors, and consumerism than were environmental concerns. In the case of policy support and transportation choices, environmental concerns explained more variance than the other constructs.

TI  - Analyzing the urbanization in the protection area of the Bosphorus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Istanbul, being one of the oldest and crowded cities in the world bridging the Asia and Europe continents, is ranked as the 15th populated mega city among the 75 largest metropolitans in the world as a result of the rapid population growth since the year of 1950. The stated growth caused a significant need for housing, therefore new settlements have been built in and around the city threating water resources, protected areas, and sensitive lands such as agricultural areas, forests, wetlands in the city. As a result of these adverse developments, the Bosphorus zone, which has a historical and geographical importance for Istanbul, was declared as a protected zone for stopping the threat of unplanned urbanization along the Bosphorus. The Bosphorus area were divided in to two protection zones as Back View and Front View Zones by the laws in terms of the stated protection plan. The main goal of this study is to examine the changes in settlement areas in the protected zones of Bosphorus specifically in Sariyer District. In this context, Landsat imageries dated 2005 and 2017 were used to determine the urban sprawl during 12 years in the protection zone of Bosphorus. The results of the study introduced 10% decrease in the forest and green lands from 2005 to 2017 while 8% and 11% increase in settlements and the other land use classes respectively. In order to perform more detailed analyses of this change, a detailed study was performed for Front and Back View Zones of Bosphorus in Sariyer district using 2005 and 2017 dated IKONOS satellite images. The map of Sariyer district produced in 1960 was considered as the reference data source as well as image for detecting the changes in the study area during 57 years in two periods. The results of the study outlined that the settlements in the study area increased 173% and 142% for two periods from 1960 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2017 respectively. The increase in settlement areas caused a decrease in forests and green lands in the study area. In particular, the study introduced the illegal settlement area increase in the protection zones of the Bosphorus based on the Bosphorus Law No. 2960 in Sariyer District.

TI  - Precise Onboard Real-Time Orbit Determination with a Low-Cost Single-Frequency GPS/BDS Receiver
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-cost single-frequency GNSS receiver is one of the most economical and affordable tools for the onboard real-time navigation of numerous remote sensing small/micro satellites. We concentrate on the algorithm and experiments of onboard real-time orbit determination (RTOD) based on a single-frequency GPS/BDS receiver. Through various experiments of processing the real single-frequency GPS/BDS measurements from the Yaogan-30 (YG30) series and FengYun-3C (FY3C) satellites of China, some critical aspects of the onboard RTOD are investigated, such as the optimal force models setting, the effect of different measurements, and the impact of GPS/BDS fusion. The results demonstrate that a gravity model truncated to 55 x 55 order/degree for YG30 and 45 x 45 for FY3C and compensated with an optimal stochastic modeling of empirical accelerations, which minimize the onboard computational load and only result in a slight loss of orbit accuracy, is sufficient to obtain high-precision real-time orbit results. Under the optimal force models, the real-time orbit accuracy of 0.4-0.7 m for position and 0.4-0.7 mm/s for velocity is achievable with the carrier-phase-based solution, while an inferior real-time orbit accuracy of 0.8-1.6 m for position and 0.9-1.7 mm/s for velocity is achieved with the pseudo-range-based solution. Furthermore, although the GPS/BDS fusion only makes little change to the orbit accuracy, it increases the number of visible GNSS satellites significantly, and thus enhances the geometric distribution of GNSS satellites that help suppress the local orbit errors and improves the reliability and availability of the onboard RTOD, especially in some anomalous arcs where only a few GPS satellites are trackable.

TI  - Comparison of peak oxygen consumption response to aquatic and robotic therapy in individuals with chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injury: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - SPINAL CORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Study design: Randomized dual center controlled clinical trial.Objective: To determine and compare the cardiorespiratory impact of 3 months of aquatic and robotic therapy for individuals with chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injury (CMISCI).Settings: Two rehabilitation specialty hospitals.Methods: Thirty-one individuals with CMISCI with neurological level between C2-T12 at least 1 year post injury were randomized to either aquatic or robotic treadmill therapy for 36 sessions. Customized sessions lasted 40-45 min at 65-75% heart rate reserve intensity with peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) measured during arm ergometry at baseline and post intervention. Additional peak robotic treadmill VO2 assessments were obtained before and after training for participants randomized to robotic intervention.Results: Peak VO2 measured with arm ergometry was not significantly different with either aquatic intervention (8.1%, p = 0.14, n = 15) or robotic intervention (-0.7%, p = 0.31, n = 17). Peak VO2 measured with robotic treadmill ergometry demonstrated a statistical improvement (14.7%, p = 0.03, n = 17, two-tailed t-test) across the robotic intervention. Comparison between the two interventions demonstrated a trend favoring aquatic therapy for improving arm ergometry peak VO2 (ANOVA, p = 0.063).Conclusions: Neither 3-month exercise interventions statistically improved arm cycle ergometry peak VO2, our cardiorespiratory surrogate marker, although percent improvement was greater in the aquatic exercise condition. Robotic ergometry peak VO2 did improve for the robotic intervention, confirming previous work. These results suggest that either intervention may hold utility in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in CMISCI, but peak VO2 measurement technique appears critical in detecting effects.

TI  - Seasonal evaluation of downscaled land surface temperature: A case study in a humid tropical city
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates the seasonal variation of estimated error in downscaled land surface temperatures (LST) over a heterogeneous urban land. Thermal sharpening (TsHARP) downscaling algorithm has been used with a separate combination of four selected remote sensing indices. This study assesses the capability of TsHARP technique over mixed land use/land covers (LULC) by analyzing the correlation between LST and remote sensing indices, namely, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) and by determining the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) produced by downscaled LST. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images have been used for pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons in 2014 covering the whole Raipur City, India. The RMSE of the downscaled LST decreases from 120 to 480 m spatial resolution in all the four seasons. It is concluded that NDBI is the most effective LULC index having the least error produced in TsHARP downscaling technique, irrespective of any season. Post-monsoon season reflects the most successful result followed by monsoon season. Even in the monsoon season of high vegetation coverage, NDBI presents a lower range of downscaled error compared to NDVI. This indicates better performance of NDBI in detecting the spatial and temporal distribution of mixed urban land.

T2  - GAZZETTA MEDICA ITALIANA ARCHIVIO PER LE SCIENZE MEDICHE
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumour in women worldwide. Morbidity and mortality increases with age, significantly after the age of 45. Early detection of the disease is vital. The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer today is significantly advanced. Magnetic resonance imaging has revolutionised diagnostics. If a biopsy shows invasive lobular carcinoma or even ductal carcinoma in situ, it is necessary to perform an magnetic resonance scan to rule out multicentricity or an extensive intraductal component, which may affect the surgical approach. Prognosis and treatment of breast cancer today depends on four molecular subtypes: Luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple negative. Guidelines for surgical and oncological treatment today have also changed, patients with locally or systemically advanced breast cancer, with a tumour larger than 2.5 cm, confirmed as HER-2 positive or triple negative from biopsy results, should be subjected to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and after the tumour is reduced, to surgery, at which point the operation can be considerably less involved than before. Furthermore, in the case of a positive sentinel lymph node, formerly mandatory axillary dissection can be replaced by axillary radiotherapy today with comparable prognosis and survival rate. Of new surgical techniques, skin-sparing mastectomy is worth mentioning, while intraoperative radiotherapy will be the future of treatment. The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer has been significantly advanced. This review have revealed the current treatment of breast cancer on surgical, oncological fiels as well as in diagnosis.

TI  - Customization and Validation of a Regional Climate Model Using Satellite Data Over East Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the customization of the fourth generation International Center for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model version 4.4 and its ability to reproduce the mean climate and most dominant modes of variability over East Africa. The simulations were performed at a spatial resolution of 25 km for the period 1998-2013. The model was driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. The customization focus was on cumulus and microphysics schemes during the Short Rains for the year 2000. The best physics combinations were then utilized for the validation studies. The East Africa region and Lake Victoria Basin region are adapted to carry out empirical orthogonal function analysis, during the Short and Long Rains. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data was utilized in the validation of the model. The first mode of variability from the model and observational data during the Short Rains was associated with the warming of the Pacific Ocean and the sea surface temperature gradients over the Indian Ocean. During the Long rains, the inter-annual rainfall variability over the Lake Victoria region was associated with the sea surface temperature anomaly over the Indian Ocean and for the East Africa region the associations were weak. The drivers during the Long Rains over East Africa region were then further investigated by splitting the season to the March-April and May periods. The March-April period was positively correlated to the West Pacific and Indian Ocean dipole index, while May was associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. In conclusion, although the model can reproduce the dominant modes of variability as in the observational data sets during the Short Rains, skill was lower during the Long Rains.

TI  - Liver Macrophages: Old Dogmas and New Insights
T2  - HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Inflammation is a hallmark of virtually all liver diseases, such as liver cancer, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cholangiopathies. Liver macrophages have been thoroughly studied in human disease and mouse models, unravelling that the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system is more versatile and complex than previously believed. Liver macrophages mainly consist of liver-resident phagocytes, or Kupffer cells (KCs), and bone marrow-derived recruited monocytes. Although both cell populations in the liver demonstrate principal functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis, danger signal recognition, cytokine release, antigen processing, and the ability to orchestrate immune responses, KCs and recruited monocytes retain characteristic ontogeny markers and remain remarkably distinct on several functional aspects. While KCs dominate the hepatic macrophage pool in homeostasis ("sentinel function"), monocyte-derived macrophages prevail in acute or chronic injury ("emergency response team"), making them an interesting target for novel therapeutic approaches in liver disease. In addition, recent data acquired by unbiased large-scale techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, unraveled a previously unrecognized complexity of human and murine macrophage polarization abilities, far beyond the old dogma of inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite tremendous progress, numerous challenges remain in deciphering the full spectrum of macrophage activation and its implication in either promoting liver disease progression or repairing injured liver tissue. Being aware of such heterogeneity in cell origin and function is of crucial importance when studying liver diseases, developing novel therapeutic interventions, defining macrophage-based prognostic biomarkers, or designing clinical trials. Growing knowledge in gene expression modulation and emerging technologies in drug delivery may soon allow shaping macrophage populations toward orchestrating beneficial rather than detrimental inflammatory responses.

AB  - Cloud detection algorithms have emerged to automate image data analysis because of its prime influential factor in remote sensing image quality. Cloud detection algorithm still needs domain-expert intervention and large number of training examples to ensure good performance whose acquirement becomes difficult due to unavailability of labeled data as well as the time and process heads involved. The paper puts forward multi-objective social spider optimization (MOSSO) based efficient clustering technique to detect clouds in the visible range. This paper explains the proposed MOSSO algorithm along-with the analysis carried on 14 benchmark two-objective test problems against MOEA/D, MODE, MOPSO and SPEA2 multi-objective algorithms. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and have been used for the implementation of an efficient clustering technique named as MOSSO-C. Optimal centroid matrix for clustering is attained in MOSSO-C through environmental selection whose performance evaluation has been done on six synthetic databases and are compared with above mentioned conventional multi-objective algorithms. The obtained results encourage the use of MOSSO-C technique to get labeled data for training process of neural network classifier. This approach efficiently classifies the cloudy pixels against various Earth's surfaces (water, vegetation and land). The paper also discusses the performance evaluation of proposed technique on four Landsat 8 data which shows on an average 96.37% performance accuracy in detecting cloudy pixels.

TI  - Hippocampus and basal ganglia as potential sentinel sites for ischemic pathology after resuscitated cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims of the study: Neurological impairment after resuscitated cardiac arrest (CA) remains a significant unmet medical need. Brain ischemia associated with CA and subsequent reperfusion is evident as two fundamentally different types of damage on neuropathological examination: frank necrosis (involving all cell types) and selective eosinophilic neuronal death (SEND). These types of damage are not only dissimilar in micromorphology, but also differently detectable with clinical brain imaging methods. In a previous study, SEND was reported in most patients surviving the initial CA. This study was undertaken to further characterize and map SEND in an expanded dataset.Methods: A cohort of 46 cases was included from an observational study on targeted temperature management (TTM) of resuscitated CA. Six brain and brain stem regions and 21 subregions were examined, and SEND severity was tested for correlation with time to ROSC. Representativity of all regions vis-a-vis global SEND was assessed, to investigate whether any particular region could be used as a "sentinel site" for overall damage.Results: The thalamus, the CA4 subregion of the hippocampus and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum were the most severely affected subregions. Involvement of the hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex or basal ganglia indicated presence of SEND in other regions. There was a significant correlation between time to ROSC and SEND.Conclusion: There are regional differences in SEND distribution. Cases free of SEND in the hippocampus or basal ganglia are unlikely to have significant SEND in other regions, suggesting that these regions could be used as "sentinel sites" for global SEND in future studies.

TI  - Proposed Smooth-STC Algorithm for Enhanced Coverage Path Planning Performance in Mobile Robot Applications
T2  - ROBOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Robotic path planning is a field of research which is gaining traction given the broad domains of interest to which path planning is an important systemic requirement. The aim of path planning is to optimise the efficacy of robotic movement in a defined operational environment. For example, robots have been employed in many domains including: Cleaning robots (such as vacuum cleaners), automated paint spraying robots, window cleaning robots, forest monitoring robots, and agricultural robots (often driven using satellite and geostationary positional satellite data). Additionally, mobile robotic systems have been utilised in disaster areas and locations hazardous to humans (such as war zones in mine clearance). The coverage path planning problem describes an approach which is designed to determine the path that traverses all points in a defined operational environment while avoiding static and dynamic (moving) obstacles. In this paper we present our proposed Smooth-STC model, the aim of the model being to identify an optimal path, avoid all obstacles, prevent (or at least minimise) backtracking, and maximise the coverage in any defined operational environment. The experimental results in a simulation show that, in uncertain environments, our proposed smooth STC method achieves an almost absolute coverage rate and demonstrates improvement when measured against alternative conventional algorithms.

TI  - Biophysical parameter assessment of winter crops using polarimetric variablesentropy (H), anisotropy (A), and alpha (α)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study brings out the potential of SAR polarimetric time series data for the study of crop biophysical parameter assessment of major winter field crops in India. We examined the entropy-alpha-anisotropy approach in radar polarimetric C-band data and related the polarimetric parameters to the biomass to understand the interaction of microwave signal with the major winter crops across dominant biomass ranges in India. The crop phenology response in terms of the changes in polarimetric parameters like entropy (H), anisotropy (A), and alpha () angle and their derived parameters has been studied for dominant winter field crops like wheat, mustard, and gram with variation in their variables like biomass. A trend is established emerging from this study which shows that entropy, alpha, and anisotropy for agricultural areas are closely related to the growth rate of the crops and their phenological stages. This paper outlines a methodology for using RADARSAT-2 full-polarimetric data for vegetation (winter crops) monitoring using the abovementioned standard polarimetric parameters for understanding crop vigor and phenology. The polarimetric parameters were observed to be more dynamic in wheat (H 0.45 to 0.8) than in mustard (H 0.6 to 0.85) in December to February data though late sown crop of mustard showed a higher range with respect to their biomass.

TI  - Spatially distributed crop model based on remote sensing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop models are useful tools in investigating crop yield and water consumption and thus far, they have been well-developed in field applications. Moreover, their regional applications have evolved from lumped models to distributed models by considering the spatial variation in soil, climate, crop, and management measures to some extent. With the advent of modernized and refined farming and water management, the spatial variation of environment-related initial and crop parameters of models should be appropriately reflected. On this basis, this study performs spatial inversion of sowing date, maximum canopy coverage CCx, and relative biomass B-rel based on the AquaCrop-GIS model and by using remote sensing data. These parameters are incorporated as independent spatial variables into the distributed AquaCrop-GIS model to produce a remote sensing-based distributed AquaCrop-RS crop model, which will be validated with the corn data in the middle oasis of Heihe River. Findings suggest that the initial condition-sowing date and crop parameters CCx, and B-rel exhibit considerable spatial variation, the introduction of sowing date has a considerable influence on the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET), and crop parameters CCx and B-rel have a considerable influence on yield simulation accuracy. In comparison with the traditional AquaCrop-GIS model, the simulation accuracy of AquaCrop-RS model is generally improved by 5%-26% in regional ET and by 35%-72% in regional yield.

TI  - Spatial distribution and genesis of salt on the saline playa at Qehan Lake, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland salt lakes and saline wetlands are intricate systems in which moisture and salinity are continuously changing and especially sensitive to climate change and human pressure. Remote sensing helps to monitor the dynamic changes in the moisture and salinity of salt lakes and saline wetlands. Based on the Landsat 8 satellite data, this paper developed a multivariable linear regression model (MLRM) to predict the spatial distribution of salt on the saline playa at the Qehan Lake in Inner Mongolia, China. The developed MLRM used the remote sensing spectral indices and the Tasseled Cap Transformation wetness band (TCTW) as a variable. By using the TCTW and the surface temperature inversion data, the response of salt to surface moisture and temperature in the dry lake bed was explored. The results showed: The MLRM with brightness index (BI) and the TCTW as the auxiliary variables has the nice applicability (R-adj(2) = 0.598, RMSE = 1.640). The MLRM established using the vegetation index NDVI may be more applicable to environments where vegetation and salts were doped-together. Salt distribution in the Qehan Lake may be controlled by flat lake bed and miniature piedmonts. There was a significant correlation between measured soil electrical conductivity (EC) and TCTW, but no correlation with surface temperature. The influence of surface temperature on salt may be biased towards the time scale.

TI  - New Workflow of Plastic-Mulched Farmland Mapping using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using plastic film mulch on cropland improves crop yield in water-deficient areas, but the use of plastic film on cropland leads to soil pollution. The accurate mapping of plastic-mulched land (PML) is valuable for monitoring the environmental problems caused by the use of plastic film. The drawback of PML mapping is that the detectable period of PML changes among the fields, which causes uncertainty when supervised classification methods are used to identify PML. In this study, a new workflow which merging PML of multiple temporal phases (MTPML) is proposed. For each temporal phase, the possible PML is firstly generated, these temporal possible PML layers are then combined to generate the possible PML layer. Finally, the maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the growing season is used to remove the non-cropland pixels from the possible PML layer, and then generate PML images. When generating temporal possible PML layers, three new PML indices (PMLI with near-infrared bands known as PMLI_NIR, PMLI with shortwave infrared bands known as PMLI_SWIR, and Normalized Difference PMLI known as PMLI_ND) are proposed to separate PML from bare land at plastic film cover stage; and the temporal possible PML layer are identified by the threshold based method. To estimate the performance of the three PML indices, two other approaches, PMLI threshold and Random Forest (RF) are used to generate temporal possible PML layer. Finally, PML images generated from the five MTPML approaches are compared with the image time series supervised classification (SUPML) result. Two study regions, Hengshui (HS) and Guyuan (GY), are used in this study. PML identification models are generated using training samples in HS and the models are used for PML mapping in both study regions. The results showed that MTPML workflow outperformed SUPML with 3%-5% higher classification accuracy. The three proposed PML indices had higher separability and importance score for bare land and PML discrimination. Among the five approaches used to generate the temporal possible PML layer, PMLI_SWIR is the recommended approach because the PMLI_SWIR threshold approach is easy to implement and the accuracy is only slightly lower than the RF approach. It is notable that no training sample was used in GY and the accuracy of the MTPML approach was higher than 85%, which indicated that the rules proposed in this study are suitable for other study regions.

TI  - Cumulative disturbances to assess forest degradation using spectral unmixing in the northeastern Amazon
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Question Tropical forests are subject to disturbances by logging, gathering of fuelwood, and fires. Can degradation trajectories (i.e. cumulative disturbances events over a period of timer) be identified using remote-sensing Landsat time series? Location Paragominas (Para, Brazil), a municipality covering 19,395 km(2) in the north-eastern Amazon. Methods We used Landsat annual imagery from 2000 to 2015 and spectral mixture analysis to derive time series of the fraction of soil (S), active photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and non-photosynthetic vegetation (senescent) (NPV) indicators. Results The NPV values over a 16-year period revealed five different degradation trajectories (i.e., cumulative disturbances in space and over time): undisturbed forest, selectively logged forest (with a management plan), overlogged forest (no management plan), overlogged forest (charcoal production) and burned forest. The variance of NPV calculated per pixel over the same period is useful to map forest degradation over Paragominas municipality, highlighting the role of disturbance factors (logging, fuelwood gathering and fire). Conclusions The fractional cover of NPV obtained from spectral mixture analysis can be used to differentiate degradation trajectories and to map forest degradation.

TI  - Worsening Health Status among Evacuees: Analysis of Medical Expenditures after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster in Fukushima
T2  - TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - After Fukushima disaster in 2011, the health status of the region's residents deteriorated. We analyzed the health status, care needs, and access to health services among evacuees and non-evacuees using healthcare expenditure (for self-employed and unemployed individuals aged < 75 years) and long-term care expenditure (mainly for individuals aged >= 65 years). Fukushima Prefecture was divided into four areas according to their evacuation status: non-EOAs (municipalities that did not include evacuation order areas (EOAs)); EOAs/non-EOAs (municipalities that included both EOAs and non-EOAs); short-term EOAs (municipalities where the EOA designation was lifted in most areas by fiscal year (FY) 2011); and long-term EOAs (municipalities where most EOA designations remained in place until the end of FY 2015). Increases in expenditure on healthcare and long-term care per capita in short-term and long-term EOAs were greater in FY 2015 than the average values in FYs 2008-2010. The increases in expenditure were higher in short-term and long-term EOAs than those in non-EOAs and EOAs/non-EOAs. The increases in dental health expenditure were attributed to enhanced accessibility to dental health facilities. Furthermore, the evacuations contributed to increases in healthcare and long-term care expenditure, independent of aging and improved accessibly to health facilities. Possible explanations for these increases include the poor health status of the evacuees following the evacuations, reduced availability of informal care provided by family members and neighbors, and reduced patient copayments. The findings highlight the necessity of health promotion among evacuees.

TI  - Clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance at the wildlife-livestock-human interface in Nairobi: an epidemiological study
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance is one of the great challenges facing global health security in the modern era. Wildlife, particularly those that use urban environments, are an important but understudied component of epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We investigated antimicrobial resistance overlap between sympatric wildlife, humans, livestock, and their shared environment across the developing city of Nairobi, Kenya. We use these data to examine the role of urban wildlife in the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance.Methods 99 households across Nairobi were randomly selected on the basis of socioeconomic stratification. A detailed survey was administered to household occupants, and samples (n=2102) were collected from the faeces of 75 wildlife species inhabiting household compounds (ie, the household and its perimeter; n=849), 13 livestock species (n=656), and humans (n=333), and from the external environment (n=288). Escherichia coli, our sentinel organism, was cultured and a single isolate from each sample tested for sensitivity to 13 antibiotics. Diversity of antimicrobial resistant phenotypes was compared between urban wildlife, humans, livestock, and the environment, to investigate whether wildlife are a net source for antimicrobial resistance in Nairobi. Generalised linear mixed models were used to determine whether the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant phenotypes and multidrug-resistant E coli carriage in urban wildlife is linked to variation in ecological traits, such as foraging behaviour, and to determine household-level risk factors for sharing of antimicrobial resistance between humans, wildlife, and livestock.Findings E coli were isolated from 485 samples collected from wildlife between Sept 6,2015, and Sept 28, 2016. Wildlife carried a low prevalence of E coli isolates susceptible to all antibiotics tested (45 [9%] of 485 samples) and a high prevalence of clinically relevant multidrug resistance (252 [52%] of 485 samples), which varied between taxa and by foraging traits. Multiple isolates were resistant to one agent from at least seven antimicrobial classes tested for, and a single isolate was resistant to all antibiotics tested for in the study. The phenotypic diversity of antimicrobial-resistant E coli in wildlife was lower than in livestock, humans, and the environment. Within household compounds, statistical models identified two interfaces for exchange of antimicrobial resistance: between both rodents, humans and their rubbish, and seed-eating birds, humans and their rubbish; and between seed-eating birds, cattle, and bovine manure.Interpretation Urban wildlife carry a high burden of clinically relevant antimicrobial-resistant E coli in Nairobi, exhibiting resistance to drugs considered crucial for human medicine by WHO. Identifiable traits of the wildlife contribute to this exposure; however, compared with humans, livestock, and the environment, low phenotypic diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant resistance. Wildlife that interact closely with humans, livestock, and both human and livestock waste within households, are exposed to more antimicrobial resistant phenotypes, and could therefore act as conduits for the dissemination of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance to the wider environment. These results provide novel insight into the broader epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in complex urban environments, characteristic of lower-middle-income countries.

TI  - Weather Conditions and Warm Air Masses in Southern Sakha During Active Forest Fire Periods
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a common and destructive natural disaster in Russia. Weather conditions during active forest fire periods in southern Sakha (Eastern Siberia) at high latitudes (58-65 degrees N, 120-140 degrees E) were evaluated. Periods of high fire activity during 2002 to 2016 were identified using MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) hotspot data by considering the number of daily hotspots and their continuity. Weather conditions during the top seven periods of high fire activity were analyzed using atmospheric reanalysis data for upper (500 hPa) and lower levels (925 hPa). Our results showed that active fires occurred under varied weather conditions and it was difficult to find common weather patterns at both upper-and lower-levels during the seven most active fire periods. Furthermore, it was apparent that the northward movement of warm air masses (cTe: continental temperate) from lower latitudes (similar to 40 degrees N) toward southern Sakha tended to exacerbate fires mainly due to strong wind conditions during the seven most active fire periods. In particular, on peak hotspot days, warm air masses from the south existed commonly near southern Sakha. This northward movement of warm air masses can be used to forecast fire and predict future fires in the region.

TI  - Exploring the mechanisms of heat wave vulnerability at the urban scale based on the application of big data and artificial societies
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation has altered the vulnerability of urban areas to heat wave disasters. There is an urgent need to identify the factors underlying the effect of heat waves on human health and the areas that are most vulnerable to heat waves. In this study, we plan to integrate indices associated with heat wave vulnerability based on meteorological observation data, remote sensing data and point of interest (POI) data; analyse the influence of urbanisation on the urban vulnerability environment; and explore the relationship between the vulnerability environment and heat-wave-related mortality. Finally, we attempt to map the spatial distribution of high heat-wave-related mortality risk based on the results of heat wave vulnerability study and artificial society. The results reveal that 1) there are differences in the influence of urbanisation on heat wave exposure, sensitivity and adaptability; 2) the exposure and sensitivity level effects on the lower limit of health impacts and the adaptability level effects on the upper limit of the health impact from heat wave in a given study area; and 3) areas vulnerable to the effects of heat waves are not confined to the city centre, which implies that residents living in suburban areas are also vulnerable to heat waves. Finally, this study not only explores the factors contributing to the impacts of heat waves but also describes the spatial distribution of the risk of disaster-associated mortality, thereby providing direct scientific guidance that can be used by cities to address heat wave disasters in the future.

TI  - Acute surgical wound-dressing procedure: Description of the steps involved in the development and validation of an observational metric
T2  - INTERNATIONAL WOUND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an observational metric that could be used to assess the performance of a practitioner in completing an acute surgical wound-dressing procedure using aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT). A team of clinicians, academics, and researchers came together to develop an observational metric using an iterative six-stage process, culminating in a Delphi panel meeting. A scoping review of the literature provided a background empirical perspective relating to wound-dressing procedure performance. Video recordings of acute surgical wound-dressing procedures performed by nurses in clinical (n = 11) and simulated (n = 3) settings were viewed repeatedly and were iteratively deconstructed by the metric development group. This facilitated the identification of the discrete component steps, potential errors, and sentinel (serious) errors, which characterise a wound dressing procedure and formed part of the observational metric. The ANTT wound-dressing observational metric was stress tested for clarity, the ability to be scored, and interrater reliability, calculated during a further phase of video analysis. The metric was then subjected to a process of cyclical evaluation by a Delphi panel (n = 21) to obtain face and content validity of the metric. The Delphi panel deliberation verified the face and content validity of the metric. The final metric has three phases, 31 individual steps, 18 errors, and 27 sentinel errors. The metric is a tool that identifies the standard to be attained in the performance of acute surgical wound dressings. It can be used as both an adjunct to an educational programme and as a tool to assess a practitioner's performance of a wound-dressing procedure in both simulated and clinical practice contexts.

AB  - Thermal InfraRed (TIR) image data at high temporal and spatial resolution are required to monitor the rapid development of crops during the growing season, taking into account the fragmentation of most agricultural landscapes. Moreover, integrating high-resolution satellite TIR data to calibrate hydrological models is a powerful information to efficiently monitor crop water use. Conversely, no single sensor meets these combined requirements in the TIR spectral region. Data fusion approaches offer an alternative to exploit observations from multiple sensors, providing image data to meet the combined requirements on spatial and temporal resolution. A novel spatio-temporal data fusion workflow based on a multi-sensor multi-resolution algorithm was developed and applied to generate TIR synthetic image data at high temporal and spatial resolution. The workflow includes two steps: in the first step, synthetic daily radiance images at Top of Atmosphere (TOA) and 30-m spatial resolution (at the ground) are generated using TIR radiometric data at TOA collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily 1-km and Landsat 8/TIRS 16-day 30-m. This procedure is applied to two image pairs on different dates. The workflow yields an estimator to generate TIR TOA radiance data on any given date, provided a MODIS radiance image is available. The next step applies constrained unmixing of the 30 m (now considered as low-resolution) TIR images using the information about sub-pixel land cover obtained from co-registered images at higher spatial resolution in the VNIR (Visible Near InfraRed) spectrum. In our case study, the L8/TIRS synthetic image data were unmixed to the Sentinel 2/MSI with 10 m x 10 m spatial resolution. Two geographically diverse experiments were carried out using the same procedure: one in The Netherlands to evaluate the procedure and other in Puglia (Italy) to generate a time series of the 10-m x 10-m TIR image data product. The validation experiment, where an actual TIRS image was applied as a reference, gave a RMSE value of 35.3 W/(m(2) mu m sr), which corresponds to a relative value of 8.5% against the TIRS reference values. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed methodology, which yields a synthetic thermal band to integrate with the multi-spectral data provided by the S2/MSI at 10 m resolution.

TI  - Meta-analysis of deep neural networks in remote sensing: A comparative study of mono-temporal classification to support vector machines
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning methods have recently found widespread adoption for remote sensing tasks, particularly in image or pixel classification. Their flexibility and versatility has enabled researchers to propose many different designs to process remote sensing data in all spectral, spatial, and temporal dimensions. In most of the reported cases they surpass their non-deep rivals in overall classification accuracy. However, there is considerable diversity in implementation details in each case and a systematic quantitative comparison to non-deep classifiers does not exist. In this paper, we look at the major research papers that have studied deep learning image classifiers in recent years and undertake a meta-analysis on their performance compared to the most used non-deep rival, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We focus on mono-temporal classification as the time-series image classification did not offer sufficient samples. Our work covered 103 manuscripts and included 92 cases that supported direct accuracy comparisons between deep learners and SVMs.Our general findings are the following: (i) Deep networks have better performance than non-deep spectral SVM implementations, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) performing better than other deep learners. This advantage, however, diminishes when feeding SVM with richer features extracted from data (e.g. spatial filters). (ii) Transfer learning and fine-tuning on pre-trained CNNs are offering promising results over spectral or enhanced SVM, however these pre-trained networks are currently limited to RGB input data, therefore currently lack applicability in multi/hyperspectral data. (iii) There is no strong relationship between network complexity and accuracy gains over SVM; small to medium networks perform similarly to more complex networks. (iv) Contrary to the popular belief, there are numerous cases of high deep networks performance with training proportions of 10% or less.Our study also indicates that the new generation of classifiers is often overperforming existing benchmark datasets, with accuracies surpassing 99%. There is a clear need for new benchmark dataset collections with diverse spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions and coverage that will enable us to study the design generalizations, challenge these new classifiers, and further advance remote sensing science. Our community could also benefit from a coordinated effort to create a large pre-trained network specifically designed for remote sensing images that users could later fine-tune and adjust to their study specifics.

TI  - Sequencing in High Definition Drives a Changing Worldview of the Epigenome
T2  - COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-molecule sequencing approaches have transformed the study of the human epigenome, accelerating efforts to describe genome function beyond the sequences that encode proteins. The post-genome era has ignited strong interest in the noncoding genome and profiling epigenetic signatures genome-wide have been critical for the identification and characterization of noncoding gene-regulatory sequences in various cellular and developmental contexts. These technologies enable quantification of epigenetic marks through digital assessment of DNA fragments. With the capacity to probe both the DNA sequence and count DNA molecules at once with unparalleled throughput and sensitivity, deep sequencing has been especially transformative to the study of DNA methylation. This review will discuss advances in epigenome profiling with a particular focus on DNA methylation, highlighting how deep sequencing has generated new insights into the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation. Technical aspects of profiling DNA methylation, remaining challenges, and the future of DNA methylation sequencing are also described.

TI  - Sentinel and non-sentinel lymph node metastases in patients with microinvasive breast cancer: a nationwide study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo determine the incidence and risk factors of sentinel lymph node (SN) and non-SN metastases in patients with microinvasive breast cancer (MIBC, T1(mic)). This to identify MIBC patients in whom axillary staging can be safely omitted.MethodsThe Danish Breast Cancer Group database was used to identify a total of 409 women with breast cancer1mm who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2002 and 2015. After validation, 233 patients were eligible for the analysis. The incidence rates of SN and non-SN metastases were determined. The associations between clinicopathological variables and a positive SN [pN1, pN1mi, or pN0(i+)] were analyzed using univariate and multivariate designs.ResultsOf 233 patients with MIBC, only 9 (3.9%) had SN macrometastases. An additional 18 (7.7%) and 23 (9.9%) had SN micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITCs), respectively. Of patients with SN macrometastases, two (22.2%) had non-SN macrometastases. In the adjusted analysis, a positive SN was associated with younger age (P=0.0001) and a positive human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) status (P=0.03).ConclusionsThe low incidence of SN macrometastases<4% suggests omission of axillary staging in MIBC patients without staging at primary surgery, especially in older (50years) HER2(-) patients. Still, the relatively high proportion of patients with non-SN macrometastases indicates that axillary treatment might be considered in SN positive patients, especially in younger HER2(+) MIBC patients.

TI  - Detection and Velocity Measurement of Brash Ice in the Arctic Ocean by TerraSAR-X Quad-pol SAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method is presented using a TerraSAR-X quad-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observation for detection and velocity measurement of sea ice drift, which can be useful information to improve sea ice models in the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. It is very difficult to detect and measure slow moving natural objects using only a space-borne SAR observation without any terrestrial measurement. The core idea is to exploit a slight time difference between different polarizations (i.e., H- and V-pol transmitted signals). The ground motion can be estimated by measuring the slope of residual Doppler frequency versus azimuth time difference without the knowledge of different scattering centers. The results demonstrate effective detection of the flow of brash ice. The SAR-measured velocities were approximately 0.2-0.3 m/s for ice floes and 1.4-3.5 m/s for brash ice flowing through ice fractures. The method was validated by using a pursuit monostatic TanDEM-X mode observation, by which two satellites observed the same sea ice with about a ten-second time interval. The sea ice velocities measured by the proposed approach using only one dataset well correlated with the results from offset tracking method applied to the two datasets with a correlation determination R-2 of 0.93. The cross-pol (HV- and VH-pol) pair is more effective to measure the velocity because the scattering center distance decreases significantly in the cross-pol pair, and data with high coherence are required for velocity estimation.

TI  - Molecular epidemiological analysis of <i>Norovirus</i> in patients with foodborne diseases in sentinel hospital, Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province
T2  - Zhonghua Yufang Yixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To understand the infection status and genetic characteristics of Norovirus from foodborne diseases in sentinel hospital of Ma'anshan city. Methods The 911 stool samples and epidemiological data of the patients with foodborne disease were collected from three hospitals of Ma'anshan city during January 2015 to June 2018. The G I and G II Norovirus were detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Some of the positive specimens were amplified by conventional reverse transcription PCR, and the PCR products were sequenced for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Results The positive rate of Norovirus was 14.7% (134/911), in which 7 strains were G I, 124 strains were G II and 3 strains were mixed infection. Norovirus can be detected throughout the year, with high positive rate from December to April of the next year [24.4%(20/82)-45.3%(24/53)]. The 78 males (15.5%) and 55 females (13.7%) were positive for Norovirus (chi(2)=0.58, P=0.448). There was no significant difference in different age groups (chi(2)=9.55, P=0.089). A total of 79 strains were successfully sequenced, 4 strains were G I group (5.1%), 75 strains were G II group (94.9%). The predominant strains were G II .17 and G II .4, aud the number were 35 and 15 respectively. The predominant strains were different in different years. The main strain was GII .17 in 2015 (30, 68.2%), GII .4 in 2016 (5/9) and 2017 (8/16), but GII .3 in 2018 (3/6). Conclusion Norovirus diarrhea was popular in Ma'anshan city throughout the year,especially in winter and spring. The prevalent strain was G II ,genotypes were diversified distribution,the dominant strains were G.. 17 and GII .4. The predominant strains were different in different years.

TI  - Risk-based classification and interactive map of watersheds contributing anthropogenic stress to Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe development anthropogenic stress indices for coastal margins of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Indices were derived based on the response of species assemblages to watershed-scale stress from agriculture and urbanization. Metrics were calculated for five groups of wetland biota: diatoms, wetland vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, fishes, and birds. Previously published community change points of these assemblages were used to classify each watershed as 'least-disturbed', 'at-risk', or 'degraded' based on community response to these stressors. The end products of this work are an on-line map utility and downloadable data that characterize the degree of agricultural land use and development in all watersheds of the US and Canadian Great Lakes basin. Discrepancies between the observed biological condition and putative anthropogenic stress can be used to determine if a site is more degraded than predicted based on watershed characteristics, or if remediation efforts are having beneficial impacts on site condition. This study provides a landscape-scale evaluation of wetland condition that is a critical first step for multi-scale assessments to help prioritize conservation or restoration efforts.

TI  - A simple and integrated approach for fire severity assessment using bi-temporal airborne LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new method (profile area change, PAC) to quantify fire-induced forest structural changes at the individual tree and clump of trees scales using pre- and post-fire LiDAR data. The PAC measures the difference in profile area summarized from pre- and post-fire LiDAR points. We applied the PAC method to assess the effects of the 2013 American Fire in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Our LiDAR PAC metrics were compared to changes in commonly used LiDAR-derived canopy cover and tree height metrics at tree level, and to Landsat-8 imagery-derived relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) at the 30m pixel level. A quantitative validation using field measured changes in basal area and leaf area index (LAI) confirmed that correlations between PAC metrics and field measurements (R-2 >= 0.67) were significantly higher than those from canopy cover or tree height metrics (R-2 <= 0.43), and much stronger than that from RdNBR (R-2 <= 0.26). The PAC metrics can also be used to infer the extent of tree canopy disturbance caused by fire, based on whether the majority of biomass loss occurred above or below the tree crown base height. Mapping of canopy disturbance indicated that over half (57.0%) of the American Fire region had tree canopy loss from fire, 22.5% of trees had sub-canopy loss, while the remaining area had no detectable tree canopy change. Overall, the LiDAR PAC metric, as a simple and integrated method, demonstrated promising potential in characterizing fine-grained changes in forest structure. The method can be beneficial for forest managers in evaluating fire-induced environmental and economic losses, and provide useful information for forest restoration design.

M3  - Article
AB  - The irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area is an important food production base. This study was designed to apply the remote sensing to monitor the soil moisture in the irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area. People's Victory Canal Irrigation District (PVCID) was selected to research for the soil moisture monitoring. The crop soil moisture index (CSMI) was designed to be CSMI = FSM/CSSM and the remote sensing soil moisture model was constructed to be RSM0-40 = 1-0.505*TVDI. The remote sensing soil moisture model performed well in monitoring the soil moisture in PVCID. PVCID was mainly threatened by the mild drought between April and May in 2011 and 2012. In conclusion, remote sensing performed well in monitoring the soil moisture and it could be applied to guide the irrigation in the irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area.

TI  - The potential of retrieving snow line dynamics from Landsat during the end of the ablation seasons between 1982 and 2017 in European mountains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere is continuously decreasing during the ablation seasons in the context of climate change. Snow Line Elevation (SLE) is a suitable indicator illustrating detailed snow cover distribution dynamics at a regional scale. In order to carry out time-series analyses of the SLEs in mountain areas, long-term (> 30 years) and detailed spatial resolution (< 100 m) data are required. In this article, we have retrieved SLEs from Landsat during the end of the ablation seasons in European mountains between 1984 and 2017. Based on our analyses, it is possible to use the Landsat archive to illustrate potential long-term snow line dynamics in the Alps, the Carpathian Mountains, and the Pyrenees. The snow lines appear to recede to higher elevations in these Southern European Mountains. To further implement statistical analyses, it is required to fill the missing observations, and reduce uncertainties induced by intermediate snowfall events.

TI  - Evaluation of the Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction System for Predicting Sea Fog over the South China Sea
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the South China Sea, sea fog brings severe disasters every year, but forecasters have yet to implement an effective sea-fog forecast. To address this issue, we test a liquid-water-content-only (LWC-only) operational sea-fog prediction method based on a regional mesoscale numerical model with a horizontal resolution of about 3 km, the Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES), hereafter GRAPES- 3km. GRAPES-3 km models the LWC over the sea, from which we infer the visibility that is then used to identify fog. We test the GRAPES-3 km here against measurements in 2016 and 2017 from coastal-station observations, as well as from buoy data, data from the Integrated Observation Platform for Marine Meteorology, and retrieved fog and cloud patterns from Himawari-8 satellite data. For two cases that we examine in detail, the forecast region of sea fog overlaps well with the multi-observational data within 72 h. Considering forecasting for 0-24 h, GRAPES-3 km has a 2-year-average equitable threat score (ETS) of 0.20 and a Heidke skill score (HSS) of 0.335, which is about 5.6% (ETS) and 6.4% (HSS) better than our previous method (GRAPES-MOS). Moreover, the stations near the particularly foggy region around the Leizhou Peninsula have relatively high forecast scores compared to other sea areas. Overall, the results show that GRAPES-3 km can roughly predict the formation, evolution, and dissipation of sea fog on the southern China coast.

TI  - Impacts of snow cover duration on vegetation spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover occupies large percentage of land surface in Tibetan Plateau. Snow cover duration (SCD) during non-growing seasons plays a critical role in regulating alpine vegetations phenology by affecting the energy budgets of land surface and soil moisture conditions. Different periods snow cover during non-growing season may have distinct effect on the vegetations phenology. Start of season (SOS) has been observed advanced under the ongoing climate change in the plateau, but it still remains unclear how the SCD alters the SOS. This study attempts to answer the following questions: (i) What is the pattern of spatial and temporal variations for SCD and grassland SOS? (ii) Which periods SCD plays a critical role in grasslands SOS?The remote sensing datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were utilized to compute the SOS and SCD on the Tibetan Plateau over 200315. The Asymmetric Gaussian function was applied to extract SOS. We also explored the spatial pattern and temporal variation of SOS and SCD. Then, by using linear correlation coefficients, we investigated the driving effects of different periods non-growing season SCD on SOS.The non-growing season SCD slightly decreased during 200315, while SOS exhibited an overall advancing trend. Advanced trends in SOS were observed in the eastern plateau, and the delayed trends were mainly founded in western plateau. Snow cover area exhibited two separate peaks during autumn and late winter over the plateau. Extended SCD regions mainly distributed in middle-east of the plateau, while shrunken SCD distributed in other regions of the plateau. SCD of different seasons caused distinct effects on vegetation SOS. Lengthened autumn SCD advanced SOS over the eastern plateau. The slightly lengthened SCD postponed SOS over the western plateau. In the wet meadow regions, advanced SOS was positively associated with SCD during the entire non-growing season, whereas for the dry steppe, SCD over the preseason played a more dominant role. The SCD of previous autumn and winter also showed lag effect on SOS over meadow regions to a certain extent. This study confirmed the importance of SCD to phenological processes at the beginning of growing season and further suggested that role of SCD should be discriminated for different periods and for different heat-water conditions. With the lag effects and SCDs distinct effect of different seasons considered, predictions on the Tibetan Plateaus spring phenology could be improved.

TI  - Assessing Conflict Driven Food Security in Rakhine, Myanmar with Multisource Imagery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent conflict along the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar has amplified a food security crisis and access to the region remains challenging. Moderate-resolution satellite remote sensing offers an approach to complement more traditional food insecurity hot spot assessment across Rakhine, Myanmar; however, conflict creates unique signals that are not agroclimatologically driven and need to be considered. Time series radar and optical data cubes were built and used to assess for deviations across space and time for rice paddy production areas based on established techniques. Ultimately, the Sentinel-1 radar was more helpful compared to fused Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 data cubes that were substantially impacted by cloud cover during key growth stages. Anecdotal reporting, very high resolution (VHR) imagery, and expert knowledge were used to support operational analyses routines in an attempt to characterize rice into failed, abandoned, and cultivated classes across 2016 to 2018 seasons. Accuracy assessment using co-timed VHR showed overall accuracy (%) of 86.5, 87.5, and 91.0 for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Nearly one-third of rice production was characterized as failed or abandoned in any given year. Qualitative analyses showed paddy failure was often adjacent to conflict events. The moderate-resolution imagery and automated routines offer complementing metrics that can be used to help guide food security assessments. In regions where climate change, migration, and conflict coincide, decision support tools will need to evolve and continue to integrate human perspectives.

TI  - Investigating the effects of 3D urban morphology on the surface urban heat island effect in urban functional zones by using high-resolution remote sensing data: A case study of Wuhan, Central China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban heat island (UHI) effect is an increasingly serious problem in urban areas. Information on the driving forces of intra-urban temperature variation is crucial for ameliorating the urban thermal environment. Although prior studies have suggested that urban morphology (e.g., landscape pattern, land-use type) can significantly affect land surface temperature (LST), few studies have explored the comprehensive effect of 2D and 3D urban morphology on LST in different urban functional zones (UFZs), especially at a fine scale. Therefore, in this research, we investigated the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and summer daytime LST in Wuhan, a representative megacity in Central China, which is known for its extremely hot weather in summer, by adopting high-resolution remote sensing data and geographical information data. The "urban morphology" in this study consists of 2D urban morphological parameters, 3D urban morphological parameters, and UFZs. Our results show that: (1) The LST is significantly related to 2D and 3D urban morphological parameters, and the scattered distribution of buildings with high rise can facilitate the mitigation of LST. Although sky view factor (SVF) is an important measure of 3D urban geometry, its influence on LST is complicated and context-dependent. (2) Trees are the most influential factor in reducing LST, and the cooling efficiency mainly depends on their proportions. The fragmented and irregular distribution of grass/shrubs also plays a significant role in alleviating LST. (3) With respect to UFZs, the residential zone is the largest heat source, whereas the highest LST appears in commercial and industrial zones. (4) Results of the multivariate regression and variation partitioning indicate that the relative importance of 2D and 3D urban morphological parameters on LST varies among different UFZs and 2D morphology outperforms 3D morphology in LST modulation. The results are generally consistent in spring, summer and autumn. These findings can provide insights for urban planners and designers on how to mitigate the surface UHI (SUHI) effect via rational landscape design and urban management during summer daytime.

TI  - A Hot Saturn Orbiting an Oscillating Late Subgiant Discovered by <i>TESS</i>
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the discovery of HD 221416 b, the first transiting planet identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for which asteroseismology of the host star is possible. HD 221416 b (HIP 116158, TOI-197) is a bright (V = 8.2 mag), spectroscopically classified subgiant that oscillates with an average frequency of about 430 mu Hz and displays a clear signature of mixed modes. The oscillation amplitude confirms that the redder TESS bandpass compared to Kepler has a small effect on the oscillations, supporting the expected yield of thousands of solar-like oscillators with TESS 2 minute cadence observations. Asteroseismic modeling yields a robust determination of the host star radius (R-* = 2.943 +/- 0.064 R-circle dot), mass (M-* = 1.212 +/- 0.074 M-circle dot), and age (4.9 +/- 1.1 Gyr), and demonstrates that it has just started ascending the red-giant branch. Combining asteroseismology with transit modeling and radial-velocity observations, we show that the planet is a "hot Saturn" (R-p = 9.17 +/- 0.33 R-circle plus) with an orbital period of similar to 14.3 days, irradiance of F = 343 +/- 24 F-circle plus, and moderate mass (M-p = 60.5 +/- 5.7 M-circle plus) and density (rho(p) = 0.431 +/- 0.062 g cm(-3)). The properties of HD 221416 b show that the host-star metallicity-planet mass correlation found in sub-Saturns (4-8 R-circle plus) does not extend to larger radii, indicating that planets in the transition between sub-Saturns and Jupiters follow a relatively narrow range of densities. With a density measured to similar to 15%, HD 221416 b is one of the best characterized Saturn-size planets to date, augmenting the small number of known transiting planets around evolved stars and demonstrating the power of TESS to characterize exoplanets and their host stars using asteroseismology.

TI  - Two separate nodules of Merkel cell carcinoma occurring concomitantly on one cheek.
T2  - Archives of craniofacial surgery
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and highly aggressive neuroectodermal carcinoma arising from mechanoreceptor Merkel cells. Multiple MCCs are even rarer. We report a case of two independent MCCs simultaneously present in the cheek of a patient, which were effectively and esthetically treated using a cheek flap. Punch biopsy performed in a 60-year-old woman admitted with a chief complaint of two skin-colored hard nodules in her left cheek, accompanied by an itching sensation, was suggestive of MCC. Accordingly, we performed sentinel lymph node biopsy through the modified Blair incision under general anesthesia, in cooperation with the head and neck surgery department. The defect was covered with a cheek flap by slightly extending the existing incision following wide excision with a safety margin of 1 cm. This paper is significant in that it introduces an effective reconstruction technique that maintains function using a cheek flap for the management of this rare case. In addition, this paper is the first to classify multiple MCCs according to the time of onset. We believe that this paper presents an effective alternative reconstruction technique with sentinel node biopsy through the modified Blair incision.

TI  - Overlap in the Genetic Architecture of Stroke Risk, Early Neurological Changes, and Cardiovascular Risk Factors
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose The genetic relationships between stroke risk, stroke severity, and early neurological changes are complex and not completely understood. Genetic studies have identified 32 all stroke risk loci. Polygenic risk scores can be used to compare the genetic architecture of related traits. In this study, we compare the genetic architecture of stroke risk, stroke severity, and early neurological changes with that of 2 stroke risk factors: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension.Methods We assessed the degree of overlap in the genetic architecture of stroke risk, T2DM, hypertension, and 2 acute stroke phenotypes based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which ranges from 0 for no stroke symptoms to 21 to 42 for a severe stroke: baseline (within 6 hours after onset) and change in NIHSS (NIHSS=NIHSS at baseline-NIHSS at 24 hours). This was done by (1) single-nucleotide polymorphism by single-nucleotide polymorphism comparison, (2) weighted polygenic risk scores with sentinel variants, and (3) whole-genome polygenic risk scores using multiple P thresholds.Results We found evidence of genetic architecture overlap between stroke risk and T2DM (P=2.53x10(-169)), hypertension (P=3.93x10(-04)), and baseline NIHSS (P=0.03). However, there was no evidence of overlap between NIHSS and stroke risk, T2DM, or hypertension.Conclusions The genetic architecture of stroke risk is correlated with that of T2DM, hypertension, and initial stroke severity (NIHSS within 6 hours of stroke onset). However, the genetic architecture of early neurological change after stroke (NIHSS) is not correlated with that of ischemic stroke risk, T2DM, or hypertension. Thus, stroke risk and early neurological change after stroke have distinct genetic architectures.

TI  - Temporal dynamic analysis of a mountain ecosystem based on multi-source and multi-scale remote sensing data
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, ecosystems have suffered a decline in natural resources due to climate change and anthropogenic pressure. Specifically, the European rabbit introduced by humans, as well as drought episodes, have led to a change in the vegetation structure of a mountainous ecosystem: Teide National Park in Spain. Teide managers studied, with field-based traditional methods, how the two keystone vegetation species, Spartocytisus supranubius and Pterocephalus lasiospermus, have changed their dynamics in this vulnerable and heterogenic ecosystem. However, remote sensing is an important tool for classifying, monitoring, and managing large areas in a fast and economic way. This work proposes a methodological framework to monitor the changes produced in this protected area using multi-source remote sensing imagery. The results strengthen and extend the analysis followed by the National Park managers, demonstrating that S. supranubius has decreased its population while P. lasiospermus has increased. Moreover, this study presents thematic maps of the species of interest, as well as its specific coverage at different dates, providing quantitative data difficult to get with traditional approaches.

TI  - When the Ghats Call: An Exploration of the Spiritual Identity Development of Non-Indian Visitors in the Landscape of Varanasi
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spiritual identity can be shaped and reshaped by diverse perspectives, experiences, and contexts. Indubitably, an eclectic body of the literature exists on both spiritual tourism and the role of context in spiritual identity development. However, none has captured the process of spiritual identity development of people visiting and staying in a foreign landscape. A qualitative exploratory study was designed to explore spiritual identity development among non-Indian visitors in the spiritual landscape of Varanasi, a city in north India. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve non-Indian nationals who identified themselves as spiritual. After thematically analyzing the transcribed interviews, it was found that spiritual identification, worldview, and practices were constructed and refined as a result of interaction with the physical, religious, sociocultural, and historical dimensions of the landscape of Varanasi. Findings suggest that individuals coming to a foreign landscape are more than backpackers and undergo unique spiritual identity development journeys. Ergo, findings of this study necessitate the need of broadening the definition of a spiritual tourist, considering the complexity of spiritual development process in a spiritual landscape. Implications for future research are also discussed.

TI  - A Geoinformatics-based Framework for Surface Water Quality Mapping and Monitoring
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of water systems must be sustainable, something that requires systematic and comprehensive monitoring. However, the attempts to obtain a comprehensive water quality monitoring (WQM) program in developing countries are challenged due to the lack of an integrated framework and limited resources. At present, the Philippines has no systematized technical and operational monitoring approach, poor coordination and data collection system, and weak law enforcement. On the other hand, Geoinformatics promises a more convenient and cost-effective WQM to complement the traditional method. The goal of this study is to demonstrate how to maximize the use of Geonformatics in developing methods and models to address the lack of spatial trends, timely monitoring, and integrated monitoring framework that could lead to a sustainable WQM system. This study employs remote sensing and GIS technique combined with ground-based water quality data as Geoinformatics-based framework to derive water monitoring and assessment information. Results of this study showed that satellite images can be utilized to derive empirical models to estimate WQ parameters. The validation results showed that the estimated WQ values using the RS-based models have no significant difference when compared with the actual WQ values. Also, the WQ maps derived using Geographic Information System (GIS) were proven useful in providing better representation and analysis of spatial and temporal information that can provide a comprehensive and cost-effective reference for WQ monitoring and assessment.

TI  - Study of wetlands in the Ecuadorian Andes through the comparison of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to compare the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images to calculate the wetland's extension, distribution and degree of conservation, in Reserva de Produce& de Fauna Chinborazo (RPFCH) protected area located in the Andean region of Ecuador. This process was developed with in situ work in 16 wetlands, distributed in different conservation levels. The Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were processed through a radiometric calibration (restoration of lost lines or pixels and correction of the stripe of the image) and an atmospheric correction (conversion of the digital levels to radiance values), to later calculate the Vegetation spectral indexes: NDVI, SAVI (L = 0.5) where L is a constant of the soil brightness component, EVI2 (improved vegetation index 2), NDWI (standard difference water index), WDRI (wide dynamic range vegetation index) and the Red Edge model only available for Sentinel-2 in this study. Making a classification of the Bofedal ecosystem in satellite images by applying Random Forest, the most important variables with Landsat-8 were EVI2 (37.72%) and SAVI with L = 0.5 (30.97%), while with Sentinel-2 the most important variables correspond to the Red Edge (38.54%) and WDRI (27.06%). With the indices calculated, two categories of analysis were determined: a) wetland integrated by the levels: intervened [1], moderately conserved [2] and conserved [3] and b) other than wetland [4] integrated by areas that do not correspond to this ecosystem. Landsat-8 shows that the percentage of correct classifications of pixels belonging to the wetland category corresponds to: [1] 72.76%, [2] 58.38%, [3] 68.42%, while for the category other [4] were correct 95.15%. With Sentinel-2, the percentage of correct classifications corresponds to [1] 95.00%, [2] 82.60%, [3] 96.25%, while for the category other [4] the correct answers were 98.13%. In this way with Landsat-8 the wetland corresponds to 21.708,54 ha (41.21%), while with Sentinel-2 the wetland represents a total of 20,518 ha (38.95%), of the 52,560 ha that belong to the RPFCH, concluding that Sentinel-2, due to its better spatial resolution, and the incorporation of its new bands in Red Edge, obtains better results in image classification.

TI  - Modelling of Indicator Escherichia coli Contamination in Sentinel Oysters and Estuarine Water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was performed to improve the ability to predict the concentrations of Escherichia coli in oyster meat and estuarine waters by using environmental parameters, and microbiological and heavy metal contamination from shellfish growing area in southern Thailand. Oyster meat (n = 144) and estuarine waters (n = 96) were tested for microbiological and heavy metal contamination from March 2016 to February 2017. Prevalence and mean concentrations of E. coli were 93.1% and 4.6 x 10(3) most probable number (MPN)/g in oyster meat, and 78.1% and 2.2 x 10(2) MPN/100 mL in estuarine water. Average 7-day precipitation, ambient air temperature, and the presence of Salmonella were associated with the concentrations of E. coli in oyster meat (p < 0.05). Raw data (MPN/g of oyster meat and MPN/100 mL of estuarine water) and log-transformed data (logMPN/g of oyster meat and logMPN/100 mL of estuarine water) of E. coli concentrations were examined within two contrasting regression models. However, the more valid predictions were conducted using non-log transformed values. These findings indicate that non-log transformed data can be used for building more accurate statistical models in microbiological food safety, and that significant environmental parameters can be used as a part of a rapid warning system to predict levels of E. coli before harvesting oysters.

TI  - Microclimate niche requirements of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) in a successional gradient of low thorn forest in northeastern Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance caused by loss of vegetal cover modifies interactions between abiotic environment and species, including phytophagous insects such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera). Furthermore, secondary succession changes both resource availability and microclimatic conditions after disturbance, thus influencing species niche requirements. However, despite this importance, effects of such modifications on phytophagous insects remain almost unknown. Therefore, in this study we compared microclimatic niche parameters of leaf beetle communities in a successional gradient of low thorn forest in northeastern Mexico. A chronosequence of four categories with different succession time was delimited (conserved areas, 31, 17 and 4 years) through the analysis of Landsat satellite images (1973, 1986, 2000, 2005 and 2015). In each category, we systematically sampled leaf beetles (using sweep nets) and recorded seven microclimatic variables monthly, during the wet season of 2016 (May-October). In total, 66 species of Chrysomelidae were found, distributed in the four successional categories. Association between communities and microclimatic variables, as well as the number of species significantly related with these changes, decreased with successional time. Relative humidity, temperature and heat index were variables mainly related to these changes, and their specific contributions changed with time. Results suggest that microclimate influences the structuration of the phytophagous insect community after disturbance, but only in areas of recent succession; thus, other factors are operating in conserved areas. Therefore, secondary vegetation areas of different recovery time constitute unique microclimate niches for leaf beetle species, and as such, these need to be accounted for when delimiting conservation areas.

AB  - Dense stereo matching plays a key role in 3D reconstruction. The capability of using deep learning in the stereo matching of remote sensing data is currently uncertain. This article investigated the application of deep learning-based stereo methods in aerial image series and proposed a deep learning-based multi-view dense matching framework. First, we applied three typical convolutional neural network models, MC-CNN, GC-Net, and DispNet, to aerial stereo pairs and compared the results with those of the SGM and a commercial software, SURE. Second, on different data sets, the generalization ability of each network is evaluated by using direct transfer learning with models pretrained on other data sets and by fine-tuning with a small number of target training data. Third, we present a deep learning-based multi-view dense matching framework where the multi-view geometry is introduced to further refine matching results. Three sets of aerial images as the main data sets and two open-source sets of street images as auxiliary data sets are used for testing. Experiments show that, first, the performance of deep learning-based stereo methods is slightly better than traditional methods. Second, both the GC-Net and the MC-CNN have demonstrated good generalization ability and can obtain satisfactory results on aerial images using a pretrained model on several available stereo benchmarks. Third, multi-view geometry constraints can further improve the performance of deep learning-based methods, which is better than that of the multi-view-based SGM and SURE.

TI  - Land use and land cover classification using Chinese GF-2 multispectral data in a region of the North China Plain
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly launched GF-2 satellite is now the most advanced civil satellite in China to collect high spatial resolution remote sensing data. This study investigated the capability and strategy of GF-2 multispectral data for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in a region of the North China Plain. The pixel-based and object-based classifications using maximum likelihood (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were evaluated to determine the classification strategy that was suitable for GF-2 multispectral data. The validation results indicated that GF-2 multispectral data achieved satisfactory LULC classification performance, and object-based classification using the SVM classifier achieved the best classification accuracy with an overall classification accuracy of 94.33% and kappa coefficient of 0.911. Therefore, considering the LULC classification performance and data characteristics, GF-2 satellite data could serve as a valuable and reliable high-resolution data source for land surface monitoring. Future works should focus on improving LULC classification accuracy by exploring more classification features and exploring the potential applications of GF-2 data in related applications.

TI  - An improved algorithm for estimating the Secchi disk depth from remote sensing data based on the new underwater visibility theory
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) is a widely used parameter for evaluating water clarity. Here we propose an improved algorithm, which is based on a new underwater visibility theory, for retrieving more accurate Z(SD) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) in various waters. Two improvements were carried out in the new algorithm. First, we used a hybrid quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA_hybrid) instead of the sixth version of QAA (QAA_v6) for retrieving more accurate total absorption coefficient (alpha(lambda)) and total backscattering coefficient (b(b)(lambda)) even in turbid inland waters. Second, we used a dynamic K-T/K-d ratio (i.e., ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficient of upwelling radiance and diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance) instead of using the fixed ratio (i.e., 1.5). The results obtained from in situ R-rs show that the improved Z(SD) estimation algorithm gave more accurate Z(SD) estimations, with the root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 in 1og10 unit, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduced from 39% to 20% (N = 178 with in situ Z(SD) values between 0.3 and 20.8 m). We then applied the improved Z(SD) estimation algorithm to the 2003-2012 MERIS images for Lake Kasumigaura to further confirm the performance of the improved Z(SD) estimation algorithm. The results obtained from 19 matchups demonstrate that the estimated Z(SD) matched well with the in situ Z(SD), with the RMSE of 0.11 m and the MAPE of 15%. The improved Z(SD) estimation algorithm shows a potential to estimate more accurate Z(SD)values from remote sensing data in various waters.

TI  - New satellite-based estimates show significant trends in spring phenology and complex sensitivities to temperature and precipitation at northern European latitudes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent climate warming has altered plant phenology at northern European latitudes, but conclusions regarding the spatial patterns of phenological change and relationships with climate are still challenging as quantitative estimates are strongly diverging. To generate consistent estimates of broad-scale spatially continuous spring plant phenology at northern European latitudes (>50 degrees N) from 2000 to 2016, we used a novel vegetation index, the plant phenology index (PPI), derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To obtain realistic and strong estimates, the phenology trends and their relationships with temperature and precipitation over the past 17years were analyzed using a panel data method. We found that in the studied region the start of the growing season (SOS) has on average advanced by 0.30dayyear(-1). The SOS showed an overall advancement rate of 2.47day degrees C-1 to spring warming, and 0.18daycm(-1) to decreasing precipitation in spring. The previous winter and summer temperature had important effects on the SOS but were spatially heterogeneous. Overall, the onset of SOS was delayed 0.66day degrees C-1 by winter warming and 0.56day degrees C-1 by preceding summer warming. The precipitation in winter and summer influenced the SOS in a relatively weak and complex manner. The findings indicate rapid recent phenological changes driven by combined seasonal climates in northern Europe. Previously unknown spatial patterns of phenological change and relationships with climate drivers are presented that improve our capacity to understand and foresee future climate effects on vegetation.

TI  - Application of the Simple Biosphere Model 2 (SiB2) with Irrigation Module to a Typical Low-Hilly Red Soil Farmland and the Sensitivity Analysis of Modeled Energy Fluxes in Southern China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface processes are an important part of the Earth's mass and energy cycles. The application of a land surface process model for farmland in the low-hilly red soil region of southern China continues to draw research attention. Conventional model does not perform well in the simulation of irrigated farmland, because the influence of land surface water is not considered. In this study, an off-line version of the Simple Biosphere model 2 (SiB2) was locally parameterized in a typical farmland of the low-hilly red soil region using field observations and remote sensing data. The performance of SiB2 was then evaluated through comparison to Bowen-ratio direct measurements in a second growing period of rice in 2015 (late rice from 23 July to 31 October). The results show that SiB2 underestimated latent heat flux (LE) by 16.0% and overestimated sensible heat flux (H) by 16.7%, but net radiation flux (Rn) and soil heat flux were reasonably simulated. The single factor sensitivity analysis of Rn, H, and LE modeled in SiB2 indicated that downward shortwave radiation (DSR) and downward longwave radiation (DLR) had a significant effect on Rn simulation. In driving data, DSR, DLR and wind speed (u) were the main factors that could cause a distinct change in sensible heat flux. An irrigation module was added to the original SiB2 model to simulate the influence of irrigated paddy fields according to the sensitivity analysis results of the parameters (C1, bulk boundary-layer resistance coefficient; C2, ground to canopy air-space resistance coefficient; and Ws, volumetric water content at soil surface layer). The results indicate that application of the parameterized SiB2 with irrigation module could be better in southern Chinese farmland.

TI  - Prediction of land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, India using geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bharathapuzha river basin, once endowed with dense vegetation and abundant water, has been experiencing acute water shortage and extreme climatic conditions in recent times. To understand the influence of human interventions on the natural environmental conditions, including the problems mentioned above, it is essential to critically examine the changes in land use/cover over these years. The objective of this study is to assess land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, Kerala during the period 1990-2017 using LANDSAT series satellite images. The dynamics of land use/cover change were quantified and mapped using geospatial techniques. The multi-temporal LANDSAT images were classified by supervised maximum likelihood method to generate the corresponding land use/cover maps; changes in land use/cover in the river basin were subsequently detected by the post-classification technique. Results of the study revealed a drastic change in land use/cover in the period 1990-2017; the primary causes of this were deforestation and urbanization. The near- and long-term future land use/cover maps of the basin for 2020 and 2035 were generated from the historically retrieved land use/cover change pattern. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov chain techniques were used to generate future land use/cover maps. These maps reveal that the predominant land use/cover class in the basin will be barren land and about 46.13% of the existing (in 2017) dense vegetation will diminish by 2035. The efficiency of sustainable watershed management activities in the river basin can be improved based on the critical observations from this study.

TI  - Towards harmonisation of entomological surveillance in the Mediterranean area
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe Mediterranean Basin is historically a hotspot for trade, transport, and migration. As a result, countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea share common public health threats. Among them are vector-borne diseases, and in particular, mosquito-borne viral diseases are prime candidates as (re)emerging diseases and are likely to spread across the area. Improving preparedness and response capacities to these threats at the regional level is therefore a major issue.The implementation of entomological surveillance is, in particular, of utmost importance. Guidance in designing entomological surveillance systems is critical, and these systems may pursue different specific objectives depending on the disease.The purpose of the proposed review is to draw up guidelines for designing effective and sustainable entomological surveillance systems in order to improve preparedness and response. However, we make it clear that there is no universal surveillance system, so the thinking behind harmonisation is to define evidence-based standards in order to promote best practises, identify the most appropriate surveillance activities, and optimise the use of resources.Such guidance is aimed at policymakers and diverse stakeholders and is intended to be used as a framework for the implementation of entomological surveillance programmes. It will also be useful to collaborate and share information with health professionals involved in other areas of disease surveillance. Medical entomologists and vector control professionals will be able to refer to this report to advocate for tailored entomological surveillance strategies.The main threats targeted in this review are the vectors of dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. The vectors of all these arboviruses are mosquitoes.MethodsCurrent knowledge on vector surveillance in the Mediterranean area is reviewed. The analysis was carried out by a collaboration of the medical entomology experts in the region, all of whom belong to the MediLabSecure network, which is currently funded by the European Union and represents an international effort encompassing 19 countries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea region.FindingsRobust surveillance systems are required to address the globalisation of emerging arboviruses. The prevention and management of mosquito-borne viral diseases must be addressed in the prism of a One Health strategy that includes entomological surveillance as an integral part of the policy. Entomological surveillance systems should be designed according to the entomological and epidemiological context and must have well-defined objectives in order to effect a tailored and graduated response. We therefore rely on different scenarios according to different entomological and epidemiological contexts and set out detailed objectives of surveillance. The development of multidisciplinary networks involving both academics and public authorities will provide resources to address these health challenges by promoting good practises in surveillance (identification of surveillance aims, design of surveillance systems, data collection, dissemination of surveillance results, evaluation of surveillance activities) and through the sharing of effective knowledge and information. These networks will also contribute to capacity building and stronger collaborations between sectors at both the local and regional levels. Finally, concrete guidance is offered on the vector of the main arbovirus based on the current situation in the area.

TI  - Long-Term Deflection Monitoring for Bridges Using X and C-Band Time-Series SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to monitor the deformation of bridges, namely in the form of long-term deflection and thermal dilation, using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations. To precisely estimate the vertical and longitudinal displacements, we used the InSAR time-series technique with multi-track stacks of Sentinel-1 SAR dataset and a single-track stack of COSMO-SkyMed SAR data over two extradosed bridge cases; Kimdaejung and Muyoung bridges between 2013 and 2017. The vertical and longitudinal displacements are estimated using multi-track Sentinel-1 SAR data and orientation angle of bridges, and we converted the displacements into thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection. From COSMO-SkyMed data, we calculated the horizontal thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection assuming that they dominantly contribute to the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively. This assumption appeared reasonable based on the comparison with calculations from Sentinel-1 data. The deflection patterns exhibit downward movements at the mid-spans between towers. The results reveal that both bridges have been suffering long-term deflection over the observation period. Thus, this study verifies the potential to monitor the long-term deflection and implies that the bridges need to be monitored periodically.

TI  - Assessment of shoreline alterations using a Digital Shoreline Analysis System: a case study of changes in the Yeilrmak Delta in northern Turkey from 1953 to 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine the erosion rates and shoreline changes in the Yeilrmak Delta (Delta) between the oldest available date (1953) before construction of the large-scale dams on the Yeilrmak River in northern Turkey and 2017. To clearly illustrate the impacts of the dams on the Delta, we investigated the relationship between the dams and shoreline changes. To compute the net shoreline changes and erosion rates over these 64years, we used a Digital Shoreline Analysis System. To digitize the shoreline changes at the mouth of the Yeilrmak River, 1:25000-scaled topographic maps from 1957, panchromatic aerial photographs from 1962, a KH-9 Hexagon satellite image from 1980, an Ikonos satellite image from 2002, and a WorldView-2 satellite image from 2017 were used. The west and east sides of the river mouth were divided into six main groups and assessed. Each group included a time series for the shorelines. The groupings were based on the time series. For each group, the net shoreline change (m) was calculated using the net shoreline movement (NSM), and erosion rate (m/year) was calculated using the linear regression rate (LRR). According to NSM computations, net shoreline change varied from -235.04 to 379.18m. The greatest evolutions in net shoreline change were observed for group I, with a minimum of -1101.11m. According to LRR analysis, the calculated erosion rate varied from -6.83 to 19.06m/year. The greatest changes in erosion rate were observed for group II, with a minimum of -30.63m/year. There is a close relationship between the construction dates of the dams in the Yeilrmak Basin and the shoreline changes in the Delta.

AB  - The monthly weather data for 31 years from 1985-2015 was used to analyze the extent of meteorological drought using standardized precipitation index (SPI) over Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow. MODIS NDVI data from 2000-2015 was used for monitoring of agricultural drought through NDVI based vegetation condition index (VCI) for all the three districts. The monthly SPI and VCI values from July to October were correlated with productivity index (PI) of kharif rice.Both the indices (SPI and VCI) were positively correlated with PI for all the districts. In Allahabad SPI and VCI during September month showed a significant correlation (0.70**& 0.61*) while in Kanpur VCI during October and SPI of July and August were significantly correlated with PI of kharif Rice. The multiple regression equation developed for predicting kharif rice PI in Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow districts explained 69 to 76 per cent variability in Pl.

TI  - Demarcation of Groundwater Possible Zones in a Hard Rock Terrain, Nagavathi Watershed of Dharmapuri District, Tamil Nadu, India-Geophysical and Geoinformatics Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrical resistivity survey has been very successful for decades in delineating prospective groundwater zones around the world. In general, the method is used to decipher the horizontal and vertical electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface earth's layers. In the perspective of hydrogeology, understanding the subsurface conditions and lithological variations is quite necessary to target groundwater potential zones. One-dimensional (1D) geoelectrical resistivity survey, vertical electrical sounding (VES), was carried out in selected locations across the Nagavathi watershed, Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu in India. The Nagavathi watershed is positioned in an undulated terrain and is dominantly underlain by charnockite and gneissic rocks. Forty-six VES using Schlumberger's electrode arrangement were conducted over the entire Nagavathi watershed, using an equal grid method. The field data were processed by IPI2 Windows software and different types of sounding curves were identified. The lineaments such as faults, joints, and fractures act as pathways to groundwater movement, major lineaments were identified from satellite data using ArcGIS 9.3. In the study area consisting of hard rocks, groundwater prospecting is a difficult task without proper understanding of subsurface lithology. From the VES results, geoelectric layers such as topsoil, weathered, fractured, and infinitely hard rock layers were identified and eight thematic maps involving spatial distribution of resistivities and thickness were prepared, in addition to geology, hydrogeomorphology, and lineament thematic layers. The combination of the eleven thematic layers in ArcGIS resulted in a groundwater potential map, providing the information about very good (75.799 km(2)), good (85.595 km(2)), medium (134.240 km(2)), poor (115.124 km(2)), and very poor (69.336 km(2)) groundwater possible zones.

TI  - CD151 confers metastatic potential to clear cell sarcoma of the soft tissue in animal model
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cluster of differentiation 151 (CD151) is a potent therapeutic target for regulating tumor metastasis. In the present study, the role of CD151 in clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue was examined using a xenoplanted tumor model, which had high rates of metastasis. A clear cell sarcoma cell line, HS-MM, which was transplanted to the aponeuroses of the thighs, the most affected sites of human clear cell sarcoma, exhibited robust lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis in SCID-beige mice. Serial in vivo passaging of peritoneally disseminated tumor cells accelerated the metastatic activity, which was accompanied by increased CD151 expression, and were designated as HS-MMhigh. Notably, inoculation of anti-CD151 antibody significantly suppressed the lymphatic invasion, peritoneal dissemination and distant metastasis of the present clear cell sarcoma model without affecting local tumor growth at the transplantation site. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of CD151 did not alter cell proliferation, but significantly inhibited Matrigel invasion activity of HS-MMhigh cells. Downregulation of CD151 impaired matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity and phosphorylation of SMAD3 protein in HS-MMhigh cells. The present results suggest that CD151 may contribute to invasion and metastasis of clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue. Therefore, CD151 may serve as a potent target to regulate metastasis of clear cell sarcoma.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is dedicated to the advertising texts for children and teenagers, its influence on their speech culture and presents some evidence for the existence of such a special advertising texts. Advertising has deeply penetrated in modern life having become not only a part of commercial sphere but of culture and life in general. "The peculiarity of advertising is that it is located on the border areas between science and art, Economics and politics" (Borisov, 2001). That is why, of course, it influences (both negatively and positively) on children and teenagers psych and worldview. In recent years, psychologists are actively studying the way advertising influences on children and teenagers and their undeveloped psych and worldview. From a linguistic point of view, we can mention the following means used by the advertisers to attract children and teenagers: 1) Occasionalisms. 2) Youth slang. 3) Advertising text containing verbal and non-verbal components. The use of graphics makes printed advertisement closer to be loved by children TV advertisement. Jargonisms (or slang) are not literary norm of language, but, watching them in the media children might be confused about their stylistic identity. This phenomenon makes a negative influence on youth speech culture that is why it is needed to lessen the number of jargonisms in advertising texts for children and conduct educational work concerning the stylistics of such words at home and at native language lessons. Creative (non-standard) advertising solutions are often criticized. Thanks to such texts children learn language game, understand the system of native language, analyzing word-formation models. This increases the motivation to learn the language, its' spelling and morphemic.

TI  - The application of GIS and satellite imagery in archaeological land-use reconstruction: A predictive model?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape reconstructions are subject to multiple filters. Nevertheless, they are the basis for scientific interpretations of the archaeological record. The resulting distribution maps in turn serve to create archaeological maps for the prediction of areas with a high archaeological vulnerability potential. This predictive modelling also leads to the classification of archaeological-free areas. However, the fact that this spatial classification was created on the basis of an archaeological database, which in turn is strongly biased by find densities in modern agglomerations, leads to the potential destruction of archaeological monuments that are located in the invulnerable periphery. Such potential maps can only be sharpened by integrating a large number of different methodical concepts. This article presents the comprehensive combination of satellite remote sensing data, GIS-based landscape analyses and environmental data sets for the construction of a potentially holistic landscape scenario. Only with the highest possible information density of a large-scale study area can interactions in the geographical control factors be identified and conclusions be drawn on archaeological land-use and settlement concepts.

TI  - Theological contributions for teacherhood
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Review
AB  - A secondary school curriculum is not only about the content and the learning of the students, but also about the teacher behavior. I assess which contributions theological teacher models can make to education. To investigate this, I first study whether and how theological teacher models can be placed within recent scientific educational literature. Subsequently, I elaborate on the theological teacher models by considering the effectiveness of a discussion, as well as typical theological teacher guidance skills.The book Teacher models from Isaiah to Bioshock by Bart Koet and Archibald van Wieringen discusses, amongst others, the following theological teacher models: the book of Isaiah as a teacher, Socrates as a teacher, Ben Sira as a prime example of an interpreter of biblical wisdom, Jesus asking questions, the Torah against the background of family relationships, Augustine's vision on the transfer of knowledge and skills, The Dutch Cardinal Willebrands learning through dialogue,(1) and the game Bioshock as a teacher of virtues. I studied whether and how these theological teacher models can be placed within Pratt's five perspectives on teaching (transmission perspective, apprenticeship perspective, developmental perspective, nurturing perspective, and social reform). The five perspectives are used as ideal types, which are heuristic instruments that show how my observations exemplify a certain fixed pattern of thinking, understanding and action. The analysis below makes use of these five perspectives, where I do not intervene in the debate as to whether they exclude each other or overlap and what would be the most effective, best or any correct form of teacher or teaching.Transmission perspective: Ben Sira and the book of IsaiahWith the Jewish teacher Ben Sira and in the book of Isaiah there is mainly a transmission o f knowledge. Ben Sira with his writings can be seen as a memorable presenter of content in educating young people in the spirit of Jewish wisdom traditions.The Isaiah book shows two processes of learning: the first process gradually develops the material to be learned for the student, where the other confronts the student from the beginning with no introduction or summary, but with an open end. Especially the first, a more deductive learning process, can be understood from the perspective of knowledge transmission.Apprenticeship perspective: AugustineAs a teacher and preacher Augustine not only wanted to transmit knowledge, but he also wanted to contribute to a more existential (re)formation of his audience: for beginners he explains briefly and clearly matters of faith, to the advanced he speaks about the details, the ambiguities and open questions associated with the doctrine of faith. Therefore, with Augustine we find mainly the apprenticeship perspective.Nurturing perspective: the Talmud and the Dutch cardinal WillebrandsIn the Talmud there is much attention for teaching. The book deepens the teachers appreciation against the background of family relationships. This is where the perspective of nurturing comes in.Cardinal Willebrands's approach was characterised by language awareness. He searched for "the language of the other". Willebrands wanted to listen to the others, to learn from the other and to enter into conversation without leaving behind his own identity.Social reform perspective: the Bioshock gameIn games like Bioshock the game is the teacher. This teacher stimulates the player to reflect on his/her moral choices and educates the player to practice virtuous behavior. This teacher model is mainly one of social reform.Developmental perspective: Jesus and SocratesFor Jesus, asking questions is a central activity. When students are asked questions about more complex forms of thinking, it is mainly the developmental perspective. Teacher is one of the most important titles of Jesus.Socrates is also known as a teacher who asks questions. In this questioning elenchus (refutation) and maieutiek (formation) are distinguished: the first is the destructive, critical part of thinking, aimed at undermining an incorrect opinion or thought; the second is constructive, aimed at forming a correct true opinion or a correct true judgment.Furthermore, I studied how to elaborate these theological teacher models by considering the effectiveness of a discussion, as well as typical theological teacher guidance skills.A more effective discussionIn earlier research, doing philosophy at a higher level was found, first, in the presence o f shared guidance of the discussion by the teacher and the students, and second, rather in a philosophical dialogue in the form of a discussion than in the form of classroom talk.Showing understanding, giving space and listeningEarlier research also showed that the specific contribution of a more effective religious education and/or world view teacher is to show understanding, give space and listen. I conclude that this is close to Pratt's perspective of nurturing. This perspective of nurturing, trust, challenging and achievable goals, encouragement and clear expectations is for the time being the most extensive theological teacher model. Possibly this is in the heart of the matter of religious education and/or world view teachers.Witness and witnessingAs Pollefeyt stated, a religious education and/or world view teacher is a witness, specialist and moderator. The teacher is a committed witness to his or her own world view, which has been obtained by himself or herself.However, the teacher is also a committed witness to the students 'world view, where the students 'world view will be obtained by the students themselves.I conclude that reflections about theological teacher models are worthwhile to present in education. It is important that teachers, partly thanks to these models, can show appropriate domain-specific teacher behavior at the right time, and with the right goal in mind. The value of the above elaboration does not have to be limited to secondary education, but is also valuable for lecturers at university level.

TI  - Estimation of health benefits from air quality improvement using the MODIS AOD dataset in Seoul, Korea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Exposure to fine particles in the atmosphere can adversely affect health and even lead to premature death. Recently, South Korea has attracted attention because of its rapid increase in the concentration of Particulate Matter (PM).Objectives: We estimated the economic benefits of reducing PM10 in Seoul, South Korea, based on MODeratere solution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Based on the retrieved PM10 data, we estimated its effects on overall health in each district of Seoul, Korea between 2014 and 2015.Methods: The relationships between MODIS AOD and ground-based PM10 data were identified in different seasons in South Korea between 2012 and 2013 using the linear regression model. The health benefits were estimated by the Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (Benmap) using the scenarios from the World Health Organization (WHO).Results: The correlation between MODIS AOD and PM10 concentration differed with the season. There was a higher correlation between MODIS AOD and PM10 concentration in winter (R = 0.57) than there was in other seasons. Based on the MODIS AOD, the average annual PM10 concentration in Seoul was higher in 2014 than it was in 2015, at values of 45.7 mu g/m(3), and 41.6 mu g/m(3), respectively. The greatest economic benefit of reducing PM10 concentration (WHO annual standard of 20 mu g/m(3)) was in 2014. This benefit was estimated to be 7022 (95% CI: 599, 20496), 2617 (95% CI: 216, 7750), and 1328 (95% CI: -159, 4679) billion KRW for all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortalities in 2014 and 2015, respectively.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that, despite considerable improvements in air quality in recent decades, there is still a need for countermeasures to prevent economic loss due to air pollution in Seoul.

TI  - Long-Term Trend of Green and Golden Tides in the Eastern Yellow Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2008, floating green tides (Ulva sp.) have been occurring continuously in the Yellow Sea (YS), and after 2013 floating golden tides (Sargassum sp.) have also occurred. The distribution, areal coverage, and migration of floating green tides have been actively studied, but most research has focused only on the western YS. Little is known about the floating golden tides in the eastern YS. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term distribution of floating green and golden tides in the eastern YS using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat satellite images from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the migration of floating macroalgae with Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) surface current data were compared. Green tides were observed in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016 in the eastern YS. From a satellite image backtracking analysis, it was confirmed that the green tides observed in the eastern YS were supplied from the western YS. When the maximum areal coverage of green tide was compared between the eastern and western YS, the coverage in the eastern YS was found to be about 4 % of that of the western YS. However, in 2011, the largest amount of floating macroalgae was found in the eastern YS and it accounted for about 45 % of the amount in the western part of the YS. In the eastern YS, floating golden tides were found in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the largest amount of floating macroalgae occurring in 2017. Although there were no long-term golden tide data for the western YS, such that it was not compared to the areal coverage of the eastern YS, it was confirmed that the amount of golden tide supplied to the eastern YS gradually increased. A comparison between the migration of floating macroalgae and HYCOM surface current data suggested that the migration and flow directions were not identical, and were considerably affected by surface ocean currents during their passage into the eastern YS. From this study, the long-term distribution and changes in areal coverage of green and golden tides in the eastern YS were obtained for the first time. This information will be useful for understanding the long-term patterns of green and golden tides, and provides basic data for predicting the occurrence and migration of floating macroalgae.

TI  - Toward archaeological predictive modeling in the Bosutswe region of Botswana: Utilizing multispectral satellite imagery to conceptualize ancient landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial technologies such as GIS, remote sensing, and GNSS are transforming landscape archaeology, particularly in research areas that are hard to access due to geographical size, environmental challenges, lack of infrastructure, and/or political instability. In the following article, we explore the potential of high-resolution, multispectral satellite imagery for building a predictive model of the settlement pattern of the Iron Age polity of Bosutswe (700-1650 CE) in Botswana. While the case study lies in Africa, the problems that Africanists experience extend far beyond the continent. With limited funding, poor access to survey regions, and countless others, predictive modelling has the potential to identify more robust archaeological landscapes.Using ArcGIS 10.6, ENVI 5.4, and WorldView 2 and 3 imagery, we catalog 22 prospective archaeological sites within a 5 km radius of Bosutswe (100 sq. km ), demonstrating the potential for image classification to identify sites difficult to locate in a traditional pedestrian survey. The discovery of these new, often small sites has implications for past environmental utilization and for regional sociopolitical dynamics. We describe our test excavation at one new site, Letlalolanoga, to demonstrate how it may contribute towards a growing body of literature that favors heterarchical power relations within African complex societies.

TI  - A Simple Approximation for the Reflectance of a Thick Cloud in Gaseous Absorption Band and Its Application for the Cloud-Top Height Determination
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new, simple, fast method to retrieve cloud altitude from measurements of light absorption in the strongest molecular band of oxygen (the A-band), centered at 761 nm, by the polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance sensor. First, we assess the validity of the method against synthetic spectra as a function of realistic cloud scenarios and satellite observation geometries. The retrieval error estimate amounts, on average, to less than 500 m. Second, the hurricane Ileana, overpassed the August 30, 2012, off the coasts west of Mexico and Southern California, is selected as test bed for the comparison of our retrievals against independent and nearly coincident cloud data inferred with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard Aqua and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 onboard MetOp-A. We find that our approach can accurately reproduce the cloud height patterns, as long as the clouds are not thin cirrus.

TI  - Improved Retrieval of Ice and Open Water From Sequential RADARSAT-2 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a new technique for automated detection of ice and open water from sequential RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR dual-polarization HH-HV images. The technique is based on combining a previously developed approach to ice and water detection applied to single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with the ice motion information derived from sequential SAR images. To evaluate the new approach, it was applied to 736 SAR image pairs acquired in 2013. Compared with the previous approach, the new approach produced an increase in the fraction of correctly classified water samples from 57.7% to 72.6% while the fraction of correctly classified ice samples did not change appreciably. The overall accuracy stayed at a high level exceeding 99.8%, when compared against the Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis pure ice and water samples. Verification results for different regions and months showed that the detection accuracy exceeds 99.5% for the most regions and months. The proposed approach can also assign enhanced quality to ice and water retrievals found in the reference image. The results are particularly relevant in light of the upcoming Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission which will significantly increase the amount and frequency of SAR observations over the Arctic region.

TI  - The Title of a Literary Text as a Discursive Phenomenon
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern text linguistics pays serious attention to the significant structural elements of the text, which carry special knowledge. Such structural elements include the title. In this article, the title is considered as a linguistic and cognitive characteristic and a spatially fixed structural element of the text - "frame", which is located around/before/behind the text, focusing on the importance of the title position in the research of discourse of writer. The titles refer to the elements of the text that carry a special "presuppositional" knowledge, on the basis of which the title as a constructive element of the text requires analysis, mediated by inclusion in the speech-thinking continuum. At that, the title occupies a dominant, but secondary role in relation to the text. In the context of a linguistic and cultural scientific paradigm, the title can be considered as a special text of culture, reflecting the worldview of a particular author and the linguistic picture of the world of the people as a whole. In addition, the header can be comprehended as the object of cognitive linguistics in the aspect of knowledge study about the outer world, carried out by means of language. The duality of the title, on the one hand, is manifested in its "auto semantics", and the independence of this informative unit of the text; on the other hand, its inclusion in the text determines its ontological specificity. In this regard, the two-pronged approach - linguistic and cognitive - combines conceptual analysis with discourse and is very productive in relation to the understanding of the structural elements of the text as a whole and titles - in particular - as representations of the individual picture of the world of the author's, resulting in the process of cognition, since the originality of the linguistic picture of the world of an author is manifested in the choice and combination of lexical means in accordance with a certain artistic purpose and author's attitude and it reflects the general direction of the work and the peculiarities of the linguistic picture of the world of the artist of word.

TI  - The Grammar of Turkish in Translation Training: Functional Approach
T2  - SELCUK UNIVERSITESI EDEBIYAT FAKULTESI DERGISI-SELCUK UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF FACULTY OF LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problems in the translation process caused by the structural approach to Turkish adopted by the students of translation, with Turkish being their native language, and highlights the necessity to develop a functional approach to Turkish in translation teaching alongside the traditional grammar books with a structural paradigm. The structural approach to Turkish adopted by the students since elementary school is seen to be a triggering factor behind the words, phrases, sentences and texts derived according to the "linguistic worldview" of Turkish language during the translation into the target language. Thus, the problem of university coursebooks on Turkish as well as other sources on the subject used by the students of translation is introduced. The article reveals the problems encountered during the translation training/foreign language learning by the native Turkish students who try to apply the traditional Turkish grammar focusing on structural level of the language, with examples given for the Turkish-Russian language pair. The main focus of the article is the - dik structures known as "sifat-fiil" in Turkish grammar that can cause problems in Turkish-Russian translation process. The necessity of applying functional analysis to the - dik structures, being an inseperable element of the socio-political texts, in the translation process is underlined. The importance of functional approach perspective for the native language to be developed by the student studying translation is emphasized.

TI  - Teachers' beliefs as a component of motivational force of professional agency
T2  - LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates teachers' beliefs - addressed here as worldviews - in the context of educational change. The intention is to develop a dynamic approach according to which worldviews are professional resources of meanings and personal constructs. We questioned what constitutes their 'mental realm' and how they, referring to subjective realities of a person's world construction, can be conceived as collective and professionally shared. The topic was tackled theoretically in the frame of a cultural-historical approach to mind in which we drew upon insights of the integrative concept of meaningful activity. Worldviews were addressed in a school-based development of a secondary school in Austria when the teachers were updating their school's profile. A special interview method (Ultimate Meanings Technique, UMT; Leontiev, 2007) was used to assist teachers and mediate their discussions on worldviews. In the findings, we propose methodological ideas for addressing 'the mental' and approaching worldviews as a type of tertiary artefacts, discuss the role of the UMT interviews in the school-based development and draw attention to a historical tension inside professional vision. The article underlines the importance of worldviews for creating historically responsive space of core meanings and for strengthening professional power of educators' taking agency for change.

TI  - Water-quality genesis in a mountain catchment affected by acidification and forestry practices
T2  - FRESHWATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of changes in air pollution and forest cover on the acid atmospheric deposition and runoff were studied in the Jizerka experimental catchment (Czech Republic), a sensitive mountain environment of low buffering capacity. From 1982 to 2015, resident scientists and volunteers measured water quality of precipitation, fog, and stream samples at the watershed level. Archived LANDSAT imagery was used to reconstruct changes in forest composition in the watershed based on a detailed ground inventory done in 2010 to 2012. Spatial interpolation was used to approximate atmospheric deposition of water and SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ over the watershed area. The open-field load of S peaked in 1987 to 1988 and dropped substantially in the 1990s, but inorganic N did not show a significant trend. The N : S deposition ratio increased from 0.37 to 2.83. Mean annual stream-water pH increased from 4.2 to 5.9, and concentrations of SO42- and NO3- decreased by 55 and 53%, respectively. Seasonal acidification of stream water was observed during snowmelt (March, April) and episodic summer rainstorms. The relatively rapid response of stream-water quality to reduced deposition corresponded with subsurface runoff generated in a shallow podzolic soil. Relatively high leaching of NO3- in the 1980s followed limited N uptake in damaged spruce stands and clear-cut areas. Recovery of stream-water chemistry followed the drop in the acid atmospheric deposition by similar to 5 y, and stream biota revived after 10 to 15 y. Removal of spruce forest and reduced air pollution caused faster recovery from acidification than expected from pure air-quality improvement. Reduced atmospheric deposition and fog-drip interactions caused by lower canopy area suggest that modified forestry practices can affect deposition rates and stream-water quality. Deciduous or mixed forests could decrease the acidic atmospheric load by reducing leaf area and surface roughness.

T2  - PHRONESIS-A JOURNAL FOR ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - I offer a fresh interpretation of the dialectical strategy of Physics 2.8's arguments that things in nature happen for the sake of something. Whereas many recent interpreters have concluded that these arguments inevitably beg the question against Aristotle's opponents, I argue that they constitute a careful attempt to build common ground with an opponent who rejects Aristotle's basic worldview. This common ground, first articulated in the famous Winter Rain Argument, takes the form of an intriguing pattern of reasoning: that natural proceedings that happen in a given manner always or for the most part do not do so by chance.

TI  - Pecs II-block in breast cancer surgery: a pilot study on clinical routine procedures
T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Regional anaesthesia for breast cancer surgery can effectively reduce acute postoperative pain and is associated with a lower risk of chronic pain development. The Pecs II-block has been suggested as an effective means for breast cancer surgery. After introduction of this block in daily routine we analysed its efficacy in an unselected group of patients.Methods: 60 patients were included (30 Pecs, 30 controls). Applying the PAIN OUT questionnaire we gathered acute pain levels (min/max) after surgery, opioid consumption, respiratory compromise, sleep disorder, impairment of the agility in and out of bed and patient satisfaction. Demographic data and comorbidities were taken out of the routine clinical documentation.Results: Patients in the Pecs group needed significantly less opioid and had lower pain scores compared to the control group. Except for a lower degree of dizziness in the Pecs group, there was no difference in terms of opioidrelated side effects. Patients in the Pecs group reported significantly less respiratory compromise (NRS 0.37 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.8; p = 0.0025) and sleep disorder (NRS 0.9 +/- 1.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.5; p = 0.005). The Pecs group also revealed an improvement for pain interference with activities in bed (1.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.0 +/- 2.5; p = 0.005) and out of bed (0.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.9; p = 0.001). Nevertheless both groups were similarly satisfied with their pain treatment.Conclusions: Performing Pecs II-blocks for breast-conserving therapy with excision of sentinel lymph nodes constitutes an effective analgesic strategy even in non-selected patients. As this technique is easy to learn it should be used as a standard feature in breast cancer patients.

AB  - This article proposes an integrative analysis of the ouranology of 3 Baruch. This apocalyptic work, properly read, manifests complex ouranological conceptions well integrated not only into early Jewish literature and Hellenistic thought, but also into later mystical traditions. The unique worldview of the book has heretofore given rise to a complex set of interpretive problems; the detailed comparative approach of the present article not only provides a reasonable solution, but also sheds light on the cosmological conceptions of other early Jewish documents and the traditions lying behind them.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle] to aid management actions
T2  - WEED TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrilla is an invasive aquatic plant that has rapidly spread through many inland water bodies across the globe by outcompeting native aquatic plants. The negative impacts of hydrilla invasion have become a concern for water resource management authorities, power companies, and environmental scientists. The early detection of hydrilla infestation is very important to reduce the costs associated with control and removal efforts of this invasive species. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a tool for rapid, frequent, and large-scale monitoring and predicting spatial extent of hydrilla habitat. This was achieved by integrating in situ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager satellite data for Lake J. Strom Thurmond, the largest US Army Corps of Engineers lake east of the Mississippi River, located on the border of Georgia and South Carolina border. The predictive model for presence of hydrilla incorporated radiometric and physical measurements, including remote-sensing reflectance, Secchi disk depth (SDD), light-attenuation coefficient (K-d), maximum depth of colonization (Z(c)), and percentage of light available through the water column (PLW). The model-predicted ideal habitat for hydrilla featured high SDD, Z(c), and PLW values, low values of K-d. Monthly analyses based on satellite images showed that hydrilla starts growing in April, reaches peak coverage around October, begins retreating in the following months, and disappears in February. Analysis of physical and meteorological factors (i.e., water temperature, surface runoff, net inflow, precipitation) revealed that these parameters are closely associated with hydrilla extent. Management agencies can use these results not only to plan removal efforts but also to evaluate and adapt their current mitigation efforts.

TI  - Tree diversity assessment and above ground forests biomass estimation using SAR remote sensing: A case study of higher altitude vegetation of North-East Himalayas, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is one of the significant components for assessing the productivity and sustainability of the forest's ecosystem. In the present study, the mapping and estimation of above ground biomass (AGB) was performed using field observations employing allometric equations and C band Sentinel 1A and L band Advanced Land Observation System (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) remote sensing satellite images for the parts of north eastern Himalayan forests, Arunachal Pradesh. Total 57 transects of 500 m x 10 m size was laid in West Kameng and Tawang districts (altitude range: 1047-4161 m) of Arunachal Pradesh, in which a total of 12203 individuals of 67 tree species (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) range: 3.18-235.45 cm) was recorded. The study exhibited higher tree density (428 individuals' ha(-1)) and basal cover (7658.63 m(2)ha(-1)) in the studied forests. The highest above ground biomass was contributed by Castanopsis indica (103.82 t ha(-1)) followed by Pinus roxburghii (46.24 t ha(-1)) and Quercus semicarpifolia (23.14 t ha(-1)). Further, AGB was estimated using the Horizontal-Horizontal (HH), Horizontal-Vertical (HV) polarizations acquired by the ALOS PALSAR 50m mosaic (2008) dataset and Vertical-Vertical (VV), Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarizations acquired by the Sentinel 1A dataset. The relationship between field based AGB and radar backscatter for selected sample plots was established using pair wise correlation. While comparing the two satellite-based SAR images, it is observed that high correlation between radar backscatter and field based AGB was observed in ALOS PALSAR as compared to Sentinel 1A SAR. This is due to higher sensitive to backscatter values and higher penetration level of L band ALOS PALSAR as compared to C band Sentinel 1A SAR. The correlation study indicates high correlation of HV polarizations in ALOS PALSAR (HV polarization R-2= 0.63; HH polarization R-2= 0.58) as compared to Sentinel 1A (VV polarization R-2= 0.054 and VH polarization R-2= 0.044). The most accurate and reliable method to estimate AGB is the field based method, but it is time consuming and tedious. Whereas, AGB estimation by L band SAR remote sensing is time effective and can be used for larger area in comparatively less time. The present study exhibited poor species diversity in higher altitudes northeast Himalayan forests as species diversity decreases with increase in altitudes. On the other hand, the higher AGB in the studied forests may be due to favorable environmental conditions including less temperature and more nutrient availability as well as less biotic interferences in terms of anthropogenic disturbances, herbivory and grazing. The study signifies the potential use of L and C band backscatter information in the reliable estimation of spatial AGB in subtropical to alpine forests of Arunachal Pradesh.

TI  - Prototype Downscaling Algorithm for MODIS Satellite 1 km Daytime Active Fire Detections
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents development of an algorithm to reduce the spatial uncertainty of active fire locations within the 1 km MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS Aqua and Terra) daytime detection footprint. The algorithm is developed using the finer 500 m reflective bands by leveraging on the increase in 2.13 mu m shortwave infrared reflectance due to the burning components as compared to the non-burning neighborhood components. Active fire presence probability class for each of the 500 m pixels within the 1 km footprint is assigned by locally adaptive contextual tests against its surrounding neighborhood pixels. Accuracy is assessed using gas flares and wildfires in conjunction with available high-resolution imagery. Proof of concept results using MODIS observations over two sites show that under clear sky conditions, over 84% of the 500 m locations that had active fires were correctly assigned to high to medium probabilities, and correspondingly low to poor probabilities were assigned to locations with no visible flaming fronts. Factors limiting the algorithm performance include fire size/temperature distributions, cloud and smoke obscuration, sensor point spread functions, and geolocation errors. Despite these limitations, the resulting finer spatial scale of active fire detections will not only help first responders and managers to locate actively burning fire fronts more precisely but will also be useful for the fire science community.

TI  - HEMATOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND METAL CONTAMINANT LEVELS IN WILD-CAUGHT CLAPPER RAIL (<i>RALLUS CREPITANS</i>) IN NORTHEASTERN FLORIDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The clapper rail (Rallus crepitans) is native to salt marshes along the eastern United States. Populations are likely stable, but may be at risk due to the degradation of wetland habitat by contaminants. Contaminants can cause adverse effects in birds such as alteration of immune and reproductive function, and previous studies have used this species as a sentinel for estuarine health. Blood samples were collected from clapper rails in Florida and hematology counts, plasma biochemistry panels, and metal assessments using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry were performed. Biochemical and hematology data were too limited to determine if contaminants were adversely affecting clapper rails in this study, but cadmium, lead, and zinc were increased for several birds. Although contaminant levels were not consistently elevated for all birds, additional research is needed to assess if clapper rails in this region are at risk of contaminant exposure due to increasing urbanization and development pressures.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, modified CO2-baited encephalitis virus surveillance (EVS) traps were evaluated for flavivirus surveillance in the Northern Territory, Australia. The traps were fitted with honey-soaked nucleic acid preservation cards (FTA(TM)) for mosquitoes to expectorate virus while feeding on the cards. Cards were tested for the presence of selected arboviruses, with two cards testing positive for Kunjin virus and Alfuy, while sentinel chickens tested in parallel also showed Kunjin virus activity at the same time. The results from the cards and vector mosquito feeding rates indicate that CO2-baited EVS traps coupled with honey-baited FTA(TM) cards are an effective tool for broad-scale arbovirus surveillance.

TI  - Why Teach about Religions? Perspectives from Finnish Professionals
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acknowledging recent research literature on professionalism and religious education across Europe, the article examines the scholars' and senior professionals' views on the curricula aims and objectives in religious education in Finland. Through asking the professionals' views on the aims of RE in relation to supporting of child's growth and development on one hand and the societal aims of RE on the other, the findings were thematically classified into the following categories. Firstly, the aims regarding the supporting of child's growth and development were focused on literacy on religions and worldviews, increasing the understanding on oneself and others, personal growth, and the skills for global citizenship. From the societal perspective, RE was seen important for supporting the understanding as literacy, understanding as empathy, and competences for global citizenship. Finally, as regards the educational model of teaching about religions, these professionals held somewhat varied views. Some favoured an RE model based on teaching groups reflecting children's own worldview affiliations, others supported whole-class instruction, and still others a hybrid model combining elements of both. However, the way in which the instruction is implemented and the position from which religions are examined in education were perceived to be in a key role in this, whatever the formal structures for instruction.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to generate DSM using the stereo matching algorithm of worldview-1 stereo images and verify the accuracy of the generated DSM. To generate DSM, RPC block modeling was performed to correct RPC errors, and image matching was performed using SGM, which is a stereo matching algorithm after the epipolar image was generated. The COST for SGM was calculated by using CENSUS, and 4-paths and 8-paths were applied for COST aggregation in SGM. To verify the quality and accuracy of the generated DSM, it was compared with the LiDAR-derived DSM and the DSM generated by commercial SW. The results showed that the vertical accuracy of the generated DSM using 4-paths of COST aggregation was 1.647 m to 3.689 m (RMSE). In case of using 8-paths of COST aggregation was 1.550 m to 3.106 m (RMSE).

TI  - Multi-Temporal Agricultural Land-Cover Mapping Using Single-Year and Multi-Year Models Based on Landsat Imagery and IACS Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and location of crops are necessary information for agricultural planning. The free availability of optical satellites such as Landsat offers an opportunity to obtain this key information. Crop type mapping using satellite data is challenged by its reliance on ground truth data. The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) data, submitted by farmers in Europe for subsidy payments, provide a solution to the issue of periodic field data collection. The present study tested the performance of the IACS data in the development of a generalized predictive crop type model, which is independent of the calibration year. Using the IACS polygons as objects, the mean spectral information based on four different vegetation indices and six Landsat bands were extracted for each crop type and used as predictors in a random forest model. Two modelling methods called single-year (SY) and multiple-year (MY) calibration were tested to find out their performance in the prediction of grassland, maize, summer, and winter crops. The independent validation of SY and MY resulted in a mean overall accuracy of 71.5% and 77.3%, respectively. The field-based approach of calibration used in this study dealt with the salt and pepper' effects of the pixel-based approach.

AB  - Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon, and one of its factors is land use land cover (LULC) change. LULC is frequently remolding the face of Earth, owing to both natural and anthropogenic reasons. This change is also responsible for temperature variations on the land surface. The aim of the present study is to draw a spatiotemporal association between LULC, elevation and land surface temperature (LST), considering the region of Ajmer and its vicinity. For the study, satellite images of 1993, 2008 and 2017 of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 are used. To obtain the LST, window algorithm was employed. Changes in LULC were analyzed and further verified by field data. Relation between LST and elevation was drawn with the help of digital elevation model. It was established that the built-up land has increased by 2.42% since 1993-2017 indicating population growth. Considering LST, maximum mean temperatures were found for degraded/sandy soil; hills/barren/uncultivated land; and fallow land. The lowest temperatures were observed for vegetation and water bodies. Henceforth, it is essential to draw a relation between LULC and LST to have improved perception of the effects of changing land covers on the urban climate.

TI  - Afropolitanism and Cultural Ambivalence in Contemporary Nigerian Drama: A Case Study of Ade Solanke's <i>Pandora</i>'<i>s Box</i>
T2  - RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Afropolitanism refers to the claim of universal citizenship by African migrants. In literary theatrical studies, a debate has been introduced about the cultural status of African immigrants. The main question has been how to strike a balance between their African identity and the new models of identity they are confronted with in host countries. This article examines the articulation of Afropolitanism and cultural ambivalence as identity reconfigurations in Ade Solanke's Pandora's Box (2012). Taking as a point of departure the experience of African immigrants in the UK, it asserts that in a globalized changing world marked by the rapid spatial migration of individuals and cultural interpenetrations, literary discourses have shifted from Afrocentrism (a cultural ideology or worldview that focuses on African history and identity) to Afropolitanism as global citizenship, giving way to the building of a new African identity in a hybrid modern world. The article argues that identity, sometimes a controversial concept, is very flexible and can be reshaped to suit the needs of the times and circumstances. Taking the example of African immigrants living in the UK, as represented in the characters in Pandora's Box, the article asserts that cultural homecoming is essential for the survival of African values.

TI  - Identification of Burned Areas and Severity Using SAR Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we performed investigations on the potentiality of the Sentinel-1, C-band synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), for the characterization and mapping of burned areas and fire severity. To this aim, we focused on fire occurred on July 13, 2017, in Metaponto (South of Italy). Both VH and VV polarizations were considered. Radar Burn Difference (RBD) and radar burn ratio (RBR) were computed between Sentinel-1 data acquired before and after the fire using both single-and time-averaged scenes (to reduce speckle noise effects). The most marked differences between burned and unburned areas were observed in the VH polarization of both RBD and RBR. The novelty of our approach is based on the use of three steps data processing devised to identify different levels of fire severity without using fixed thresholds. The burned areas are first: 1) highlighted using the ratio between multitemporal data set acquired before and after the fire occurrence; 2) further enhanced by Getis-Ord spatial statistic; and 3) finally, categorized using ISODATA unsupervised classification. The approach herein proposed pointed out that: 1) the time-averaged ratio of VH polarization of Sentinel-1 well perform in mapping burned area and 2) the use of Getis-Ord spatial statistic coupled with ISODATA unsupervised classification suitably captures the diverse levels of burned severity as confirmed by in situ assessment.

TI  - Multi-Scale Remote Sensing-Assisted Forest Inventory: A Glimpse of the State-of-the-Art and Future Prospects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Advances in remote inventory and analysis of forest resources during the last decade have reached a level to be now considered as a crucial complement, if not a surrogate, to the long-existing field-based methods. This is mostly reflected in not only the use of multiple-band new active and passive remote sensing data for forest inventory, but also in the methodic and algorithmic developments and/or adoptions that aim at maximizing the predictive or calibration performances, thereby minimizing both random and systematic errors, in particular for multi-scale spatial domains. With this in mind, this editorial note wraps up the recently-published Remote Sensing special issue Remote Sensing-Based Forest Inventories from Landscape to Global Scale, which hosted a set of state-of-the-art experiments on remotely sensed inventory of forest resources conducted by a number of prominent researchers worldwide.

AB  - The collective action that is required to mitigate and adapt to climate change is extremely difficult to achieve, largely due to socio-ideological biases that perpetuate polarization over climate change(1,2). Because climate change perceptions in children seem less susceptible to the influence of worldview or political contexts(3), it may be possible for them to inspire adults towards higher levels of climate concern, and in turn, collective action(4). Child-to-parent intergenerational learning-that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes or behaviours from children to parents(5)-may be a promising pathway to over-coming socio-ideological barriers to climate concerns(5). Here we present an experimental evaluation of an educational intervention designed to build climate change concern among parents indirectly through their middle school-aged children in North Carolina, USA. Parents of children in the treatment group expressed higher levels of climate change concern than parents in the control group. The effects were strongest among male parents and conservative parents, who, consistent with previous research(1), displayed the lowest levels of climate concern before the intervention. Daughters appeared to be especially effective in influencing parents. Our results suggest that intergenerational learning may overcome barriers to building climate concern.

TI  - Small and Isolated Immunohistochemistry-positive Cells in Melanoma Sentinel Lymph Nodes Are Associated With Disease-specific and Recurrence-free Survival Comparable to that of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Negative for Melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although immunohistochemistry (IHC) has improved our ability to detect melanoma metastases in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) does not provide a lower threshold for determining if a SLN is positive for metastasis. Existing literature suggests that even a small aggregate or an enlarged, abnormal cell detectable by IHC can be associated with an adverse outcome. In our experience, however, some SLNs contain small solitary cells the size of neighboring lymphocytes demonstrable only by IHC. We sought to determine their clinical significance. A total of 821 patients underwent a SLN biopsy at our institution over a 12-year period. In all, 639 (77.8%) were SLN-negative, 125 (15.2%) were SLN-positive, and 57 (6.9%) had rare IHC-positive cells of undetermined clinical significance with no disease progression over a mean 59-month follow-up. Kaplan-Meier method with pair-wise comparisons revealed no significant difference in disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival between SLN-negative and rare IHC-positive groups. There were significant differences in survival and recurrence between patients in the rare IHC-positive group and those with melanoma metastases, including those with solitary melanoma cells and those with tumor burdens <= 0.2 mm. While the lower diagnostic threshold for metastatic melanoma on IHC-stained sections needs to be studied further, our data suggest that rare IHC-positive cells lacking cytomorphologic features of overt malignancy are equivocal for melanoma and could impart a similar prognosis as patients with no evidence of SLN involvement.

TI  - Comparison of Particulate Organic Carbon to Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Ratio Based on the Ocean Color Satellite Data at the Ieodo and Socheongcho Ocean Research Stations
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ieodo ocean research station (IORS) and the Socheongcho ocean research station (SORS) have been operated in South Korea to carry out a research across multiple disciplines. The IORS and the SORS are affected by various water masses such as Tsushima Warm Current (TWC), Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) and Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW). Therefore, the IORS and the SORS are suitable for the research on the physio-ecological response of phytoplankton to environmental changes. The particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll-a ratio (POC:Chl-a) has been widely used for an indicator of the ecological and physiological conditions of the phytoplankton. The purpose of this study is to investigate the POC:Chl-a ratio and its controlling factors at the IORS and the SORS by using satellite dataset. At the IORS, POC:Chl-a ratio ranged from 166.16 to 431.20, and the average was 322.14 +/- 46.35. On the other hand, at the SORS, POC:Chl-a ratio ranged from 131.92 to 703.98, and the average was 385.05 +/- 123.95. The POC:Chl-a ratio was higher at the SORS from autumn to winter. However, POC:Chl-a ratio in the IORS showed similar ranges in every month. The difference in POC:Chl-a ratio between the IORS and the SORS appear to be caused by differences of environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, and nutrients. However, to reveal the detailed relationship between environmental conditions and POC:Chl-a ratio, a further study on seasonal variations of the phytoplankton community structure and several environmental parameters would be warrant.

TI  - 5-year oncological outcomes of targeted axillary sampling in pT1-2N1 breast cancer
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) has been a standard treatment in breast cancer with positive sentinel LNs. However, various short- and long-term postoperative morbidities have been reported after conventional ALND. To define the concept of targeted axillary sampling (AS) and to assess its oncological feasibility for breast cancer. We compared the oncological outcomes in the axillary area between conventional ALND and targeted AS with or without radiotherapy.Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine female patients with cT1-2N1 breast cancer underwent breast and axillary surgery. We defined the concept of targeted AS in clinical and pathological terms, and the oncological outcomes were compared between ALND and AS, and between AS with and without radiotherapy.Results: There were no significant differences in oncological outcomes in the axilla between conventional ALND and AS, or between AS with radiotherapy and AS alone.Conclusions: The 5-year oncological outcomes of targeted AS were not inferior to those of conventional ALND, regardless of whether radiotherapy was added.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Analysis of <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> Habitat Using Data Mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of Ruditapes philippinarum habitat in Geunso Bay, South Korea. R. philippinarum samples were acquired through in-situ observation. Remotely sensed data were used to derive factors related to R. philippinarum habitat. A spatial distribution map was generated using a data-mining model focused on the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) model with a spatial dataset of eight R. philippinarum habitat-related factors: training data of R. philippinarum observations, spectral reflectance factor, sediment type factor, tidal channel factors (density of and distance from the tidal channel), and morphological factors (elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect and exposure time). Validation analysis was performed through comparison with observed habitat locations. The accuracy rate of the CHAID model was 84.7 % (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.847) using success rate analysis and 74.5 % (AUC = 0.745) using prediction rate analysis. The data-mining model based on remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) tools is an efficient method for mapping the spatial distribution of R. philippinarum habitat in tidal flats.

TI  - Classification of Halophytes from Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery in Ganghwa Island, Korea Using Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveying methods have limitations when investigating the vegetation of mudflats, which are difficult to access due to tidal variations. The use of remote sensing data to explore inaccessible targets and regions is an effective approach to analyzing vegetation species. Recently, hyperspectral images, composed of several tens to several hundreds of spectral bands, have been effectively utilized to classify and analyze halophytes using spectral reflectance differences. In this study, halophytes were classified from an airborne hyperspectral image of the Dongmak beach using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. Dongmak beach is located on Ganghwa Island, Korea, where mudflats are well developed. Since the hyperspectral image has many spectral bands, it was tried to reduce the number of bands. To do this, the statistical values of halophytes and mudflats from all of the hyperspectral bands were first calculated by using several methods, including parallelepiped, Mahalanobis distance, minimum distance, spectral information divergence, and a spectral angle mapper. The statistical images were then used to classify halophytes and mudflats by applying a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN). The achieved accuracy of the MLP-ANN classification was about 95.02 %. Some areas composed of halophytes were misclassified as mudflats. These results will reduce the time and cost of field investigations in large areas.

TI  - Shoreline Movement Monitoring and Geomorphologic Changes of Beaches Using Lidar and UAVs Images on the Coast of the East Sea, Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy beaches are important habitats for coastal organisms and act as buffer zones during coastal disasters. Most of the coastal zone along the eastern coast of Korea consists of sandy beaches. However, beach erosion has been accelerating in recent years. In this study, shoreline movement and topographical changes were analyzed in Uljingun on the East Sea coast of Korea using remotely sensed data from airborne Lidar and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The shoreline changes extracted were statistically quantified using net shoreline movement (NSM) and linear regression rate (LRR) in the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS). Morphological changes were quantified based on a comparison of the digital surface maps (DSM) generated by Lidar and UAVs. Shoreline movement and morphological changes were analyzed over the short-term (February 2016 to February 2019) and long-term (June 2008 to June 2018). Seaward migration was dominant for 7.02 m, 1.64 m, and 9.22 m along three defined subareas over the long-term. Over the short-term, LRR results showed landward migration as 0.7 m and 1.10 m in two of the subareas. Morphological change showed erosion and accretion occurring at approximately 0.08 m(3) and 0.42 m(3), respectively. This reverse trend indicates that a detailed DSM can detect volumetric change due to relocation of the sediment around artificial construction.

TI  - Six decades of urban green change in a neotropical city: a case study of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of expansion of human settlements commonly occurs without proper urban planning, which can directly affect green areas located within cities and adjacent areas. This study focuses on: (1) a spatiotemporal analysis to quantify the growth of the city of Xalapa (1950s to 2010s), (2) changes in woody vegetation cover within the boundaries of the city, and (3) land use and landscape changes and urban sprawl by decade from the 1980s to 2010s. To achieve this, we used digital images (i.e., ortho-photos, SPOT images), which were classified and integrated into a geographic information system. Based on the processed imagery, we delimited the urban polygon of the city, and quantified its woody vegetation cover changes and land use changes in areas surrounding the city for each decade of study. We found that over the past six decades, the city of Xalapa has grown in similar proportions per decade, mostly concentrated southward, fitting strongly and significantly to quadratic and linear growth patterns. Urban sprawl increased over the study period, Shannon's relative entropy increasing from 0.58 to 0.73. Woody cover within the city occupied a similar proportion (19-29%) of total city area throughout the study period because of the addition of patches of woody vegetation from formerly outlying areas, despite infill urbanization replacing preexisting urban green areas. Land use change in the area surrounding the city went from a transition through different uses (e.g., woody vegetation to cropland to urban; 1980s-2000s), to a direct change from woody vegetation to urban use (2000s-2010s), and exhibited landscape fragmentation over the period of study. Our results show that an integrated combination of remotely-sensed data and landscape metrics can be used to monitor urban patterns and processes, and that the results obtained can be incorporated into urban planning and management.

TI  - Performance of recombinant chimeric proteins in the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in dogs
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dogs are considered sentinels in areas of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission risk to humans. ELISA is generally the method of choice for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in dogs, but its performance substantially depends on the antigenic matrix employed. In previous studies, our group has developed four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) and evaluated their potential for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in humans. For human sera, these chimeric antigens presented superior diagnostic performances as compared to commercial tests available in Brazil, Spain, and Argentina. Therefore, in this study we have evaluated the potential of these antigenic proteins for detection of anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies in dog sera.Methodology/Principal findings The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized by checkerboard titration. Subsequently, the diagnostic potential was validated through analysis of ROC curves and the performance of the tests was determined using double entry tables. Cross-reactivity was also evaluated for babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, dirofilariosis, anaplasmosis, and visceral leishmaniosis. Best performance was shown by IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4, although all four antigens demonstrated a high diagnostic performance with 46 positive and 149 negative samples tested. IBMP-8.3 demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4 (96.7-100%), IBMP-8.2 (73.3-87.5%), and IBMP-8.1 (50-100%). The highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%), followed by IBMP-8.3 (96.7-97.5%) and IBMP 8.1 (89.1-100%).Conclusions/Significance The use of chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays for anti-T. cruzi IgG antibody detection in sera of infected dogs was shown to be a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The chimeric antigens used in this work allowed also to overcome the common hurdles related to serodiagnosis of T. cruzi infection, especially regarding variation of efficiency parameters according to different strains and cross-reactivity with other infectious diseases.Author summary Despite dogs being considered T. cruzi's most important domestic sentinel/reservoir and also suffering from the outcomes of the infection, there has never been a commercially available test to diagnose T. cruzi infection in dogs. As such, our group's objective was to develop a state-of-the-art serological diagnostic test utilizing four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) in an ELISA platform to accurately identify canine anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies. The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized, evaluated for cross-reactivity towards multiple canine parasite's, including Leishmania spp., its diagnostic potential was validated and the test's performance was determined using double entry tables. The IBMP-8.3 antigen demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4, whereas the highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%). Therefore, we've concluded that the serodiagnosis through anti-T. cruzi IgG detection in dogs, utilizing chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays is a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. Furthermore, the use of chimeric antigens efficiently addressed common hurdles related to T. cruzi serodiagnosis, especially regarding efficiency variation in response to different strains and cross-reactivity.

TI  - Ice Cloud Properties From Himawari-8/AHI Next-Generation Geostationary Satellite: Capability of the AHI to Monitor the DC Cloud Generation Process
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) successfully launched the Himawari-8 (H-8) new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor on October 7, 2014. The H-8/AHI level-2 (L2) operational cloud property products were released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency during September 2016. The Voronoi light scattering model, which is a fractal ice particle habit, was utilized to develop the retrieval algorithm called "Comprehensive Analysis Program for Cloud Optical Measurement" (CAPCOM-INV)-ice for the AHI ice cloud product. In this paper, we describe the CAPCOM-INV-ice algorithm for ice cloud products from AHI data. To investigate its retrieval performance, retrieval results were compared with 2000 samples of the ice cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius values. Furthermore, AHI ice cloud products are evaluated by comparing them with the MODIS collection-6 (C6) products. As an experiment, cloud property retrievals from AHI measurements, with an observation interval time of 2.5 min and ground-based rainfall observation radar data (the latter of which is supplied by the JMA, with a 1-km grid mesh), are used to investigate the generation processes of deep convective (DC) cloud in the vicinity of the Kyushu island, Japan. It revealed that AHI measurements have the capability of monitoring the growth processes, including variation of the cloud properties and the precipitation in the DC cloud.

TI  - Understanding pro-environmental intentions by integrating insights from social mobility, cosmopolitanism, and social dominance
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To offer an integrative account bridging individuals' sociocultural orientations with pro-environmentalism, the current research tested the mediating and moderating relationships among pro-environmental intentions and three person-level factors: perceived social mobility, cosmopolitan orientation, and social dominance orientation (SDO). With a Singaporean college student sample (N = 220), we found support for the hypothesized second-stage moderation model that perceived social mobility positively predicts cosmopolitan orientation, and in turn, cosmopolitan orientation is moderated by SDO to positively predict pro-environmental intentions. Specifically, lower levels of SDO strengthen the pro-environmental advantages of endorsing higher levels of cosmopolitan orientation. These findings add novel knowledge to the environmental psychology literature by advancing an integrative approach that demonstrates how the interplay of people's perceptions about the social, cultural, and group standing impacts their likelihood to engage in pro-environmental actions. We discuss the implications that an egalitarian worldview toward other cultures, social groups, and human-nature relations might be the key to addressing the global challenge of climate change.

TI  - Intraseasonal Variations of Summer Convection over the Tibetan Plateau Revealed by Geostationary Satellite FY-2E in 2010-14
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the infrared black body temperature (TBB) observed by the geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2E from 2010 to 2014, the seasonal migration, occurrence frequency, and intraseasonal variability of summer convection over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surrounding areas are analyzed. The results show that in May, convection mainly occurs over the eastern edge of the TP; in June, following the onset of the Asian summer monsoon, the strongest (severe) convection occurs in the southeastern part of the TP; and in July-August, strong southwesterly winds transport abundant moisture to the eastern and central areas of the TP, leading to formation of an active convection belt over southeastern TP. The results also show that in the western TP, the area with convection frequency greater than 6% occupies the southern plateau around the 37th pentad, and gradually moves northward until the end of July; in the central plateau, convection (severe convection) becomes active since early (mid) June, and maintains through the entire late summer with three major northward movements until reaching 34 degrees N; and in the eastern TP, the convection is relatively active since the beginning of May and its northward stretching is slightly later than that over the central plateau. Overall, summer convective activities are unevenly distributed over the TP, with frequency of convection decreasing from south to north; and they also exhibit considerable intraseasonal variability, the maximum of which is found over the middle reach of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the southeastern plateau. EOF analysis of summer convection frequency over the TP reveals two leading modes, with the first mode being a dipole variation pattern between the Indian monsoon region and the southeastern TP, and the second mode a tripole pattern over the western TP, the Indian continent west of 80 degrees E, and the South Asian continent east of 80 degrees E.

TI  - A Novel Unsupervised Sample Collection Method for Urban Land-Cover Mapping Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover mapping over urban areas using Landsat imagery has attracted considerable attention in recent years as it can promptly and accurately reflect the biophysical composition status of the urban landscape and allow further applications such as urban planning and risk management. However, due to the large diversity across different urban landscapes, adequate training sample collection for urban area mapping is both challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sample collection method for mapping urban areas using Landsat imagery. Specifically, the idea is to select reliable, representative, and diverse training samples from the images in a two-stage and iterative manner, based on a set of spectral indices (vegetation, impervious surface, soil, water). To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, a synthetic data set was designed and a series of Landsat images over 39 representative cities from different biomes across the world was employed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was quantitatively validated by assessing the quality of the automatically collected samples and the accuracy of the mapping results. In terms of the mapping performance, the proposed automatic approach can achieve a comparable mapping accuracy to supervised classification with manually collected samples. On the basis of the freely accessed Landsat data, the proposed approach demonstrates a promising potential for automatic large-scale (i.e., global) mapping over urban areas.

TI  - Surface charge of well-defined polymeric nano-stars regulates non-invasive fluorescence imaging of lymph node
T2  - MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) is crucial for clinical SLN biopsy surgery. Herein, we developed an innovative nanoprobe based on well-defined core crosslinked star (CCS) polymers for non-invasive fluorescence imaging of SLN. A well-defined biodegradable CCS polymer comprising multiple polyethylene glycol (PEG) arms and carboxyl terminal groups (denoted as CCS-COOH) was synthesized successfully by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization with a disulfide-based crosslinker reagent. Besides, CCS-COOH was coupled by tert-butyl carbazate to produce the CCS derivative with neutral butoxycarbonyl (Boc) terminal groups (denoted as CCS-Boc). By the removal of Boc groups, another CCS derivative with positive primary amino terminal groups (denoted as CCS-NH2) was also yielded. These CCS polymers had similar particle size but different surface charge. For SLN fluorescence imaging, the CCS polymers labeled by CY7, a near-infrared probe, exhibited superior in Vitro photo-stability to CY7 alone. After intradermal injection of the CY7-labeled CCS polymers in a mouse model, they could efficiently accumulate in the lymph node of the mouse. CY7-labeled CCS-COOH having negatively-charged surface displayed longer duration time and higher fluorescence intensity in the lymph node as compared to its counterparts with neutral or positive charge surface. In vitro and in vivo toxicity tests supported low cytotoxicity of these CCS polymers against cell lines and low systemic toxicity. The results of this work highlight the potential of negatively-charged near-infrared-emitting CCS polymer as a new nanoprobe for safe and efficient SLN imaging.

TI  - MODIS observed snow cover variations in the Aksu River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major proportion of discharge in the Aksu River is contributed from snow-and glacier-melt water. It is therefore essential to understand the cryospheric dynamics in this area for water resource management. The MODIS MOD10A2 remote-sensing database from March 2000 to December 2012 was selected to analyze snow cover changes. Snow cover varied significantly on a temporal and spatial scale for the basin. The difference of the maximum and minimum Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) in winter exceeded 70%. On average for annual cycle, the characteristic of SCF is that it reached the highest value of 53.2% in January and lowest value of 14.7% in July and the distributions of SCF along with elevation is an obvious difference between the range of 3,000 m below and 3,000 m above. The fluctuation of annual average snow cover is strong which shows that the spring snow cover was on the trend of increasing because of decreasing temperatures for the period of 2000-2012. However, temperature in April increased significantly which lead to more snowmelt and a decrease of snow cover. Thus, more attention is needed for flooding in this region due to strong melting of snow.

TI  - Retrieval of Snow Depth on Sea Ice in the Arctic Using the FengYun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow on sea ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change because it plays an important role regulating surface and near surface air temperatures. Given its high albedo and low thermal conductivity, snow cover is considered a key reason for amplified warming in polar regions. This study focuses on retrieving snow depth on sea ice from brightness temperatures recorded by the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite. After cross calibration with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) Level 2A data from January 1 to May 31, 2011, MWRI brightness temperatures were used to calculate sea ice concentrations based on the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm. Snow depths were derived according to the proportional relationship between snow depth and surface scattering at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. To eliminate the influence of uncertainties in snow grain sizes and sporadic weather effects, seven-day averaged snow depths were calculated. These results were compared with snow depths from two external data sets, the IceBridge ICDIS4 and AMSR-E Level 3 Sea Ice products. The bias and standard deviation of the differences between the MWRI snow depth and IceBridge data were respectively 1.6 and 3.2 cm for a total of 52 comparisons. Differences between MWRI snow depths and AMSR-E Level 3 products showed biases ranging between -1.01 and -0.58 cm, standard deviations from 3.63 to 4.23 cm, and correlation coefficients from 0.61 to 0.79 for the different months.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Multi-Band Active Radar Calibrator for SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, IECAS (Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) has developed a set of L-, S-, C-, and X-band active radar calibrators that are deployed during the calibration campaigns for HJ1C synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Gaofen-3 SAR, and so on. In the near future, P-band and Ka-band spaceborne SARs will be launched. We found that it is not convenient to develop special active radar calibrators (ARCs) for a specific SAR or a specific frequency band SAR, and the acquired experience could help in the design and development of a multi-band ARC. This paper describes the design and implementation of a multi-band active radar calibrator which can operate in the L-, C-, X-, and Ka-bands. Moreover, laboratory measurements are performed to characterize the performance of the multi-band ARC, paying particular attention to the gain stability, the system transfer function, the gain flatness, and the linearity of the ARC receiver. Three such ARCs are developed, and to our knowledge, the multi-band ARC is the first of its kind in China or even in the world, and it can be used to implement the calibration campaigns of the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR, Shenzhen-1 SAR, Luojia-2 SAR, and so on.

TI  - Vegetable classification in Indonesia using Dynamic Time Warping of Sentinel-1A dual polarization SAR time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of Sentinel-1A (S1A) dual polarization SAR time series data for vegetable classification in Indonesia. Vegetables are characterized by the temporal changes of observables extracted from time series of S1A data. We extracted observables regarding both backscatter (VH and VV) coefficients and decomposition features (i.e., entropy, angle, and anisotropy). The vegetable classification is based on a time-weighted Dynamic Time Warping dissimilarity measure that is calculated with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching, referred to as twDTWS. This study focuses on three main vegetable types widely planted in Indonesia, namely chili, tomato, and cucumber. We conducted vegetable classification in two areas, Malang and Lampung, using time series of S1A data covering the dry season in 2017. Our results show that the twDTWS method provides a promising means to classify vegetables using time series of S1A data for the dry season, while the features decomposed from dual polarization S1A data have little influence on the classification accuracy. Moreover, the twDTWS method with query sequences (namely reference temporal profiles) defined on the Malang dataset produced an overall accuracy of 0.80 for the classification of chili and cucumber from the Lampung dataset when the query sequences correspond to the growth cycles of vegetables. The variation in the length (i.e., the number of observations) of query sequences can affect the classification accuracy. We conclude that the twDTWS method has a high potential for classifying vegetables in different areas when constructing the query sequences of vegetables based on their growth cycles.

T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite is a cross-track scanning instrument containing 22 sounding channels in total. In this study, the bias characteristics of channels 1-6, which could have significant cloud contamination in heavy precipitation, are first analyzed based on the differences between ATMS observations (O) and model simulations (B) under clear-sky conditions over oceans. Latitudinal dependencies of the biases of window channels 1-3 are greater than those of channels 4-6. Biases of all nadir-only observations examined in different latitudinal bands [(1)(phi)] are positive and no more than 7.0 K. Biases at higher latitudes are larger. Channels 1-5 have a generally symmetric scan bias pattern [(2)()]. The global distributions of brightness temperature differences after subtracting the biases, i.e., O-B-(1)(phi)-(2)(), for channels 3-6 spatially match the liquid water path distributions. Excluding ice-affected observations, channel 3-6 O-B differences systematically increase as the liquid water path increases under cloudy conditions. Further investigation is needed to apply these findings for ATMS data assimilation under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions.

TI  - Validity of the Seattle Heart Failure Model after heart failure hospitalization
T2  - ESC HEART FAILURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Heart failure hospitalization is a sentinel event associated with increased mortality risk. Whether long-term heart failure risk models such as the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) accurately assess risk in the post-hospital setting is unknown. Methods and results The SHFM was applied to a cohort of 2242 consecutive patients (50% women; mean age 73) on discharge after acute heart failure hospitalization and analysed for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. Direct patient-level comparison between our study cohort and the original SHFM cohorts was also performed to confirm and quantify the degree and extent of increased mortality risk attributable to post-hospital status. The SHFM demonstrated good overall risk discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.704) and was well calibrated in patients The SHFM accurately predicts mortality risk in younger patients after acute heart failure hospitalization. However, patients >= 65 years old had increased adjusted mortality risk for up to 18 months after discharge compared with ambulatory heart failure patients, a pattern consistent with the well-described post-hospital syndrome.

TI  - Impact of Natural and Anthropogenic Changes on the Spatial-Temporal Variations of Total Suspended Matter in the Pearl River Estuary, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Delta and its adjacent coastal water is one of most developed regions of China, and high variability in its environment has been observed due to its subtropical monsoon climate as well as high-intensity human activity. This study aims to interpret the spatial-temporal variations of total suspended matter (TSM) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and its driving factors. An empirical band ratio TSM retrieval algorithm was developed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua images and in situ data. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and mean relative error (MRE) of the algorithm are 0.925 and 15.67 %, respectively. Significant spatial and temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) TSM variations were revealed from 2003 to 2015, which were found to gradually decrease from the western mouths of the river to its central. The monthly mean TSM was higher in winter than in summer, with a peak concentration of 33.2 mg/L in December and a low of 16.4 mg/L in August. Wind is a main driving force of TSM spatial-temporal variation, and sediment yield of the river and tide also play positive roles. Meanwhile, dam construction in the Pearl River Basin (PRB) was found to be crucial for decreasing sediment yield, and sediment yield become the main factor when the average wind speed was steadily decreased. Moreover, the uncertainty from limited Landsat observations was assessed using MODIS data, which demonstrated that the MRE was about -50 % and 50 % during most of the year, and thus higher frequency observations are required. These results gave an environmental basis for the optimized development and management of rivers and estuary in the PRB and the PRE.

TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution of the cloud optical depth over China based on MODIS satellite data during 2003-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud optical depth (COD) is one of the important parameters used to characterize atmospheric clouds. We analyzed the seasonal variations in the COD over East Asia in 2011 using cloud mode data from the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) ground-based observational network. The applicability of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) COD product was verified and compared with the AERONET cloud mode dataset. There was a good correlation between the AERONET and the MODIS. The spatial and temporal distribution and trends in the COD over China were then analyzed using MODIS satellite data from 2003 to 2016. The seasonal changes in the AERONET data and the time sequence variation of the satellite data suggest that the seasonal variations in the COD are significant. The result shows that the COD first decreases and then increases with the season in northern China, and reaches the maximum in summer and minimum in winter. However, the spatial distribution change is just the opposite in southern China. The spatial variation trend shows the COD in China decreases first with time and gradually increases after 2014. And the trend of COD in the western and central China is consistent with that in China. While the trend of COD shows a continuously increasing over time in northeast China and the Pearl River Delta.

TI  - On Gleaning Knowledge From Cross Domains by Sparse Subspace Correlation Analysis for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the availability of an increasing amount of remote sensing images, problems still arise in that the knowledge from existing images is underutilized and the collection of reference knowledge for each newly obtained image is expensive. Recently, an attractive solution called "transfer learning" has received increasing attention in the remote sensing field, by transferring knowledge from source domains to help improve the learning procedure in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a sparse subspace correlation analysis-based supervised classification (SSCA-SC) method for transfer learning in hyperspectral remote sensing image classification, which is not restricted by the data dimensionality or the data acquisition sensors. Specifically, we first propose a sparse subspace correlation analysis (SSCA) method to simultaneously learn the optimal projection matrices for heterogeneous domains into a common subspace and obtain sparse reconstruction coefficients over a shared self-expressive dictionary in the derived subspace. In order to fully utilize the label information to improve the class separability, the SSCA-SC framework learns more discriminative representations for the input data by training a corresponding SSCA model for each class. As a result, the projected data belonging to the same class are maximally correlated and represented well, while those from different classes will have a low correlation. Another advantage of the SSCA-SC framework lies in the fact that it not only learns new representations for the data from different domains but it also designs a discriminative and robust classifier that properly adapts to the new representation. The proposed method was tested with three hyperspectral remote sensing data sets, and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed SSCA-SC method.

TI  - Collaborative inversion heavy metal stress in rice by using two-dimensional spectral feature space based on HJ-1 A HSI and radarsat-2 SAR remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and extensive monitoring of heavy metal pollution levels in rice fields is crucial to agricultural production and food safety. Most previous studies used optical remote sensing data to monitor heavy metal stress in rice in which way the remote sensing features are not diversified and the monitoring accuracy is relatively low. Compared with that optical remote sensing can monitor features like color and cell internal structure, microwave remote sensing can monitor the morphology and geometrical features. The complementary characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data are reflected in two aspects. On the one hand, the high spectral resolution characteristics of hj-1a HIS and the high spatial resolution characteristics of radarsat-2 SAR satellite are used for feature fusion to obtain the image data of high altitude spectral resolution; on the other hand, the two remote sensing data can depict the vegetation characteristics from different angles. In order to fully extract the characteristics of crop stress, the model was constructed by utilizing the complementary characteristics of multi source remote sensing data. This paper synergized optical and microwave remote sensing to construct the crop heavy metal stress monitoring model. To this end, certain rice-growing areas polluted by heavy metal in Suzhou city were selected as the experimental areas, where ASD spectrum data, biochemical parameters and heavy metal content data of rice were collected during critical growth periods on one hand, HJ-1 A HIS and Radarsat-2 SAR satellite data were obtained almost simultaneously on the other hand. Based on heavy metal stress-responsive mechanism of rice, NVI (R598, R508) and SVI(HV,VH,HH,VV), spectral indexes sensitive to heavy metal stress, were extracted from the optical and radar data respectively to construct a two-dimensional feature space, based on which an optical-and-radar-remote-sensing-combined model for monitoring heavy metal stress in rice was constructed. In this paper, the study and main conclusions are as follows:(1) It used spectral characteristics analysis combined with statistic methods or random forest algorithm to build the canopy chlorophyll index NVI, which is sensitive to chlorophyll content changes of rice under heavy metal stress, and a heavy metal stress level inversion model was built based on hyperspectral HSI data accordingly. Also, it used statistic method to build the microwave index SVI, which is sensitive to biomass changes of rice under heavy metal stress, and a heavy metal stress level inversion model was built based on microwave SAR images as a result. (2) A combination of biochemical and morphological parameters, both responding to heavy metal stress, was synergized with NVI and SVI, sensitive to chlorophyll and biomass changes respectively, to build a two-dimensional feature space. Heavy metal stress levels were classified in this space. Thus, a synergetic model to retrieve heavy metal stress based on multi-source remote sensing data was developed. In this paper, the innovation lies in a model constructed by synergizing optical and radar remote sensing data to monitor heavy metal stress in rice based on a multi-dimensional spectral feature space and this model can be applied to monitoring multiple environmental stresses in crops.

TI  - Urban flood mapping with an active self-learning convolutional neural network based on TerraSAR-X intensity and interferometric coherence
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing has been widely used for flood mapping and monitoring. Nevertheless, flood detection in urban areas still proves to be particularly challenging by using SAR. In this paper, we assess the roles of SAR intensity and interferometric coherence in urban flood detection using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data. We further introduce an active self-learning convolution neural network (A-SL CNN) framework to alleviate the effect of a limited annotated training dataset. The proposed framework selects informative unlabeled samples based on a temporal-ensembling CNN model. These samples are subsequently pseudo-labeled by a multi-scale spatial filter. Consistency regularization is introduced to penalize incorrect labels caused by pseudo-labeling. We show results for a case study that is centered on flooded areas in Houston, USA, during hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Our experiments show that multi-temporal intensity (pre- and coevent) plays the most important role in urban flood detection. Adding multi-temporal coherence can increase the reliability of the inundation map considerably. Meanwhile, encouraging results are achieved by the proposed A-SL CNN framework: the kappa statistic is improved from 0.614 to 0.686 in comparison to its supervised counterpart.

TI  - Investigation of Sentinel-2 Bidirectional Reflectance Hot-Spot Sensing Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Directional reflectance effects, often described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), occur in Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument reflectance. The bidirectional hot-spot is a special case of the BRDF used to describe the increased backscatter reflectance that occurs over most surfaces when the solar and viewing directions coincide. A global year of Sentinel-2A metadata extracted using the Committee on Earth Observation Satellite Visualization Environment (COVE) tool and an established astronomical model were used to quantify the range of solar geometry and scattering angles expected in Sentinel-2A data. The established astronomical model was adapted to be Sentinel-2A specific and was parameterized as a function of the sensor acquisition date and nadir latitude. Solar zenith angles varied from 15.335 degrees to 91.454 degrees, and the scattering angles varied from 84.714 degrees to 173.967 degrees. To confirm the global COVE results, the scattering angles of a sample of Sentinel-2A data were examined and differed by less than 0.17 degrees with respect to the COVE data. Given that hot-spots are only apparent when the scattering angle is close to 180 degrees, we conclude that hot-spot will not occur in Sentinel-2A data. Equations and software to predict the scattering angle at the Sentinel-2A swath edge as a function of acquisition date and nadir latitude are provided so users may obtain data over a range of scattering angles in support of their BRDF studies.

TI  - Sentinel Node Navigation in Gastric Cancer: Where Do We Stand?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundEarly gastric cancer (EGC) is more common nowadays and is related a to low percentage of lymph node metastasis. For this reason, there is enormous interest to implicate minimally invasive approaches. Recently, special efforts have been made towards a potential intraoperative (real-time) lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment, as nodal disease status could not be identified with precision before or during surgery. In this direction, accurate prediction of the LNM status through sentinel LN mapping has been attempted, as an approach to the intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). A careful literature search was conducted in order to clarify the potential clinical application of SN biopsy in the gastric cancer field.ConclusionThe real clinical application of SN biopsy in gastric cancer treatment has been more than challenging due to the complicated nature of gastric lymphatic drainage and the high possibility of skip metastasis phenomenon. Notably, sophisticated technical aspects, such as the preferred tracer used and the potential ideal method to verify the presence of metastases in the resected SLNs, made SN biopsy application in gastric cancer field extremely demanding. Assessing the potential role of SN navigation for gastric cancer treatment in the era of advanced technology, where the minimally invasive surgical approaches are in the top of the scientific interest, it has to be highlighted that SN navigation for gastric cancer is a topic that remains highly controversial, and the need for future clinical trials on this topic is obvious.

TI  - Variables Selection for Aboveground Biomass Estimations Using Satellite Data: A Comparison between Relative Importance Approach and Stepwise Akaike's Information Criterion
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is still a major challenge to select appropriate variables from remote sensing sensors, which implicates finding reliable selection methods that can maximize the performance of chosen variables in regression models. In this study, we compare the performance of stepwise variable selection based on Akaike information criterion and an approach that integrates relative importance techniques and the decomposition criteria of R-2 using two different remote sensing data: SPOT-5 and RapidEye images, with the purpose of selecting suitable variables in multiple linear regression models to estimate aboveground biomass. The obtained accuracy of the regression models was evaluated by triple cross-validation. We carried out this study in a mixed pine-oak forest of central Mexico where intensive wood extraction occurs and therefore different levels of degradation are found. We estimated aboveground biomass from field inventory data at the plot level (n = 52) and used well-established allometric equations. The results showed that a better fit was obtained with the explanatory variables selected from the RapidEye image (R-2 = 0.437 with stepwise variable selection based on the Akaike information criterion approach and R-2 = 0.420 with relative importance techniques) and the approach that integrates the relative importance can generate better regression models to estimate forest biomass with a reduced number of variables and less error in the estimates.

TI  - Developing a two-step algorithm to estimate the leaf area index of forests with complex structures based on CHRIS/PROBA data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is a key factor affecting soil erosion, which depends not only on the horizontal structure of vegetation, but also on its vertical structure. The leaf area index (LAI) of plants, as an important structural parameter of the terrestrial ecosystem, can reflect horizontal vegetation coverage, vertical structure of vegetation, litter thickness and underground biomass. All these are the principal aspects of vegetation affecting soil erosion. The multi-angle remote sensing data can provide the stereoscopic and directional information of the surface target, which is helpful to extract the vertical structure parameters of vegetation effectively. Therefore, in order to improve the estimation accuracy of soil erosion, a two-step method was developed in this study to estimate the forest LAI under different vertical structures using the PROSAIL model and multi-angle CHRIS/PROBA data based on the field data. A total of 70 quadrats (10 m x 10 m sized) were deployed in Mount Zijin with undisturbed natural vegetation, considering the vegetation types and accessibility in the middle of August 2017. The pixels were first classified into two categories depending on complexity of vertical structure; then, a specific algorithm was applied to the different classes. For Class 1, the single angle data of 55 degrees had the highest accuracy, indicating that, for forests with a simple vertical structure, the single angle data was sufficient for LAI estimation. For Class 2, the multi-angle data combination of 0 degrees, 55 degrees and -55 degrees had the highest accuracy, indicating that, for forests with complex vertical structure, the multi-angle data can improve the accuracy of LAI estimation. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the LAI estimation algorithm. The results indicated that the two-step method can significantly improve the LAI estimation accuracy of forests with complex vertical structure, with a decrease in MAPE and RMSE of 19.52% and 23.08%, respectively, compared to the traditional empirical algorithm. The developed LAI estimation algorithm can be widely applied to forests with different vertical structures. Lastly, the two-step method was applied to the CHRIS/PROBA image acquired on September 7th, 2015 for mapping the spatial distribution of forest LAI in the western part of Mount Zijin. The result showed that the northern part and the southern part had higher LAI than the middle part of Mount Zijin.

TI  - Identifying hotspots and representative monitoring area of groundwater changes with time stability analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a most accessible freshwater resource for human beings, and it is increasingly important as an alternative to surface water under the threat of climate change. However, its complex spatio-temporal dynamic remains unattended from management perspective. Past studies on groundwater management were stalled by a relative dearth of high-quality data and a lack of synthetic analysis on both spatial and temporal information. Thanks to NASA's launch of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, our study has solved these two problems by innovatively applying time stability analysis to GRACE-based groundwater data. Taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as an example, we employed GRACE satellite data to obtain monthly changes of groundwater tables from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2016 in 1.0-degree grid of spatial resolution. Then we identified hotspots (which indicated severe groundwater declines and fluctuations over time) and representative monitoring areas (which stably represented the spatial average over time) using time stability analysis. Time stability employs multiple coefficients to identify the spatial relations between local variables and global variables overtime, thus showing the overall effect of spatial-wise and temporal-wise factors but never used in groundwater studies before. Based on this innovative method, we further identified management categories across the YRB using multivariate cluster analysis. As a result, the YRB has been divided into five zones for different management strategies. We identified the hotspots in west-most and east-most areas of the YRB, where we suggest a strengthened groundwater protections and risk response system. The northern part of the middle reach in the YRB was also identified as the representative monitoring areas. With these knowledge, decision-makers can have a clearer regional plan for groundwater protection, monitoring, and risk response system. This new method enables a quick decision on the prioritized areas for different groundwater management strategies while not losing the scope of spatio-temporal heterogeneity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Using Vegetation Indices Based on Red-Edge Reflectance from Sentinel-2 to Estimate Gross Primary Productivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the most important component of terrestrial carbon flux. Red-edge (680-780 nm) reflectance is sensitive to leaf chlorophyll content, which is directly correlated with photosynthesis as the pigment pool, and it has the potential to improve GPP estimation. The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2A and B satellites provide red-edge bands at 20-m spatial resolution on a five-day revisit period, which can be used for global estimation of GPP. Previous studies focused mostly on improving cropland GPP estimation using red-edge bands. In this study, we firstly evaluated the relationship between eight vegetation indices (VIs) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery in association with incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR(in)) and carbon flux tower GPP (GPP(EC)) across three forest and two grassland sites in Australia. We derived a time series of five red-edge VIs and three non-red-edge VIs over the CO2 flux tower footprints at 16-day time intervals and compared both temporal and spatial variations. The results showed that the relationship between the red-edge index (CIr, <mml:semantics><mml:mfrac>783705</mml:mfrac>-1</mml:semantics>) multiplied by PAR(in) and GPP(EC) had the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.81 gC.m(-2).day(-1)) at the two grassland sites. The CIr also showed consistency (rRMSE defined as RMSE/mean GPP, lower than 0.25) across forest and grassland sites. The high spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data provided more detailed information to adequately characterize the GPP variance at spatially heterogeneous areas. The high revisit period of Sentinel-2 exhibited temporal variance in GPP at the grassland sites; however, at forest sites, the flux-tower-based GPP variance could not be fully tracked by the limited satellite images. These results suggest that the high-spatial-resolution red-edge index from Sentinel-2 can improve large-scale spatio-temporal GPP assessments.

TI  - Exploring variations of ecosystem service value in Hangzhou Bay Wetland, Eastern China
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important natural resources, and studying wetland ecosystem values is helpful to explore the sustainable development of resources and economy. Hangzhou Bay is located in economically developed coastal area of China, where wetland values have been changed rapidly in the past few decades. Based on three sets of remote sensing data (1990, 2000 and 2010), this study has made an exploration on spatio-temporal changes of wetland area, and also made an assessment on wetland ecosystem values of eight types of service in Hangzhou Bay based on related theories of ecological economics. Results showed that the ecosystem service value of Hangzhou Bay Wetland in 1990, 2000 and 2010 were 48.7 x 10(8) yuan, 41.6 x 10(8) yuan and 45.3 x 10(8) yuan, respectively. If divided by wetland types, rivers and lakes were two types of wetlands that have the greatest proportion of service value, followed by paddy field and shallow waters. In the perspective of service types, water conservation and material production accounted for over 70% of the total service value. In addition, the recreation value has been increased significantly in recent years. This study, therefore, recommends developing coastal wetland tourism and coastal aquaculture based on controlling pollution emissions to protect natural wetlands.

TI  - Global ecosystem overfishing: Clear delineation within real limits to production
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.

TI  - A New Azimuth Ambiguity Suppression Algorithm for Surface Current Measurement in Coastal Waters and Rivers With Along-track InSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new algorithm for suppressing azimuth ambiguities when measuring surface currents with an along-track interferometric (ATI) synthetic aperture radar in heterogeneous scenes, such as coastal waters or rivers. The key of the proposed algorithm involves a careful analysis of a parameter called the eigenvalue spectrum entropy (EVSE), which is defined as the entropy of the eigenvalue spectrum of the ATI covariance matrix computed in the Doppler domain. The physical meaning of EVSE is that it serves as a descriptor for the degree to which an unambiguous signal component and an ambiguous one are mixed. With the help of EVSE, azimuth ambiguities can be suppressed. Simulation results demonstrate that as compared with the conventional ATI method without azimuth ambiguity suppression, the proposed algorithm allows for a pronounced improvement in the current measuring accuracy. Other advantages of the proposed algorithm lie in the fact that it is not only adaptive, due to its ability to automatically capture the useful Doppler band whose width and position may both vary for different radar and scene parameters, but it also needs a minimal number of user inputs, making it a quite attractive algorithm for routine implementation.

TI  - Automatic extraction of built-up area from ZY3 multi-view satellite imagery: Analysis of 45 global cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate delineation of global built-up area (BUA) is fundamental to a better understanding of human development and the impacts on global environmental change. Existing global datasets of human settlement were mostly generated at medium and coarse spatial resolutions, including BUA and other impervious surfaces. With multiple high-resolution satellite constellations now available (e.g., ZiYuan-3 (ZY3), SPOT-5/6/7, Cartosat-1/2, and WorldView-2/3), identifying the global BUA explicitly from the complex landscapes becomes possible. In this study, a novel method was proposed for automated extraction of BUA at the global scale, by fusing a series of building features. Specifically, two planar features, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) and Harris corner detector, were employed to characterize the structure and corner attributes of buildings. Moreover, two multiangular built-up indices (MABIs), i.e., Ratio Multi-angular Built-up Index (RMABI) and Normalized Difference Multi-angular Built-up Index (NDMABI), were proposed to represent the vertical properties of buildings based on multi-view images, which can further complement the planar features. 45 global cities were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method with images acquired by the ZY3 satellite constellation. The results show that the fusion of MBI and Harris corner can achieve satisfactory accuracy, i.e., 91.12%, 88.85%, 82.82% and 0.85, for the average overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-score, respectively, for all the test cities. After fusing the MABIs with the planar features, the average OA, UA, PA and F values of the final results were 92.00%, 86.20%, 89.14% and 0.87 for the RMABI, and 91.83%, 85.51%, 89.62% and 0.87 for the NDMABI, respectively. In particular, addition of the MABIs can further reduce the omission errors where medium/high rise buildings with low local contrast exist. We compared our results with two existing state-of-the-art global BUA products, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and Global Urban Footprint (GUF), which further corroborated the effectiveness of our method.

TI  - Human-induced eutrophication dominates the bio-optical compositions of suspended particles in shallow lakes: Implications for remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is generally divided into inorganic (SPIM) and organic (SPOM) parts; they come from different sources, and have different impacts on the optical properties and/or water quality of lake. However, in a specific remote sensing process, they are not retrieved separately. Using in-situ data of 59 lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLR-YR) in dry season (April) and wet season (August) in 2012, we first studied the absorption properties and sources of different SPM. On this basis, we proposed a workflow for simultaneously estimating SPIM and SPOM from satellite data. Our results are as follows: Bio-optical compositions of SPM in these eutrophic shallow lakes tempo-spatially varied greatly and were dominated by human-induced eutrophication. Phytoplankton contributed 18.42 +/- 18.92% of SPIM and 26.22 +/- 1924% of SPOM in April 2012, but 30.4 +/- 23.41% of SPIM and 47.03 +/- 18.1% of SPOM in August 2012. The trophic state index explained 42.84% of SPOM variation in April 2012, and 54.64% in August 2012. Moreover, there were strong linear relationships between SPIM concentration and non-algal particle absorption coefficient (Pearson's r = 0.73; p < 0.01) and between SPOM concentration and phytoplankton absorption coefficient (r = 0.76; p < 0.01). Based on these results, SPIM and SPOM concentrations in the lakes along the MLR-YR could be retrieved from OLCI/Sentinel-3A satellite data, respectively. This study has a great significance for real-time monitoring and managing aquatic environment in various eutrophic and/or shallow lakes as a group. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

AB  - Objective This study was conducted to investigate the viral and bacterial etiology and epidemiology of patients with acute febrile respiratory syndrome (AFRS) in Qinghai using a commercial routine multiplex-ligation-nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-based assay.Methods A total of 445 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients with AFRS were analyzed using the RespiFinderSmart22kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system.Results Among the 225 (225/445, 51%) positive specimens, 329 positive pathogens were detected, including 298 (90.58%) viruses and 31 (9%) bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza virus (IFV; 37.39%; 123/329), adenovirus (AdV; 17.02%; 56/329), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; 10.94%; 36/329), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 10.03%; 33/329), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs; 8.51%; 28/329), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneu; 8.51%; 28/329), respectively. Among the co-infected cases (17.53%; 78/445), IFV/AdV and IFV/M. pneu were the most common co-infections. Most of the respiratory viruses were detected in summer and fall.Conclusion In our study, IFV-A was the most common respiratory pathogen among 22 detected pathogens, followed by AdV, HCoV, RV/EV, PIV, and M. pneu. Bacteria appeared less frequently than viruses, and co-infection was the most common phenomenon among viral pathogens. Pathogens were distributed among different age groups and respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November. Enhanced surveillance and early detection can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AFRS, as well as for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.

AB  - The population genetic studies of marine fishes usually show complex patterns of genetic differentiation which were influenced by both historical process and contemporary gene flow. Genetic structure of eight different populations for eastern keelback mullet, Liza affinis, collected from the coast along eastern and southern China, was examined using six microsatellite loci. We found strong genetic similarities among most of the samples except the Dongguan population and most microsatellite variation was found within populations. All loci were characterized by high genetic variability with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.871 to 0.928. The Bayesian cluster analysis of the microsatellite data detected four genetic groups with no relation to geographic areas. The bottleneck results also showed no significant values. Based on these data we postulated that complex marine currents and larval dispersal shaped the genetic structured of studied populations. The present study illustrated the importance of understanding the biological significance of genetic differentiation when using molecular data in identifying units for management and protection.

TI  - Red Tide Detection Based on High Spatial Resolution Broad Band Satellite Data: A Case Study of GF-1
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional red tide remote sensing detection methods are based on ocean color satellite data with high spectral resolution (spectral band width < 20 nm), but low spatial resolution. Clearly, fine-scale remote-sensing monitoring of red tide requires high spatial resolution satellite data. Yet, satellite data with high spatial resolution often lack high spectral resolution, with spectral band width > 50 nm. Moreover, systematic research has yet to demonstrate effective detection of red tide using high spatial resolution, but low spectral resolution, satellite data. In this paper, high spatial resolution (16 m), but low spectral resolution, data from the satellite, GF-1, are analyzed to determine if effective fine-scale detection of red tide is possible. The spectral response characteristics of red tide in GF-1 data are analyzed using a 2014 red tide event that occurred in Guangdong Province, China. It was found that, despite broad spectral band widths, GF-1 WFV imaging spectrometer data still exhibits a clear tide detection algorithm for GF-1 WFV data based on this red tide spectral signal. The detection accuracy of red tide for this algorithm is better than 92 %, and the F1-Score value is better than 87 %. Spatial analysis of the Guangdong 2014 red-tide event based on this algorithm showed that the maximum red tide area extracted from GF-1 satellite data is 10 km(2), and that the red tide area decreases greatly during the extinction phase. A comparative analysis of MODIS satellite data indicates that, despite the availability of multiple ocean color bands, no ocean color anomaly is detected because of coarse spatial resolution. The developed method was also successfully used to detect red tide occurred in Rizhao, Shandong Province.

TI  - Quality of warfarin management in primary care Determining the stability of international normalized ratios using a nationally representative prospective cohort
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the stability of warfarin anticoagulation using a nationally representative sample of Canadian primary care patients and providers.Design Prospective cohort study.Setting Primary care practices associated with the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network.Participants Adult warfarin users with 7 or more evaluable international normalized ratio (INR) readings.Main outcomes measures International normalized ratio time in therapeutic range (TTR) determined using the Rosendaal method; TTR above 75% was considered good INR control and TTR below 60% was considered poor INR control. The primary outcome was the proportion of all warfarin users (using an INR target range of 2.0 to 3.5) with good INR control during their first year taking warfarin who have poor INR control the following year. Secondary outcomes included the TTR using an INR target of 2.0 to 3.0 when restricted to patients with known atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE); and the proportion of INR values below the target of 2.0 and above the targets of 3.0 and 3.5 in the year before the availability of other oral anticoagulants.Results Among 18 303 adult warfarin users (mean age of 71.0 years, 46.6% female), the median TTR (INR target range of 2.0 to 3.5) was 77.4% (interquartile range of 64.6% to 86.4%). The TTR was above 75% in 56.0% of patients and below 60% in 19.3% of patients. Of those exhibiting good INR control in year 1 of anticoagulation therapy, only 10.2% had poor control the following year. When restricted to patients with known AF or VTE (89.7% with AF and 13.5% with VTE), and assuming an INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0, the TTR was 67.8% (interquartile range of 54.8% to 77.9%). Of these patients, 27.9% had INR values below 2.0, and 19.4% and 8.6% had values above 3.0 and 3.5, respectively.Conclusion Primary care warfarin management produces a TTR comparable to that in randomized trials, with out-of-range INR values 3 times more likely to predispose to thrombosis (INR of <2.0) than to hemorrhage (INR of >3.5). A history of good INR control does predict future INR stability and meaningfully informs decisions to switch established warfarin users onto newer agents.

TI  - An Improved Spatiotemporal Fusion Approach Based on Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution remotely sensed data is of great significance for the extraction of land use/cover information and the quantitative inversion of biophysical parameters. However, due to the limitation of sensor performance and the influence of rain cloud weather, it is difficult to obtain remote sensing images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatiotemporal fusion model is a crucial method to solve this problem. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectivity fusion model (STARFM) and its improved models are the most widely used spatiotemporal adaptive fusion models. However, the existing spatiotemporal adaptive reflectivity fusion model and its improved models have great uncertainty in selecting neighboring similar pixels, especially in spatially heterogeneous areas. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively search and determine neighboring spectrally similar pixels in STARFM-like models, resulting in a decrease of imagery fusion accuracy. In this research, we modify the procedure of neighboring similar pixel selection of ESTARFM method and propose an improved ESTARFM method (I-ESTARFM). Based on the land cover endmember types and its fraction values obtained by spectral mixing analysis, the neighboring similar pixels can be effectively selected. The experimental results indicate that the I-ESTARFM method selects neighboring spectrally similar pixels more accurately than STARFM and ESTARFM models. Compared with the STARFM and ESTARFM, the correlation coefficients of the image fused by the I-ESTARFM with that of the actual image are increased and the mean square error is decreased, especially in spatially heterogeneous areas. The uncertainty of spectral similar neighborhood pixel selection is reduced and the precision of spatial-temporal fusion is improved.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes are vital to the food security challenge. Food security has determined the history of humanity. The global population will increase to about 9 billion in 2050-2060. Food and feed demands have been projected to double in the 21st century, which will further increase the pressure on the use of land, water, and nutrients. The study of the relationship between food security and land use is of paramount importance for policy formulation. During the past one decade, the study area has undergone many LULC changes due to rapid urban growth, poorly planned infrastructural development and expansion of horticulture which adversely affected the food security. For LULC change detection analysis temporal Landsat satellite data sets captured by thematic mapper were employed. Maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm was applied to classify the study area, whereas, post classification comparison approach was adopted to analyze the LULC changes. The results have revealed that the area under horticulture and forests has declined by 3.7 and 2.26% respectively while the area under horticulture and built-up has increased by 2.17 and 1.13% respectively.

TI  - Estimating Real-Time Water Area of Dongting Lake Using Water Level Information
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China, is an important water source for the Yangtze River Basin. The water area of Dongting Lake fluctuates significantly daily, which may cause flooding and other relevant disasters. Although remote sensing techniques may provide lake area estimates with reasonable accuracy, they are not available in real-time and may be susceptible to weather conditions. To address this issue, this paper attempted to examine the relationship between lake area and the water levels at the hydrological stations. Multi-temporal water area data were derived through analyzing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using the Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI). Then we analyzed the inter- and intra-annual variations in the water area of the Dongting Lake. Corresponding water level information at hydrological stations of the Dongting Lake were obtained. Simple linear regression (SLR) models and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models were constructed using water levels and water level differences from the upstream and downstream hydrological stations. We used the data from 2004 to 2012 and 2012, respectively, to build the model, and applied the data from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the models. Results suggest that the maximum water area of the Dongting Lake during 2000-2015 has a clear decreasing trend. The variations in the water area were characterized by hydrological seasons, with the annual minimum and maximum water areas occurring in January and September, respectively. The water level at the Chengjingji station, and water level differences between upstream stations and the Chengjingji station, play a major role in estimating the water area. Further, results also show that the SMLR established in 2012 performs the best in estimating water area of the Dongting Lake, especially with high water levels.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Sea Ice Lead Detection Based on SAR Imagery and Altimeter Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of sea ice leads is a prerequisite for the estimation of ice freeboard and thickness from altimeter data. The classification of altimeter waveforms is generally performed using statistical parameters on the echo power or machine learning approaches directly on the waveforms. The validation and optimization of such algorithms can be carried out using a set of reference cases provided by Earth Observation images. In this paper, we first developed a new lead detector based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A robust and consistent methodology for the joint assessment of Altimeter and SAR leads detector is then provided. We propose to fully account for the 2-D geometric problem when comparing the 1-D altimeter track and 2-D SAR image. The surface of the lead intersecting the altimeter footprint and its distance to nadir are considered here. Based on collocated Sentinel-3 (S-3) altimeter data and S-1 images, the performance of our S-3 lead detector is fully assessed. A new parameterization is found resulting in a better tradeoff between good detection and false alarm rate. A similar analysis is performed using AltiKa altimeter data, showing enhanced performance for S-3 altimeter data acquired in Delay-Doppler mode with reduced off-nadir returns.

TI  - Varicella Outbreak Surveillance in Schools in Sentinel Jurisdictions, 2012-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In 2007, a routine second dose of varicella vaccine was recommended in the United States for children aged 4 to 6 years to better control varicella-zoster virus circulation and outbreaks. Sentinel varicella outbreak surveillance was established to assess feasibility of surveillance and describe outbreaks that are occurring.Methods. Through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemiology Laboratory Capacity funding, health departments conducted active surveillance for varicella outbreaks in schools from 2012 to 2015. Outbreaks of varicella were defined as >= 5 cases in a school within at least 1 incubation period (21 days). School nurses, healthcare providers, or laboratories reported cases and outbreaks of varicella to health departments; demographic, vaccination, and clinical data were collected.Results. Georgia, Houston, Maine, Minnesota, New York City, and Philadelphia participated in all 3 years; Puerto Rico and West Virginia participated in 2012 to 2013; and Kansas and Arkansas participated in 2014 to 2015. Twenty-nine outbreaks including 262 cases were reported. The median size of the outbreaks was 7 cases (range, 5-31 cases), and the median duration was 31 days (range, 4-100 days). Of the case-patients associated with larger outbreaks (>= 8 cases), 55.4% were unvaccinated, and 15.7% and 18.1% had received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine, respectively. In small outbreaks (5-7 cases), 33.3% of case-patients were unvaccinated, and 16.7% and 38.5% had received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine, respectively.Conclusions. The majority of cases associated with outbreaks occurred in undervaccinated children (unvaccinated and 1-dose vaccine recipients). Outbreaks with a greater proportion of 2-dose vaccine recipients were smaller. Varicella outbreak surveillance is feasible, and continued monitoring of outbreaks remains important for describing the epidemiology of varicella during the 2-dose varicella vaccination program.

TI  - Biases and Abrupt Shifts of Monthly Precipitable Water from Terra MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly atmospheric precipitable water (PW) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite was assessed over land at 60 degrees S-60 degrees N. MODIS provides two PW products by using infrared (IR) and near-IR (NIR) algorithms, respectively. An assessment was performed for both MODIS PW data from 2000 to 2014, comparing them with the measurements at international stations of the global positioning systems and with a reanalysis to detect abrupt changes through monthly variations. It is noted that MODIS IR systematically underestimated PW in over 75% of stations, and that PW estimation declines with time. MODIS NIR significantly overestimated PW for tropical land and experienced two abrupt shifts. These data defects result in large spurious decreasing trends in MODIS IR and increasing trends in MODIS NIR. The two MODIS PW products are currently not suitable for a climatic-trend analysis, highlighting the need for data reprocessing and calibration.

TI  - Investigating Smoke Aerosol Emission Coefficients Using MODIS Active Fire and Aerosol Products: A Case Study in the CONUS and Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke aerosols released from biomass burning greatly influence air quality, weather, and climate. The total particulate matter (TPM) of smoke aerosols has been demonstrated to be a linear function of fire radiative energy (FRE) during a period of biomass burning via a smoke aerosol emission coefficient (C-e). However, it remains challenging to quantify C-e appropriately through satellite observations. In this study, an innovative approach was put forward to explore C-e by establishing the relationships between FRE and TPM in two regions, the CONtiguous United States and Indonesia. Specifically, we identified 584 isolated fire clusters and smoke plumes in the CONtiguous United States and 248 in Indonesia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer natural color images, and then calculated FRE from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire product and TPM from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth product for each fire-smoke matchup during Terra and Aqua overpasses. The relationships between TPM and FRE were constructed to determine C-e using an ordinary least squares regression. The results show that FRE and TPM are significantly correlated (r(2) >= 0.63, p < 0.001) with the C-e varying across regions and fuel types. In the CONtiguous United States, forest C-e values are 21.3 and 34.1 g/MJ and savanna C-e values are 18.2 and 22.8 g/MJ for western and eastern regions, respectively; additionally, C-e is 20.9 g/MJ for grasslands and 5.0 g/MJ for shrublands. In Indonesia, C-e is 52.4 and 30.0 g/MJ for peatlands and forests, respectively. Overall, this study improves our understanding of C-e variations with fuel types and climate regions.Plain Language Summary Hundreds to thousands of fire events happen yearly in both the temperate climate of the CONtiguous United States and tropical Indonesia. These fires are major sources of air pollution, greenhouse gases, and aerosols, which greatly affect regional climate, weather, air quality, and human health. It is therefore important to estimate the amounts of particulate emissions released during these fires. We propose here a simple but robust method for accurately estimating fire particulate emissions from satellite observations that enables assessing variations by climatic region and land cover type. By analyzing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based active fire and aerosol products, we found that, for a given fire size, (1) forest fire particulate emission levels are larger than those from grasslands, savannas, and shrublands in the CONtiguous United States; (2) particulate emissions from peatland fires are substantially greater than those from forest fires in Indonesia; and (3) forest fire particulate emissions are greater in Indonesia than the CONtiguous United States as a whole. The results from this study improve our understanding of fire emissions by climatic region and land cover type that can better explain regional impacts on environmental conditions and human health.

TI  - Cropland yield divergence over Africa and its implication for mitigating food insecurity
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite globalization and the scale of international food trade, access to sufficient food remains a major challenge in Africa. The most effective way to mitigate food insecurity is to increase crop production. To answer the question that whether African countries have the capacity to mitigate food shortages by best cultivating practices observed on current cropland, in this study, we use the local net primary productivity scaling (LNS) method to evaluate the currently attainable potential yield-gap (CAYgap). The CAYgap is initially used to suggest steps towards best regional agricultural practices and provide an indicator of regional divergence of cropland productivity in each homogeneous agro-climatic zone. Results indicate that under current climatic conditions, improving each countries' productivity to the zonal optimal level, around similar to 90% of all African countries have the capacity to mitigate their current energy shortages independently. Thus, to achieve ending hunger, possible efforts are needed which include (1) clarifying what and how socio-economic and institutional factors cause yield divergence across agro-climatic zones and establishing relevant practical policies; (2) strengthening the resilience of food access to make national food availability favors households and individuals; and (3) establishing systematically monitoring platforms on dynamics of crop yields from pixel to regional and from growth phrase to decadal scales. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying satellite-derived indicators for the maximum yield achieved method to quantify and map the current cropland yield divergence by LNS method, and this method could be applied on different spatial level from regional to global scale with reasonable homogeneous zone scheme.

TI  - Efficient Starspot Reconstruction via Light-curve Inversion with Bipartite Regularization
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-curve inversion (LI) is a powerful imaging technique and widely used in stellar surface imaging and starspot reconstruction. It can be used to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a light curve of a star via the conversion from temporal resolution to spatial resolution. However, as an ill-posed problem, accurate resulting spot-to-photosphere brightness ratio (SBR) is hard to achieve because of the limitation of the single regularization of the traditional LI method. To address the existing problems, we propose a new method, namely LI with bipartite regularization (LIBR), to extend the capability of LI. This new method employs adaptive SBR adjustment in each iteration of the fitting process to obtain accurate intensity distribution. As shown in the simulations, the SBR produced by the LIBR method indicates that the model can mimic the actual stellar surface as closely as possible. Therefore, it becomes possible to be used for analyzing starspots from massive high-quality observed data derived from the Kepler Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

TI  - FluHMM: A simple and flexible Bayesian algorithm for sentinel influenza surveillance and outbreak detection
T2  - STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely detection of the seasonal influenza epidemic is important for public health action. We introduce FluHMM, a simple but flexible Bayesian algorithm to detect and monitor the seasonal epidemic on sentinel surveillance data. No comparable historical data are required for its use. FluHMM segments a typical influenza surveillance season into five distinct phases with clear interpretation (pre-epidemic, epidemic growth, epidemic plateau, epidemic decline and post-epidemic) and provides the posterior probability of being at each phase for every week in the period under surveillance, given the available data. An alert can be raised when the probability that the epidemic has started exceeds a given threshold. An accompanying R package facilitates the application of this method in public health practice. We apply FluHMM on 12 seasons of sentinel surveillance data from Greece, and show that it achieves very good sensitivity, timeliness and perfect specificity, thereby demonstrating its usefulness. We further discuss advantages and limitations of the method, providing suggestions on how to apply it and highlighting potential future extensions such as with integrating multiple surveillance data streams.

TI  - Virus survival and fitness when multiple genotypes and subtypes of influenza A viruses exist and circulate in swine
T2  - VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed swine influenza virus (SIV) surveillance in Midwest USA and isolated 100 SIVs including endemic and reassortant H1 and H3 viruses with 2009 pandemic H1N1 genes. To determine virus evolution when different genotypes and subtypes of influenza A viruses circulating in the same swine herd, a virus survival experiment was conducted in pigs mimicking field situations. Five different SIVs were used to infect five pigs individually, then two groups of sentinel pigs were introduced to investigate virus transmission. Results showed that each virus replicated efficiently in lungs of each infected pig, but only reassortant H3N2 and H1N2v viruses transmitted to the primary contact pigs. Interestingly, the parental H1N2v was the majority of virus detected in the second group of sentinel pigs. These data indicate that the H1N2v seems to be more viable in swine herds than other SIV genotypes, and reassortment can enhance viral fitness and transmission.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Agro BigData and Decision Support Systems in Agriculture
CL  - Montevideo, URUGUAY
AB  - Spatial information on crop status and development is required by agricultural managers for a site specific and adapted management. Here, a prototype of a web application is presented for the visualization of biomass production of maize (Zea mays). The web application displays past biomass development and future predictions for user-defined regions of interest along with summary statistics. Biomass is modelled using the crop growth model (CGM) APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) using meteorological data from 2001 to 2014. Information on current crop status and subfield heterogeneity is assimilated into APSIM through high-resolution optical satellite imagery. The use of recent satellite data and regional, historical meteorological data increases the reliability of the biomass information provided. Through its unique combination of high-resolution satellite imagery together with mechanistic crop growth modelling, this web application can overcome the often sparse temporal or sparse spatial resolution of biomass information, which is based on remote sensing images or on crop growth modelling alone. The prototype presented, with its high resolution biomass maps, can be the basis for variable rate application as farmers can react site-specifically to plant development.

TI  - Actor-network theory and ethnography: Sociomaterial approaches to researching medical education
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical education is amessy tangle of social and material elements. These material entities include tools, like curriculum guides, stethoscopes, cell phones, accreditation standards, and mannequins; natural elements, like weather systems, disease vectors, and human bodies; and, objects, like checklists, internet connections, classrooms, lights, chairs and an endless array of others.We propose that sociomaterial approaches to ethnography can help us explore taken for granted, or under-theorized, elements of asituation under study, thereby enabling us to think differently. In this article, we describe ideas informing Actor-Network Theory approaches, and how these ideas translate into how ethnographic research is designed and conducted. We investigate epistemological (what we can know, and how) positioning of the researcher in an actor-network theory informed ethnography, and describe how we tailor ethnographic methodsdocument and artefact analysis; observation; and interviewsto align with asociomaterial worldview.Untangling sociomaterial scenarios can offer anovel perspective on myriad contemporary medical education issues. These issues include examining how novel tools (e.g. accreditation standards, assessment tools, mannequins, videoconferencing technologies) and spaces (e.g. simulation suites, videoconferenced lecture theatres) used in medical education impact how teaching and learning actually happen in these settings.

TI  - Review of depleting coastal resource areas in GODAVARI delta upon human interventions, Andhra Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The coastal environment is home to a wide range of landforms and landscapes. Coastal resources like beaches, mangroves, sand dunes, sand spit, mud flat and sandy area are common along the stretch of Godavari delta in Andhra Pradesh coast. This study aims to assess the changes in the coastal resources in Godavari delta to evaluate its present ecological status and to map various coastal natural resources in the delta region with the use of latest tools like Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System. Using IRS satellite data, the natural coastal resources were prepared for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015. Based on the richness of natural resources, the delta region was divided into four resource areas and the status of natural resources was analyzed within the identified resource areas. It is inferred that there was a 10% loss in the spatial extent of natural resources during 1990-2015. The study facilitates better scientific insight of areas that require effective conservation and management plans to improve and protect natural resources so as to sustain the delta region of Godavari from further depletion.

TI  - The Appropriate Role of a Clinical Ethics Consultant's Religious Worldview in Consultative Work: Nearly None
T2  - HEC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethical reasoning is an integral part of the work of a clinical ethics consultant (CEC). Ethical reasoning has a close relationship with an individual's beliefs and values, which, for religious adherents, are likely to be tightly connected with their spiritual perspectives. As a result, for individuals who identify with a religious tradition, the process of thinking through ethical questions is likely to be influenced by their religious worldview. The connection between ethical reasoning and one's spiritual perspective raises questions about the role that CECs' personal religious worldviews should play in their professional lives and their consultative work. This paper offers numerous arguments critiquing the inclusion of a consultant's own spiritual perspective in her work and has identified only limited circumstances under which such inclusion might be permissible. In particular, these arguments lead to the conclusion that a CEC's personal beliefs should never influence her ethical analysis or development of a recommendation. Further, religious appeals should not be used in communication during decision-making conversations other than to describe the patient or surrogate's stated perspective. There may be limited cases in which a CEC may share her spiritual worldview with a patient with the intent of building a collaborative relationship, but such situations should be approached with extreme caution.

TI  - Multimorbidity, eHealth and implications for equity: a cross-sectional survey of patient perspectives on eHealth
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective There is increasing awareness of the burden of medical care experienced by those with multimorbidity. There is also increasing interest and activity in engaging patients with chronic disease in technology-based healthrelated activities ('eHealth') in family practice. Little is known about patients' access to, and interest in eHealth, in particular those with a higher burden of care associated with multimorbidity. We examined access and attitudes towards eHealth among patients attending family medicine clinics with a focus on older adults and those with polypharmacy as a marker for multimorbidity.Design Cross-sectional survey of consecutive adult patients attending consultations with family physicians in the McMaster University Sentinel and Information Collaboration practice-based research network. We used univariate and multivariate analyses for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for free text responses.Setting Primary care clinics.Participants 693 patients participated (response rate 70%). Inclusion criteria: Attending primary care clinic. Exclusions: Too ill to complete survey, cannot speak English.Results The majority of participants reported access to the internet at home, although this decreased with age. Participants 70 years and older were less comfortable using the internet compared with participants under 70. Univariate analyses showed age, multimorbidity, home internet access, comfort using the internet, privacy concerns and self-rated health all predicted significantly less interest in eHealth. In the multivariate analysis, home internet access and multimorbidity were significant predictors of disinterest in eHealth. Privacy and loss of relational connection were themes in the qualitative analysis.Conclusion There is a significant negative association between multimorbidity and interest in eHealth. This is independent of age, computer use and comfort with using the internet. These findings have important implications, particularly the potential to further increase health inequity.

TI  - Deformations and Morphology Changes Associated with the 2016-2017 Eruption Sequence at Bezymianny Volcano, Kamchatka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava domes grow by extrusions and intrusions of viscous magma often initiating from a central volcanic vent, and they are frequently defining the source region of hazardous explosive eruptions and pyroclastic density currents. Thus, close monitoring of dome building processes is crucial, but often limited to low data resolution, hazardous access, and poor visibility. Here, we investigated the 2016-2017 eruptive sequence of the dome building Bezymianny volcano, Kamchatka, with spot-mode TerraSAR-X acquisitions, and complement the analysis with webcam imagery and seismic data. Our results reveal clear morphometric changes preceding eruptions that are associated with intrusions and extrusions. Pixel offset measurements show >7 months of precursory plug extrusion, being locally defined and exceeding 30 m of deformation, chiefly without detected seismicity. After a short explosion, three months of lava dome evolution were characterised by extrusions and intrusion. Our data suggest that the growth mechanisms were significantly governed by magma supply rate and shallow upper conduit solidification that deflected magmatic intrusions into the uppermost parts of the dome. The integrated approach contributes significantly to a better understanding of precursory activity and complex growth interactions at dome building volcanoes, and shows that intrusive and extrusive growth is acting in chorus at Bezymianny volcano.

TI  - Extending the forecast model: Predicting Western Lake Erie harmful algal blooms at multiple spatial scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Erie is a classic case of development, recovery from, and return to eutrophication, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms. Forecast models are used annually to predict bloom intensity for the whole Western lake Erie Basin, but do not necessarily reflect nearshore conditions or regional variations, which are important for local stakeholders. In this study we: 1) developed relationships between observed whole basin and nearshore bloom sizes, and 2) updated and extended a Bayesian seasonal bloom forecast model to provide new regional predictions. The western basin was subdivided into 5 km near-shore regions, and bloom start date, size, and intensity were quantified with MODIS-derived images of chlorophyll concentrations for July-October 2002-2016 for each subdivision and for the entire basin. While bloom severity within each subdivision is temporally and spatially unique, it increased over the study period in each subdivision. The models for the 5 km subdivisions explained between 83 and 95% of variability between regional sizes and whole bloom size for US subdivisions and 51% for the Canadian subdivision. By linking predictive basin-wide models to regional regression estimates, we are now able to better predict potential bloom impacts at scales and in specific areas that are vital to the economic well-being of the region and allow for better management responses.

TI  - Effect of coriander <i>Coriandrum sativum</i> L. on parasitization behaviour of <i>Trichogramma chilonis</i> Ishii (Trichogrammatidae: Hymenoptera) in brinjal ecosystem
T2  - Entomon
M3  - Article
AB  - For the management of the brin-jal shoot and fruit borer augmentatory biocontrol using Trichogramma chilonis Ishii egg parasitoid is a viable option. Experiments conducted in the net house (pro tray technique) and field to study the effect of coriander on the parasitization, revealed that under free choice test, maximum numbers of parasitized eggs were observed in brinjal grown with coriander at 1: 1 ratio (29.48 eggs/card). Under no-choice condition the mean number of parasitized eggs recorded was 20.88 eggs per card observed in brinjal. In the field experiment using sentinel egg card technique no statistical difference in parasitoid performance between the sole crop and intercropped plot was observed. In this studies (field experiments) clearly indicate that there is no significant effect of coriander on parasitisation of T. chilonis, though the results were promising in the green house. The probable reason for this may be due to influence of climate factors like wind direction, temperature and RH. (C) 2019 Association for Advancement of Entomology

TI  - Research and Verification of a Remote Sensing BIF Model Based on Spectral Reflectance Characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Banded iron formations (BIFs) represent the most important and widely distributed iron ore resources in the world. Monitoring BIF resources is of great significance for tracking reserves and for the orderly exploitation of resources. Previous remote sensing (RS) recognition methods for ground objects in mining areas have been developed based on satellite sensor data, but those methods do not incorporate the spectral characteristics of ground objects. Consequently, these modeling methods are relatively blind because they do not consider the real spectra of ground objects in advance, affecting the accuracy of RS recognition to a certain degree. In the present study, the visible to near-infrared spectra of two types of typical iron ore (magnetite and hematite) and of the surrounding rocks in a BIF deposit were first recorded by a field-portable spectrometer in a mining area. Then, the differences in the spectral characteristics among the two types of iron ore and surrounding rocks were analyzed. Based on the different spectral characteristics in different wavelength ranges, RS extraction and classification models for iron ore were constructed and applied to Landsat 8 data for the actual recognition of iron ore in an open pit. This study yielded the following results. There were remarkable differences in the spectral characteristics among the two types of iron ore and surrounding rocks. In addition to distinguishing the iron ore from the surrounding rocks, magnetite and hematite were further differentiated based on the constructed inversion model. The accuracies of distinguishing iron ore from the surrounding rocks, identifying hematite, and identifying magnetite were 83.5%, 83.3%, and 85%, respectively. The results demonstrated that iron ore zones can be identified automatically by the RS model based on the measured spectral characteristics and the inversion model. Accordingly, this model can increase the identification accuracy and provide a new method for BIF deposit detection and exploitation monitoring.

TI  - Changes in vegetation seasonality and livestock stocking rate in La Pampa Province (Argentina)
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production is traversing expansion and intensification processes all over the planet and in consequence the large scale cattle production is being displaced to marginal lands with lower stocking capacity. The objective of this work was to assess the seasonality of vegetation in La Pampa province located in a semiarid region in Argentina and to explore if the variations in seasonality are related to the stocking rate. The hypothesis is the changes in stocking rate of rangelands and its grazing pressure alter the proportion of different vegetation functional groups and so the vegetation seasonality. It is predicted that overgrazing of seasonal grasses will alter the proportion of woody species having consequences over spectral indices. It was analyzed satellite data, particularly the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and related it to stocking rate records from SENASA. This work evidences the relationship between the stocking rate and the spectral index EVI, indicator of the primary productivity of vegetation, at departmental scale in the natural areas of Monte and Espinal of La Pampa. Results indicate that in western region (Monte) there was an increment in the stocking rate at department level and a decrease in vegetation seasonality. It is posed that the higher grazing pressure led to the overgrazing of the most palatable herbaceous species, increasing the shrub proportion in landscape.

TI  - Assessing Water Availability in Mediterranean Regions Affected by Water Conflicts through MODIS Data Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is a widespread problem in arid and semi-arid regions such as the western Mediterranean coastal areas. The irregularity of the precipitation generates frequent droughts that exacerbate the conflicts among agriculture, water supply and water demands for ecosystems maintenance. Besides, global climate models predict that climate change will cause Mediterranean arid and semi-arid regions to shift towards lower rainfall scenarios that may exacerbate water conflicts. The purpose of this study is to find a feasible methodology to assess current and monitor future water demands in order to better allocate limited water resources. The interdependency between a vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), precipitation (current and future), and surface water resources availability in two watersheds in southeastern Spain with serious difficulties in meeting water demands was investigated. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI and LST products (as proxy of drought), precipitation maps (generated from climate station records) and reservoir storage gauging information were used to compute times series anomalies from 2001 to 2014 and generate regression images and spatial regression models. The temporal relationship between reservoir storage and time series of satellite images allowed the detection of different and contrasting water management practices in the two watersheds. In addition, a comparison of current precipitation rates and future precipitation conditions obtained from global climate models suggests high precipitation reductions, especially in areas that have the potential to contribute significantly to groundwater storage and surface runoff, and are thus critical to reservoir storage. Finally, spatial regression models minimized spatial autocorrelation effects, and their results suggested the great potential of our methodology combining NDVI and LST time series to predict future scenarios of water scarcity.

TI  - Improving the detection of wildfire disturbances in space and time based on indicators extracted from MODIS data: a case study in northern Portugal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires constitute an important threat to human lives and livelihoods worldwide, as well as a major ecological disturbance. However, available wildfire databases often provide incomplete or inaccurate information, namely regarding the timing and extension of fire events. In this study, we described a generic framework to compare, rank and combine multiple remotely-sensed indicators of wildfire disturbances, in order to not only select the best indicators for each specific case, as well as to provide multi-indicator consensus approaches that can be used to detect wildfire disturbances in space and time. For this end, we compared the performance of different remotely-sensed variables to discriminate burned areas, by applying a simple change-point analysis procedure on time-series of MODIS imagery for the northern half of Portugal, without external information (e.g. active fire maps). Overall, our results highlight the importance of adopting a multi-indicator consensus approach for mapping and detecting wildfire disturbances at a regional scale, that allows to profit from spectral indices capturing different aspects of the Earth's surface, and derived from distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Finally, we argue that the framework here described can be used: (i) in a wide variety of geographical and environmental contexts; (ii) to support the identification of the best possible remotely-sensed functional indicators of wildfire disturbance; and (iii) for improving and complementing incomplete wildfire databases.

TI  - The dead man's places What does Eca in contemporary Portuguese literature?
T2  - LUSO-BRAZILIAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In "Os portugueses nao gostam de asas" (2008), Jose Eduardo Agualusa draws on aspects of contemporary Portugal and submits them to the brutal verdict of a deceased Eca de Queiros. In "O regresso de Jose Maria" (2015), by Joao de Melo, Ega runs into Eca in 21st-century Lisbon, and both deride the provincialism of the Portuguese. These works capitalize on Eca's legacy (and its heralded topicality) to carry out a work of identity interrogation. This article aims to understand to what extent Eca is being used as an interlocutor in such a discussion, or as a privileged observer, holder of an unquestionable truth about what it is to be Portuguese. The works of Agualusa and Melo reveal that Eca acts as a discursive genre that they use as shorthand to convey a worldview about Portugal, but they also struggle with the rules and routines of that genre while searching for an understanding of what Portugal is.

TI  - Passive Microwave Melt Onset Retrieval Based on a Variable Threshold: Assessment in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) presents unique challenges to the determination of melt onset (MO) using remote sensing data. High spatial resolution data is required to discern melt onset among the islands and narrow waterways of the region. Current passive microwave retrievals use daily averaged 19 GHz and 37 GHz data from the multi-channel microwave radiometer (SMMR) and/or the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I). The development of a new passive microwave melt onset method capable of using higher resolution data is desirable. The new passive microwave melt onset method described here, named the Dynamic Threshold Variability Method (DTVM), uses higher resolution data from the 37 GHz vertically-polarized channel from the advanced microwave scanning radiometers (AMSR-E and AMSR-2). The DTVM MO detection methodology differs from previously presented passive microwave Arctic MO methods in that it does not use a fixed threshold of a brightness temperature parameter. Instead, the DTVM determines MO dates based on the distribution of dates corresponding to the exceedance of a range of brightness temperature variability thresholds. The method also uses swath data instead of daily averaged brightness temperatures, which is found to lead to improved melt detection. Two current passive microwave MO methods are compared and evaluated for applicability in the CAA alongside the DTVM. The DTVM provides MO dates at a higher spatial resolution than earlier methods in addition to higher correlation with MO dates from surface air temperature (SAT) reanalyses. It is found that, for some years, MO dates in the CAA exhibit a latitudinal dependence, while in other years the MO dates in the CAA are relatively uniform across the domain.

TI  - Ecological niche models for sand fly species and predicted distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) and visceral leishmaniasis in Bahia <bold>s</bold>tate, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a public health problem in Brazil. This disease is endemic in most of Bahia state, with increasing reports of cases in new areas. Ecological niche models (ENM) can be used as a tool for predicting potential distribution for disease, vectors, and to identify risk factors associated with their distribution. In this study, ecological niche models (ENMs) were developed for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases and 12 sand fly species captured in Bahia state. Sand fly data was collected monthly by CDC light traps from July 2009 to December 2012. MODIS satellite imagery was used to calculate NDVI, NDMI, and NDWI vegetation indices, MODIS day and night land surface temperature (LST), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and 19 Bioclim variables were used to develop the ENM using the maximum entropy approach (Maxent). Mean diurnal range was the variable that most contributed to all the models for sand flies, followed by precipitation in wettest month. For Lutzomyia longipalpis (L. longipalpis), annual precipitation, precipitation in wettest quarter, precipitation in wettest month, and NDVI were the most contributing variables. For the VL model, the variables that contributed most were precipitation in wettest month, annual precipitation, LST day, and temperature seasonality. L. longipalpis was the species with the widest potential distribution in the state. The identification of risk areas and factors associated with this distribution is fundamental to prioritize resource allocation and to improve the efficacy of the state's program for surveillance and control of VL.

TI  - Science for Policy: A Case Study of Scientific Polarization, Values, and the Framing of Risk and Uncertainty
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well documented that more research can lead to hardened positions, particularly when dealing with complex, controversial, and value-laden issues. This study is an attempt to unveil underlying values in a contemporary debate, where both sides use scientific evidence to support their argument. We analyze the problem framing, vocabulary, interpretation of evidence, and policy recommendations, with particular attention to the framing of nature and technology. We find clear differences between the two arguments. One side stress that there is no evidence that the present approach is causing harm to humans or the environment, does not ruminate on uncertainties to that end, references nature's ability to handle the problem, and indicates distrust in technological solutions. In contrast, the other side focuses on uncertainties, particularly the lack of knowledge about potential environmental effects and signals trust in technological development and human intervention as the solution. Our study suggests that the two sides' diverging interpretations are tied to their perception of nature: vulnerable to human activities versus robust and able to handle human impacts. The two sides also seem to hold diverging views of technology, but there are indications that this might be rooted in their perception of governance and economy rather than about technology per se. We conclude that there is a need to further investigate how scientific arguments are related to worldviews, to see how (if at all) worldview typologies can help us to understand how value-based judgments are embedded in science advice, and the impact these have on policy preferences.

TI  - Assessing the impact of space debris on orbital resource in life cycle assessment: A proposed method and case study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The space sector is a new area of development for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. However, it deals with strong particularities which complicate the use of LCA. One of the most important is that the space industry is the only human activity crossing all stages of the atmosphere during the launch event or the atmospheric re-entry. As a result, interactions occur not only with the natural environment but also with the orbital environment during the use phase and the end-of-life of space missions. In this context, there is a lack of indicators and methods to characterise the complete life-cyde of space systems including their impact on the orbital environment. The end-of-life of spacecraft is of particular concern: space debris proliferation is today a concrete threat for all space activities. Therefore, the proposed work aims at characterising the orbital environment in term of space debris crossing the orbital resource. A complete methodology and a set of characterisation factors at midpoint level are provided. They are based on two factors: (i) the exposure to space debris in a given orbit and (ii) the severity of a potential spacecraft break-up leading to the release of new debris in the orbital environment. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of such approach through three theoretical post-mission disposal scenarios based on the Sentinel-IA mission parameters. The results are discussed against the propellant consumption needed in each case with the purpose of addressing potential 'burden shifting' that could occur between the Earth environment and the orbital one.

TI  - Analysis of broadleaf encroachment in coniferous forest plantations using multi-temporal satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, several critical issues have been identified concerning the performance of recently established spruce forest plantations in Ireland, in particular coniferous reforestation sites. More specifically, the reforestation of peatland areas in the midlands of Ireland have been subject to encroachment by broadleaf species, such as birch, and willow. These species regenerate naturally and compete with, and outgrow, the coniferous species (commonly Norway spruce) that were planted. In many cases, the growth of these trees is faster than the spruce, resulting in stands being completely encroached by approximately 15 years of age. Given the widespread nature of this problem coupled with the fragmented nature of the Irish forest estate, a project was established to use Earth observation data to predict the spatial distribution and species composition of the affected sites. The spatial distribution and associated area estimates of broadleaf encroachment within State owned spruce forests were assessed using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of the encroachment map was 85.23% and a Kappa Index of Agreement of 0.58. The associated area of encroached or broadleaf dominated forests was 20,003 ha with a confidence interval of +/- 20% calculated using a sample-based estimator.

TI  - Management intensification maintains wood production over multiple harvests in tropical <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forestry, in which trees are grown as a crop, must maintain wood production over repeated harvest cycles (rotations) to meet global wood demands on a limited land area. We analyze 33 yr of Landsat observations across the world's most productive forestry system, Eucalyptus plantations in southeastern Brazil, to assess long-term regional trends in wood production. We apply a simple algorithm to time series of the vegetation index NIRv in thousands of Eucalyptus stands to detect the starts and ends of rotations. We then estimate wood production in each identified stand and rotation, based on a statistical relationship between NIRv trajectories and inventory data from three plantation companies. We also compare Eucalyptus NIRv with that of surrounding native vegetation to assess the relative influence of management and environment on plantation productivity trends. Across more than 3,500 stands with three complete rotations between 1984 and 2016, modeled wood volume decreased significantly between the first and second rotation, but recovered at least partially in the third; mean wood volumes for the three rotations were 262, 228, and 247 m(3)/ha. This nonlinear trend reflects intensifying plantation management, as rotation length decreased by an average of 15% (decreasing wood volume per rotation) and NIRv proxies of tree growth rates increased (increasing volume) between the first and third rotation. However, NIRv also increased significantly over time in unmanaged vegetation around the plantations, suggesting that environmental trends affecting all vegetation also contribute to sustaining wood production. Management inputs will likely continue to be important for maintaining wood production in future harvests.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Tumor Margin Demarcation Using the Hybrid Tracer Indocyanine Green-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Nanocolloid: A Proof-of-Concept Study in Tongue Cancer Patients Scheduled for Sentinel Node Biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - For radical resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, a tumor-free margin of at least 5 mm is required. Unfortunately, establishing in-depth margins is a surgical conundrum. Knowing that the hybrid sentinel node (SN) tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid generates temporary tattoolike markings at the site of administration, we studied the ability to apply this tracer for tumor margin demarcation combined with SN biopsy. Methods: Nineteen patients with clinical T1-T2 oral tongue tumors received the traditional superficial 3 or 4 deposits of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (0.1 mL each), and in 12 patients additional deposits were placed deeply using ultrasound guidance (total of 6; 0.07 mL each). SN mapping was performed using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT. Before and directly after tumor excision, fluorescence imaging was performed to monitor the tracer deposits in the patient (fluorescent deposits were not used to guide the surgical excision). At pathologic examination, primary tumor samples were studied in detail. Results: The number of tracer depositions did not induce a significant difference in the number of SNs visualized (P = 0.836). Reproducible and deep tracer deposition proved to be challenging. The fluorescent nature of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid supported in vivo and ex vivo identification of the tracer deposits surrounding the tumor. Pathologic examination indicated that in 66.7% (8/12), all fluorescence was observed within the resection margins. Conclusion: This study indicates that tumor margin demarcation combined with SN identification has potential but that some practical challenges need to be overcome if this technique is to mature as a surgical guidance concept. Future studies need to define whether the technology can improve the radical nature of the resections.

TI  - Appraisal of Urban Heat Island Detection of Peshawar Using Land Surface Temperature and Its Impacts on Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Last couple of decades witnessed a rapid escalation in urban temperature of Peshawar city and its neighboring localities. This alarming condition gave birth to climatic term urban heat island-created drastic alteration in surface temperatures. In this study, thermal infrared remote sensing data have been employed to map out and monitor such micro-climatic variation in temperatures in land use/land cover exposed surface to the environment. To assess these outcomes resulting from human activities, Landsat TM data band 6 was subjected through ERDAS Imagine 2013. For further processing, ARC GIS helped a lot in making maps to pinpoint the heat island in and around the city. Moreover, a relationship of land surface temperature with urban sprawl, environmental and industrialization was established. This study has shown a substantial upsurge in temperature about to 1 degrees-3 degrees. Urban sprawl and industrialization at the edges are accounting for these conditions. Urban and industrial data have also reinforced the fact being drawn from remotely sensed data. Hence, evaluation of land surface temperature data captured through remote satellite has proven to be effective tool not only for monitoring and analyzing temperature but also for assessing its adverse impacts on the environment and climate.

TI  - PATTERNS OF SSS VARIABILITY IN THE EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC Intraseasonal to Interannual Timescales from Seven Years of NASA Satellite Data
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) observations from NASA's satellite missions, Aquarius/SAC-D and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), are used to describe spatial patterns of the seasonal cycle, as well as intraseasonal and interannual variability, in the eastern tropical Pacific, the location of the second Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS-2) field experiment. The results indicate that the distribution of SSS variance is highly inhomogeneous in both space and time. The seasonal signal is largest in the core of the Eastern Pacific Fresh Pool and in the Gulf of Panama. The interannual signal is highest in a relatively narrow zonal band along approximately 5 degrees N, while the intraseasonal signal appears to be a dominant mode of variability in the zonally stretched near-equatorial region. Located right in the middle of a hotspot of high SSS variance, the SPURS-2 site appears to be at the crossroads of many different processes that shape the distribution of SSS in the eastern tropical Pacific and beyond.

TI  - Ultra-high spatial resolution fractional vegetation cover from unmanned aerial multispectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is a key environmental variable often mapped from satellite and aerial imagery. The derivation of ultra-high spatial resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) based on multispectral imagery acquired from an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) has several applications, including the potential to revolutionise the collection of field data for calibration/validation of satellite products. In this study, abundance maps were derived using three methods, applied to data collected in a typical Australian rangeland environment. The first method used downscaling between Landsat FVC maps and UAS images with Random Forest regression to predict bare ground, photosynthetic vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation cover. The second method used spectral unmixing based on endmembers identified in the multispectral imagery. The third method used an object-based classification approach to label image segments. The accuracy of all UAS FVC and Landsat FVC products were assessed using 20 field plots (100 m diameter star transects), as well as from 138 ground photo plots. The classification method performed best for all cover fractions at the 100 m plot scale (12-13% RMSE), with the downscaling approach only able to accurately predict photosynthetic cover. The downscaling and unmixing generally over-predicted non-photosynthetic vegetation associated with Chenopod shrubs. When compared with the high-resolution photo plot data, the classification method performed the worst, while the downscaling and unmixing methods achieved reasonable accuracy for the photosynthetic component only (12-13% RMSE). Multispectral UAS imagery has great potential for mapping photosynthetic vegetation cover in rangelands at ultra-high resolution, though accurately separating non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare ground was only possible when the data was scaled-up to coarser resolutions.

TI  - Is it possible to map subsurface soil attributes by satellite spectral transfer models?
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is impossible to make pedological maps without understanding subsurface attributes. Several strategies can be used for soil mapping, from a tacit knowledge to mathematical modeling. However, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding how to optimize subsurface mapping. This work aimed to quantify subsurface soil attributes using satellite spectral reflectance and geographically weighted regression (GWR) techniques. The study was carried out in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in an area spanning 47,882 ha. Multitemporal satellite images (Landsat-5) were initially processed in order to retrieve spectral reflectance from the bare soil surface. Based on a toposequence method, 328 points were then distributed across the area (at depths between 0 and 20 cm and 80 and 100 cm) and analyzed for their soil chemical and physical attributes (including the reflectance spectra (400 to 2500 run)) in the laboratory. We achieved 67.72% of bare soil for the whole study area, with the remaining 32.28% of the unmapped surface being filled by kriging interpolation. All 328 samples were modeled using surface (Landsat-5 TM spectral reflectance) and subsurface (acquired in the laboratory) data, reaching up to 0.72 RLi. The correlation between the spectra of both depths was significant and the soil attributes prediction reached an R!dj of validation above 0.6 for clay, hue, value, and chroma at 0-20 and 80-100 cm depths. The satellite soil surface reflectance allowed the estimation of soil subsurface attributes. These results demonstrate that diagnostic soil attributes can be quantified based on spectral pedotransfer (SPEDO) functions to assist digital soil mapping and soil monitoring. Despite our efforts to determine soil subsurface properties using digital soil mapping approach, this task still need considerable refinement. Thus, research must continue to aggregate outcomes from other techniques.

TI  - Reduction of Spatially Structured Errors in Wide-Swath Altimetric Satellite Data Using Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is a next generation satellite mission expected to provide a 2 km-resolution observation of the sea surface height (SSH) on a two-dimensional swath. Processing SWOT data will be challenging because of the large amount of data, the mismatch between a high spatial resolution and a low temporal resolution, and the observation errors. The present paper focuses on the reduction of the spatially structured errors of SWOT SSH data. It investigates a new error reduction method and assesses its performance in an observing system simulation experiment. The proposed error-reduction method first projects the SWOT SSH onto a subspace spanned by the SWOT spatially structured errors. This projection is removed from the SWOT SSH to obtain a detrended SSH. The detrended SSH is then processed within an ensemble data assimilation analysis to retrieve a full SSH field. In the latter step, the detrending is applied to both the SWOT data and an ensemble of model-simulated SSH fields. Numerical experiments are performed with synthetic SWOT observations and an ensemble from a North Atlantic, 1/60 degrees simulation of the ocean circulation (NATL60). The data assimilation analysis is carried out with an ensemble Kalman filter. The results are assessed with root mean square errors, power spectrum density, and spatial coherence. They show that a significant part of the large scale SWOT errors is reduced. The filter analysis also reduces the small scale errors and allows for an accurate recovery of the energy of the signal down to 25 km scales. In addition, using the SWOT nadir data to adjust the SSH detrending further reduces the errors.

TI  - A CRITICAL EXPOSITION OF THE ETHNOCENTRIC WORLDVIEW IN DIALOGUE WITH KARL JASPERS, HANNAH ARENDT, AND ZYGMUNT BAUMAN ON THE MATTERS OF XENOPHOBIA AND SOCIAL OSTRACISM
T2  - PHAINOMENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall aim of this article is to provide a critical exposition of the ethnocentric worldview. In order to reach this aim, I intend to explore the nature of abusive generalization which belongs to the populist images of national identity. Secondly, the main argument of the article lies in the proposition that what supplements nationalist populism is the psychological component of xenophobia. These crucial aspects of ethnocentrism, as I intend to argue, compose the ethnocentric worldview, which shapes individual commitment to national identity by omitting the member of a different ethnic identity.

TI  - On the linkage between changes in cloud cover and precipitation extremes over Central India
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, linkage between changing characteristics of precipitation extremes and cloud covers over Central India is explored during summer monsoon period using Satellite data (1998-2015). This is a first attempt to relate the changes in cloud cover to the changes in precipitation extremes. Non-rainy cirrus clouds are excluded from this study. Results show that heavy rainfall ( >= 60 mm/day) is associated with cold cloud tops (Tb <= 5.220 K) while moderate rainfall ( < 60 mm/day and >= 20 mm) occurs mostly with middle clouds (Tb > 220 K and <= 245K). Low level clouds (Tb > 245 K) are responsible for light rainfall ( < 20 mm/day). Increases in top 20%, 10%, 5% and 1% heavy precipitation relate well with the increases in very deep convective, deep convective and convective cloud cover. Among these relations, increase in top 5% heavy precipitation relates best with increase in very deep convective cloud cover. Decrease in bottom 30% low precipitation relates with decrease in low level cloud cover. The results reported in this study fit into the framework of how weather extremes respond to climate change.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate demarcation of river basin boundaries is an important input for any programme connected with watershed management. In the present study, the boundary of the Varuna river basin is automatically derived using coarse- and medium-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of SRTM-30 m, ASTER-30 m, Cartosat-30 m, ALOS Palsar-12.5 m and Cartosat-10 m as well as manually through on-screen digitisation from a very high-resolution 1 m 1 m remote sensing data available as Google Earth image. The study demonstrated the efficacy of on-screen digitisation from high-resolution Google Earth image supported by detailed field observations in the precision mapping of the place of origin of the Varuna River, its stream network and basin boundary when compared to the maps generated through automatic methods using DEMs of various resolutions. The Varuna river system takes its headwaters from the areas surrounding Umran and Dain 'tals' (shallow, large depressions/basins) but not from the west of Mau Aima town as has been previously reported.

TI  - Response of long- to short-term changes of the Puri coastline of Odisha (India) to natural and anthropogenic factors: a remote sensing and statistical assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal regions of India are densely populated and most biological productive ecosystems which are threatened by erosion, natural disaster, and anthropogenic interferences. These threats have made priority in appraisal of shoreline dynamicity as part of sustainable management of coastal zones. The present study assessed the long- to short-term dynamicity of shoreline positions along the coast of Puri district, Odisha, India, during the past 25 years (1990-2015) using open-source multi-temporal satellite images (Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI) and statistical-based methods (endpoint rate, linear regression rate and weighted linear regression). The long-term assessment during 1990-2015 shows that shoreline accredited at the rate of 0.3 m a(-1) with estimated mean accretion and erosional rate of 1.18 m a(-1) and 0.64 m a(-1),respectively. A significant trend of coastal erosion is primarily observed on the northern side of Puri district coast. A cyclic pattern of accretion (during 1990-1995 and 2000-2004) and erosion (during 1995-2000 and 2009-2015) was observed during the assessment of short-term shoreline change. It exhibited significant correlation with the landfall of severe cyclones and identified cyclic phases after severe cyclonic storms, i.e., phase of erosion, phase of accretion and phase of stabilization. Overall, the natural processes specifically the landfall of tropical cyclones and anthropogenic activities such as the construction of coastal structures, encroachment and recent construction in the coastal regulatory zone, and construction of dams in upper catchment areas are the major factors accountable for shoreline changes. The output of the research undertaken is not only crucial for monitoring the dynamism of coastal ecosystem boundaries but to enable long- to short-term coastal zone management planning in response to recently reported high erosion along the Puri coast. Moreover, the usage of open-source satellite imageries and statistical-based method provides an opportunity in developing cost-effective spatial data infrastructure for shoreline monitoring and vulnerability mapping along the coastal region.

TI  - <SUP>1</SUP>H NMR metabolomic analysis of skin and blubber of bottlenose dolphins reveals a functional metabolic dichotomy
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a carnivorous cetacean that thrives in marine environments, one of the apex predators of the marine food web. They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems due to their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, and in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, skin and blubber are important surface and protective tissues that have not been adequately probed for metabolism. Using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) based metabolomics approach, we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranded bottlenose dolphin (n = 4) samples collected at different localities in the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber are quantitatively very different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Further, using hierarchical clustering analysis and random forest analysis of the metabolite abundances, the results pointed to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. On one hand, the differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, thus pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, the skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards an active anabolic energy generating metabolism. The most notable pathways found in both tissues included: urea cycle, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism among others. Our H-1 NMR metabolomics analysis allowed the quantification of metabolites associated with these two organs, i.e., pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the functional and physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation, as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies.

TI  - Woody vegetation dynamics in the tropical and subtropical Andes from 2001 to 2014: Satellite image interpretation and expert validation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactions between climate and land-use change are dictating the distribution of flora and fauna and reshuffling biotic community composition around the world. Tropical mountains are particularly sensitive because they often have a high human population density, a long history of agriculture, range-restricted species, and high-beta diversity due to a steep elevation gradient. Here we evaluated the change in distribution of woody vegetation in the tropical Andes of South America for the period 2001-2014. For the analyses we created annual land-cover/land-use maps using MODIS satellite data at 250 m pixel resolution, calculated the cover of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) in 9,274 hexagons of 115.47 km(2), and then determined if there was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 14 year linear trend (positive-forest gain, negative-forest loss) within each hexagon. Of the 1,308 hexagons with significant trends, 36.6% (n = 479) lost forests and 63.4% (n = 829) gained forests. We estimated an overall net gain of similar to 500,000 ha in woody vegetation. Forest loss dominated the 1,000-1,499 m elevation zone and forest gain dominated above 1,500 m. The most important transitions were forest loss at lower elevations for pastures and croplands, forest gain in abandoned pastures and cropland in mid-elevation areas, and shrub encroachment into highland grasslands. Expert validation confirmed the observed trends, but some areas of apparent forest gain were associated with new shade coffee, pine, or eucalypt plantations. In addition, after controlling for elevation and country, forest gain was associated with a decline in the rural population. Although we document an overall gain in forest cover, the recent reversal of forest gains in Colombia demonstrates that these coupled natural-human systems are highly dynamic and there is an urgent need of a regional real-time land-use, biodiversity, and ecosystem services monitoring network.

TI  - Predictive mapping of surface soil texture in a semiarid region of India through geostatistical modeling
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and complete spatial distribution of soil texture is required for proper land use planning, soil management practices and other interventions linked to environmental protection. In the present study, we spatially predicted sand, silt and clay content in top soil (0-15cm) in parts of Gadag district in Karnataka, India using satellite-based indices and geostatistical modeling. The study was conducted to evaluate the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing data as auxiliary variable along with CartoDEM for spatial prediction of sand, silt and clay content with a total of 57 number of field observations. The bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), The Grain Size Index (GSI) and the relationship between band 4 and 3, 4 and 7 and 6 and 7 of Landsat 8 OLI and slope, elevation of CartoDEM were used as covariates for modeling. Among these covariates NDVI and relationship between band 4 and band 7 were not significantly correlated with the sand, silt and clay content. However digital number (DN) of band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, GSI and relationship between band 4 to band 3 were significantly correlated with the surface soil sand, silt and clay content. The DN of band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, GSI and relationship between band 4 to band 3 were selected as auxiliary data for the estimation of sand and silt content, whereas the DN of band 5 and 7 explained most of the variability of soil clay. The Regression Kriging (RK) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were employed to predict soil texture and compared for better accuracy of estimation. The greater spatial variability (58.8, 48.2 and 33.2%) of sand, silt and clay content respectively were predicted with lower estimation errors (RMSE=7.41, 4.68 and 7.64, R-2=0.95, 0.55 and 0.91 respectively) in RK as compared to MLR method (RMSE=9.18, 5.65 and 11.13, R-2=0.90, 0.38 and 0.80 respectively). The average decrease of 31.3, 19.2 and 17.5% in the prediction error was observed in RK over MLR approach in clay, sand and silt prediction respectively. The uncertainty of the prediction was calculated by 95% confidence intervals, which showed 7.51, 43.5 and 49.6% for sand, silt and clay prediction respectively. The current study showed that RK approach can be useful to predict sand, silt and clay content over MLR approach.

TI  - Applying principles of metrology to historical Earth observations from satellites
T2  - METROLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Approaches from metrology can assist earth observation (EO) practitioners to develop quantitative characterisation of uncertainty in EO data. This is necessary for the credibility of statements based on Earth observations in relation to topics of public concern, particularly climate and environmental change. This paper presents the application of metrological uncertainty analysis to historical Earth observations from satellites, and is intended to aid mutual understanding of metrology and EO. The nature of satellite observations is summarised for different EO data processing levels, and key metrological nomenclature and principles for uncertainty characterisation are reviewed. We then address metrological approaches to developing estimates of uncertainty that are traceable from the satellite sensor, through levels of data processing, to products describing the evolution of the geophysical state of the Earth. EO radiances have errors with complex error correlation structures that are significant when performing common higher-level transformations of EO imagery. Principles of measurement-function-centred uncertainty analysis are described that apply sequentially to each EO data processing level. Practical tools for organising and traceably documenting uncertainty analysis are presented. We illustrate these principles and tools with examples including some specific sources of error seen in EO satellite data as well as with an example of the estimation of sea surface temperature from satellite infra-red imagery. This includes a simulation-based estimate for the error distribution of clear-sky infra-red brightness temperature in which calibration uncertainty and digitisation are found to dominate. The propagation of these errors to sea surface temperature is then presented, illustrating the relevance of the approach to derivation of EO-based climate datasets. We conclude with a discussion arguing that there is broad scope and need for improvement in EO practice as a measurement science. EO practitioners and metrologists willing to extend and adapt their disciplinary knowledge to meet this need can make valuable contributions to EO.

TI  - Longitudinal access and exposure to green-blue spaces and individual-level mental health and well-being: protocol for a longitudinal, population-wide record-linked natural experiment
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Studies suggest that access and exposure to green-blue spaces (GBS) have beneficial impacts on mental ealth. However, the evidence base is limited with respect to longitudinal studies. The main aim of this longitudinal, population-wide, record-linked natural experiment, is to model the daily lived experience by linking GBS accessibility indices, residential GBS exposure and health data; to enable quantification of the impact of GBS on well-being and common mental health disorders, for a national population.Methods and analysis This research will estimate the impact of neighbourhood GBS access, GBS exposure and visits to GBS on the risk of common mental health conditions and the opportunity for promoting subjective well-being (SWB); both key priorities for public health. We will use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create quarterly household GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposure using digital map and satellite data for 1.4 million homes in Wales, UK (2008-2018). We will link the GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposures to individual-level mental health outcomes for 1.7 million people with general practitioner (GP) data and data from the National Survey for Wales (n=similar to 12 000) on well-being in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. We will examine if these associations are modified by multiple sociophysical variables, migration and socioeconomic disadvantage. Subgroup analyses will examine associations by different types of GBS. This longitudinal study will be augmented by cross-sectional research using survey data on self-reported visits to GBS and SWB.Ethics and dissemination All data will be anonymised and linked within the privacy protecting SAIL Databank. We will be using anonymised data and therefore we are exempt from National Research Ethics Committee (NREC). An Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP) application (Project ID: 0562) to link these data has been approved. The research programme will be undertaken in close collaboration with public/patient involvement groups. A multistrategy programme of dissemination is planned with the academic community, policy-makers, practitioners and the public.

TI  - Feedback of coastal marshes to climate change: Long-term phenological shifts
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are important carbon sinks facing serious threats from climatic stressors. Current research reveals that the growth of individual marsh plants is susceptible to a changing climate, but the responses of different marsh systems at a landscape scale are less clear. Here, we document the multi-decadal changes in the phenology and the area of the extensive coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, a representative of coastal ecosystems around the world that currently experiencing sea-level rise, temperature warming, and atmospheric CO2 increase. The phenological records are constructed using the longest continuous satellite-based record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat data, and an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model. We find that the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes increased concomitantly with the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the last 30 years, and predict that such changes will continue and accelerate in the future. These phenological changes suggest a potential increase in CO2 uptake and thus a negative feedback mechanism to climate change. The areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were stable over the period studied, but the areas of the brackish and saline marshes decreased substantially, suggesting ecosystem instability and carbon storage loss under the anticipated sea-level rise. The marshes' phenological shifts portend their potentially critical role in climate mitigation, and the different responses among systems shed light on the underlying mechanisms of such changes.

TI  - Assessment of Regression and Classification Methods Using Remote Sensing Technology for Detection of Coastal Depth (Case Study of Bushehr Port and Kharg Island)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Any decision-making and planning in coastal areas and ports require a series of basic information in which bathymetry is an important part of it. The concern of most scholars who deal with or research in this area is to access accurate, up-to-date, and cost-effective information. One of the methods to achieve such information is to use remote sensing technologies. The purpose of this study is to use Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Random Forest algorithm by using regression and classification methods for depth prediction in a part of Persian Gulf region (Bushehr port, Kharg Island, and its surroundings). For verification of depth prediction in these two methods, two indices of root mean square error and mean absolute error in the regression method and the Kappa index (KAPPA) for classification method were used. The results of these two methods show that in both regression and classification methods, the best combination of bands for depth prediction was the band combination (1-2-3-4) and the Landsat 8 satellite image has the ability to obtain depth with a fairly acceptable accuracy to depth of around 10m. From the depths of 10m onward, the measurement error will increase relative to the depth.

TI  - Lymph-circulating tumor cells show distinct properties to blood-circulating tumor cells and are efficient metastatic precursors
T2  - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The leading cause of breast cancer-associated death is metastasis. In 80% of solid tumors, metastasis via the lymphatic system precedes metastasis via the vascular system. However, the molecular properties of tumor cells as they exit the primary tumor into the afferent lymphatics en route to the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are not yet known. Here, we developed an innovative technique that enables the collection of lymph and lymph-circulating tumor cells (LCTCs) en route to the SLN in an immunocompetent animal model of breast cancer metastasis. We found that the gene and protein expression profiles of LCTCs and blood-circulating tumor cells (BCTCs) as they exit the primary tumor are similar, but distinct from those of primary tumors and lymph node metastases (LNMs). LCTCs, but not BCTCs, exist in clusters, display a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype and cancer stem cell-like properties, and are efficient metastatic precursors. These results demonstrate that tumor cells that metastasize through the lymphatic system are different from those spread by blood circulation. Understanding the relative contribution of these cells to overall peripheral blood-circulating tumor cells is important for cancer therapy. Whether these two types of cell occur in cancer patients remains to be determined.

TI  - Evaluation of single crop coefficient curves derived from Landsat satellite images for major crops in Iran
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of single crop coefficient (K-c) for major crops at regional scales would significantly result in optimizing the consumption of agriculture water. In this study, a new approach is applied to generate K-c curves from satellite images based on the Priestley-Taylor equation. The equation mainly consists of shortwave radiation and thermal terms. Therefore in order to meet the equation's requirements, the Landsat optical data was considered as the essential satellite-based input of the approach, yet thermal data was obtained from the MODIS imagery which was primarily downscaled using the TsHARP algorithm to fit the 30 m spatial resolution of Landsat; therefore, in this study the method is referred to as the MultiSensor Data Fusion for potential EvapoTranspiration calculation (MSDF-ET). The K-c trends were first evaluated for annual crops (forage maize, sugar beet, wheat, and barley) in two different regions (the Qazvin and Tehran-Karaj plains) using field observation data of Leaf Area Index (LAI). The method was then applied to the major crops in 31 selected plains with three different climatic conditions in Iran. Climatic conditions were categorized into cold (North West region), arid (Central region), and warm and humid (South West region). Eventually, crop water requirements (CWR) in different regions were compared considering long-term air temperature, wind, and relative humidity (RH) variations. Evaluation of the method in the Qazvin and Tehran-Karaj plains showed promising results. The K-c trend varied according to the LAI and temperature variability. Crop growth duration and especially K-c curves were successfully extracted using remotely sensed data in the studied areas. CWR in the zone with higher values of air temperature, notably in warm seasons, was higher in comparison with other climatic zones. Also lengths of the growing seasons were shorter. In conclusion, surface and groundwater resources management would be improved as the result of taking satellite data into account for K-c and subsequently CWR calculations.

TI  - Mindfulness of Death as a Tool for Mortality Salience Induction with Reference to Terror Management Theory
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I argue that mindfulness of death (mara?asati) can be a tool to induce mortality salience and can have a positive psychological impact. The mindfulness of death is described in detail in the early Buddhist texts A?guttara Nikaya and Visuddhimagga. The texts stress that death should be consciously connected with temporality and mindfulness. Here, I look at the mindfulness of death in relation to the mortality salience of terror management theory. Mortality salience is a term proposed in terror management theory that means the state of conscious activation of the thoughts of death. In addition, after conscious activation of the thought of death, I examine the psychological changes, such as the increase of pro-social attitudes which emphasizes ethics and morality, and the emphasis on the intrinsic value of life due to the operation of a cultural worldview and self-esteem. In this paper, I conclude that mindfulness of death can be an effective tool to induce mortality salience.

TI  - Long-term continuity in land surface phenology measurements: A comparative assessment of the MODIS land cover dynamics and VIIRS land surface phenology products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology contributes to, and is diagnostic of, seasonal variation in ecosystem processes and exerts important controls on land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water, and energy. Satellite remote sensing provides a valuable source of data for monitoring the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems and has been widely used to map geographic and interannual variation in land surface phenology (LSP) over large areas. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface phenology product provides global data sets characterizing the annual LSP of terrestrial ecosystems, and is designed to support long-term continuity of LSP measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We used data from VIIRS and MODIS to evaluate the agreement and characterize the similarities and differences between LSP data from each instrument. Specifically, we compare data from the Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product with data from the newly developed VIIRS LSP product over the most common land cover types in North America. To do this, we assessed the overall agreement between time series of vegetation indices from VIIRS and MODIS, evaluated the correspondence between retrieved phenometrics from each instrument, and analyzed sources of differences between phenometrics from the each product. As part of this analysis, we also compared phenometrics from MODIS and VIIRS with phenometrics derived from Landsat Analysis Ready Data and PhenoCam time series. Results show that two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) values from VIIRS and MODIS are similar (R-2 > 0.81; root mean square deviation < 0.062), but that VIIRS EVI2 time series show more high frequency variation than time series from MODIS. Further, even though the VIIRS and MODIS products are generated using different instruments and algorithms, phenometrics from each product are similar and show only minor differences within and across land cover types. Systematic differences between phenometrics from the two products were generally less than one week (absolute bias 4.8 +/- 3.0 days), and RMSDs were less than two weeks for most phenometrics across different land cover classes (10.7 +/- 4.3 days). Comparison of VIIRS and MODIS LSP data with corresponding metrics estimated from Landsat and PhenoCam data consistently showed high agreement among the data sets. Overall, results from this analysis indicate that the VIIRS LSP product provides excellent continuity with the MODIS record. However, studies attempting to create high-fidelity long-term LSP time series by merging these products should exploit the overlap period of MODIS and VIIRS to estimate land cover-specific corrections for modest systematic bias in the MODIS LCD product relative to the VIIRS LSP product.

TI  - Estimation and Mapping of Forest Structure Parameters from Open Access Satellite Images: Development of a Generic Method with a Study Case on Coniferous Plantation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate forests are under climatic and economic pressures. Public bodies, NGOs and the wood industry are looking for accurate, current and affordable data driven solutions to intensify wood production while maintaining or improving long term sustainability of the production, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Free tools and open access data have already been exploited to produce accurate quantitative forest parameters maps suitable for policy and operational purposes. These efforts have relied on different data sources, tools, and methods that are tailored for specific forest types and climatic conditions. We hypothesized we could build on these efforts in order to produce a generic method suitable to perform as well or better in a larger range of settings. In this study we focus on building a generic approach to create forest parameters maps and confirm its performance on a test site: a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) forest located in south west of France. We investigated and assessed options related with the integration of multiple data sources (SAR L- and C-band, optical indexes and spatial texture indexes from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2), feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning techniques. On our test case, we found that the combination of multiple open access data sources has synergistic benefits on the forest parameters estimates. The sensibility analysis shows that all the data participate to the improvements, that reach up to 13.7% when compared to single source estimates. Accuracy of the estimates is as follows: aboveground biomass (AGB) 28% relative RMSE, basal area (BA) 27%, diameter at breast height (DBH) 20%, age 17%, tree density 24%, and height 13%. Forward feature selection and SVR provided the best estimates. Future work will focus on validating this generic approach in different settings. It may prove beneficial to package the method, the tools, and the integration of open access data in order to make spatially accurate and regularly updated forest structure parameters maps effortlessly available to national bodies and forest organizations.

TI  - Copolarized and Cross-Polarized SAR Measurements for High-Resolution Description of Major Hurricane Wind Structures: Application to Irma Category5 Hurricane
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - C-band high-resolution radar (synthetic aperture radar [SAR]) is the only spaceborne instrument able to probe at very high resolution and over all ocean basins the sea surface under extreme weather conditions. When coanalyzed with Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer wind estimates, the radar backscatter signals acquired in major hurricanes from Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 SAR reveal high sensitivity in the cross-polarized channel for wind speeds up to 75m/s. The combination of the two copolarized and cross-polarized channels can then be used to derive high-resolution surface wind estimates. The retrieval methods and impacts of intense rainfall are discussed in the context of a Hurricane Irma (2017) case study. On 7 September 2017, Sentinel-1 measurements intercepted Hurricane Irma when it was at category 5 intensity. When compared to Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer, SAR-derived wind speeds yield bias and root-mean-square of about 1.5 and 5.0m/s, respectively. The retrieved wind structure parameters for the outer core are found to be in agreement with the Best-Track and combined satellite- and aircraft-based analyses. SAR measurements uniquely describe the inner core and provide independent measurements of the maximum wind speed and the radius of maximum wind. Near the radius of maximum wind a 65-m/s increase in wind speed in less than 10km is detected, corresponding to an instantaneous absolute vorticity of order 210 times the Coriolis parameter. Using a parametric Holland model and the environmental surface pressure (1,011hPa), SAR-derived wind speeds correspond to a central surface pressure of 918hPa (921hPa from the Best-Track) in Irma's eye.

TI  - An Assessment of Atmospheric Correction Methods for GOCI Images in the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Estuary is a typical case II water body with high turbidity. Atmospheric correction of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data is difficult in such areas. The applicability of existing atmospheric correction methods suffers from a lack of systematic assessment. In this study, the nearest-neighbor, near-infrared (NIR)-ratio, and ultraviolet atmospheric correction (UV-AC) techniques are applied to GOCI images of the Yellow River Estuary, and the quality of the water-leaving reflectance rho(w)(lambda) obtained by these methods is evaluated. The results show that the performance of the NIR-ratio and UV-AC methods is almost the same compared with in situ synchronous data, with the absolute percentage difference (APD) of each band ranging from 6-48 % and 9-47 %, respectively. The accuracy of the 660 nm and 680 nm bands is the highest (APD less than 10 %). The values of rho(w)(lambda) retrieved by the nearest-neighbor method are obviously underestimated, with an APD ranging from 30-196 %. Moreover, negative values appear in the NIR and blue bands. A rationality evaluation of the spectral shape of rho(w)(lambda) extracted from the GOCI images further confirms the consistency of the results obtained by the UV-AC and NIR-ratio methods. Approximately 86 % of pixels were scored the same by the two methods. Based on the above evaluation results, the NIR-ratio and UV-AC methods are concluded to have the same accuracy, and both perform better than the nearest-neighbor method. The input parameters of the NIR-ratio method are determined in advance using in situ measured data. On account of the limited amount of measured data, the representativeness and applicability of the input parameters are yet to be confirmed.

AB  - IntroductionAlthough endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer is well established, anatomical resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended for lesions at high risk for occult lymph node metastasis (e.g., lymphovascular invasion, poor grade, and deep submucosal invasion). However, 75-95% high-risk early gastric cancer (HR-EGC) patients ultimately have node-negative disease and could potentially have undergone organ-sparing resection. Due to the inadequacy of standard modalities to reliably rule out nodal metastases in HR-EGC patients, sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling was developed in Asia with promising results. However, the applicability of this technique in the West has been brought into question due to potential differences in tumor histology and body habitus. This prospective study aimed to test SLN sampling for North American EGC patients.MethodsAll patients with biopsy-confirmed T0-2N0-1M0 gastric adenocarcinoma at the Montreal General Hospital-McGill University Health Centre were eligible for enrollment. Esophageal and GEJ cancers were excluded due to the high rate of intrathoracic lymph node involvement. Peritumoral submucosal injection with T-99 radiocolloid was performed endoscopically 24-30h prior to surgery. Methylene blue dye injection was performed after induction of anesthesia. SLN basins were identified as those having >10% of baseline tumor radiation signal or blue color, or both. After basins were individually removed, standard laparoscopic anatomical resection was then performed with D2 lymphadenectomy. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03049345). Data are presented as median (interquartile range).ResultsFrom July 2016-April 2018, 253 patients with esophagogastric adenocarcinoma were evaluated. Of these, 10 met inclusion criteria (90% male, age 66(30) years). Subtotal gastrectomy was performed in nine patients (90%) and length of stay was 4 (2)days. At least one SLN basin was identified in nine cases (90%). The median #SLN basins identified was 2(2) with a median of 5(5) total SLNs retrieved per patient. In the one case for which no SLN basins were identified, only blue dye injection was used, whereas SLNs were identified in all cases using the dual tracer method. Final T-stage was pT1b/T2 in four (40%), pT1a in two (20%), and Tx in four (40%). Two patients (20%) had lymph node metastases on final pathological analysis, both of which were identified by SLN sampling (accuracy 100%; false negative rate 0%). No adverse events related to SLN retrieval were identified.ConclusionsThis study represents the first prospective feasibility evaluation of sentinel lymph node sampling for early gastric cancer in North America with promising preliminary results. The dual tracer method was superior to single agent blue dye in identifying sentinel nodal basins. Considerable further study is necessary to verify the safety and utility of SLN mapping in North American patients with early gastric adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Bag of words KAZE (BoWK) with two-step classification for high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - IET COMPUTER VISION
M3  - Article
AB  - The bag-of-words (BoW) model has been widely used for scene classification in recent state-of-the-art methods. However, inter-class similarity among scene categories and very high spatial resolution imagery makes its performance limited in the remote-sensing domain. Therefore, this research presents a new KAZE-based image descriptor that makes use of the BoW approach to substantially increase classification performance. Specifically, a novel multi-neighbourhood KAZE is proposed for small image patches. Secondly, the spatial pyramid matching and BoW representation can be adopted to use the extracted features and make an innovative BoW KAZE (BoWK) descriptor. Third, two bags of multi-neighbourhood KAZE features are selected in which each bag is regarded as separated feature descriptors. Next, canonical correlation analysis is introduced as a feature fusion strategy to further refine the BOWK features, which allows a more effective and robust fusion approach than the traditional feature fusion strategies. Experiments on three challenging remote-sensing data sets show that the proposed BoWK descriptor not only surpasses the conventional KAZE descriptor but also yields significantly higher classification performance than the state-of-the-art methods used now. Moreover, the proposed BoWK approach produces rich informative features to describe the scene images with low-computational cost and a much lower dimension.

AB  - The non-resonant conversion of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons into scalar as well as light pseudoscalar particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs) in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields can cause a unique, spatially fluctuating spectral distortion in the CMB. We use the publicly available Planck temperature maps for the frequency channels (70{545 GHz) to obtain the first ALP distortion map using 45% clean part of the sky. The 95th percentile upper limit on the RMS fluctuation of ALP distortions from the cleanest part of the CMB sky at 15 arcmin angular resolution is 18.5 x 10(-6). The RMS fluctuation in the distortion map is also consistent with di ff erent combinations of frequency channels and sky-fractions.

M3  - Article
AB  - From the time when it was first launched in 2005, satellite data generated from Google Earth are freely available online. Hence, without being conducting concrete studies about the accuracy of satellite data from Google Earth, Google Earth are chiefly used for different field of studies in different sectors for different purposes in Ethiopia. In this regard, it was planned to conduct this study by establishing the main objective to evaluate the positional accuracy of Google Earth. Hence, in order to address the aforementioned objective, a brief methodology for collecting and analyzing data was performed. The positional accuracy of Google Earth for both horizontal and vertical cases was evaluated. The acquired horizontal RMSE of Google Earth was found fit to produce a class-1 map of having 1:20000 scale as recommended by ASPRS-1990. Unlike for horizontal case, the computed RMSE for vertical positional accuracy of Google Earth was not found fit for preparing class-1 map. However, making correlations between field survey and GE can provide 95% fitness, and also, subtracting the acquired RMSE for the vertical case from the original Google Earth elevation data can provide a 90% fitness for preparing class-I map as well.

AB  - We apply a Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis technique on CHAMP satellite data recorded over southern Africa between 2007.0 and 2009.0 epochs, and develop a Southern African Lithospheric Magnetic Model (SALMM) at satellite altitude. The comparative evaluation of the SALMM with the global model MF7 shows a good agreement in the Y and Z field components that are not much contaminated by external field contributions. We use the Z lithospheric field map to confirm the prominent long-wavelength anomalies over the southern African region and its surrounding ocean areas, discussing the underlying geological and tectonic structures of the identified crustal anomalies.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node fingerprinting
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. When locating the sentinel lymph node (SLN), surgeons use state-of-the-art imaging devices, such as a 1D gamma probe or less widely spread a 2D gamma camera. These devices project the 3D subspace onto a 1D respectively 2D space, hence loosing accuracy and the depth of the SLN which is very important, especially in the head and neck area with many critical structures in close vicinity. Recent methods which use a multi-pinhole collimator and a single gamma detector image try to gain a depth estimation of the SLN. The low intensity of the sources together with the computational cost of the optimization process make the reconstruction in real-time, however, very challenging.Results. In this paper, we use an optimal design approach to improve the classical pinhole design, resulting in a non-symmetric distribution of the pinholes of the collimator. This new design shows a great improvement of the accuracy when reconstructing the position and depth of the radioactive tracer. Then, we introduce our Sentinel lymph node fingerprinting (SLNF) algorithm, inspired by MR-fingerprinting, for fast and accurate reconstruction of the tracer distribution in 3D space using a single gamma detector image. As a further advantage, the method requires no pre-processing, i.e. filtering of the detector image. The method is very stable in its performance even for low exposure times. In our ex vivo experiments, we successfully located multiple Technetium 99m (Tc-99m) sources with an exposure time of only one second and still, with a very small L-2-error.Conclusion. These promising results under short exposure time are very encouraging for SLN biopsy. Although, this device has not been tested on patients yet, we believe: that this approach will give the surgeon accurate 3D positions of the SLN and hence, can potentially reduce the trauma for the patient.

The increase in temperature and changes in rainfall pattern may negatively affect their extent and condition, and thus the process of carbon accumulation in wetlands. The introduction of the Sentinel series (S1 and S2) and WorldView space-borne sensors (WV3) have enabled monitoring of herbaceous above ground biomass (AGB) in small and narrow wetlands in semi-arid areas. The objective of this study was to assess (i) the capabilities of the high to moderate resolution sensors such as WV3, S1A and S2A in estimating herbaceous AGB of vegetated wetlands using SAR backscatter, optical reflectance bands, vegetation spectral indices (including Leaf Area Index or LAI measurements) and band ratio datasets and (ii) whether significant differences exists between the AGB ranges of wetland and surrounding dryland vegetation. A bootstrapped Random Forest modelling approach, with variable importance selection, was utilised which incorporated ground collected grass AGB for model calibration and validation. WorldView-3 (WV3) yielded the highest AGB prediction accuracies (R-2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 169.28 g/m(2)) regardless of the incorporation of bands only, indices only or the combination of bands and indices. In general, the optical sensors yielded higher modelling accuracies (improvement in R-2 of 0.04-0.07 and RMSE of 11.48-17.28 g/m(2)) than the single Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor but this was marginal depending on the scenario. Incorporating Sentinel 1A (S1) dual polarisation channels and Sentinel 2A (S2) reflectance bands, in particular, yielded higher accuracies (improvement in R-2 of 0.03-0.04 and RMSE of 5.4-16.88 g/m(2)) than the use of individual sensors alone and was also equivalent to the performance of the high resolution WV3 sensor results. Wetlands had significantly higher AGB compared to the surrounding terrestrial grassland (with a mean of about 80 g/m(2) more). Monitoring herbaceous AGB at the scale of the wetland extent in semi-arid to arid grasslands enables improved understanding of their carbon sequestration potential, the contributions to global carbon accounting policies and also serving as a proxy for functional intactness.

TI  - Rotavirus vaccine impact assessment surveillance in India: protocol and methods
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Rotavirus infection accounts for 39% of under-five diarrhoeal deaths globally and 22% of these deaths occur in India. Introduction of rotavirus vaccine in a national immunisation programme is considered to be the most effective intervention in preventing severe rotavirus disease. In 2016, India introduced an indigenous rotavirus vaccine (Rotavac) into the Universal Immunisation Programme in a phased manner. This paper describes the protocol for surveillance to monitor the performance of rotavirus vaccine following its introduction into the routine childhood immunisation programme.Methods An active surveillance system was established to identify acute gastroenteritis cases among children less than 5 years of age. For all children enrolled at sentinel sites, case reporting forms are completed and a copy of vaccination record and a stool specimen obtained. The forms and specimens are sent to the referral laboratory for data entry, analysis, testing and storage. Data from sentinel sites in states that have introduced rotavirus vaccine into their routine immunisation schedule will be used to determine rotavirus vaccine impact and effectiveness.Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, and all the site institutional ethics committees approved the project. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and with stakeholders of the universal immunisation programme in India.

TI  - Sentinel Nodes Detection with Near-infrared Imaging in Gynecological Cancer Patients: Ushering in an Era of Precision Medicine
T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure is a well-known method for identifying solid tumors such as breast cancer, vulvar cancer, and melanoma. In endometrial and cervical cancer, SLN has recently gained acceptance.Objectives: To evaluate the detection rate of SLN with an indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescent imaging (ICG/NIR) integrated laparoscopic system in clinically uterine-confined endometrial or cervical cancer.Methods: Patients with clinically early-stage endometrial or cervical cancer were included in this retrospective study. ICG was injected into the uterine cervix and an ICG/NIR integrated laparoscopic system was used during the surgeries. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) protocol was followed. SLN and/or suspicious lymph nodes were resected. Side-specific lymphadenectomy was performed when mapping was unsuccessful. Systematic lymphadenectomy was completed in patients with high-grade histology or deep myometrial invasion. Enhanced pathology using ultra-staging and immunohistochemistry were performed in all cases.Results: We analyzed 46 eligible patients: 39 endometrial and 7 cervical cancers. Of these, 44 had at least one SLN (93.6%). In 41 patients (89%) we detected bilateral SLN, in 3 (7%) only unilateral, and in 2 (4%) none were detected. Seven patients presented with lymph node metastasis. All were detected by NCCN/SLN protocol. Of these cases, two were detected with only pathological ultra-staging.Conclusions: SLN mapping in endometrial and cervical cancer can easily be performed with a high detection rate by integrating ICG/NIR into a conventional laparoscopic system. Precision medicine in patients evaluated by SLN biopsy changes the way patients with endometrial or cervical cancer are managed.

TI  - Estimation of sediment settling velocity in estuarine and coastal waters using optical remote sensing data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust method has been developed for estimating sediment settling velocity (w(s)) from high resolution optical remote sensing data in estuarine, coastal and harbor waters. This method estimates settling velocity as a function of the drag coefficient (C-d), Reynolds number (Re), grain size (D-50), specific gravity (Delta(SG)) and grain shape (in terms of the Corey Shape Factor - CSF). These parameters were derived from the particulate inherent optical properties such as backscattering (b(bp)), beam attenuation (c(p)), suspended sediment concentration and turbidity using Landsat 8 OLI and HICO data. Preliminary results for the Gulf of Cambay in the eastern Arabian Sea and Yangtze river estuary in the East China Sea, showed that satellite-retrieved settling velocities (m s(-1)) varied from very low values in clear oceanic waters, intermediate values in coastal waters, to very high values in river plumes and sediment-laden coastal waters. The remote sensing retrievals of sediment properties and their settling velocities were generally consistent with the field and laboratory results, which indicate that the proposed methodology will have important implications in various coastal engineering, environmental and management studies.

TI  - DIVINE IMMUTABILITY PERFECTION OR FLAW?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Process theology stands in contrast to classical theism in its conception of God and the divine attributes. The crucial point in this confrontation is their way of interpreting 'divine perfection' (actus purus). The major point of disagreement - which is also the cornerstone in process theological worldview and is also the root of their different viewpoints in regard to all the divine attributes - is the idea of 'process'. From this element of 'process' the idea of the 'divine mutability' is born. Therefore, one of the major differences between traditional/classical theology and process theology is the idea of divine immutability. In the Islamic tradition, too, this attribute has been very much highlighted. In this contribution I seek to criticize the doctrine of divine mutability, based on the Islamic tradition and from the Islamic speculative perspective. To achieve this goal, after having discussed the major divine attributes in process theology, then in the second part, I will explore and criticize from an Islamic perspective process theology's conception of divine mutability. And finally and in the third part, I will critically study some of the main teachings of process theology.

TI  - Land use change modeling through an integrated Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain analysis (case study: Arasbaran region, Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal land use/land cover (LULC) change information provides a variety of applications for informed management of land resources. The aim of this study was to detect and predict LULC changes in the Arasbaran region using an integrated Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain analysis. At the first step, multi-temporal Landsat images (1990, 2002 and 2014) were processed using ancillary data and were classified into seven LULC categories of high density forest, low-density forest, agriculture, grassland, barren land, water and urban area. Next, LULC changes were detected for three time profiles, 1990-2002, 2002-2014 and 1990-2014. A 2014 LULC map of the study area was further simulated (for model performance evaluation) applying 1990 and 2002 map layers. In addition, a collection of spatial variables was also used for modeling LULC change processes as driving forces. The actual and simulated 2014 LULC change maps were cross-tabulated and compared to ensure model simulation success and the results indicated an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 97.79% and 0.992, respectively. Having the model properly validated, LULC change was predicted up to the year 2025. The results demonstrated that 992 and 1592 ha of high and low-density forests were degraded during 1990-2014, respectively, while 422 ha were added to the extent of residential areas with a growth rate of 17.58 ha per year. The developed model predicted a considerable degradation trend for the forest categories through 2025, accounting for 489 and 531 ha of loss for high and low-density forests, respectively. By way of contrast, residential area and farmland categories will increase up to 211 and 427 ha, respectively. The integrated prediction model and customary area data can be used for practical management efforts by simulating vegetation dynamics and future LULC change trajectories.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Tattooing and Targeted Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer Patients Who Presented as cN plus Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Became cN0 After Treatment
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node tattooing and targeted axillary dissection, as axillary staging, was evaluated in 75 breast cancer patients who presented as cN+ before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and became cN0 after treatment. Marking axillary lymph nodes with tattoo is a feasible, accurate, and low-cost method. Tattoo ink migration from one node to another might affect the objectivity of the procedure.Introduction: Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is an alternative to axillary dissection for breast cancer patients who presented as cN before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and became cN0 after treatment. TAD is defined as the removal of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) along with the pre-NAC marked positive nodes. Tattooing is an option to mark positive nodes. In this study we aimed to investigate the identification rate of tattooed nodes during surgery, correspondence between tattooed nodes and SLNs, and difficulties and pitfalls of the method.Patients and Methods: In 75 patients who were cN+, with axillary lymph nodes known to have or suspected to have disease were tattooed preNAC with a sterile carbon suspension (Spot). After NAC completion all patients became cN0 and underwent TAD as an axillary staging procedure.Results: SLNs were identified successfully in 70 of 75 patients (93.3%). All tattooed nodes were identified successfully intraoperatively in 71 of 75 patients (94.6%). Retrieval of all tattooed nodes in surgical specimens was achieved in 74 patients (98.6%). Correspondence between tattooed nodes and SLNs was observed in 53 of 70 patients (75.3%). In 34 patients (45.3%) the number of pigmented nodes in pathological examination was greater than the number of initially tattooed nodes, indicating the possibility of tattoo ink migration.Conclusion: Tattoo of axillary lymph nodes is a feasible, accurate, and low-cost method of positive node marking pre-NAC. Pathological confirmation of black pigment in the lymph nodes excised is not by itself warranty of retrieval of all marked node because of tattoo ink migration from one node to another. Intraoperative identification using visual inspection is essential. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term outcomes among injured older adults transported by emergency medical services
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/Objective: Little is known about the long-term outcomes of injured older adults cared for in trauma systems. We sought to describe mortality and causes of death over time, and the independent association of injury severity, comorbidities, and other factors on 12-month mortality among injured older adults transported by emergency medical services (EMS).Materials and Methods: This was a population-based cohort study of injured adults >= 65 years in the United States transported by 44 EMS agencies to 51 hospitals from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, with 12-month follow-up through December 31, 2012. The primary outcomes were time to death and causes of death. We used descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards models to generate adjusted hazard ratios (HR).Results: 15,649 injured older adults were transported by EMS, frequently after a fall (84.5%). Serious injuries (Injury Severity Score [ISSI >= 16) occurred in 3.5%, with serious extremity injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale score >= 3) being most common (17.8%). Mortality rates were: 1.6% in-hospital, 5.1% at 30 days, 9.4% at 90 days and 20.3% at 1 year. The adjusted HR for patients in the highest comorbidity quartile was 2.20 (versus lowest quartile, 95% CI 1.97-2.46, p < .001), while the HR for ISS >= 25 was 2.69 (versus ISS 0-8, 95% CI 1.60-4.51, p= .001). Cardiovascular etiologies (53.3%) and dementia (32.7%) were the most common causes of death, with injury listed in 12.8% of death certificates.Conclusions: Injury requiring EMS transport is a sentinel event among older adults, with death typically occurring months later, often due to cardiovascular causes and dementia. A heavy comorbidity burden had an adjusted mortality risk comparable to severe injury. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - HAU: GIVING VOICES TO THE ANCESTORS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gift exchange within Maori society, underpinned by the notion of hau, is a favoured topic for anthropological research. Hau has become an international phenomenon due to its potential relevance to understanding gift economies in many non-monetary societies worldwide. However, the desire in anthropological and socioeconomic analyses to constantly redefine the concept of hau within the narrow context of gift exchange has led to a separation of hau as the life force from its Maori philosophical base and, moreover, to a separation of Maori from the philosophy of hau. This article attempts to provide an expansive, culturally grounded account of hau by bringing Maori voices to the forefront of this international discussion. The voices of Maori ancestors are privileged and kept alive through the oral literature of respected Maori leaders. Highlighted here is the dynamic interaction of hau with other life forces, and its interwoven philosophy that is nuanced according to a cosmological, spiritual and genealogically based worldview.

TI  - Sentinel node navigation surgery in cervical and endometrial cancer: a review
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Pelvic lymphadenectomy is generally performed to treat early-stage cervical cancer, and pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy is performed in patients with endometrial cancer confined to the uterus. However, systematic lymphadenectomy is frequently associated with sequelae including lymphocele, lymphedema and cellulitis. The sentinel lymph node concept has been recently applied in the management of patients with gynecological cancer, with the goal of avoiding systematic lymphadenectomy and its associated postoperative complications. In this review, we examine and summarize the recently expanding body of literature and discuss sentinel lymph node navigation during surgery in patients with cervical and endometrial cancer. Current data suggest that sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) appears to be feasible for detecting lymph node metastasis compared with systematic lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage cervical or endometrial cancer. The non-inferiority of long-term prognosis through omission of systematic lymphadenectomy has not been proven by randomized trial, but SNNS decreases lymphatic complications related to systematic lymphadenectomy. Further studies are needed to clarify the necessity of additional systematic lymphadenectomy and/or adjuvant therapy in cases with isolated tumor cells or micrometastasis in SLNs.

TI  - Spatial early warning signals for impending regime shifts: A practical framework for application in real-world landscapes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Prediction of ecosystem response to global environmental change is a pressing scientific challenge of major societal relevance. Many ecosystems display nonlinear responses to environmental change, and may even undergo practically irreversible 'regime shifts' that initiate ecosystem collapse. Recently, early warning signals based on spatiotemporal metrics have been proposed for the identification of impending regime shifts. The rapidly increasing availability of remotely sensed data provides excellent opportunities to apply such model-based spatial early warning signals in the real world, to assess ecosystem resilience and identify impending regime shifts induced by global change. Such information would allow land-managers and policy makers to interfere and avoid catastrophic shifts, but also to induce regime shifts that move ecosystems to a desired state. Here, we show that the application of spatial early warning signals in real-world landscapes presents unique and unexpected challenges, and may result in misleading conclusions when employed without careful consideration of the spatial data and processes at hand. We identify key practical and theoretical issues and provide guidelines for applying spatial early warning signals in heterogeneous, real-world landscapes based on literature review and examples from real-world data. Major identified issues include (1) spatial heterogeneity in real-world landscapes may enhance reversibility of regime shifts and boost landscape-level resilience to environmental change (2) ecosystem states are often difficult to define, while these definitions have great impact on spatial early warning signals and (3) spatial environmental variability and socio-economic factors may affect spatial patterns, spatial early warning signals and associated regime shift predictions. We propose a novel framework, shifting from an ecosystem perspective towards a landscape approach. The framework can be used to identify conditions under which resilience assessment with spatial remotely sensed data may be successful, to support well-informed application of spatial early warning signals, and to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global environmental change.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) simulation models are helpful tools for decision makers because of their capacity of predicting the landscape dynamics under various scenarios and thereby developing countermeasures. Developing LUCC models with high reliability still remains challenging due to complicated influencing of natural and anthropogenic factors. An adding/deleting approach is proposed in this study to explore whether and to what extent it can improve the accuracy of a hybrid LUCC model involved with cellular automata, Markov chain, and artificial neural network in the Qeshm Island, the biggest island in the Persian Gulf. The accuracy assessment was conducted by comparing the simulation results obtained from the models with the maps derived from Landsat image in 2014. The results revealed that the adding/deleting approach could improve the prediction accuracy of the model for the majority of land use classes as the area of the correctly predicted classes increased to 7.2km(2), which is greater than 6.09km(2) without using the approach. We further compared the results derived from the proposed approach with those from cellular automata-Markov chain-artificial neural network, Markov chain-artificial neural network, and cellular automata-Markov chain-logistic regression, resulting in the Figure of Merit index of 7.8 with this approach, compared to 6.7, 5.1, and 4.5 with the other three models mentioned above. This study demonstrates that the proposed approach is effective for improving the performance of LUCC modeling.

TI  - Socio-hydrology of "artificial glaciers" in Ladakh, India: assessing adaptive strategies in a changing cryosphere
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of even small glacier decrease and changes of seasonal snow cover are critical for the functioning of meltwater-dependent mountain agriculture. In order to deal with recurrent water scarcity, different types of ice reservoirs, commonly called artificial glaciers, have been introduced in Ladakh and promoted as appropriate adaptive strategies to cope with changes in the cryosphere. The resulting seasonal ice reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of water scarcity in spring. We examine the efficacy of 14 ice reservoirs through a long-term analysis of their functioning within the environmental and socioeconomic context of Ladakh. Using multi-temporal satellite data (1969-2017), close range photogrammetry, and repeat field measurements (2014 and 2015), we provide an inventory and typology of these ice reservoirs and estimate storage volume of one selected structure, which ranges from 1010 to 3220m(3) of water. We extrapolate this volume to all ice reservoirs and estimate potential irrigation cycles of cropped areas, which vary between less than 0.1 in unfavorable cases and almost 3 in optimal cases and years. Based on interviews and field surveys (2007-2017), we discuss the benefits perceived by local smallholders, such as the reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting crop failure risks together with the possibility of growing cash crops. We argue that artificial glaciers are remarkably suited to the physical environment. However, their usefulness as a climate change adaptation strategy is questionable because climatic variability, natural hazards, and an incomplete integration into the local socioeconomic setting significantly reduce their efficacy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Recently, following import by travel and migration, epidemic community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has caused nosocomial outbreaks in Europe, sometimes with a fatal outcome. We describe clinico-epidemiological characteristics of CA-MRSA detected by the European Network for the Surveillance of imported S. aureus (www.staphtrav.eu) from May 2011 to November 2016.Methods: Sentinel surveillance at 13 travel clinics enrolling patients with travel-associated skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) and analysing lesion and nose swabs at one central laboratory.Results: A total of 564 independent case-patients with SSTI were enrolled and had 374 (67%) S. aureus-positive lesions, of which 14% (51/374) were MRSA. The majority of CA-MRSA isolates from SSTI were Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-positive (43/51, 84%). The risk of methicillin-resistance in imported S. aureus varied by travel region (p<0.001) and was highest in Latin America (16/57, 28%, 95% CI 17.0-41.5) and lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa (4/121, 3%, 95% CI 0.9-8.3). Major epidemic clones (USA300/USA300 Latin-American Variant, Bengal Bay, South Pacific) accounted for more than one-third (19/51, 37%) of CA-MRSA imports. CAMRSA SSTI in returneeswas complicated (31/51 multiple lesions, 61%; 22/50 recurrences, 44%), led to healthcare contact (22/51 surgical drainage, 43%; 7/50 hospitalization, 14%), was transmissible (13/47 reported similar SSTI in non-travelling contacts, 28%), and associated with S. aureus nasal colonization (28 of 51 CAMRSA cases, 55%; 24 of 28 colonized with identical spa-type in nose and lesion, 85%).Conclusions: Travel-associated CA-MRSA SSTI is a transmissible condition that leads to medical consultations and colonization of the infected host.

TI  - The Valuable Potential of the History of Learning Turcisms in Russian Language
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of words of Turkic origin as a means of shaping students' value attitude to the vocabulary of the Russian language, educating students of the aesthetic perception of words-Turcisms. According to the authors of the study, the borrowed words from the Turkic language culture form a significant layer of the vocabulary of the modem Russian language, allowing to realize the formation of the value potential of the students' personality. Turkic words form the value potential of a person in case that they are included in the structure of a person's worldview and are brought into use. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to study various words of the Turkic origin, in which the history of our people is reflected in different eras. Thus, the authors of the article examine in detail various groups of Turkic borrowings. In addition, the scientific article presents an analysis of the dictionaries of Turcisms in the Russian language, which allows us to trace the phonetic, morphological, lexico-semantic changes that Turcisms was undergone changes during the transition to Russian. From the linguistic and methodological point of view, according to the authors of the study, the study of vocabulary of Turkic origin expands the vocabulary of students; develops communicative and linguistic and cultural competence of students, the formation of the value potential of the individual students. The study of borrowed words from the Turkic language culture allows the teacher to reinforce students' knowledge of the Russian language vocabulary, to expand the vocabulary of students; contributes to the development of their speech, logical thinking; instills love for the Russian language; arouses interest in its study.

TI  - Academic identity, confidence and belonging: The role of contextualised admissions and foundation years in higher education
T2  - BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a cross-national exploration of responses to widening participation (WP), with a specific focus on the provision of foundation year (FY) programmes and the use of contextualised admissions (CA) in selective Irish and UK institutions. There remains a dearth of research on these routes, with little understanding of the characteristics of students who utilise them, of why students use these routes and little knowledge of their effect on students' experiences in university and their overall sense of belonging. A year-long longitudinal comparative case study design examined three alternative entry routes in two selective higher education institutions (HEIs) in England and Ireland: a well-established FY; a newly formed FY; and a CA pathway. Data were collected through a mixed-method approach. Questionnaires and in-depth focus groups were employed at fixed points with participating students in each route. Results indicated that FY students had lower levels of familial educational history and parental occupation. FY students' sense of belonging significantly increased over the year, with students reporting increased confidence and sense of belonging due to the relationships established during the FY. CA students' sense of belonging remained the same, with students reporting feeling different and isolated. Results indicate that while students utilising FYs may be 'more disadvantaged' than CA students, their experiences helped establish a sense of belonging; illustrating the need for diverse WP routes catering to a wide range of needs. Results highlight the importance of providing opportunities to develop social and bridging social capital for all non-traditional students.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis Method for Spectral Band Adjustment between Hyperspectral Sensors: A Case Study Using the CLARREO Pathfinder and HISUI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Space Station has become the platform for deploying hyperspectral sensors covering the solar reflective spectral range for earth observation. Intercalibration of hyperspectral sensors plays a crucial role in evaluating/improving radiometric consistency. When intercalibrating between hyperspectral sensors, spectral band adjustment is required to mitigate the effects of differences between the relative spectral responses (RSRs) of the sensors. Errors in spectral parameters used in spectral band adjustment are propagated through to the adjustment results. The present study analytically approximated the uncertainty in the spectral band adjustment for evaluating the relative contributions of uncertainties in parameters associated with the exo-atmosphere, atmosphere, and surface to the total uncertainty. Numerical simulations using the derived equations were conducted to perform a sensitivity analysis for the case of the spectral band adjustment between the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) Pathfinder (CPF) and the Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI). The results show that the effects of errors in the solar irradiance were greater than those of other sources of error, indicating that accurate estimates of atmospheric reflectances and tranismittances are not needed for spectral band adjustment between CPF and HISUI in the atmospheric windows. The accuracy of the analytical approximation was also evaluated in the simulations. The framework of the sensitivity analysis is applicable to other pairs of hyperspectral sensors.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-3 Imagery to Monitor Cyanobacterial Blooms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) have been a concern for aquatic systems, especially those used for water supply and recreation. Thus, the monitoring of CHABs is essential for the establishment of water governance policies. Recently, remote sensing has been used as a tool to monitor CHABs worldwide. Remote monitoring of CHABs relies on the optical properties of pigments, especially the phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a). The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of recent launch the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify PC and chl-a. To do this, OLCI images were collected over the Western part of Lake Erie (U.S.A.) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. When comparing the use of traditional remote sensing algorithms to estimate PC and chl-a, none was able to accurately estimate both pigments. However, when single and band ratios were used to estimate these pigments, stronger correlations were found. These results indicate that spectral band selection should be re-evaluated for the development of new algorithms for OLCI images. Overall, Sentinel 3/OLCI has the potential to be used to identify PC and chl-a. However, algorithm development is needed.

TI  - Socio-hydrological drivers of agricultural water use in small reservoirs
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of small reservoirs built across semi-arid areas present a potential to support agricultural livelihoods of rural smallholders. The scale and geographical dispersion of these multiple lakes restrict the understanding of these coupled human-water systems and the identification of adequate strategies to support riparian farmers. This research developed a multi-scalar interdisciplinary approach to characterise the hydrological and wider drivers of agricultural water use around multiple small reservoirs in semi-arid central Tunisia. The combination of field surveys, quantitative questionnaires and qualitative, semi-structured interviews confirmed minimal withdrawals, but highlighted the diversification of practices, the rise in fruit farming and peripheral benefits generated here by the development of 56 lakes. 48% of lakes provide residual benefits for the occasional watering of on average 300 fruit trees and support to downstream wells exploited for irrigation. A further 13 lakes (23%) provide high levels of benefits (900 fruit trees each), albeit with low equity, supporting essentially established farmers. The analysis of surface water assessments every 8 days from Landsat 5-8 imagery over 1999-2014, provides unprecedented insights into the significant water scarcity and unreliability that impedes agricultural intensification on 86% of small lakes. Limited storage capacities and prolonged droughts highlight the need for small reservoirs in this climatic context to retain a supplementary irrigation objective and not strive to support widespread intensification of irrigated practices. Many farmers lack the capabilities to increase their withdrawals and suffer physical and economic water access difficulties, mismanagement, compounded through limited and short-term government assistance. Individual successes resulted from farmers' economic resilience and means to secure alternate water supplies during dry spells.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) models for potential R. philippinarum habitat mapping in the Geunso Bay, Korea. R. philippinarum samples were collected during field observation. Remote sensing data were used to identify the factors controlling the distribution of R. philippinarum. Habitat potential maps were constructed and eight controlling factors were generated from satellite imagery, namely elevation of intertidal zone, aspect, exposure time, slope, density of tidal channel, distance from tidal channel, surface-sediment distribution, and near-infrared reflectance (NIR). Validation of the maps was conducted by comparison with surveyed habitat locations. Performance of the SVM model (AUC=0.777) is better compared with NB model (0.733). The GIS-based SVM and NB models combined with remote sensing techniques are efficient tools for mapping potential R. philippinarum habitat in tidal flats.

AB  - PurposeSeveral recent studies have evaluated the feasibility of the sentinel node (SN) concept for gastric cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate limited gastrectomy with SN basin dissection in SN navigation surgery (SNNS) for patients with early-gastric cancer located in the upper-third of the stomach.Methods147 patients received SNNS for early-gastric cancer at our institution. Of these, 26 patients diagnosed with early-gastric cancer<4cm in size and located in the upper-third of the stomach were retrospectively analyzed for the distribution of SN and SN basins.ResultsIn three of the 26 patients, lymph node metastasis was limited to the left gastric artery (LGA) basin. The breakdown of the basins were as follows: A single LGA basin, 19 cases; a non-single LGA basin, seven cases. A non-single LGA basin was significantly associated with the clinicopathological factors, such as tumor spread to the middle-third of the stomach, tumor location at the center of the greater curvature, and undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, compared to the single LGA basin group.ConclusionsOur data revealed that the distribution of the SN basins in early-gastric cancer measuring less than 4cm in size and located in the upper-third of the stomach was significantly correlated with tumor spread, tumor location, and the pathological findings.

TI  - EFFECT OF THE TRAINING AREAS AND TREE METHOD FOR CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IN PRIMARY FORESTS OF <i>Araucaria</i> AND <i>Nothofagus</i> IN THE SOUTH OF CHILE: USE OF LANDSAT DATA AND AUXILIARY INFORMATION
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Much effort is being made around the world to classify the native forest so as to better know its composition, structure and distribution in order to exercise a better management over them. The Araucaria araucana forests have ecologic relevance because they are millenary and its distribution in Chile and Argentina is quite reduced, which justifies the execution of the present investigation. This study proposes as its objective to classify at fine and medium scales the Araucaria and Nothofagus ecosystems of the south of Chile. To do this, remote sensors were used, applying a biunivocal-combined classification and the tree method, obtaining a detailed description. Auxiliary information used was: cartography of the Conguillio National Park, Digital Elevation Model and Vegetation Indexes. Also, Lansat-8 OLI Images from 2013, with spatial resolution of 30x30m, were used. Two hundred and sixty forestry inventory plots were carried out and the data were analyzed with the Idrisi Kilimanjaro, ArcGis 8.0 and SPSS programmes. The categories obtained from this supervised classification were 23, which had 75.0% of global accuracy. The accuracy for forests was 74.6%, for grass and bushes 80.5%, for soil with scarce vegetation 84.95%, for snow 95,1%, for volcanic lava 73.3%, and for water was 73.0%. Thus, the Araucaria and Nothofagus ecosystems were classified using this joined application of biunivoca-combined method and the tree method. This was done at a fine and medium scales. The ,final map allows to carry out a much better management of these ecosystems.

TI  - Climate Change, Land Use/Land Cover Change, and Population Growth as Drivers of Groundwater Depletion in the Central Valleys, Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater depletion is an important problem driven by population growth, land use and land cover (LULC) change, climate change, and other factors. Groundwater depletion generates water stress and encourages unstainable resource use. The aim of this study is to determine how population growth, LULC change, and climate change relate to groundwater depletion in the Alto Atoyac sub-basin, Oaxaca, Mexico. Twenty-five years of dry season water table data from 1984 to 2009 are analyzed to examine annual groundwater depletion. Kriging is used to interpolate the region's groundwater levels in a geographic information system (GIS) from mapped point measurements. An analysis of remotely sensed data revealed patterns of LULC change during a 34-year (1986-2018) period, using a supervised, machine-learning classification algorithm to calculate the changes in LULC. This analysis is shown to have an 85% accuracy. A global circulation model (GFDL-CM3) and the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were used to estimate the effects of climate change on the region's groundwater. Estimates of evapotranspiration (using HELP3.5 code) and runoff (USDA-SCS-CN), were calculated. Since 1984, the region's mean annual temperature has increased 1.79 degrees C and urban areas have increased at a rate of 2.3 km(2)/year. Population growth has increased water consumption by 97.93 x 10(6) m(3)/year. The volume of groundwater is shrinking at a rate of 284.34 x 10(6) m(3)/year, reflecting the extreme pressure on groundwater supply in the region. This research reveals the nature of the direct impacts that climate change, changing LULCs, and population growth have in the process of groundwater depletion.

TI  - THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN LATIN AMERICA: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CUBAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election without a clearly articulated policy for either Cuba or the Latin American/Caribbean region as a whole. Two years into that presidency, this article seeks to describe that policy and place it within Trump's wider foreign policy. The article deconstructs the worldview of 'America First' as lying within the perspective of the neo-conservative wing of the Republican Party, epitomised by John Bolton, the current National Security Advisor. The implications of that worldview for Cuba and Latin America make for a reversal of Obama's opening to Cuba, a hardline on immigration from Mexico and Central America, and greater pressure for regime change in both Venezuela and Nicaragua. Also analysed is the resonance of Trump's policies with the recent turn to the political right in Latin America, notably in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Colombia.

TI  - Multi-Index Image Differencing Method (MINDED) for Flood Extent Estimations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data are often used to extract water surfaces related to extreme events like floods. This study presents the Multi INDEx Differencing (MINDED) method, an innovative procedure to estimate flood extents, aiming at improving the robustness of single water-related indices and threshold-based approaches. MINDED consists of a change detection approach integrating specific sensitivities of several indices. Moreover, the method also allows to quantify the uncertainty of the Overall flood map, based on both the agreement level of the stack of classifications and the weight of every index obtained from the literature. Assuming the lack of ground truths to be the most common condition in flood mapping, MINDED also integrates a procedure to reduce the subjectivity of thresholds extraction focused on the analysis of water-related indices frequency distribution. The results of the MINDED application to a case study using Landsat images are compared with an alternative change detection method using Sentinel-1A data, and demonstrate consistency with local fluvial flood records.

TI  - Evaluating visible derivative spectroscopy by varimax-rotated, principal component analysis of aerial hyperspectral images from the western basin of Lake Erie
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kent State University (KSU) spectral decomposition method provides information about the spectral signals present in multispectral and hyperspectral images. Pre-processing steps that enhance signal to noise ratio (SNR) by 737-19.04 times, enables extraction of the environmental signals captured by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center's, second generation, Hyperspectral imager (HSI2) into multiple, independent components. We have accomplished this by pre-processing of Level l HSI2 data to remove stripes from the scene, followed by a combination of spectral and spatial smoothing to further increase the SNR and remove non-Lambertian features, such as waves. On average, the residual stochastic noise removed from the HSI2 images by this method is 5.43 +/- 1.42%. The method also enables removal of a spectrally coherent residual atmospheric bias of 4.28 +/- 0.48%, ascribed to incomplete atmospheric correction. The total noise isolated from signal by the method is thus <+/- 7% based on analysis of multiple swaths. The method is essentially independent of the order of operations, extracting the same spectral components within error in all cases, spatial patterns that are very similar and explaining nearly identical amounts of information from each image. Based on comparison between multiple swaths the uncertainty in the variance associated with each component averages +/- 1.69% and is as low as +/- 0.08% and in all cases <+/- 3.15%.

TI  - First detection of TBE virus in ticks and sero-reactivity in goats in a non-endemic region in the southern part of Switzerland (Canton of Ticino)
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Switzerland, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a notifiable human disease with an average of 210 cases per year in the last 10 years (2008-2017). A national surveillance conducted in 2009 reported a prevalence of 0.46% for tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) detected in ticks, which is in accordance with the prevalences found in Europe from 0.1%-5%. The Canton of Ticino in the southern part of Switzerland, geographically separated from the rest of the national territory by the Alps, is considered a non-endemic region, as no autochthonous clinical cases and no TBEV presence in ticks have ever been reported. In order to understand the epidemiological situation in Ticino, we conducted a large study investigating the TBEV presence in field-collected Ixodes ricinus ticks and in goat and human sera. Goats and sheep were considered as sentinel hosts showing persistence of antibodies also after 28 months in the absence of symptoms; this longevity supports the data validity to characterize an area with the TBEV status. The goat sera collection was composed of a total of 662 samples from 37 flocks. The total seroprevalence was 14.6%. 39 (40%) of the 97 SNT-positive samples showed an antibody titer >= 1:120 which indicates recent infection and consequently the probable presence of active foci among the pastures frequented by the goats belonging to 10 flocks. In total, 51 owners participated in the study and all were TBEV antibody-free.A total of 12'052 I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) were collected and 1'371 pools were tested using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Only one positive pool was reported with a prevalence of 0.35%. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the TBEV strain isolated from the ticks collected in Ticino is closely related to 2 strains coming from the Canton of Valais (99.1% and 98.7% identity, respectively), a neighbouring region of the Canton of Ticino. These two Cantons are close together but separated by high mountains (Alps) and we hypothesize that infected ticks were transported by wild animals from Valais into the Valle Maggia in Ticino where we found positive ticks. In conclusion, our data show for the first time the presence of TBEV in ticks and the related sero-reactivity in goats, confirming the presence of TBEV in the environment of the Canton of Ticino. Further surveillance studies will have to be conducted to follow the persistence of TBEV in this region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Electricity Consumption in China
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) provide information on nighttime luminosity, a correlation of built environment and energy consumption. This research intends to estimate spatial distribution of electricity consumption (EC) in mainland China, and analyze the temporal and spatial change of electricity consumption during 2000-2012. Nighttime light vegetation index (NVI), ratio nighttime light vegetation index (RNVI), difference nighttime light vegetation index (DNVI), normalized difference nighttime light vegetation index (NDNVI), soil adjusted nighttime light vegetation index (SANVI), and modified difference nighttime light vegetation index (MDNVI) were used to compensate for shortages in DMSP/OLS data. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI products, China GIS database, and socioeconomic statistical data were also considered. An EC estimation model was used to obtain EC during 2000-2012. We divided EC into four ratings and analyzed spatiotemporal patterns using exploratory spatial data analysis tools (e.g., Moran's I and local indicators of spatial association-LISA statistics). Then we built a linear regression model of EC, and correlated with DMSP/OLS data to produce China's EC spatially. We used mean relative error (MRE) to compare our results and related research outcomes. Our result showed lower MRE, i.e., superior accuracy. EC grew quickly in China from 2000 to 2012 increasing from 6.79 to 14.82M kWh. Generating capacity and EC of 32 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have a strong spatial correlation. The proposed index combines information from DMSP/OLS NTL data and MODIS NDVI data for more detailed characterization of nighttime luminosity, and reduced NTL saturation. The index simplicity enables rapid characterization and monitoring of EC.

TI  - Does Ownership Structure Affect Firm Performance in an Emerging Market? The Case of India
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Manuscript type: Research paperResearch aim: This study aims to examine the impact of ownership structure (ownership concentration and identities) on the financial and market performance of Indian listed firms, post the US financial crisis 2008.Design/Methodology/Approach: This study is based on a six-year financial dataset of 100 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed firms, from FY 2009-10 to FY 2014-15. The study applies the static panel data model (pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect) and the dynamic panel data model (two-step generalised method of moments) for the hypotheses testing.Research findings: This study finds that in the case of ownership concentration, large owners have no link with the financial performance. However, they have an adverse impact on the market performance. The presence of promoters, domestic institutions and foreign institutions appears to boost the financial performance, whereas the foreign institutional investment seems to enhance the market performance.Theoretical contribution/Originality: The major contributions of this study are the two dimensions of ownership concentration (large owners) and identity (types of owners) being considered as ownership structure, the use of the dynamic panel models to check for the endogeneity issue and the post US financial crisis analysis derived from this study. All of these contribute to the impact of ownership volatility and performance variation in the context of India, thereby making this study a novel one.Policy implications: Policymakers should consider developing more lucrative policies so as to encourage institutional investors to invest in the Indian market. This is because domestic and foreign institutional owners are central to the enhancement of both the corporate financial and market performance. Further, corporate executives should aim to prevent inefficiencies so as to safeguard the interest of large owners.Research implications/Limitations: This study has used ownership structure as one of the essential governance mechanisms. Future research may consider other mechanisms like board structure or CEO duality.

T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on sea ice type is an important factor for deriving sea ice parameters from satellite remote sensing data, such as sea ice concentration, extent and thickness. In this study, sea ice in the Weddell Sea was classified by the histogram threshold (HT) method, the Spreen model (SM) method from satellite scatterometer data and the strong contrast (SC) method from radiometer data, and this information was compared with Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) sea ice-type ship-based observations. The results show that all three methods can distinguish the multi-year (MY) ice and first-year (FY) ice using Ku-band scatterometer data and radiometer data during the ice growth season, while C-band scatterometer data are not suitable for MY ice and FY ice discrimination using HT and SM methods. The SM model has a smaller MY ice classification extent than the HT method from scatterometer data. The classification accuracy of the SM method is the higher compared to ship-based observations. It can be concluded that the SM method is a promising method for discriminating MY ice from FY ice. These results provide a reference for further retrieval of long-term sea ice-type information for the whole of Antarctica.

TI  - Validation of delay-multiply-and-standard-deviation weighting factor for improved photoacoustic imaging of sentinel lymph node
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delay-and-sum (DAS) is one of the most common algorithms used to construct the photoacoustic images due to its low complexity. However, it results in images with high sidelobes and low resolution. Delay-and-standard-deviation (DASD) weighting factor can improve the contrast of the images compared to DAS. However, it still suffers from high sidelobes. In this work, a new weighting factor, named delay-multiply-and-standard-deviation (DMASD) is introduced to enhance the contrast of the reconstructed images compared to other mentioned methods. In the proposed method, the SD of the mutual multiplied delayed signals are calculated, normalized and multiplied to DAS beamformed data. The results show that DMASD improves the signal-to-noise-ratio about 19.29 and 7.3 dB compared to DAS and DASD, respectively, for in vivo imaging of the sentinel lymph node. Moreover, the contrast ratio is improved by the DMASD about 23.61 and 10.81 dB compared to DAS and DASD, respectively.

TI  - An Approach for Estimating Monthly Curve Number Based on Remotely-Sensed MODIS Leaf Area Index Products
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Curve number (CN) is a principal factor which is widely used in hydrology, specifically in the rainfall-runoff modelling. Its value varies based on soil moisture condition; soil hydrologic group, land use, and vegetation cover type. Remote sensing technology provides a tool to investigate spatiotemporal variations of land-cover. This may lead to generation of some continuous spatiotemporal CN datasets required for many hydrological applications. The purpose of this research is to develop an approach for estimating a monthly-distributed curve number via MODIS leaf area index (LAI) products. For calculating monthly CN, we investigated the relationship between monthly LAI, rainfall and CN under different computational scenarios of arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean for estimating monthly LAI and rainfall. For this purpose, rainfall data for the period 2002-2016 were collected. Further, LAI data were obtained from MODIS for the same period. The performance of the modelled CN (correlation coefficients and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) was compared against obtained values of monthly rainfall and runoff in the SCS-CN method (observation-based CN). The findings of this study suggested that CN values obtained from the arithmetic mean of LAI and the geometric mean of rainfall yielded the best scenario (R-2 = 0.916 and NS = 0.903 for calibration set; R-2 = 0.926 and NS = 0.892 for validation set). Therefore, we suggest a simple appropriate method to generate monthly spatially distributed CN for hydrological applications.

TI  - Textural Noise Correction for Sentinel-1 TOPSAR Cross-Polarization Channel Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal noise-induced distortions in a Sentinel-1 terrain observation with progressive scans synthetic aperture radar image cannot be corrected by the noise equivalent sigma nought (NESZ) subtraction only. Since the thermal noise is scaled during synthetic aperture radar processing, it resides not only as an additive noise in each pixel but also as a multiplicative noise in the interpixel contrast. In this paper, we investigate the noise characteristics and propose an efficient method for the multiplicative textural noise correction. The core ideas are to find the optimal coefficient of the noise-induced standard deviation (SD) and model the noise contribution to the local SD as a function of the NESZ and the signal-to-noise ratio. Denoising is accomplished by a subwindow-wise adaptive rescaling of the pixel values. The improvements in the first-and second-order statistical textural features demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - BackgroundFew guidelines exist for an opioid prescription after breast surgical oncology (BSO) procedures. We sought to characterize opioid prescribing and use patterns by surgery type.MethodsPatients (n=332) undergoing BSO procedure were surveyed one week postoperatively for opioid use. The surgeons were surveyed about pain management preferences surgery type. CPT codes were collected for 2017 to calculate the amount of opioids used by surgery type relative to surgeon preference.ResultsMean oral morphine equivalent (OME) preferred prescription for surgeons who did not tailor prescriptions by surgery type (n=7, group A) was 177, whereas for those who did tailor (n=10, group B) varied from 137 to 257 OME. There was a significant difference in opioid use by surgery type: 32 OME for segmental mastectomy (SM)sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND), 63 for SM+axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), 76 for total mastectomy (TM)+/- SLND, 115 for TM+ALND (P<0.001). Considering the type of surgeries performed group A prescribers would have 229190 unused OME and group B would have 230826 in 1 year.ConclusionWide variation in opioid use by BSO procedure type was noted with substantial unused OME regardless ofprescribing preference. Evidence-based guidelines are needed to tailor analgesic prescriptions according to the need.

TI  - Geostatistical Integration of Field Measurements and Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Images for Spatial Prediction of Grain Size of Intertidal Surface Sediments
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential benefit of using high-resolution optical and SAR images for the geostatistical mapping of grain size of intertidal surface sediments. The grain size values from field measurements are integrated with reflectance and backscattering coefficients from multi-sensor images via regression kriging. The trends of grain size variations are estimated using support vector regression (SVR) modeling to account for a nonlinear relationship, and rank transformation is applied to original input variables to highlight the relative differences in input values from multi-sensor images. Unlike the conventional regression based mapping approach, the residual component that cannot be explained by the multi-sensor remote sensing images is considered and predicted via kriging. The final grain size values are then obtained by adding these two components. From a case study on the Baramarae tidal flats in Korea with KOMPSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images, the integration of multi-sensor images with field measurements via SVR and rank transformation could explain 58 % of grain size variance, leading to a significant improvement in predictive performance (approximately 29 %) over ordinary kriging based on field measurements only. Furthermore, using reflectance and scattering information from multi-sensor images generated the grain size distribution with more detailed variations in the study area. Therefore, the synergistic use of multi-sensor images within an advanced geostatistical integration framework is expected to be very effective for the reliable mapping of the grain size of intertidal surface sediments when only a limited number of field measurements are available.

Assessment of the consequences of these changes for hydrological processes is vital for sustainable management of water resources. In this study, the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on the evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff in the Ganga river basin, India during the period of 1975-2010 are assessed. Variable infiltration capacity (VIC), a physically distributed macro-scale hydrological model, is used with a grid cell resolution of 0.125 degrees with a daily time step to simulate hydrological fluxes. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product MCD15A3 is used to extract monthly LULC class-wise leaf area index values to parameterize the VIC model. The results indicate that the VIC model is a powerful model for assessing the hydrologic impacts of LULC change. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for the monthly stream flow were 0.650 and 0.565 during calibration and 0.764 during validation, respectively. Single-cell model simulations show that expansion of the built-up area at the cost of vegetation is the change that affected the water balance of the study area most significantly. The effects of LULC changes are greatest during the monsoon. However, during the dry season, there are similar ET and runoff responses from most of the LULC classes because of the low soil moisture. The overall changes in the ET and runoff due to LULC changes in the study area are found to be too small at the basin. We observe that at the basin scale, the negative impacts on the ET and runoff are compensated by the positive impacts.

TI  - Effects of the surrounding landscape on waterbird populations in estuarine ecosystems of central Chile
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterbirds have high potential as bioindicators of the status and functioning of estuarine ecosystems, because they respond to multiple stress factors in a wide range of spatial scales. The objective of this study was to analyze the dependence of the population size of waterbird species with different degrees of association with waterbodies (High: HAW, Low: LAW) on attributes of the surrounding landscape. This was accomplished by long-term monitoring (2006-2015) of the populations of waterbirds in three estuaries of central Chile; the Itata, Mataquito, and Reloca Rivers. We acquired data on the composition and structure of the landscape for each site from satellite sensors (Landsat TM5, ETM+7 and OLI 8), specifically the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI). We also obtained the covers of grassland and crops, bare soil and shrubland annually (summer) using a supervised classification. Using point-count data (2013-2015) from the landscape surrounding the Itata estuary, we compared the proportion of the population of different species present within and outside the wetland. The negative temporal correlation (p<0.05) between the number of Yellow-billed pintails (Anas georgica) inside and outside the estuary strongly suggests the movement of individuals between these two habitats. We found that the abundance of many species in in the estuaries was affected by the variation of some landscape attributes. However, that proportion of LAW and HAW species showing such relationships did not differ significantly. The most important attributes of the landscape for waterbird populations were moisture (flooded sites) and vegetation photosynthetic vigor, shrubland cover. The growing use of waterbird population data as an environmental monitoring tool requires a deep understanding of the factors that drive the changes in both population numbers but also in the data describing the latter. This study highlights the importance of incorporating into waterbird population assessments information from both inside the waterbodies and from their surrounding landscapes.

TI  - A Novel Training Program for Mental Health Providers in Religious and Spiritual Competencies
T2  - SPIRITUALITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Religion and spirituality are areas of diversity and multiculturalism that have yet to be comprehensively addressed in most mental health training programs. Without this type of training, many practitioners lack the competence and confidence to engage in spiritually competent care-clinical practice that recognizes the importance of religion and spirituality in people's identity, worldview, meaning-making, and, therefore, their psychological well-being. Emerging research on treatment outcomes and client preferences, as well as professional ethical mandates, support the need for training in spiritual competencies for mental health care. To address the gap between current professional training and the needs and realities of clinical practice, we have developed an online training program to assist practitioners in building their competency and comfort levels in integrating religion and spirituality into treatment. Spiritual Competency Training in Mental Health (SCT-MH) is a 7-hour asynchronous, online program consisting of 8 modules. The modules are designed to develop basic competency in 16 empirically derived spiritual competencies in mental health. The content was derived from numerous instructional materials and peer-reviewed publications, with input from leading experts in the field of spirituality and mental health. It is a multidisciplinary program, allowing mental health providers from any discipline and orientation to participate. The material is applicable for working with clients with a wide range of mental health issues from diverse religious and spiritual backgrounds. In this article, we will discuss how the program was developed, what it entails, who it was developed for, and future efforts to test it empirically.

TI  - Can Creativity Beat Death? A Review and Evidence on the Existential Anxiety Buffering Functions of Creative Achievement
T2  - JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR
M3  - Review
AB  - The relationship between creativity and symbolic immortality had been long acknowledged by scholars. In a review of the literature, we found 12 papers that empirically examined the relationship between creativity and mortality awareness using a Terror Management Theory paradigm, overall supporting the notion that creativity plays an important role in the management of existential concerns. Also, a mini meta-analysis of the impact of death awareness on creativity resulted in a small-medium weighted mean effect. We examined the existential anxiety buffering functions of creative achievement as assessed by the Creative Achievement Questionnaire in a sample of 108 students. It was found that at high, but not low, levels of creative goals, creative achievement was associated with lower death-thought accessibility under mortality salience in comparison to controls. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical report of the anxiety buffering functions of creative achievement among people for whom creativity constitutes a central part of their cultural worldview. The current findings support the notion that creative achievement may be an avenue for symbolic immortality, particularly among individuals who value creativity. Implications for understanding death-related creativity motivations and their impact on individuals and society and for the promotion of creative achievement and creative motivation are discussed.

TI  - Skin Cancer: Melanoma.
T2  - FP essentials
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Melanoma is associated with the highest mortality rate among commonly diagnosed skin cancers. Intense intermittent exposure to UV radiation via sunlight is the most significant risk factor. A history of sunburns is another major factor. Patients with suspicious lesions or nevi typically ask about them during primary care visits, so it is imperative that primary care clinicians learn to recognize them. Clinicians and patients can apply the ABCDE (Asymmetry, irregular Borders, Color variation, Diameter greater than 6 mm, Evolution over time) criteria to monitor suspicious lesions. Dermatoscopy can aid clinicians in assessment. If melanoma is suspected, excisional biopsy is preferred over incisional biopsy. After a diagnosis of melanoma is confirmed, a multidisciplinary approach to management is needed, with involvement of a dermatology subspecialist and possibly an oncology subspecialist. Surgical excision is performed for early stage melanoma, and surgical excision with wide margins and possible sentinel lymph node biopsy for stages IB or II. For patients with metastatic disease, a combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy is recommended. After initial treatment, patients should undergo follow-up examinations on a regular schedule. All patients diagnosed with stage IA to IV melanoma should undergo skin examinations at least annually for their lifetime.

TI  - Limpets (<i>Patella</i> spp. Mollusca, Gastropoda) as model organisms for biomonitoring environmental quality
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of limpets of the genus Patella as indicators of environmental quality is a priori promising, but few data are available in relation to their sensitivity to toxicants or their ability to accumulate pollutants. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of Patella spp. as model organisms by (1) assessing the sensitivity of limpet embryos to some common pollutants, (2) validating the use of the limpet embryo-larval bioassay using natural sediment samples, and (3) analyzing the presence of pollutants by using Patella spp. as sentinel species. The obtained EC50 values ranged between 33 and 84 mu g/L for Cu, 749-1163 for Cd, 317-1103 for Zn and 813-3411 mu g/L for Pb; these sensitivity ranges were similar to those of other marine invertebrates used in ecotoxicology. It was not possible to validate the bioassay with natural samples, since the sampled sites did not cause significant toxicity. Patella spp. accumulated metals and organic pollutants in their soft tissues, showing higher concentrations than mussels for some metals (Cd, As and Cu) and lower concentrations for others (Hg, Zn, Cr), as well as for organic pollutants. Furthermore, bioaccumulation in limpets showed a spatial pattern of contamination similar to that shown by mussels and sediments, revealing limpets as a very good substitute/complement to mussels for biomonitoring marine pollution, especially in sites where mussel populations are absent or present at low numbers.

TI  - The effect of copper and chlorpyrifos co-exposure on biomarkers in the marine mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Metals and organophosphorous pesticides commonly co-occur in marine environment, but the effect of their mixtures on non-target organisms is still poorly understood. This study investigated the combined effect of the essential metal copper (Cu) and organophosphorous pesticide chlorpyrifos (Chp) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) after short-term exposure to their sublethal concentrations. Mussels were exposed for four days to 5 and 15 mu g L-1 Cu and 0.05 and 5 mu g L-1 Chp, and to their binary mixtures. The investigated biomarkers, namely acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), metallothioneins content (MTs) and lipid peroxide levels (LPO) displayed unspecific and inconsistent response patterns that varied depending on the concentration of chemicals and composition of mixtures. The exposure to Cu or Chp alone did not induce AChE activity changes, whereas only Cu provoked a significant GST activity increase. Exposure to lower and higher concentration of Chp resulted in MTs content and LPO level increase, respectively. Response of biomarkers to mixtures was generally inconsistent. Data integration by IBR index and PCA revealed different stress levels for given exposure conditions, but no explicit differentiation between single and joint exposures was found. The present results showed that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu and Chp in mixtures may result in a detectable biological response, stressing the need for further investigation of joint effects of widespread marine contaminants in sentinel organisms.

TI  - LANDFIRE Remap Prototype Mapping Effort: Developing a New Framework for Mapping Vegetation Classification, Change, and Structure
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - LANDFIRE (LF) National (2001) was the original product suite of the LANDFIRE program, which included Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC), Height (EVH), and Type (EVT). Subsequent refinements after feedback from data users resulted in updated products, referred to as LF 2001, that now served as LANDFIRE's baseline datasets and are the basis for all subsequent LANDFIRE updates. These updates account for disturbances and vegetation transition changes that may not represent current vegetation conditions. Therefore, in 2016 LANDFIRE initiated the Remap prototype to determine how to undertake a national-scale remap of the LANDFIRE primary vegetation datasets. EVC, EVH, and EVT were produced (circa 2015) via modeling for ecologically variable prototyping areas in the Pacific Northwest (NW) and Grand Canyon (GC). An error analysis within the GC suggested an overall accuracy of 52% (N = 800) for EVT, and a goodness of fit of 51% (N = 38) for percent cover (continuous EVC) and 53% (N = 38) for height (continuous EVH). The prototyping effort included a new 81-class map using the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) within the NW. This paper presents a narrative of the innovative methodologies in image processing and mapping used to create the new LANDFIRE vegetation products.

TI  - Removal of the MCSST MODIS SST Bias During Upwelling Events Along the Southeastern Coast of Brazil
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) retrievals with a significant positive bias during the occurrence of upwelling phenomena along the southeastern coast of Brazil were reported in our companion paper. As a result, this paper proposes an automated bias correction algorithm to improve the MODIS long-wave multichannel SST (MCSST) retrievals during the abovementioned conditions in this region. In this paper, MODIS daytime SST data (SSTMODIS) and differences between brightness temperatures in MODIS channels 31 and 32 (BT31 - BT32) are analyzed simultaneously with hourly wind surface conditions, in situ SST at 0.3 and 10 m in depth (SSTbuoy03 and SSTbuoy10), and sensible and latent heat fluxes from the Cabo Frio buoy data (at 23 degrees S, 42 degrees W) during 2014. The obtained results show that some upwelling events present air temperature (T-air) greater than SSTbuoy03 and low-atmospheric water vapor content. A simultaneous occurrence of these factors during upwelling conditions may lead to a warm-skin layer effect and may cause BT31 to be greater than SSTbuoy03 and BT31 - BT32 to be small (-0.18 degrees C +/- 0.22 degrees C), affecting the MCSST performance. The proposed bias correction algorithm uses a least-squares curve between SSTbuoy03 and SSTMODIS retrievals when BT31 - BT32 similar to 0.5 degrees C (i. e., dry atmospheric conditions). The bias correction algorithm has significantly improved the SSTMODIS bias (RMSE) from 1.43 degrees C to - 0.02 degrees C (1.60 degrees C to 0.58 degrees C) when applied to 22 cloud-free pixels of MODIS during January-March of 2015.

M3  - Article
AB  - According to the theological worldview of J. R. R. Tolkien, the principal work of a Christian is to know, love, and serve God. Why, then, did he devote so much time to creating an entire family of imaginary languages for imaginary peoples in an imaginary world? This paper argues that the stories of these peoples, with their 'eucatastrophes,' have consoling value amid the incomplete stories of our own lives. But more fundamentally, secondary creation is proper to the adopted children of God and can be a way of drawing closer to God. Such work also witnesses to the freedom of the children of God, not only to receive salvation from God, but to contribute to the enrichment of creation and eternal life.

TI  - Calibrating Sentinel-2 Imagery with Multispectral UAV Derived Information to Quantify Damages in Mediterranean Rice Crops Caused by Western Swamphen (<i>Porphyrio porphyrio</i>)
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Making agricultural production compatible with the conservation of biological diversity is a priority in areas in which human-wildlife conflicts arise. The threatened Western Swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio) feeds on rice, inducing crop damage and leading to decreases in rice production. Due to the Swamphen protection status, economic compensation policies have been put in place to compensate farmers for these damages, thus requiring an accurate, quantitative, and cost-effective evaluation of rice crop losses over large territories. We used information captured from a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) equipped with a multispectral Parrot SEQUOIA camera as ground-truth information to calibrate Sentinel-2 imagery to quantify damages in the region of Ebro Delta, western Mediterranean. UAV vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) allowed estimation of damages in rice crops at 10 cm pixel resolution by discriminating no-green vegetation pixels. Once co-registered with Sentinel grid, we predicted the UAV damage proportion at a 10 m resolution as a function of Sentinel-2 NDVI, and then we extrapolated the fitted model to the whole Sentinel-2 Ebro Delta image. Finally, the damage predicted with Sentinel-2 data was quantified at the agricultural plot level and validated with field information compiled on the ground by Rangers Service. We found that Sentinel2-NDVI data explained up to 57% of damage reported with UAV. The final validation with Rangers Service data pointed out some limitations in our procedure that leads the way to improving future development. Sentinel2 imagery calibrated with UAV information proved to be a viable and cost-efficient alternative to quantify damages in rice crops at large scales.

TI  - Fault Slip Associated with the 2 September 2017 M 5.3 Sulphur Peak, Idaho, Earthquake and Aftershock Sequence
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2 September 2017 M 5.3 Sulphur Peak, Idaho, earthquake is one of the largest earthquakes in southern Idaho since the 1983 M 6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. It was followed by a vigorous aftershock sequence for nearly two weeks that included five events above M 4.5. The coseismic and early postseismic deformation was measured with both Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Positioning System (GPS), yielding up to 3 cm subsidence southwest of the mainshock epicenter and horizontal motions of similar to 1 mm at sites similar to 40 km east and west of the epicenter. We derive dislocation models of the net slip during the similar to 14-day swarm from Sentinel 1A interferograms and GPS offsets, allowing for both fault-zone collapse and normal faulting to account for the observed geodetic motions. Slip inversions yield several decimeters of normal slip on one or more normal faults near the mainshock hypocenter. Distributed normal slip on a moderately (55 degrees) east-dipping fault, normal slip on one or more shallowly west-dipping faults, or a combination thereof explain the data equally well and are difficult to distinguish from one another on the basis of geodetic data alone. Previously mapped regional Sevier-age thrust structures and later normal faults dip westward, suggesting that the sequence reactivated one or more ancient thrust structures with normal slip. If a moderately east-dipping fault accommodated substantial slip, it would imply a nascent fault structure that cuts across the reactivated ancient thrust structures. The inferred geodetic moment of 3.02-4.39 x 10(-17) N . m (M-w 5.62-5.73) greatly exceeds the 1.15 x 10(-17) N . m (M-w 5.34) seismic moment of the 2 September mainshock, showing that most of the moment release occurred during the aftershock sequence. Up to similar to 0.2 m of fault-zone collapse may have occurred on a shallow west-dipping fault, suggesting possible large-scale expulsion of fluids from the fault zone at depth.

T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), the detection of distant disease determines whether the intention of the treatment is curative or palliative. Therefore, adequate preoperative staging is imperative for optimal treatment planning. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of conventional imaging techniques, including chest X-ray and/or CT thorax-(abdomen), liver ultrasonography(US), and skeletal scintigraphy, on the distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) in patients with IBTR, and to compare conventional imaging with F-18-FDG PET-CT or no imaging at all.MethodsThis study was exclusively based on the information available at time of diagnoses of IBTR. To adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between the three imaging groups, a propensity score (PS) weighted method was used.ResultsOf the 495 patients included in the study, 229 (46.3%) were staged with conventional imaging, 89 patients (19.8%) were staged with F-18-FDG PET-CT, and in 168 of the patients (33.9%) no imaging was used (N=168). After a follow-up of approximately 5 years, 14.5% of all patients developed a distant recurrence as first event after IBTR. After adjusting for the PS weights, the Cox regression analyses showed that the different staging methods had no significant impact on the DRFI.ConclusionsThis study showed a wide variation in the use of imaging modalities for staging IBTR patients in the Netherlands. After using PS weighting, no statistically significant impact of the different imaging modalities on DRFI was shown. Based on these results, it is not possible to recommend staging for distant metastases using F-18-FDG PET-CT over conventional imaging techniques.

TI  - Observation of Fish Dissemination Pattern on Madura Coastal Using Segmentation of Satellite Images
T2  - EMITTER-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Almost traditional fishermen still use manual methods to catch fish that rely on experience in fishing and information among fellow fishermen. This method is not effective for maximizing fish production. A good pattern or strategy is needed to increase fish production. In determining dissemination pattern of fish, it can be predicted from physical parameters such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, turbidity, total suspended solids, and colored dissolved organic matter using the Landsat 8 images. This research area is on the Island of Madura Coast. The pattern is determined by using Lagrange Interpolation and clustering using K-Means. The results of the study of the pattern of fish dissemination were then validated with data from the Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan Jawa Timur. The results between fish patterns and validation data in 2015 showed similarities in January, February, March, May, June, July, August, September. In 2016, results between fish patterns and validation data showed that similarities in July, August, September, and December. In 2017, results between fish patterns and validation data showed similarities in November. 2015 has the most similarities between the patterns and validation data and the least similarity are 2017.

TI  - Impact of the ARSET Program on Use of Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We show that training activities conducted through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Applied Remote-Sensing Training (ARSET) program led to a significant increase in remote-sensing data use for decision-making. Our findings are based on survey data collected from 1041 ARSET participants from 117 countries who attended ARSET trainings between 2013 and 2016. To assess the impact of the ARSET program, we analyzed changes in three metrics. Results show that 83% of all respondents increased their knowledge of remote-sensing data products at least moderately, 79% increased their ability to access data, and 73% increased their ability to make decisions. We also examined how respondents are using remote-sensing data across 40 specific work tasks ranging from research to decision support applications. More than 50% of respondents reported an increase in data use for all except two of the tasks. ARSET will use these findings, together with participant data on future training needs, to set future directions for the program.

TI  - Essence of digital transformation-Manifestations at large financial institutions from North America
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is focus among most leading academic institutions globally to understand digital transformation. While most operate on some common premise related with the construct of digital transformation there is no established definition yet. Existing descriptions cover a wide range of things from smart living, future of work, automation, industry convergence, and technology among others. These are sometimes fairly all encompassing, inconsistent and incomparable as a point of reference. Interestingly, major consulting firms, technology promoters, independent influencers, analysts promote transformation solutions, each with their own models, interpretation and descriptions.In the paper, we develop an understanding on what is the nature of demand for digital transformation. This is based on evidences of narratives from large financial institutions. We scoped our study on four large banks in North America to see - is there an essence of transformation when institutions adopt digital technology? The paper deals on key themes - drivers, benefits, perception of digital transformation, readiness of banks and deployment instances. Understanding how large financial institutions are adopting digital technologies is important for contemporary technology providers, institutions, researchers and analysts.The study conducted is qualitative along with associated quantitative techniques and visual analytics. This is achieved by theme-based narrative analysis of the public disclosures from four large North American Banks across five years (FY'13-FY'17). The research analyzes the relevant narratives from annual reports to code them into logical themes thereby providing a view of the key focus and associations. Analyzing the practices and manifestations of the institutions this research classifies standard and more advanced differentiating practices. This leads to an emergent structure for a Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM). The authors believe these will serve as indicative maturity guidance for digital technology adoption by financial institutions, in similar context and will also be beneficial to technology providers.

TI  - Discourse on culture in research on immigrant and migrant workers' health
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Health and safety researchers and practitioners have proposed that cultural differences help explain inequalities between foreign and native-born workers. While cultural explanations for inequalities have long been debated in other fields, there exists little critique of cultural discourses in occupational health. Methods This article examines and discusses the discourse on culture in 107 articles on immigrant or migrant workers' health published between 2011 and 2015. For each article, passages on culture were identified and analysed for both the context and the manner in which culture was discussed. Results The discourse on culture was found to be generally simplistic, individualistic, and uncritical, intentionally or unintentionally supporting the worldview that workers' "otherness" is both cause of inequalities and target for interventions. Conclusion The article argues that empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary work is needed to document the mechanisms and pathways that underlie health and safety inequalities by foreign-born status.

TI  - Comparing map-based and library-based training approaches for urban land-cover fraction mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved trade-off between resolution, coverage and revisit time, makes Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery an interesting data source for mapping the composition and spatial-temporal dynamics of urban land cover. To fully realize the potential of Sentinel-2's high amount of available data, efficient urban mapping workflows are required. Machine learning regression is a powerful approach to produce subpixel land cover fractions from remote sensing imagery, yet it requires mixed spectra for model training for which the fractions of the land cover classes present in the pixel are known. Typically, this data is obtained by sampling spectra from the image to be unmixed, and corresponding land-cover fractions from higher-resolution land cover reference data, i.e. map based training. We propose synthetic mixing of library spectra as an alternative for producing land cover fraction training data for regression modelling, i.e. library-based training. The approach is applied to a Sentinel-2 image of the city of Brussels (Belgium) and part of its urban fringe for mapping Vegetation, Impervious, and Soil (VIS) fractions at 20 m resolution. VIS fraction maps obtained with library-based training have mean absolute errors below 0.1 for all three surface types. The composition of these three key surface categories and their spatial distribution is well represented for the entire area in resulting maps. As a proof of concept, library-based training is compared with the map-based training approach. The more flexible library-based training not only achieves similar mapping accuracies, but in most cases, outperforms the map-based training approach in terms of bias and magnitude of error. The outcome of the research suggests that use of spectral libraries and synthetic mixing may provide an efficient modelling framework for regression-based mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery in operational contexts.

TI  - Geometric changes of three glaciers in Dickson Land, central Spitsbergen, during the period 1990-2015
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers of the Svalbard archipelago react very rapidly to climate change in the polar environment. Combining the study of aerial photographs, digital elevation models and in situ measurements, it is possible to measure glacier geometric changes. Apart from the standard remote sensing data evaluation we focus on in situ measurements by ground penetrating radar. This study calculates length, area, volume and elevation changes of three glaciers in Dickson Land, central Spitsbergen, during the period 1990-2015. Ground penetrating radar surveys indicate ice thickness, which was used for calculating the volume and the bed topography of the glaciers. The mean ice thickness ranges from 21.2 to 52.4 m. Between 1990 and 2015, the glacierized area decreased from 5.37 +/- 1.02 km(2) to 4.45 +/- 0.25 km(2) (- 17.5%) and the volume reduced from 309.93 +/- 4.75 mil m(3) to 215. 44 +/- 1.27 mil m(3) (- 30.5%). The mean surface elevation decreased by 23.0 +/- 8.4 m (Bertilbreen), 22.3 +/- 10.2 (Ferdinandbreen) and 10.7 +/- 7.8 m (Elsabreen). The average surface elevation (0.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.0 +/- 0.4 m a(-1)) and volumetric (- 0.22 +/- 0.02 to - 3.61 +/- 0.12 mil m(3) a(-1)) changes correspond to values reported from this and other regions of Svalbard.

TI  - High-resolution habitat and bathymetry maps for 65,000sq. km of Earth's remotest coral reefs
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - With compelling evidence that half the world's coral reefs have been lost over the last four decades, there is urgent motivation to understand where reefs are located and their health. Without such basic baseline information, it is challenging to mount a response to the reef crisis on the global scale at which it is occurring. To combat this lack of baseline data, the Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation embarked on a 10-yr survey of a broad selection of Earth's remotest reef sitesthe Global Reef Expedition. This paper focuses on one output of this expedition, which is meter-resolution seafloor habitat and bathymetry maps developed from DigitalGlobe satellite imagery and calibrated by field observations. Distributed on an equatorial transect across 11 countries, these maps cover 65,000 sq. km of shallow-water reef-dominated habitat. The study represents an order of magnitude greater area than has been mapped previously at high resolution. We present a workflow demonstrating that DigitalGlobe imagery can be processed to useful products for reef conservation at regional to global scale. We further emphasize that the performance of our mapping workflow does not deteriorate with increasing size of the site mapped. Whereas our workflow can produce regional-scale benthic habitat maps for the morphologically diverse reefs of the Pacific and Indian oceans, as well as the more depauperate reefs of the Atlantic, accuracies are substantially higher for the former than the latter. It is our hope that the map products delivered to the community by the Living Oceans Foundation will be utilized for conservation and act to catalyze new initiatives to chart the status of coral reefs globally.

TI  - Determining the Boundary and Probability of Surface Urban Heat Island Footprint Based on a Logistic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the spatial extent of surface urban heat island (SUHI or UHISurf) effects require precise determination of the footprint (FP) boundary. Currently available methods overestimate or underestimate the SUHI FP boundary, and can even alter its morphology, due to theoretical limitations on the ability of their algorithms to accurately determine the impacts of the shape, topography, and landscape heterogeneity of the city. The key to determining the FP boundary is identifying background temperatures in reference rural regions. Due to the instability of remote sensing data, these background temperatures should be determined automatically rather than manually, to eliminate artificial bias. To address this need, we developed an algorithm that adequately represents the decay of land surface temperature (LST) from the urban center to surrounding rural regions, and automatically calculates thresholds for reference rural LSTs in all directions based on a logistic curve. In this study, we applied this algorithm with data from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua/MODIS) 8-day level 3 (L3) LST global grid product to delineate precise SUHI FPs for the Beijing metropolitan area during the summers of 2004-2018 and determine the interannual and diurnal variations in FP boundaries and their relationship with SUHI intensity.

TI  - Retrieval of Inorganic Suspended Particle Size with Landsat-8 OLI Data in the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle size distribution (PSD) is relevant to many physical and biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems. Field investigation or satellite data with coarse resolution have limitations in description of detailed PSD in a small scale region, e.g. river estuary. In this study, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data was used for estimating inorganic suspended particle size in the Yellow River estuary. A simple empirical model using ratio of green to red bands was developed based on in situ measured remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and median particle size (Dv50) for inorganic materials. Validation against in situ measurements showed that retrieved Dv50 was in good accordance with in situ measurements with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 24.0 % and root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.310 mu m. Application of the model to OLI data retrieved a clear and reasonable spatial distribution of Dv50 in the Yellow River estuary. OLI retrieved Dv50 agreed well with that from MODIS data (R-2=0.89, MAPE=6.4 %, RMSE=0.6 mu m). Dv50 maps characterized a river mouth to offshore changing trend, demonstrating the model potential for understanding of the detailed information of a local scale region. The empirical algorithm developed here can be easily applied to other satellite data with similar bands of Landsat-8 OLI data and fine spatial resolution.

TI  - A meta-analysis of infection rates of Schistosoma japonicum in sentinel mice associated with infectious waters in mainland China over last 40 years
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic parasitic disease. After nearly 70 years of control efforts in China, Schistosomiasis transmission has been reduced to a much lower level. The absence or near absence of infections in humans or livestock, based on traditional fecal and serological tests, has made the targets and priorities of future control efforts difficult to determine. However, detection of schistosome cercariae in waters using sentinel mice could be an alternative way of identifying remaining foci of infection, or even serve as a tool for evaluation of control efficacy. This method has been employed in China over last forty years. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of the relevant research to investigate if infections in sentinel mice mirror the ongoing trend of schistosomiasis transmission in China.Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting infection rates of S. japonicum in sentinel mice in China before Sep 1, 2018 in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved all relative studies based on five databases (CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed and Web of Science) and the reference lists of resulting articles. For each individual study, the infection rate in sentinel mice is presented together with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Point estimates of the overall infection rates and their 95% CIs were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed according to study periods, seasons or regions.Results We identified 90 articles, including 290 studies covering eight endemic provinces. The overall rate in sentinel mice was 12.31% (95% CI: 10.14-14.65%) from 1980 to 2018. The value of 3.66% (95% CI: 2.62-4.85%) estimated in 2004 to 2018 was significantly lower than in 1980 to 2003 (22.96%, 95% CI: 19.25-26.89%). The estimate was significantly higher in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The highest estimates were obtained in Hunan (30.11%, 95% CI: 25.64-34.77%) followed by Anhui (26.34%, 95% CI: 12.88-42.44%) and then Jiangxi (13.73%, 95% CI: 6.71-22.56%). Unlike the other provinces in the middle and lower reaches, no significant reduction was seen in Hubei after 2003. Even in Hubei two studies carried out after 2014 reported infections in sentinel mice, although no infected snails were reported across the province. Infections were most found in April (17.40%, 95% CI: 1.13-45.49%), July (24.98%, 95% CI: 15.64-35.62%) and October (17.08%, 95% CI 5.94-32.05%). High degrees of heterogeneity were observed.Conclusion This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of schistosome infection in sentinel mice across China. The estimates largely mirror the ongoing trends of transmission in terms of periods and regions. Infections were most likely to occur in April, July and October. In areas where no infected snails were reported infections in sentinel mice were still observed. Due to the presence of snails and infected wildlife, detection of schistosomes in waters using such a highly sensitive method as the deployment of sentinel mice, remains of importance in schistosomiasis monitoring. We would suggest the current criteria for transmission interruption or elimination of schistosomiasis in China be adjusted by integrating the results of sentinel mice based surveys.Author summary With the continued activities of the prevention and control programme in China, the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum infection have been reduced to low levels. This makes it impossible to detect any infections in humans or livestock using the traditional approach of fecal and serological testing, so as to evaluate properly the risk map of infection. However, detection of existence of schistosome cercariae in waters could be an alternative way of detecting a potential focus of transmission. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of studies performed over the last 40 years to estimate the overall infection rates of S. japonicum in sentinel mice. The estimate across China in 2004 to 2018 was 3.66%, significantly lower than in 1980 to 2003. The highest estimates were observed in Hunan, followed by Anhui and Jiangxi. Two studies conducted in Hubei in 2015 and 2016 respectively, reported infected sentinel mice where no infected snails had been reported across the province since 2014. Transmission was found be most likely in April, July and October. The estimates largely mirror the ongoing trends of S. japonicum infections in terms of periods and regions. Due to the presence of snails and other infected wildlife, detection of schistosome cercariae in waters with a highly sensitive tool remains of great importance in schistosomiasis monitoring and evaluation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the potential threat of S. japonicum in nature, to humans and livestock has been assessed in this manner. We would suggest that the current criteria for transmission interruption or elimination of S. japonicum in China be adjusted by integrating the results of sentinel mice.

TI  - Assessing Landscape Fire Hazard by Multitemporal Automatic Classification of Landsat Time Series Using the Google Earth Engine in West-Central Spain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are needed to identify the interaction between landscape changes and wildland fires. Objectives: In this work, we determined fire hazard changes in a representative Mediterranean landscape through the classification of annual LULC types and fire perimeters, using a dense Landsat Time Series (LTS) during the 1984-2017 period, and MODIS images. Methods: We implemented a semiautomatic process in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to generate annual imagery free of clouds, cloud shadows, and gaps. We compared LandTrendr (LT) and FormaTrend (FT) algorithms that are widely used in LTS analysis to extract the pixel tendencies and, consequently, assess LULC changes and disturbances such as forest fires. These algorithms allowed us to generate the following change metrics: type, magnitude, direction, and duration of change, as well as the prechange spectral values. Results and conclusions: Our results showed that the FT algorithm was better than the LT algorithm at detecting low-severity changes caused by fires. Likewise, the use of the change metrics' type, magnitude, and direction of change increased the accuracy of the LULC maps by 4% relative to the ones obtained using only spectral and topographic variables. The most significant hazardous LULC change processes observed were: deforestation and degradation (mainly by fires), encroachment (i.e., invasion by shrublands) due to agriculture abandonment and forest fires, and hazardous densification (from open forests and agroforestry areas). Although the total burned area has decreased significantly since 1985, the landscape fire hazard has increased since the second half of the twentieth century. Therefore, it is necessary to implement fire management plans focused on the sustainable use of shrublands and conifer forests; this is because the stability in these hazardous vegetation types is translated into increasing fuel loads, and thus an elevated landscape fire hazard.

TI  - Faith in international agricultural development: Conservation Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of faith and religion in international development cooperation is hotly debated today. The legitimacy of this role remains, however, often confided to instrumental reasons. Yet, thinking about faith and religion only in instrumental terms leaves unquestioned the possibility of a religious background of development cooperation as a practice itself and the potential role of faith through individual practitioners that operate within secular NGOs, and research and policy institutes. The aim of the present paper is therefore to consider the structural role of faith and worldview in relation to agricultural development, moving beyond the discourse of instrumentality. We do this by focusing on Giller and Andersson's political agronomy analysis of the promotion of Conservation Agriculture in Zimbabwe by the faith-based organisation 'Foundations for Farming'. We argue that a distinction should be made between religion as a practice of believers and faith functioning as a worldview in every practice. In addition, we argue that it is helpful to distinguish between different kinds of practices involved in agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa, namely farming practice, agronomic scientific practice, and faith practice. The value of this philosophical analysis is that it challenges a dichotomous model of 'science-based versus faith-based' approaches to agricultural development. Furthermore, specific kinds of normativity are identified as always already functioning inside practices, rather than practices being neutral spaces that are (subjectively) infused with normativity by applying external ethical standards.

TI  - Improved assessment of mangrove forests in Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary using WorldView 2 and TanDEM-X high resolution imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments of remote sensing techniques which can capture both the structure and function of the ecosystem provide a more representative view of the landscape. These unique Earth observations were used to help improve traditional forestry surveys by providing species-specific land cover classes for mangrove forests in the Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary. By combining optical data from WorldView2 (WV2; 2 m pixel) and a canopy height model derived using radar data from TanDEM-X (TDX; 12 m pixel), we identified nine mangrove and five non-mangrove classes by following an Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Algorithm. Three dominant mangrove species accounted for nearly 50% of the sanctuary. Heritieria fomes disproportionately covered the largest area at 43%, overturning previous field-based estimates of Excoecaria agallocha dominance. E. agallocha and Sonneratia apetala, covered 3% and 1.47% of the sanctuary, respectively. Four mixed species classes were also identified with clear vegetation zonation patterns that trended toward species homogeneity with increasing distance from shore. The overall land cover accuracy (WV2: 89.33%; WV2-TDX: 89.89%), the Kappa Coefficient (WV2: 0.88; WV2-TDX: 0.89) and change statistics between WV2 and WV2-TDX land cover classifications indicate that the WV2 imagery can separate mangrove community types without structural data. The combination of the land cover classifications and the canopy height model indicated that H. fomes were not only the most dominant forest but also, on average, the tallest (12.3 m) among the other eight mangrove types. Our large-scale mapping with high resolution optical and radar platforms can capture subtle changes in mangrove vegetation and canopy structural gradients more accurately and be used to monitor biodiversity changes and Aichi Biodiversity Targets and Indicators, which would contribute to biodiversity policy updating.

TI  - An Automated Python Language-Based Tool for Creating Absence Samples in Groundwater Potential Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although sampling strategy plays an important role in groundwater potential mapping and significantly influences model accuracy, researchers often apply a simple random sampling method to determine absence (non-occurrence) samples. In this study, an automated, user-friendly geographic information system (GIS)-based tool, selection of absence samples (SAS), was developed using the Python programming language. The SAS tool takes into account different geospatial concepts, including nearest neighbor (NN) and hotspot analyses. In a case study, it was successfully applied to the Bojnourd watershed, Iran, together with two machine learning models (random forest (RF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)) with GIS and remotely sensed data, to model groundwater potential. Different evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), true skill statistic (TSS), efficiency (E), false positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and false negative rate (FNR)) were used to scrutinize model performance. Two absence sample types were produced, based on a simple random method and the SAS tool, and used in the models. The results demonstrated that both RF (AUC-ROC = 0.913, TSS = 0.72, E = 0.926) and MARS (AUC-ROC = 0.889, TSS = 0.705, E = 0.90) performed better when using absence samples generated by the SAS tool, indicating that this tool is capable of producing trustworthy absence samples to improve groundwater potential models.

TI  - Altitudinal and temporal evapotranspiration dynamics via remote sensing and vegetation index-based modelling over a scarce-monitored, high-altitudinal Andean paramo ecosystem of Southern Ecuador
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the tropical Andes, the paramo ecosystem is known as water towers and the main water supplier for the cities of the Andean region. Nevertheless, considering that evapotranspiration (ET) is the major water loss and the lack of in situ evapotranspiration measurements in high altitudinal paramo ecosystems, ET dynamics on the hydrological regulation remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to close this gap, we focused on a remote sensing approach. This study addressed the altitudinal and temporal dynamics of actual evapotranspiration using a crop coefficient based on a Vegetation Index (VI) model. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) retrieved from Landsat imagery were evaluated. Four remote sensing images and ground-level meteorological data for a 10-month period were used to create ET maps from each VI. A cubic spline interpolation was used to obtain daily ET time series between two satellite overpass dates. Aggregated monthly values were used to validate against ET calculated from water balance. Results revealed that EVI-based ET outperformed the other VI-based ET. The results showed 30% of subestimation (Pbias%) in relation to the water balance. For upgraded results, an extended satellite images time series and a fine calibration are needed. Regarding the altitudinal variability, ET exhibited a strong dependence on land cover characteristics. Our work provides a plausible method to estimate ET in paramo ecosystems in the absence of ET measurements and with a scarcity of clear sky images, further evaluation is necessary to improve ET estimations using remote sensing in the future.

TI  - Enhanced Ozone Production in Ambient Air at Patiala Semi-Urban Site During Crop Residue Burning Events
T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous in situ measurements of criteria pollutants (O-3, CO and NOx) and meteorological variables were done at a semi-urban site (Patiala) of North-West Indo-Gangetic Plains (NW-IGP) for the years 2014 and 2015. The influence of meteorology on the levels of criteria pollutants was investigated on daily, monthly, seasonal and diurnal basis. The average rate of increase in O-3, calculated to be 1.1ppbh(-1) and pollution index (daily O-3 max/O-3 min ratio), values (10.2) indicates remarkable ozone pollution. Ozone is negatively correlated (represented as r value) with its precursor gases CO (-0.28) and NOx (-0.32), as they get consumed in the photochemical production of ozone. The impact of meteorology on ozone production was positively correlated with SR (0.63), AT (0.49), MT (0.59) and WS (0.23) and negatively correlated with RH (-0.83). Pre-, during and post-biomass burning periods were determined using Terra-MODIS images over the study area. Enhanced levels of ozone were recorded as 20ppb and 15ppb during daytime, respectively, for rice and wheat crop seasons, and 12ppb during nighttime for both seasons. Ozone exceedance of 24h national standard occurred on 50% and 8% of the sampling periods during wheat and rice crop residue burning, respectively. Ozone generation with its precursor gases was analyzed quantitatively.

TI  - Geographic Object Based Image Analysis of WorldView-3 Imagery for Urban Hydrologic Modelling at the Catchment Scale
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Sponge City initiative will involve widespread installation of new stormwater infrastructure including green roofs, permeable pavements and rain gardens in at least 30 cities. Hydrologic modelling can support the planning of Sponge Cities at the catchment scale, however, highly detailed spatial data for model input can be challenging to compile from the various authorities, or, if available, may not be sufficiently detailed or updated. Remote sensing methods show great promise for mitigating this challenge due to their ability to efficiently classify satellite images into categories relevant to a specific application. In this study Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was applied to WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2017) to create a detailed land cover map of an urban catchment area in Beijing. While land cover classification results based on a Bayesian machine learning classifier alone provided an overall land cover classification accuracy of 63%, the subsequent inclusion of a series of refining rules in combination with supplementary data (including elevation and parcel delineations), yielded the significantly improved overall accuracy of 76%. Results of the land cover classification highlight the limitations of automated classification based on satellite imagery alone and the value of supplementary data and additional rules to refine classification results. Catchment scale hydrologic modelling based on the generated land cover results indicated that 61 to 82% of rainfall volume could be captured for a range of 24 h design storms under varying degrees of Sponge City implementation.

TI  - Zoning and weighting in urban heat island vulnerability and risk mapping in Helsinki, Finland
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is likely to increase the risks related to heat waves in urban areas. We map spatial pattern of heat wave vulnerability and risk in the Helsinki metropolitan area in southern Finland. First, we assess differences that zoning, i.e., differences in spatial units of analysis, and weighting, i.e., weights given to indicators when constructing the index, cause in map production. Second, we evaluate how maps of consensus and certainty could pave the way for visualizing and assessing uncertainties in risk and vulnerability indices. For vulnerability, we use socioeconomic data using 5 different zoning options and 11 different weighting options. For risk, we add two extra layers to vulnerability maps: hazard map showing the spatial pattern of heat based on Landsat satellite images and exposure map showing the spatial pattern of population. We found that when different zoning options are used, the spatial pattern of vulnerability may differ dramatically. In risk maps, the differences between zoning options are smaller. Contrary to previous literature, differences in indicator weighting alter the final maps slightly. The consensus and certainty maps show their potential, e.g., in pointing out areas which may have both high risk/vulnerability and high certainty for risk/vulnerability. Finally, we discuss other possibilities in tackling the uncertainties in mapping and propose new avenues for research.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) mapping of Islamabad region using indigenously fabricated, locally-calibrated, economical sunphotometer and GLOBE sunphotometer
T2  - OPTICA PURA Y APLICADA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at ground based atmosphere monitoring for Islamabad region (33.7167 degrees N and 73.667 degrees E, 508 m altitude) using locally designed dual channels, (Green (550nm) and red (625nm)) LED based handheld sunphotometer. Calibration was done by using improvised transfer of calibration method employing pre-calibrated GLOBE (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit Environment) sunphotometer. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of said region for the month of July, August 2017 was calculated using acquired data for red and green channels. Matching trends (correlation up to 95%) were observed for AOT obtained with GLOBE and local sunphotometer. AOT of Islamabad region generated by satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) instrument board on AQUA and Terra satellites has also been presented for calibration period (Oct 2016-Feb 2017) to qualify our findings. The inter-comparison of data with MODIS instrument AQUA and Terra from Oct 2016 to Feb. 2017 with the local sunphotometer green channel yielded a correlation coefficients in range of 0.51-0.55 approaching the previously reported range values of (similar to 0.55-0.60) for similar comparison. Along with AOT, in this study, the average daily Angstrom exponent alpha, and angstrom turbidity constant beta, have also been reported. The average of angstrom exponent for recorded data is 1.42, this implies moderately polluted urban atmosphere of area under study, while the 19th and 20th July are clearest day for monitoring period with beta = 0.07 and beta = 0.083 respectively.

TI  - Too much of a good thing: Detrimental effects of interferon
T2  - SEMINARS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Healthy tissues of the body express relatively low basal levels of interferons. However, following detection of microbial invasion by sentinel receptors, a cascade of events initiates leading to the transcriptional induction of interferon genes. Interferons are secreted and act primarily as paracrine cytokines to bind neighboring cell surface receptors. Binding to interferon receptors activates a signal pathway to the nucleus inducing a set of interferon-stimulated genes. The biological activity of these genes confers the unique antiviral and innate immune response of interferons. The rapid induction of interferons is critical to survival, and equally critical is the recovery from this defensive state. Either an aberrant response to infection or an inherited genetic disorder that leads to sustained or increased interferon levels can tip the balance towards pathogenesis.

TI  - Remote sensing for urban heat and cool islands evaluation in semi-arid areas
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are experiencing rapid population growth and consequently extensive urbanization. Land-use/land-cover change is one of the important elements worldwide, which significantly affect the environment. This study aims to describe the emergence of urban heat and cool islands as a result of changes in land-use/ land-cover. Land surface temperature over a 32-year period in Isfahan city, Iran was retrieved. The results confirmed the effect of land-use/land-cover change on Landsat land surface temperature. The average land surface temperature changed from 37.5 degrees C in 1985 to 42.7 degrees C in 2017 during August. The highest land surface temperature in the study area for both years occurred on bare soils (40.66 degrees C in 1985 and 45.88 degrees C in 2017). The second highest Landsat land surface temperature was recorded in central parts of the city with dense built-up covers (36.93 degrees C in 1985 vs 42.45 degrees C in 2017). The central parts of the city were found to have a lower Landsat land surface temperature compared to bare soils, which contributes to the formation of urban cool islands. As expected, water bodies and vegetation had a lower Landsat land surface temperature compared to other land covers. The results also showed changes in land use types during 1985 and 2017, with an increase in water bodies (148.82%) and built-up areas (39.67%) and a decrease in vegetation (20.08%) and bare soil (12.42%). The areas converted from vegetation to built-up experienced an increase in Landsat land surface temperature, which confirmed the effect of land-use/land-cover on microclimate. (C) 2019 GJESM.

TI  - Sea Ice Classification with First-Order Logic Refined Sliding Bagging
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an automatic framework for classifying sea ice types using remote sensing imageries. Firstly, polarization features are extracted to form polarization characteristic vectors for representing individual pixels in a remote sensing image. Secondly, a multiple classifier ensemble strategy, i.e., sliding bagging, is exploited for classifying each polarization characteristic vector into a sea ice type. The sliding bagging strategy not only avoids the limitation of one single classifier for characterizing the sea ice variability over a large-scale region, but also alleviates the data imbalance over different sea ice types. Finally, the spatial structural relationships of sea ice types are encoded with first-order logic (FOL) to refine the sea ice classification resulted from the sliding bagging scheme. Experimental evaluations on RADARSAT-2 data validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TI  - Long-Term PM<sub>10</sub> Exposure and Cause-Specific Mortality in the Latium Region in (Italy): A Difference-in-Differences Approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The link between particulate matter (PM) exposure and adverse health outcomes has been widely evaluated using large cohort studies. However, the possibility of residual confounding and lack of information about the health effects of PM in rural and suburban areas are unsolved issues.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to estimate the effect of annual PM <= 10 mu m (PM10) exposure on cause-specific mortality in the Latium region (central Italy, of which Rome is the main city) during 2006-2012 using a difference-in-differences approach.METHODS: We estimated daily PM10 concentrations for each 1 km(2) of the region from 2006 to 2012 by use of satellite data, land-use predictors. and meteorological parameters. For each of the 378 regional municipalities and each year, we averaged daily PM10 values to obtain annual mean PM10 exposures. We applied a variant of the difference-in-differences approach to estimate the association between PM10 and cause-specific mortality by focusing on within-municipality fluctuations of mortality rates and annual PM exposures around municipality means, therefore controlling by design for confounding from all spatial and temporal potential confounders. Analyses were also stratified by population size of the municipalities to obtain effect estimates in rural and suburban areas of the region.RESULTS: In the period 2006-2012, we observed deaths due to three causes: 347,699 nonaccidental; 92,787 cardiovascular; and 16,509 respiratory causes. The annual average (standard deviation, SD)( )PM10 concentration was 21.9 ( +/- 4.9) mu g/m(3) in Latium. For each 1-mu g/m(3) increase in annual PM10 we estimated increases of 0.8% (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.2%, 1.3%), 0.9% (0.0%, 1.8%), and 1.4% (-0.4%, 3.3%) in nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. Similar results were found when we excluded the metropolitan area of Rome from the analysis. Higher effects were estimated in the smaller municipalities, e.g., those with population <5,000 inhabitants.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a significant association of annual PM10 exposure with nonaccidental and cardiorespiratory mortality in the Latium region, even outside Rome and in suburban and rural areas.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Many small islands are located in the southwestern Indian Ocean. These islands have their own environmental specificities and very fragmented landscapes. Generic land use products developed from low and medium resolution satellite images are not suitable for studying these small territories. This is why we have developed a land use/land cover product, called Homisland-IO, based on remote sensing processing on high spatial resolution satellite images acquired by SPOT 5 satellite between December 2012 and July 2014. This product has been produced using an object-based classification process. The overall accuracy of the product is 86%. Homisland-IO is freely accessible through a web portal and is thus available for future use.

AB  - PurposeTehran, Iran, is an interesting location for aerosol studies because it is affected by anthropogenic pollution and desert dust aerosols. The aim of this study was to discriminate the aerosol types using satellite data over the city.MethodThe study was performed using Level-2 daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom Exponent (AE) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites for the years 2011 to 2015. As the Deep Blue (DB) AE retrievals are more reliable than the Dark Target (DT) AE retrievals, the study was performed using DB data.ResultsThe number of granules with successful retrievals (at least in two pixels with AODs >0.2 over Tehran with high quality assurance) was 200, which indicates that aerosols could be observed in 5.47% (200 from 3652 of Terra and Aqua granules) of the overpasses during the study period. The maximum and minimum values of AOD occurred during May (0.320.27) and August (0.18 +/- 0.07), respectively. Based on the AOD vs. AE data, aerosols were classified into three different categories: urban/industry (UI), Desert Dust (DD) and Mixed (Mix). To improve the accuracy of the aerosol classification, the analysis was limited to retrievals with AOD values larger than 0.2. The DD, UI and Mix types had 48.5%, 30.5% and 21% contribution in the aerosol days, respectively.Conclusions p id=Par4 The maximum DD frequency was observed in the spring and summer seasons, while the UI type had its maximum during the cold season. The AOD of the DD type (over Tehran) correlated well with the AOD observations done at the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Zanjan (300km northwest from Tehran). For the UI type, no relationship with the AERONET AOD was detected. This gives confidence in our aerosol typing as the contribution of dust in the aerosol load is mainly from long-range transport, whereas the urban aerosols originate from local sources. Back trajectories ending in Tehran show that the northeast and west trajectories are two main transport routes for the dust to the study area.

TI  - Long-term trajectories of fractional component change in the Northern Great Basin, USA
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to monitor change in sagebrush steppe is urgent due to the increasing impacts of climate change, shifting fire regimes, and management practices on ecosystem health. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective and reliable method for monitoring change through time and attributing changes to drivers. We report an automated method of mapping rangeland fractional component cover over a large portion of the Northern Great Basin, USA, from 1986 to 2016 using a dense Landsat imagery time series. Our method improved upon the traditional change vector method by considering the legacy of change at each pixel. We evaluate cover trends stratified by climate bin and assess spatial and temporal relationships with climate variables. Finally, we statistically evaluate the minimum time density needed to accurately characterize temporal patterns and relationships with climate drivers. Over the 30-yr period, shrub cover declined and bare ground increased. While few pixels had > 10% cover change, a large majority had at least some change. All fractional components had significant spatial relationships with water year precipitation (WYPRCP), maximum temperature (WYTMAX), and minimum temperature (WYTMIN) in all years. Shrub and sagebrush cover in particular respond positively to warming WYTMIN, resulting from the largest increases in WYTMIN being in the coolest and wettest areas, and respond negatively to warming WYTMAX because the largest increases in WYTMAX are in the warmest and driest areas. The trade-off of lowering temporal density against removing cloud-contaminated years is justified as temporal density appears to have only a modest impact on trends and climate relationships until n = 6, but multi-year gaps are proportionally more influential. Gradual change analysis is likely to be less sensitive to n than abrupt change. These data can be used to answer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and the suitability of management practices.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this inquiry is to insist and illustrate with examples the need of risking and rework as far as possible, within a situated context, a set of conceptual tools. These tools should make possible to set out again certain theoretical and practical questions on an experimental basis. These experiments seek to develop a creative and symbolic resistance in all fields.Creating a brief genealogy of Patricia Hill Collins' concept of matrix of domination, it summary examines the way in which Ludwig Wittgenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Virginia Woolf and Collins herself prepare their set of speculative instruments. With this analysis, we hope to find certain common elements that help to create new tools of investigation. Those tools should recognize and dismantle the dominant worldview in order to cause deep changes in our reality.

TI  - The Association Between Hunter-Killed Deer and Lyme Disease in New Jersey, 2000-2014
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Years when the deer population is robust during the autumn hunting season may point toward an elevated risk of Lyme disease (LD) in the human population two summers later. We applied overdispersed Poisson regression models to county-specific data from New Jersey for each year from 2000 to 2014. The average relative risk of LD for each additional hunter-killed deer per square mile was 1.12 (1.10, 1.14) for 2000-2007 and 1.11 (1.09, 1.13) for 2008-2014. The hunting data already collected for conservation and wildlife management purposes may be a relevant component of LD surveillance activities.

TI  - Spatio-temporal mangrove canopy variation (2001-2016) assessed using the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Variation patterns in mangrove canopies were evaluated for the Marismas Nacionales coastal ecosystem (northwest Mexico), based on a monthly time series (2001 to 2016) of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). By using a non-centralized normalized principal component analysis (PCA), the imagery series was decomposed to the S and T modes, allowing the identification of recurrent temporal patterns as well as spatial patterns over time. It was found that the maximum vegetation vigor in mangroves occurs in autumn, 4-5months after the driest season, while approximately 15% of the mangrove canopy displayed decreasing trends because of disturbance events, including anomalies in temperature and precipitation. Most of the mangrove canopy was stable (78%), while the remaining 7% was found to be in a recovery phase. The most vulnerable mangrove canopies were detected in areas defined in previous studies as dominated by Avicenia germinans, while resistant and resilient forests where located in areas dominated by Laguncularia racemosa.

TI  - How well do global burned area products represent fire patterns in the Brazilian Savannas biome? An accuracy assessment of the MCD64 collections
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the current fire dynamics in the Brazilian Savannas (Cerrado) relies heavily on satellite-derived burned area (BA) products applied at the biome level. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of studies analyzing the consistency of available available satellite products concerning BA location and extension for the region. Accordingly, we performed an accuracy assessment of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 BA product (MCD64 /C6) over 222,768,000 ha encompassing the Brazilian Cerrado. We used reference data derived from Landsat-8 OLI to perform an intercomparison of MCD64/C6 with 1) the previous collection 5.1 (C5.1); 2) independent active fires from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS); and 3) recent land use patterns. The results of the comparison between C6 and C5.1 indicate that the new collection decreases the omission error in 90% of the analyzed area and increases the burn hits, providing improved BA estimates in 61% of the region. However, the MCD64 product increases the overall commission errors in 74% of the area. The MCD64/C6 product showed a high coefficient of correlation with active fires independently detected by VIIRS (tau = 0.74). For both MCD64 collections 5.1 and 6, the different accuracy assessment measures exhibited a marked performance deterioration from the north towards the south. The largest bum scars and total affected areas occur mainly across the northern Cerrado, explaining the better performance in that area. Conversely, greater inaccuracies were found in the southern Cerrado area, where natural vegetation has been converted into pasture and cropland, leading to fragmented landscapes and small fire patches. Finally, the BAs mapped by both collections were similar in location albeit divergent in the magnitude, with C6 detecting 21% more area than C5.1 during the year 2015.

TI  - Classification of Landsat 8 images in the Segura Hydrographic Demarcation
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a cartography of land uses in the Segura Hydrographic Demarcation obtained by classifying 2017 Landsat 8 images. The classification was carried out using two classifiers: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). Training areas were obtained from historical high resolution imagery until 2016. Prior to classification, a cross validation analysis of the training areas was carried out to determine which of them may have undergone a change of use between 2016 and 2017. The results obtained with ML and RF, both with the original set of training areas and with the one obtained eliminating the problem, are compared to determine the best option. In the case of ML, the results improve after eliminating the changing training areas, from 77.7% to 81.4%; however, with RF this improvement is not so important, going from 84.1% to 85.1%. Therefore, it can be concluded that, with both methods, the classification is more exact when the modified training areas are used and, although the results obtained are quite acceptable for both ML and RF, the latter performs a more accurate classification.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of eddies in the Kamchatka Current from its source in the Bering Sea to Paramushir Island south of Kamchatka are considered for the first time. The Kamchatka Current in the Olyutorsky Bay contains anticyclonic eddies having a cold core of low salinity with the diameter to 90 km and to 120 km located south of the Avacha Bay. The characteristics of the Kamchatka Current eddies are determined using Terra and Aqua satellite data and the data of Argo buoys and surface drifters. The maximum velocity of a surface current in an eddy south of Kamchatka reaches 1 m/s. Satellite observations demonstrate that such eddies propagate in the Bering Sea from east to west to the latitude of Karaginsky Island and further to southwest to the Kamchatka Strait. The thermohaline characteristics of the eddies located in the northwestern Bering Sea and south of Kamchatka are close to each other. At the same time, during 1990-2017, in the eddy core temperature rose by 1 degrees C and salinity decreased by 0.5 psu. Salinity anomalies at minimum temperature were significant in 1990 and 2004-2006 and were small in 1996-1998 and 2015-2016. The most probable reason for the salinity variations at minimum temperature is that the intensity of tidal mixing varies in the lunar nodal cycle.

AB  - In Consecrating Science, Lisa Sideris argues that an anthropocentric and science-based cosmology encourages human arrogance and diminishes a sense of wonder in human experience immersed in the natural world, as found in diverse cultural and religious traditions. I agree with her that science elevated to a commanding worldview, scientism, is a common and contemporary mistake, to be deplored, a lame science. But I further argue that science has introduced us to the marvels of deep nature and vastly increased our human appreciation of nature as a wonderland at levels great and small. Sideris is right to fear consecrating science. She-and the humanists, sages, and saviors-need also to fear blindness to what science has to teach us about cosmogenesis and wonderland Earth.

TI  - Seasonal Differences in Dielectric Properties of Dwarf Woody Tundra Vegetation in a Microwave Range
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is vital to study seasonal variations in dielectric properties of woody tundra vegetation for the development of algorithms for satellite data interpretation and for the accuracy improvement of microwave methods for remote tundra sensing. This paper presents the measurement results of dielectric characteristics of dwarf birch (Betula nana) and willow (Salicaceae) at a frequency of 1.41 GHz. Vegetation samples were taken in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in different seasons (April, August, and November). Dielectric properties were measured by means of a bridge-type setup in the temperature range from 263 to 293 K at different water content in plant samples. Seasonal differences in temperature dependences of the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity (CP), the loss-angle tangent were established for the studied tree species. These variations were caused by the water amount change in plants, the formation of ice in plant cells, the difference in dielectric properties of dry wood, cell sap, and ice. For branches and leaves, empirical dependences of CP on volume moisture were established. CP is higher in branch wood than that of in leaves due to greater volume of free water in the intercellular space of branch wood. Significant seasonal differences in woody tundra CP are indicative of the need for consideration of such seasonal changes under tundra remote sensing.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To ascertain the increase in detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) associated with the use of indocyanine green (ICG) in comparison with methylene blue dye in women with endometrial cancer.Methods. For this randomized controlled trial, all patients underwent SLN mapping after injection of blue dye on one side of the cervix and ICG on the other side. Randomization was for the side (right vs. left) on which ICG was used so that each patient's contralateral hemipelvis (HP) served as a control to her ipsilateral HP. We performed a two-tailed, normal-approximate McNemar test for paired-matched data. The primary endpoint was the difference in SLN detection rate for each HP according to the dye used.Results. This trial included 132 patients, and 46 patients underwent robotic-assisted surgery while 86 had standard laparoscopic surgery. Successful detection of SLN was 90.9% using ICG and 64.4% using blue dye (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in the duration of the SLN procedure (median 10 min per HP) and number of SLN per HP (mean 1.2) according to the dye used. The SLN detection rates for either dye were very similar whether the surgical approach was robotic (mean BMI 45) or laparoscopic (mean BMI 29). Crossover of dye to the contralateral HP was present in 3% of cases.Conclusion. The use of ICG instead of blue dye results in a 26.5% (95% CI 17.4%-35.6%) increase of SLN detection rates per HP in women with endometrial cancer. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - THE MEANING OF SOUND IN THE CREATION OF FILM CHARACTER` INNER WORLD (BY THE EXAMPLE OF L. SHEPITKO'S FILM "ASCENT")
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating of the inner world of the film character onscreen is the most important stage in the process of forming an integral artistic image of the film. In cinema, as a synthetic art, the artistic image is provided with the help of a complex system of interaction of visual and sound means of expressiveness. The paper is to analyze the possibilities of sound engineering techniques that contribute to the reflection of the inner world of the movie character, the various states of his consciousness and mental activity. In film phonogram, a number of techniques are used to promote not only a clearer understanding of the spatial differences within the film's form by viewers, but also to fuller reveal the artistic and ideological plan, as well as the aesthetics and even the director's worldview such as: spatial-temporal and frequency-dynamic sound processing, sound design. To establish a special sound atmosphere of the various artistic spaces, aesthetical possibilities of sound landscapes are applied. The paper displays the development of audiovisual solution of the author's film, including the concept of film music, as exemplified by an outstanding work of the Russian film director Larisa Shepitko "Ascend". As the author concludes the development of the sound component of the film's general audiovisual concept can be crucial not only for shaping of the individual character's artistic image, but also for expressing of aesthetic principles, artistic style and world view of the film director.

AB  - This paper applies outcome-based school aid to Ohio's FY 2014 school district data to find systematic patterns between school aid parameters and outcome equity as well as fiscal equity. Empirical findings suggest that outcome-based power-equalizing aid improves both fiscal and outcome equity more than Ohio's aid formula does, with partial outcome targeting enhancing the equity even more. Outcome-based foundation aid improves the equity more than Ohio's aid does only when negative aid is allowed. This paper makes another contribution to the literature by providing a method to adjust the range of simulated aid within the current school aid budgets.

TI  - Special Issue on "Advances in Remote Sensing and Geoscience Information Systems of the Coastal Environments"
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Advanced remote sensing (RS) and geoscience information system (GIS) have become more essential to understanding the coastal environmental characteristics of Earth surfaces. In this special issue, a total of 52 papers have been published. These papers studied on a variety seas including the Yellow Sea (YS), East China Sea (ECS), South China Sea, Arctic Ocean, North West Pacific, and the Greenland Sea. Forty of these papers studied on the YS and the ECS. Remotely sensed data from various platforms, including satellite, airborne, unmanned aircraft, Helikite and Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) images, were used for analysis, and GIS spatial data, reanalysis data and models were also utilized. Ocean colour images were mainly applied to detect marine environment changes (SST, chlorophyll-a and suspended particle matter) and benthic and floating vegetation. High-resolution images were mainly used in the analysis of topographic changes, sedimentary phases and habitat changes in small study areas. SAR images were mainly used for detection of oil spill and sea ice, and could also be used in studies to estimate the moving speed of the target using dual receive antenna mode of the SAR sensor. Unmanned aerial vehicles were mainly used to analyze geographical features and topographic deformation along the coast. Furthermore, hyperspectral images were used for precise detection of vegetation and oil spill studies.

TI  - KWENENG: HOW TO LOSE A PRECOLONIAL CITY
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR imagery has revealed a precolonial Tswana capital, Kweneng, just south of Johannesburg. How could such an extensive town have gone unnoticed for two centuries? Tests reveal that vegetation obscured many of the ruins. Another reason is that Kweneng lies in a historical blind spot, and the memory of the place does not seem to have survived the Difeqane civil wars of the early 19th century. A third important reason is that an earlier generation of archaeologists who examined aerial photographs of this area in the 1960s failed to record the extraordinarily dense concentration of ruins at Kweneng.

TI  - Unsupervised Deep Change Vector Analysis for Multiple-Change Detection in VHR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) in multitemporal images is an important application of remote sensing. Recent technological evolution provided very high spatial resolution (VHR) multitemporal optical satellite images showing high spatial correlation among pixels and requiring an effective modeling of spatial context to accurately capture change information. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised context-sensitive framework-deep change vector analysis (DCVA)-for CD in multitemporal VHR images that exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) features. To have an unsupervised system, DCVA starts from a suboptimal pretrained multilayered CNN for obtaining deep features that can model spatial relationship among neighboring pixels and thus complex objects. An automatic feature selection strategy is employed layerwise to select features emphasizing both high and low prior probability change information. Selected features from multiple layers are combined into a deep feature hypervector providing a multiscale scene representation. The use of the same pretrained CNN for semantic segmentation of single images enables us to obtain coherent multitemporal deep feature hypervectors that can be compared pixelwise to obtain deep change vectors that also model spatial context information. Deep change vectors are analyzed based on their magnitude to identify changed pixels. Then, deep change vectors corresponding to identified changed pixels are binarized to obtain a compressed binary deep change vectors that preserve information about the direction (kind) of change. Changed pixels are analyzed for multiple CD based on the binary features, thus implicitly using the spatial information. Experimental results on multitemporal data sets ofWorldview-2, Pleiades, and Quickbird images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - From governing behaviour to transformative change: A typology of household energy initiatives in Switzerland
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a study of fifty initiatives aimed at reducing energy usage among Swiss households, we uncover what representations of change and forms of engagement are put forward by these initiatives, and the related policy implications. Two ideal-types emerge from our analysis: first, the dominant worldview of change as based on governing behaviour towards 'better' individual choices, made possible through rationalising, evaluating, and awareness-raising; second, an ideal-type which involves representations of change based on recognizing the social embeddedness of practices and socio-technical systems. Initiatives that fall into this category seek to transform how everyday life plays out, in relation to energy services and systems of provision, while challenging dominant norms around individuals as central to change. In comparing the Swiss case to over 1,000 initiatives across Europe, we discuss what makes Switzerland a forerunner in relation to this second ideal type. Further, we assess how different forms of engagement are at play, involving the participation of diverse groups of people in initiative design and implementation, while aiming towards more durable, effective and innovative solutions which we see as a subset of the two ideal types, and one that merits further study.

TI  - Evaluating the variability of ANPP in central Iranian arid and semi-arid rangelands using CASA model and its relationship with climatic factors
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) plays an important role in regulating ecological processes and carbon cycle in arid and semi-arid rangelands. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of rangeland ANPP in seven bioclimatic zones in Isfahan Province using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) ecosystem model fitted with MODIS-NDVI and climatic data during 2000-2016. The model evaluation indicated a good agreement between the estimated and observed ANPP (R-2 = 0.917). In concomitant with the precipitation gradient, the mean annual ANPP increased from east towards west and southwest of the region from zero to 160 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The maximum and minimum ANPP values occurred in humid and cold as well as hyper-arid and warm zone, respectively. The annual temporal variability of ANPP was analyzed in response to climatic factors (precipitation and temperature), Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) drought indices. The drought was found as the most important factor affecting ANPP. The minimum and maximum ANPP values were observed in 2000 (23.23 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and 2014 (41.73 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The maximum ANPP occurred in May and June during which temperature, as an important factor in plant growth, reached its optimum and precipitation affected with a time lag. The annual rangeland ANPP was positively associated with precipitation and negatively with temperature.

TI  - Evaluation of influenza surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Influenza infrastructure systems are crucial for maintaining surveillance operations, and for mitigating and responding to the disease. The role of surveillance is to isolate and identify as rapidly as possible any new influenza strains and collate this information for the preparedness for, and response to, an impending influenza activity in humans. However, sources of surveillance information, particularly in Africa, are meagre. This systematic review will critically evaluate the existing influenza surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa.Method and analysis We will build multiple electronic database search strategies for use in PubMed, Scopus, African Journal Online, Web of Science and Google scholar to identify as many studies as possible. The medical subject heading and keywords will include a wide range of synonyms, both in index terms and freetext words. Database search will be followed by hand searching of reference lists of all relevant studies. We will include eligible full-text studies published from 2002 in order to coincide with the establishment of the integrated disease surveillance and response system in Africa by WHO. We will examine the influenza surveillance performance systems using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on evaluating public health surveillance systems. Our outcome measures will include surveillance system attributes such as timeliness, sensitivity, specificity, acceptability, representativeness, simplicity and usefulness. We will conduct a narrative synthesis of all studies.Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethics approval because it uses publicly available data. Our findings will be published in a peer review journal and disseminated to policy makers.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wildfire Using a Small Unmanned Aerial System: Post-Fire Mapping, Vegetation Recovery and Damage Analysis in Grand Bay, Mississippi/Alabama, USA
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires can be beneficial for native vegetation. However, wildfires can impact property values, human safety, and ecosystem function. Resource managers require safe, easy to use, timely, and cost-effective methods for quantifying wildfire damage and regeneration. In this work, we demonstrate an approach using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with a MicaSense RedEdge multispectral sensor to classify and estimate wildfire damage in a coastal marsh. We collected approximately 7.2 km(2) of five-band multispectral imagery after a wildfire event in February 2016, which was used to create a photogrammetry-based digital surface model (DSM) and orthomosaic for object-based classification analysis. Airborne light detection and ranging data were used to validate the accuracy of the DSM. Four-band airborne imagery from pre- and post-fire were used to estimate pre-fire health, post-fire damage, and track the vegetation recovery process. Immediate and long-term post-fire classifications, area, and volume of burned regions were produced to track the revegetation progress. The UAS-based classification produced from normalized difference vegetation index and DSM was compared to the Landsat-based Burned Area Reflectance Classification. Experimental results show the potential of using UAS and the presented approach compared to satellite-based mapping in terms of classification accuracies, turnaround time, and spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - TRANSITIONAL ART FOR THE CAPITALOCENE
T2  - ARTE Y POLITICAS DE IDENTIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The study will embrace the concept of Capitalocene (J. Moore, 2015), to encompass not only the question of overexploitation of the physical world, but also the existence of power structures and groups that mark the historical and cultural construction responsible for overcoming the limits of the planet. The environmental crisis, led by climate change and the loss of biodiversity along with the end of fossil fuels, are the greatest challenges of our time. It is a crisis of our livelihoods, as well as our culture, worldview and the construction of knowledge. It requires the attention of all disciplines, sectors and agents, including the humanities, and specifically, art. This article focuses on studying one of the most recent artistic manifestations -transitional art- born in the United Kingdom (Neal, 2015) and related to the Transition Town Movement (TTM). Through a case study in Spain and the United Kingdom we seek to identify what type of art corresponds to the challenges of the Capitalocene, to later verify what characteristics of transitional art are appropriate to our time and finally to know if transitional art can respond to this global challenge.

TI  - Detecting inundation thresholds for dryland wetland vulnerability
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland wetlands receiving periodical floods are of key importance for ecological resilience. The inundation regime (i.e., frequency, duration, depth, and timing of inundation), is one of the major factors that determine the suitability of local conditions for specific wetland species. During droughts, inundation conditions can reach a threshold after which wetland vegetation could transition to dryland vegetation. This study analyses the response of vegetation to hydrologic variability in an arid wetland in Australia over a period of 22 years (including the Millennium drought) in order to identify inundation thresholds for transitions. We use numerical modelling, field observations and remote sensing data to relate continuous detailed simulations of the inundation regime with the response of patches of Common reed, Water couch and River red gum, three key vegetation associations in the study site. We focus in patches that were affected by the drought and presented dryland vegetation invasion as well as reference patches that remained healthy throughout the drought. On each patch, we compare annual and inter-annual simulated inundation regimes to the minimum inundation conditions that can support the specific vegetation, and we compute the percentage area of the patch that verifies minimum inundation for each year. We define this area percentage as minimum inundation index. This index is analysed in conjunction with Landsat derived information on green vegetation coverage (green Seasonal Fractional Cover) for the selected patches. We found that the minimum inundation index and inter annual frequency are able to describe the vegetation dynamics of the patches, which can be characterised by two distinct response modes that depend on a threshold value of the minimum inundation index. Inundation below the threshold noticeably leads to degraded vegetation, but the vegetation can recover quickly if this threshold is later maintained for one or two years. Values below the threshold for more extended periods (drought) result in a gradual decrease of wetland vegetation to almost complete disappearance after four years and subsequent dryland vegetation invasion.

TI  - Langer's axillary arch lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients: A prospective clinical study
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Latissimus dorsi, an anatomical landmark for axillary lymph node dissection, was reported to harbor an anatomical variation named Langer's axillary arch (LAA). However, the incidence and clinical significance of LAA in breast cancer remain obscure.Methods: We conducted a six-year prospective study, including 1724 breast cancer patients in Qilu hospital between January 2012 to February 2018. All patients received ALND were inspected for existence of LAA. All the surgeries were completed with the involvement of same experienced surgeon. Once the LAA was identified, all the lymph nodes located lateral to it, named LAA's lymph node, were dissected and collected for pathologic examination.Results: Among 1724 breast cancer patients, LAA was identified in 132 patients (7.66%). 120 out of the 132 patients (90.91%) had at least two LAA's lymph nodes. 21 out of 120 patients (17.50%) were confirmed with cancer cell metastasis in LAA's lymph nodes. Among the 23 patients received sentinel lymph node tracing, sentinel lymph node was located lateral to LAA in 3 patients (13.04%).Conclusions: Our results indicated that it is of great importance for surgeons to correctly ascertain LAA, and it should be taken as a nonnegligible parts during ALND or SLNB.

TI  - SAR-Mode Altimetry Observations of Internal Solitary Waves in the Tropical Ocean Part 2: A Method of Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is demonstrated that the synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL) on board of the Sentinel-3A can detect short-period internal solitary waves (ISWs) with scales of the order of a kilometer. A variety of signatures owing to the surface manifestations of the ISWs are apparent in the SRAL Level-2 products over the ocean. These signatures are identified in several geophysical parameters, such as radar backscatter () and sea level anomaly (SLA). Radar backscatter is the primary parameter in which ISWs can be identified owing to the measurable sea surface roughness perturbations in the along-track direction resulting from the sharpened SRAL footprint. The SRAL footprint is sufficiently small (300 m in the along-track direction) to capture radar power fluctuations over successive wave crests and troughs, which produce rough and slick surface patterns arrayed in parallel bands with scales of a few kilometers along-track. Furthermore, it was possible to calculate the mean square slope () for the dual-band (Ku and C bands) altimeter of Sentinel-3, which made the ISW signatures unambiguously identified because of the large variations in exact synergy with ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) images. Hence, the detection method is validated in cloud-free sun glint OLCI images. It is shown that both and SLA yield realistic estimates for routine observation of ISWs with the SRAL. The detection method that is used relies on the parameter which is calculated from . This is a significant improvement from previous observations recently reported for conventional pulse-limited altimeters (Jason-2). An algorithm is developed to be used in any ocean region. Wavelets were applied for a first analysis of the variations because ISWs can be readily identified in high-frequency signals. Other geophysical parameters such as SLA were used to exclude phenomena that are unlikely to be ISWs.

T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widely distributed in Armenia bisexual and parthenogenetic species of Darevskia rock lizards have the potential to be considered as bioindicators of the effects of environmental pollutants. Juvenile and adult bisexual D. raddei and parthenogenetic D. armeniaca lizards were sampled from four locations with different levels of soil contamination. The comet assay, micronucleus (MN) test and global DNA methylation detection were applied in peripheral blood erythrocytes to assess genotoxic and epigenetic effects of pollutants. The concentrations of heavy metals were analyzed in the corresponding soil samples. In polluted areas levels of DNA damage were significantly higher and levels of global DNA methylation were significantly lower in both species than in reference sites. The levels of comets and global DNA methylation decreased with age but did not depend on sex. MN test did not show significant differences among localities or between sexes and age groups. The positive correlation between DNA damage and contents of Cr, Cu, As and Mo and negative correlation between global DNA methylation and contents of Cr, Cu, Zn, Mo and Pb were shown for D. raddei. The positive correlations between DNA damage and contents of Cr, Zn and Pb and negative correlations between global DNA methylation and contents of Cr, Zn, Mo, Cd and Pb were revealed for D. armeniaca. The correlation results for some metals are different in juveniles and adults. D. armeniaca showed higher sensitivity toward environmental pollution than D. raddei in their common habitat. Genetic homogeneity of parthenogenetic lizards permits to evaluate the effects of environmental pollutants independently from inter-individual genetic variation. In conclusion, the current study suggests that DNA damage and global DNA methylation may be applied to Darevskia lizards as a sentinel organism for assessing the effects of environmental pollutants.

TI  - Assessing <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG Uptake in the Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - F-18-FDG PET/CT has limited value in early breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the current procedure of choice to search for small metastatic deposits in the axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer. In this retrospective study, we reevaluated F-18-FDG PET/CT images after locating the SLN on PET/CT with the help of SLN SPECT/CT images and assessed F-18-FDG uptake, particularly in the SLN. Our goal was to understand if combined evaluation of F-18-FDG PET/CT and SLN SPECT/CT could be useful for detecting early lymph node metastasis in the axilla. Methods: F-18-FDG PET/CT images of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who also had SLN scintigraphy (SPECT/CT) and biopsy results were analyzed to assess F-18-FDG uptake in the SLN. The SLN seen on SPECT/CT images was located on PET/CT images, and its metabolic activity was assessed both visually and semiquantitatively using SUVmax. F-18-FDG PET results were compared with the histopathology result for the SLN. Results: Twenty patients among 130 met the inclusion criteria. SLN SPECT/CT images were helpful for locating the SLN on F-18-FDG PET/CT images in all 20 patients. Histopathologic analysis of the SLNs demonstrated metastasis in 7 patients and no metastasis in 13. There was mild (visible) F-18-FDG uptake in the SLN (SUVmax, 1.2-4.1; metastatic deposit size, 68 mm) in 6 of 7 patients with SLN metastasis (85.7%). There was no or only faint F-18-FDG uptake in the SLN (SUVmax, 1) in 9 of 13 patients with no SLN metastasis (69.2%). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis indicated that the SUVmax cutoff for differentiating SLN-positive from -negative cases was 0.85 (sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 61.5%; area under the curve, 0.747; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Combined evaluation of F-18-FDG PET/CT and SPECT/CT images to assess F-18-FDG uptake, particularly in the SLN, is a new image analysis technique to detect early metastatic disease in the axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer. Although this technique does not currently seem feasible for use in routine practice, mainly because of the limitations of current PET/CT technology in detecting small tumors, it is an interesting image analysis technique to be aware of for possible future use.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the Western Basin of Lake Erie: A 20-year time-series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Blooms of harmful cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) have occurred on an annual basis in western Lake Erie for more than a decade. Previously, we developed and validated an algorithm to map the extent of the submerged and surface scum components of cyanoHABs using MODIS ocean-color satellite data. The algorithm maps submerged cyanoHABs by identifying high chlorophyll concentrations (>18 mg/m(3)) combined with water temperature >20 degrees C, while cyanoHABs surface scums are mapped using near-infrared reflectance values. Here, we adapted this algorithm for the SeaWiFS sensor to map the annual areal extents of cyanoHABs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie for the 20-year period from 1998 to 2017. The resulting classified maps were validated by comparison with historical in situ measurements, exhibiting good agreement (81% accuracy). Trends in the annual mean and maximum total submerged and surface scum extents demonstrated significant positive increases from 1998 to 2017. There was also an apparent 76% increase in year-to-year variability of mean annual extent between the 1998-2010 and 2011-2017 periods. The 1998-2017 time-series was also compared with several different river discharge nutrient loading metrics to assess the ability to predict annual cyanoHAB extents. The prediction models displayed significant relationships between spring discharge and cyanoHAB area; however, substantial variance remained unexplained due in part to the presence of very large blooms occurring in 2013 and 2015. This new multi-sensor time-series and associated statistics extend the current understanding of the extent, location, duration, and temporal patterns of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie.

TI  - Semi-automated open water iceberg detection from Landsat applied to Disko Bay, West Greenland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in Greenland's marine-terminating outlet glaciers have led to changes in the flux of icebergs into Greenland's coastal waters, yet icebergs remain a relatively understudied component of the ice-ocean system. We developed a simple iceberg delineation algorithm for Landsat imagery. A machine learning-based cloud mask incorporated into the algorithm enables us to extract iceberg size distributions from open water even in partially cloudy scenes. We applied the algorithm to the Landsat archive covering Disko Bay, West Greenland, to derive a time series of iceberg size distributions from 2000-02 and 2013-15. The time series captures a change in iceberg size distributions, which we interpret as a result of changes in the calving regime of the parent glacier, Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbrx). The change in calving style associated with the disintegration and disappearance of Sermeq Kujalleq's floating ice tongue resulted in the production of more small icebergs. The increased number of small icebergs resulted in increasingly negative power law slopes fit to iceberg size distributions in Disko Bay, suggesting that iceberg size distribution time series provide useful insights into changes in calving dynamics.

TI  - Greenspace and Infant Mortality in Philadelphia, PA
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite mounting evidence that urban greenspace protects against mortality in adults, few studies have explored the relationship between greenspace and death among infants. Here, we describe results from an analysis of associations between greenness and infant mortality in Philadelphia, PA. We used images of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from processed satellite data, to estimate greenness density in each census tract. We linked these data with census tract level counts of total infant mortality cases (n=963) and births (n=113,610) in years 2010-2014, and used Bayesian spatial areal unit, conditional autoregressive models to estimate associations between greenness and infant mortality. The models included a set of random effects to account for spatial autocorrelation between neighboring census tracts. Infant mortality counts were modeled using a Poisson distribution, and the logarithm of total births in each census tract was specified as the offset term. The following variables were included as potential confounders and effect modifiers: percentage non-Hispanic black, percentage living below the poverty line, an indicator of housing quality, and population density. In adjusted models, the rate of infant mortality was 27% higher in less green compared to more green tracts (95% CI 1.02-1.59). These results contribute further evidence that greenspace may be a health promoting environmental asset.

TI  - Removing Stripes, Scratches, and Curtaining with Nonrecoverable Compressed Sensing
T2  - MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly-directional image artifacts such as ion mill curtaining, mechanical scratches, or image striping from beam instability degrade the interpretability of micrographs. These unwanted, aperiodic features extend the image along a primary direction and occupy a small wedge of information in Fourier space. Deleting this wedge of data replaces stripes, scratches, or curtaining, with more complex streaking and blurring artifacts-known within the tomography community as missing wedge artifacts. Here, we overcome this problem by recovering the missing region using total variation minimization, which leverages image sparsity-based reconstruction techniques-colloquially referred to as compressed sensing (CS)-to reliably restore images corrupted by stripe-like features. Our approach removes beam instability, ion mill curtaining, mechanical scratches, or any stripe features and remains robust at low signal-to-noise. The success of this approach is achieved by exploiting CS's inability to recover directional structures that are highly localized and missing in Fourier Space.

TI  - Fragmentation, forest structure, and topography modulate impacts of drought in a tropical forest landscape
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models predict increases in drought conditions in many parts of the tropics. Yet the response of tropical forests to drought remains highly uncertain, especially with regards to the factors that generate spatial heterogeneity in drought response across landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat imagery to assess the impacts of a severe drought in 2015 across an 80,000-ha landscape in Puerto Rico. Specifically, we asked whether drought effects varied systematically with topography and with forest age, height, and fragmentation. We quantified drought impacts using anomalies of two vegetation indices, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), and fit random forest models of these metrics including slope, aspect, forest age, canopy height, and two indices of fragmentation as predictors. Drought effects were more severe on drier topographic positions, that is, steeper slopes and southwest-facing aspects, and in second-growth forests. Shorter and more fragmented forests were also more strongly affected by drought. We also assessed which factors were associated with stronger recovery from drought. Factors associated with more negative drought anomalies were also associated with more positive postdrought anomalies, suggesting that increased light availability as a result of drought led to high rates of recovery in forests more severely affected by drought. In general, recovery from drought was rapid across the landscape, with postdrought anomalies at or above average across the study area. This suggests that forests in Puerto Rico might be resilient to a single-year drought, though vulnerability to drought varies depending on forest characteristics and landscape position.

TI  - Applying Spatial Mapping of Remotely Sensed Data to Valuation of Coastal Ecosystem Services in the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial mapping of remote sensing data tends to be used less when valuing coastal ecosystem services than in other ecosystems. This research project aimed to understand obstacles to the use of remote sensing data in coastal ecosystem valuations, and to educate coastal stakeholders on potential remote sensing data sources and techniques. A workshop program identified important barriers to the adoption of remote sensing data: perceived gaps in spatial and temporal scale, uncertainty about confidence intervals and precision of remote sensing data, and linkages between coastal ecosystem services and values. Case studies that demonstrated the state of the science were used to show methods to overcome the barriers. The case studies demonstrate multiple approaches to valuation that have been used successfully in coastal projects, and validate that spatial mapping of remote sensing data may fill critical gaps, such as cost-effectively generating calibrated historical data.

TI  - Compliance Rates, Advantages, and Drawbacks of a Smartphone-Based Method of Collecting Food History and Foodborne Illness Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of comprehensive data on both food exposure history and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with foodborne illness is typically challenging because of poor compliance with data collection methods. Smartphone technology provides a convenient tool with which to collect data on food consumption behavior and foodborne illness. Ethica, a smartphone-based application used to acquire, store, and analyze data on human behavior, was evaluated as a potential supplement to current data collection strategies. The purpose of this study was to assess the compliance rates, advantages, and drawbacks of a smartphone-based method of collecting food history and foodborne illness data from a sample of volunteers. Through a combination of user-triggered and prompted microsurveys, meal descriptions, and photo food diaries, the food consumption behavior of 96 university students was investigated over a period of 10 weeks. During the first 10 days of the study, 95% of participants used the time-triggered microsurveys and 51% of participants used the digital image features of the app to report food consumption history at least twice per day. Approximately 34% of participants used at least one of the reporting features to report at least one episode of vomiting or nausea during this period, and 29% reported at least one episode of diarrhea; only 7% sought medical care. The smartphone-based method of data collection used in this study allowed capture of uniquely detailed food history data and data on gastrointestinal symptoms associated with foodborne illness that were not reported to medical practitioners and public health. This enhanced ability to gather in-depth information from sentinel and at-risk target populations could support foodborne illness surveillance. Compliance rates, advantages, and limitations discussed in this study can guide the development of future data collection strategies.HIGHLIGHTSUniquely detailed food history data can be captured through smartphone applications.Compliance was related to efficiency, automated reminders, and minimal user burden.Many participants (55%) reported nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea over the 10-week study.Only 7% of individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms sought medical care.Smartphone-based data collection tools can support disease surveillance strategies.

It is shown that the key formula of the synthesized band variant can be simplified under certain circumstances. In addition, a novel fusion schema is proposed. As a result, the gain factor adopted to weight the injected detail is computed in a different way. This schema can be applied to fuse a wide range of hyperspectral and multispectral data. In this letter, its effectiveness is demonstrated by taking into account the characteristics of WorldView-3 data.

TI  - Comparing Remotely-Sensed Surface Energy Balance Evapotranspiration Estimates in Heterogeneous and Data-Limited Regions: A Case Study of Tanzania's Kilombero Valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in integrated water resources planning, development and management, especially in tropical and arid regions. Determining ET is not straightforward due to the heterogeneity and complexity found in real-world hydrological basins. This situation is often compounded in regions with limited hydro-meteorological data that are facing rapid development of irrigated agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) techniques have proven useful in this regard. In this study, we compared the daily actual ET estimates derived from 3 remotely-sensed surface energy balance (SEB) models, namely, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model, the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model, and the Simplified Surface Balance Index (S-SEBI) model. These products were generated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery for a total of 44 satellite overpasses in 2005, 2010, and 2015 in the heterogeneous, highly-utilized, rapidly-developing and data-limited Kilombero Valley (KV) river basin in Tanzania, eastern Africa. Our results revealed that the SEBAL model had a relatively high ET compared to other models and the SSEBop model had relatively low ET compared to the other models. In addition, we found that the S-SEBI model had a statistically similar ET as the ensemble mean of all models. Further comparison of SEB models' ET estimates across different land cover classes and different spatial scales revealed that almost all models' ET estimates were statistically comparable (based on the Wilcoxon's test and the Levene's test at a 95% confidence level), which implies fidelity between and reliability of the ET estimates. Moreover, all SEB models managed to capture the two spatially-distinct ET regimes in KV: the stable/permanent ET regime on the mountainous parts of the KV and the seasonally varied ET over the floodplain which contains a Ramsar site (Kilombero Valley Floodplain). Our results have the potential to be used in hydrological modelling to explore and develop integrated water resources management in the valley. We believe that our approach can be applied elsewhere in the world especially where observed meteorological variables are limited.

TI  - Impact of Cartosat-1 orography on weather prediction in a high-resolution NCMRWF unified model
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study reports for the first time an application of orography from the Cartosat-1 satellite digital elevation model (DEM) generated at a source resolution of 30m in a convection-permitting numerical weather prediction model. The effects of improvements in the representation of orography have been examined in the high-resolution regional National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) Unified Model predictions for a heavy rainfall event over the city of Chennai. A time-lagged ensemble method is employed to account for the uncertainties associated with the initial conditions, which can better forecast extreme weather events than single forecasts. The simulations reveal that the predictions based on Cartosat-1 DEM capture the local details of the rainfall distribution better than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shuttle radar topography mission DEM-based predictions, and better represent the orographic and thermal uplifting. The spatio-temporal patterns of the simulated rainfall over Chennai are superior in Cartosat-1 DEM-based simulations mainly due to the enhanced wind convergence and moisture transport. The present study reveals the role of mountains in the enhancement of heavy rainfall events over coastal cities and highlights the potential use of high-resolution orography in the improvement of the operational weather forecasting skill of the NCMRWF Unified Model.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - World Brackishwater Aquaculture Conference (BRAQCON)
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - The South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) is an upwelling-dominated region, where the seasonally-reversing winds and currents are the major physical forces driving primary production. The region is characterized by high primary productivity during the summer monsoon season (June to September), when the winds and currents favor upwelling. The coast is notable for the presence of monsoonal rivers. During summer monsoon, nutrient-rich riverine water is discharged in great quantity into coastal waters. The heavy inflow of turbid, nutrient-rich water into coastal regions during the summer monsoon facilitates primary production, augmenting phytoplankton biomass. In the present study, we investigated the relative roles of upwelling and precipitation that drive productivity along the south-west coast of India. The available remote sensing data sets for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), precipitation, silicate and wind were used for the period 1998 to 2016. The Chl-a anomaly showed positive correlation with upwelling index and precipitation except during 2003 and 2012. During these years, negative anomalies for Chl-a and precipitation were observed even though the upwelling index showed positive anomalies. So the enhancement in Chl-a was nominal during those specific years even when the upwelling was very strong. This indicates the role of riverine nutrients from heavy precipitation during summer monsoon that contributes significantly to coastal productivity apart from upwelling in SEAS.

T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is the average temperature of the earth's surface which has increased over the past century by about 0.6 degrees C. This rising temperature may vary precipitation patterns, more frequent droughts, rise in sea level and intense storms and can be termed as climate change. To understand uneven precipitation pattern for monsoon dominated region like India, there is a need to study cloud processes at high resolution with the help of cloud microphysical properties. Ocean is the major and primary source of cloud whereas local water bodies and re-evaporated water over land could be secondary source. Paper focuses over ocean (Arabian Sea) as well as over land (central India) to know the effect of global warming on cloud microphysical properties such as cloud effective radius and cloud liquid water content. Warming signal in terms of rise in sea surface temperature (0.1 degrees C/decade) as well as rise in surface air temperature (0.05 degrees C/decade) are observed over Arabian Sea and central India respectively. Satellite data show an increasing (0.5 mu m/decade) trend in cloud effective radius over Arabian Sea, whereas it decreases (-0.1 mu m/decade) over central India. Increasing trend in temperature and cloud properties is may be due to warming signal. Aerosol concentration over ocean and land further helped to understand cloud processes with cloud microphysical properties. Paper will focus on the effect of warming signal in cloud properties over Arabian Sea and central India. This type of high resolution study may help to understand cloud processes which in turn may help to understand precipitation patterns.

TI  - Estimation of forest structural and compositional variables using ALS data and multi-seasonal satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced forest resource inventory (FRI) information is of critical importance for sustainable forest management. FRIs are dependent on remote sensing data and processing methods, along with field calibration/validation to generate cost-effective options for modelling forest inventory and biophysical variables over large areas. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of combining multi-seasonal multispectral satellite imagery with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for estimating basal area, species mixture and stem density for an uneven-aged tolerant hardwood forest in Ontario, Canada. Using random forest (RF) regression as a non parametric diagnostic technique, three multispectral optical sensors (i.e., Landsat-5 TM, Sentinel-2 A and WorldView-2) were compared to examine the most cost-effective sensor configuration for modelling FRI variables. The contribution of spectral predictors derived from these optical sensors as well as ALS height and intensity metrics were evaluated using RF variable importance. As part of our variable selection framework, all predictor variables were grouped into relatively independent clusters using a hierarchical variable clustering technique, which revealed the distinctiveness between information contained in spectral predictors, height- and intensity-based metrics. This indicates that ALS intensity data carry unique information complementary to passive near-infrared data for forest characterization. ALS data alone did not result in accurate models for basal area and species mixture, but predictive accuracies were improved significantly with the addition of spectral predictors. Compared to single-date images, multi-seasonal imagery proved to be more accurate for modelling FRI variables, especially when combined with ALS data. Despite its limited spatial resolution, Sentinel-2 A was found to be the most cost-effective image source for enhancing ALS-based FRI models. Using variables identified by the variable selection procedure, best subsets regression outperformed the RF models developed for diagnostic analysis, resulting in a suite of accurate and parsimonious predictive models, with coefficients of determination of 0.73, 0.90 and 0.67, for basal area, species mixture, and stem density, respectively.

TI  - Channel Imbalances and Along-Track Baseline Estimation for the GF-3 Azimuth Multichannel Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth multichannel (AMC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which contains multiple receiving antennas along the azimuth, can prevent the minimum antenna area constraint and provide high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) SAR images. Channel calibration and along-track baseline estimation are important topics in an AMC SAR system, since they have a great impact on image quality. Based on the signal model for stationary target of AMC SAR, this paper first analyses the influence of the along-track baseline and channel imbalances on SAR images by simulation. Then, a novel method to simultaneously estimate the along-track baseline, phase imbalance and range sample time imbalance (RSTI) based on the azimuth cross-correlation in the two-dimensional frequency domain is addressed. In addition, with the help of simulations and real data acquired by Gaofen-3 (GF-3), the effectiveness of this method is verified by comparing with some existing methods. Finally, this paper analyzes the estimation accuracy of this method under different scenarios and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and points out the direction for future research.

TI  - Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images Based on Multiscale Features-Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection in remote sensing images is a challenging but significant task. Due to the variety and complexity of underlying surfaces, most of the current cloud detection methods have difficulty in detecting thin cloud regions. In fact, it is quite meaningful to distinguish thin clouds from thick clouds, especially in cloud removal and target detection tasks. Therefore, we propose a method based on multiscale features-convolutional neural network (MF-CNN) to detect thin cloud, thick cloud, and noncloud pixels of remote sensing images simultaneously. Landsat 8 satellite imagery with various levels of cloud coverage is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MF-CNN model. We first stack visible, near-infrared, short-wave, cirrus, and thermal infrared bands of Landsat 8 imagery to obtain the combined spectral information. The MF-CNN model is then used to learn the multiscale global features of input images. The high-level semantic information obtained in the process of feature learning is integrated with low-level spatial information to classify the imagery into thick, thin and noncloud regions. The performance of our proposed model is compared to that of various commonly used cloud detection methods in both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Compared to other cloud detection methods, the experimental results show that our proposed method has a better performance not only in thick and thin clouds but also in the entire cloud regions.

TI  - The Effect of Rapid Population Growth on Urban Expansion and Destruction of Green Space in Tehran from 1972 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of satellite data is a very powerful tool for change detection applications especially for monitoring urban expansion. Urban expansion results in an accelerating proportion of the population living in cities and caused considerable effects on green space structures and areas. Many methods and models have been tested to determine urban expansion. In this paper, after computing the Tehran area and its green space coverage, the relationship between the population with urban expansion and green space coverage is estimated by regression analysis. As a consequence of Tehran texture and dataset for processing, raster to vector conversion was the most effective method for computing urban area, and also green space coverage was determined with normalized difference vegetation index. Machine learning algorithms such as support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (nonparametric method) were utilized to estimate green space coverage and urban area, respectively. Although RF model improves the accuracy of estimated population (R-2=0.97, RMSE=38.18, and MAE=83.44), the use of SVR model considerably improves the estimation of green space coverage (R-2=0.93, RMSE=47.12, and MAE=100.18) as well.

TI  - A Global Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Diurnal Cycle Using MODIS Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal variations of land surface temperature (LST) play a vital role in a wide range of applications such as climate change assessment, land-atmosphere interactions, and heat-related health issues in urban regions. This study uses 15 years (2003-17) of daily observations of LST Collection 6 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Aqua and the Terra satellites. A spline interpolation method is used to estimate half-hourly global LST from the MODIS measurements. A preliminary assessment of interpolated LST with hourly ground-based observations over selected stations of North America shows bias and an error of less than 1 K. Results suggest that the present interpolation method is capable of capturing the diurnal variations of LST reasonably well for different land-cover types. The diurnal cycle of LST and time of occurrence of maximum temperature are computed from the spatially and temporally consistent interpolated diurnal LST data at a global scale. Regions with higher variability in the timing of maximum LST hours and diurnal amplitude are identified in this study. The global desert regions show generally small variability of the monthly mean diurnal LST range, whereas larger areas of the global land exhibit rather higher variability in the diurnal LST range during the study period. Moreover, the changes in diurnal temperature range for the study period are examined for distinct land-cover types. Analysis of the 15-yr time series of the diurnal LST record shows an overall decrease of 0.5 K in amplitude over the Northern Hemisphere. However, the diurnal LST range shows variant changes in the Southern Hemisphere.

TI  - Appraisal of river water quality using open-access earth observation data set: a study of river Ganga at Allahabad (India)
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to provide a better understanding for appraisal and monitoring of surface water quality of the river Ganga at Allahabad (India) using open-access earth observation data set. The Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus, ETM+) data has been used for this study. The band rationing technique has been employed for this study. Water samples were collected according to the satellite passing. The ratio of the radiances at the sampling sites was obtained and validated with in situ measurements of water-quality parameters. The water-quality parameters were assessed viz. turbidity, pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, alkalinity, and total hardness. Multiple linear regression models were developed based on satellite bands. The result shows that water-quality parameters were significantly correlated with the radiance values of the ETM + image except turbidity. Multiple linear regression equations models were applied on ETM +bands for estimation of water-quality parameters and preparation of water-quality maps for different water-quality parameters of the study area. Moreover, the current study suggests that the Landsat 7 ETM+ image can be effectively used for the assessment of water-quality parameters of a river system.

TI  - Risk factors and prevalence of antibodies for <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in diaphragmatic fluid in wolverines (<i>Gulo gulo</i>) from the Northwest Territories, Canada
T2  - FOOD AND WATERBORNE PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii, a zoonotic food borne parasite that can infect almost all warm-blooded animals including people, and ranks 4th among 24 most significant global foodborne parasites listed by the World Health Organization/United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO, 2014). Exposure to T. gondii has been reported in wildlife and people in the Canadian North, despite low densities of feline definitive hosts. The ecology of this host-parasite system could be affected by changing climate and landscape in boreal and sub-Arctic regions, and surveillance data are critically needed. Wolverines are an economically and culturally important species in northern Canada due to their valuable fur. Fluid obtained from diaphragmatic muscle of 127 wolverines (Gulo gulo) were tested for antibodies to T. gondii using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A seroprevalence of 62% (Confidence Interval (CI): 53-71%) was observed. This result indicates high levels of exposure, likely either through environmental contamination with T. gondii oocysts shed by infected wild felids, or consumption of carcasses/offal of other intermediate hosts containing tissue cysts with bradyzoites in tissues. We examined factors associated with seropositivity, including age, sex, harvest location, harvest location with respect to treeline, and body condition index. Adult (>= 2 years) wolverines had 5.2 times higher odds of being sero-positive than juvenile (<1 years) wolverines. The highest seroprevalence was observed in wolverines from Sahtu and South Slave regions. Proportion of sero-positive wolverines harvested above and below the tree line was not significantly different (60% vs 65%). Age was the only significant predictor of T. gondii exposure in wolverines (using logistic regression analysis); further studies should target larger sample sizes. This study is an example of how fluid from diaphragmatic muscle can be used for screening for T. gondii antibodies in wolverines. The diaphragm, commonly collected for screening for another food borne parasite, Trichinella, in wildlife harvested for human consumption, can be used for screening of T. gondii exposure in wildlife. Due to their predatory and scavenging lifestyle and high trophic level, wolverines could serve as a sentinel species for T. gondii. (C) 2019 The Authors.

T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research work presents a comparative performance of geographic information system (GIS)-based statistical models for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of the Himalayan watershed in India. A total of 190 landslide locations covering an area of 14.63km(2) were identified in the watershed, using high-resolution linear imaging self-scanning (LISS IV) data. The causative factors used for LSM of the study area are slope, aspect, lithology, curvature, lineament density, land cover and drainage buffer. The spatial database has been prepared using remote sensing data along with ancillary data like geological maps. LSMs were prepared using information value (InV), frequency ratio (FR) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) models. The validation results using the prediction rate curve technique show 89.61%, 87.12% and 88.26% area under curve values for FR, AHP and InV models, respectively. Therefore, the frequency ratio (FR) model could be used for LSM in other parts of this hilly terrain.

TI  - Predictive factors of upstaging DCIS to invasive carcinoma in BCT vs mastectomy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Upstaging from DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma varies widely from 0 to 59%. We aim to identify risk factors associated with upstaging in all DCIS patients and based on specific surgical intervention.Methods: Patients with a pre-operative diagnosis of DCIS undergoing BCT or mastectomy were reviewed. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors for upstaging.Results: In total, 623 patients had a pre-operative diagnosis of DCIS. Upstaging occurred in 74 patients (12%) overall. There was no difference in upstaging rates between mastectomy and BCT (11% v 14% p = 0.27). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive in 4/212 patients (1%). Multivariable analysis revealed suspicion of microinvasion (OR 5.7 95%CI2.2-14.9), surgeon suspicion of invasive disease (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.4) and larger size/multicentric/extensive tumor (OR 1.9 95% CI 1.1-3.4) increase risk of upstaging.Conclusions: Suspicion of microinvasion, surgeon suspicion, and tumor size can be used to help guide the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy. For patients without these high risk characteristics, it is hard to justify the use of concurrent SLN biopsy for patients who undergo BCT. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Retrieval of Near-Shore Bathymetry From Multispectral Satellite Images Using Generalized Additive Models
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving shallow-water depth from multispectral satellite imageries appears very promising in near-shore bathy-metric mapping for its high efficiency and low costs. Lyzenga's linear band method, which currently is the most widely used algorithm in the field, performs a linear regression between some known water depths and image-derived input variables. In real-world situations, the linear assumption in Lyzenga's method cannot be exactly satisfied because of complex environmental factors, and its performance is, therefore, often limited. In this letter, we improve Lyzenga's method by introducing generalized additive models to describe the nonlinear relationship between water depths and image-derived regressors. The performance of the new method was evaluated by using Landsat-8 multispectral data over the coastal areas of Oahu Island, Hawaii. The experimental results of two independent validation regions show that the depth-retrieval accuracy of the proposed algorithm was about 20% better than that of Lyzenga's method, and the performance improvement was most pronounced in the depth interval of 5-10 m.

AB  - Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare morphological subtype of melanoma that remains uncharacterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of DM, its general demographics, clinicopathological features and disease-specific prognostic factors. DM cases were sampled from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program from between 1973 and 2017. A total of 3,657 cases (median age, 68 years) were identified. The results indicated that DM primarily occurred in Caucasian subjects, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Statistically significant overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rate differences were identified according to sex, age, treatment, T stage, N stage and SEER historic tumor stage (P<0.05). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, age >68 years, male sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II and III, and SEER historic tumor stage of the regional tumor were all factors associated with poorer OS and DSS rates. The findings also revealed that surgical treatment was associated with favorable DSS and OS rates. In conclusion, DM occurred primarily in Caucasian subjects of 60-80 years of age, with predominance in males. Furthermore, age, sex, AJCC stage, SEER historic tumor stage and surgical treatment were identified as independent prognostic factors of DM in terms of DSS and OS.

TI  - Performance of a new system using a one-step nucleic acid amplification assay for detecting lymph node metastases in breast cancer
T2  - MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for CK19 mRNA is an intraoperative diagnostic procedure for detection of lymph node metastasis. Automated Gene Amplification Detector RD-200 and the LYNOAMP CK19 gene amplification reagent as components of a new OSNA system have been developed. As an improvement over a conventional system, the new system can analyze 14 samples per run, evaluate two lymph nodes in similar to 17min, and reduce inhibition of reactions. This study was aimed at evaluating clinical performance of the new system by comparing it with performance of histopathological analysis and a conventional OSNA system. A total of 150 lymph nodes in 63 breast cancer patients (T1-3) who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection were examined intraoperatively with the new OSNA system, the conventional system, and histopathological analysis. In comparison with histopathological analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rate of the new system were 93.9, 98.8, and 96.7%, respectively. In comparison with the conventional system, similar corresponding values were obtained: 96.9, 98.8, and 98.0%, respectively. The results show that clinical performance of the new OSNA system is equivalent to that of histopathological diagnosis and the conventional OSNA system. The new system is superior to the conventional one because of processing of a greater number of samples, shorter testing time, and the absence of inhibited reactions.

TI  - Surface Reflectance Retrieval from Satellite Observation (OMI) over East Asia Using Minimum Reflectance Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study derived spectral Lambertian Equivalent Reflectance (LER) over East Asia from the observations of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard polar-orbit satellite Aura. The climatological (October 2004-September 2007) LER values were compared with the surface reflectance products of OMI or MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in terms of the atmosphere-environment variables as follows: wavelength (UV, visible), surface properties (land, ocean), and cloud filtering. Four kinds of LER outputs in the UV and visible region (328-500 nm) were retrieved based on the averages of lowest (1, 5, and 10%) surface reflectance values as well as the minimum reflectance. The average of the lowest 10% among them was in best agreement with the OMI product: correlation coefficient (0.88), RMSE (1.0%) and mean bias (-0.3%). The 10% average and OMI LER values over ocean were 2% larger in UV than in visible, while the values over land were 1% smaller. The LER variability on the wavelength and surface property was highest (similar to 3%) in the condition of both land and visible, particularly in the ice-cap and desert regions. The minimum reflectance values over the oceanic and inland sample areas overestimated the MODIS product by 1.4%. This high-resolution MODIS observations were effective in removing cloud contamination. The relative errors of the 10% average to MODIS were smaller (-0.6%) over ocean but larger (1.5%) over land than those of the OMI product to MODIS. The reduced relative error in the OMI product over land may result from additional cloud filtering using the Landsat data. This study will be useful when retrieveing the surface reflectance from geostationary-orbit environmental satellite (e.g., Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer; GEMS).

TI  - Early Prediction of <i>Margalefidinium polykrikoides</i> Bloom Using a LSTM Neural Network Model in the South Sea of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been occurring within the South Sea of Korea (SSK) for decades, causing significant ecological impacts and economic problems for many fish farms concentrated in coastal areas. The occurrence of HABs is related to various factors, including meteorological and physical factors, making it difficult to predict the timing of their occurrence. However, it is essential to make a preliminary forecast of HAB occurrence through analysis of such factors to minimize the damage. In this study, a deep neural network model of long short-term memory (LSTM) that can predict the occurrence time of Margalefidinium polykrikoides blooms is presented and evaluated. Satellite data were used to extract sea surface temperature (SST) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), which are environmental factors known to be related to HABs occurrence. M. polykrikoides blooms that have occurred in the past 21 years (1998-2018) have been shown to be initiated when SST reaches around 25 degrees C within the summer season. The prediction performance of LSTM-based neural network was evaluated using test data from 2017 and 2018, and the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy were determined. Prediction for 2017 matched well with the test data; however, for 2018, the network predicted that a HAB would occur between July 19 and Sep. 03, with an RMSE of 0.233 and accuracy of 94.8 %, but the actual occurrence of HAB was between July 24 and Aug. 20. This study shows that the trained LSTM-based network would be useful for early prediction of the future red tide blooms in SSK.

TI  - Hydraulic properties of injection formations constrained by surface deformation
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater injection over the past decade has increased seismicity in the central USA, in some cases accompanied by detectable surface uplift. Here, we use this uplift to constrain subsurface properties and pore pressure evolution. We apply an advanced multitemporal interferometric algorithm to 35 synthetic aperture radar images acquired by ALOS satellite over four years before the 2012 earthquake sequence in east Texas, where large volumes of wastewater are disposed at depths of 800 m and 1800 m. To solve for the hydraulic diffusivity of the injection layers, we jointly inverted the injected volume and uplift data, considering a poroelastic layered half space. We find diffusivity values of 0.3 +/- 0.1 m(2)/s and 0.7 +/- 0.15 m(2)/s for shallow and deep injection layers, respectively, which combined with seismically-derived bulk moduli yields permeability values of 5.5 +/- 2.6 x 10(-14) m(2) and 1.9 +/- 0.25 x 10(-13) m(2) for these layers, consistent with permeability range reported for Rodessa formation and well test values. Hydraulic conductivity determines the evolution of pore pressure and thus the origin and location of induced seismicity. This study highlights the value of geodetic observations to constrain key hydrogeological properties of injection layers and to monitor the evolution of the subsurface pressure change.

To infer aquifer dynamics, we provide a more detailed and joint analysis of deformation and groundwater data. Investigating well data in the Tulare Basin, we find that groundwater levels stabilized before 2015 and show that M&L's observed continued subsidence through July 2016 is likely caused by the delayed compaction of the aquitard. Our analysis suggests the observed 2017 transient uplift is not due to recharge of the aquifer system after heavy winter rainfall because it requires an unrealistic vertical hydraulic gradient nearly five orders of magnitude larger than that typical of Tulare Basin. We find that, regardless of the amount of rainfall, transient annual uplifts of similar to 3 cm occur in May to June. Using an elastic skeletal storage coefficient of 5 x 10(-3), we link this ground uplift to annual groundwater level changes.

TI  - Postglacial incision-infill cycles at the Borisoglebsk Upland: Correlations between interfluve headwaters and fluvial network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses postglacial landscape transformation in the Northern Hemisphere Middle Pleistocene glaciation area located in the center of the Russian Plain. We attempted to verify the regional paleogeographic model by reconstructing the Late Pleistocene incision-infill cycles at the Eastern Borisoglebsk Upland based on a comparison of inactive interfluves headwaters and actual fluvial network palaeoarchives. The study was also aimed to determine the past extent of fluvial systems. Interdisciplinary research of the actual and buried topography, lithology and pedogenic properties of surface deposits was carrid out with remote sensing data interpretation, DGPS survey, and detailed description of geological cores involved. The study was followed by analysis of grain size, chemical and organic contents, microstructure, and numerical dating. Integrating the available results, we propose a scenario of the fluvial network transformation at the Eastern Borisoglebsk Upland over the last 150 ka. At least four fluvial incision stages were determined while network extent has significantly changed through the Late Pleistocene. Three can be generally associated with the regional base level decrease - Late Moscow, Late Valdai and Late Holocene and accompanying isolation of the Nero Lake terraces of 130 m, 100-105 m and 95-98 m. Incision stages were separated by landscape stability or aggradation periods those were asynchronous at the middle and upper parts of the fluvial network. The main agent of initial valley infill appears to be local lacustrine sedimentation altered by alluvial and colluvial deposition towards the second half of Valdai. Revealed landscape conditions variability emphasize the importance of comprehensive local correlations for regional retrospective models.

TI  - Assessment of Ecosystem Services Value Based on Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Transboundary Karnali River Basin, Central Himalayas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LUCC) and its spatio-temporal characteristics are essential for natural resource management and sustainable development. LUCC is one of the major factors that affect the ecosystem and the services it provides. In this study, we used remote sensing techniques and a geographical information system to extract the land cover categories based on the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) technique from Landsat TM/ETM/OLI satellite images in the transboundary Karnali River Basin (KRB, China and Nepal) of central Himalayas from 2000 to 2017. Spatio-temporal integrated methodologyTupu was used to spatially show the LUCC as well as spatial characteristics of the arisen Tupu and shrunken Tupu. In addition, the ecosystem services value (ESV) were obtained and analyzed for each land cover category. In 2017, forest covered the highest area (33.45%) followed by bare area (30.3%), shrub/grassland (18.49%), agriculture (13.12%), snow/ice (4.32%), waterbody (0.3%) and built-up area (0.04%) in the KRB. From 2000 to 2017, the areas of forest, waterbody and snow/ice have decreased by 0.59, 6.14, and 1072.1 km(2), respectively. Meanwhile, the areas of shrub/grassland, agriculture, barren land, and built-up categories have increased by 82.21, 1.44, 991.97, and 3.11 km(2), respectively. These changes in the land cover have led to an increase in the ESV of the basin, especially the increase in shrub/grassland, agriculture, and water bodies (in the higher elevation). The total ESV of the basin was increased by $1.59 x 10(6) from 2000 to 2017. Anthropogenic factors together with natural phenomena drive LUCC in the basin and thus the ESV. The findings of this study could facilitate the basin-level policy formulation to guide future conservation and development management interventions.

TI  - Estuarine Dissolved Organic Carbon Flux From Space: With Application to Chesapeake and Delaware Bays
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a neural network model trained with in situ data, combined with satellite data and hydrodynamic model products, to compute the daily estuarine export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at the mouths of Chesapeake Bay (CB) and Delaware Bay (DB) from 2007 to 2011. Both bays show large flux variability with highest fluxes in spring and lowest in fall as well as interannual flux variability (0.18 and 0.27 Tg C/year in 2008 and 2010 for CB; 0.04 and 0.09 Tg C/year in 2008 and 2011 for DB). Based on previous estimates of total organic carbon (TOCexp) exported by all Mid-Atlantic Bight estuaries (1.2 Tg C/year), the DOC export (CB+DB) of 0.3 Tg C/year estimated here corresponds to 25% of the TOCexp. Spatial and temporal covariations of velocity and DOC concentration provide contributions to the flux, with larger spatial influence. Differences in the discharge of fresh water into the bays (74 billion m(3)/year for CB and 21 billion m(3)/year for DB) and their geomorphologies are major drivers of the differences in DOC fluxes for these two systems. Terrestrial DOC inputs are similar to the export of DOC at the bay mouths at annual and longer time scales but diverge significantly at shorter time scales (days to months). Future efforts will expand to the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine, and its major rivers and estuaries, in combination with coupled terrestrial-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical models that include effects of climate change, such as warming and CO2 increase.Plain Language Summary This study combines satellite data, field work observations, and statistical and numerical models to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from two major East Coast estuaries, Chesapeake, and Delaware Bays. DOC is a food supplement, supporting growth of microorganisms and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle through the microbial loop, a marine pathway which incorporates DOC into the food chain. Using this novel methodology, we were able to better quantify the combined contribution of these estuaries to the East Coast carbon budget and contrast estuarine properties affecting the DOC export, such as riverine inputs, time scales of variability, and geomorphology. The combined DOC contribution of these two estuaries represents 25% of the total organic carbon exported by all Mid-Atlantic Bight (the coastal region running from Massachusetts to North Carolina) estuaries, and 27% of the total atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

TI  - Object-based random forest modelling of aboveground forest biomass outperforms a pixel-based approach in a heterogeneous and mountain tropical environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a highly heterogeneous biome of global ecological significance with high levels of terrestrial carbon stocks and aboveground biomass (AGB). Accurate maps of AGB are required for monitoring, reporting, and modelling of forest resources and carbon stocks. Previous research has linked plot-level AGB with environmental and remotely sensed data using pixel-based approaches. However, few studies focused on investigating possible improvements via object-based image analysis (OBIA) including terrain related data to predict AGB in topographically variable and mountainous regions, such as Atlantic forest in Minas Gerais, Brazil. OBIA is expected to reduce known uncertainties related to the positional discrepancy between the image and field data and forest heterogeneity, while terrain derivatives are strong predictors in forest ecosystems driving forest biomass variability. In this research, we compare an object-based approach to a pixel-based method for modeling, mapping and quantifying AGB in the Rio Doce basin, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We trained a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm using environmental, terrain, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed imagery. We aimed to: (i) increase the precision of the AGB estimates; (ii) identify optimal variables that fit the best model, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE, Mg/ha); (iii) produce an accurate map of the AGB for the study area, and subsequently (iv) describing the AGB spatial distribution as a function of the selected variables. The RF object-based model notably improved the AGB prediction by reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) from 28.64 to 20.95%, and RMSE from 33.43 to 20.08 Mg/ha, and increasing the R-2 (from 0.57 to 0.86) by using a combination of selected remote sensing, environmental, and terrain variables. Object-based modelling is a promising alternative to common pixel-based approaches to reduce AGB variability in topographically diverse and heterogeneous environments. Investigation of mapped outcomes revealed a decreasing AGB from west towards the east region of the Rio Doce Basin. Over the entire study area, we map a total of 195,799,533 Mg of AGB, ranging from 25.52 to 238 Mg/ha, following seasonal precipitation patterns and anthropogenic disturbance effects. This study provided reliable AGB estimates for the Rio Doce basin, one of the most important watercourses of the globally important Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In conclusion, we highlight that OBIA is a better solution to map forest AGB than the pixel-based traditional method, increasing the precision of AGB estimates in a heterogeneous and mountain tropical environment.

TI  - Melanoma of the Vulva and Vagina: Surgical Management and Outcomes Based on a Clinicopathologic Review of 68 Cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY CANADA
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This study sought to evaluate the clinicopathologic features, surgical management, and survival of patients over 12 years at two academic centres.Methods: Patients diagnosed with vulvar or vaginal melanoma between 2002 and 2014 were identified through pathology databases. Clinical and pathologic data were extracted from the medical records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS), and univariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazard model were used to detect covariates related to survival.Results: Patients with vulvar melanoma were more likely to undergo surgical excision (84.0% vs. 55.6%, P = 0.0243) and were more likely to achieve negative margins (70.0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.0001). Forty-eight percent of patients with vulvar melanoma had a lymph node evaluation; sentinel node biopsies were performed in 32%. Actuarial median OS for vulvar melanoma was 45 months compared with 10.48 months for vaginal melanoma. A subset of 10 patients with vulvar melanoma who survived longer than 60 months was identified. Eight significant predictors of OS were demonstrated for vulvar melanomas: clinical stage, maximum tumour size, tumour thickness, lymphovascular space invasion status, clinically enlarged lymph nodes, sentinel lymph nodes, lymph node status, and radiation treatment. Patients with positive or indeterminate margin status demonstrated a higher risk of recurrence than did patients with negative margins (hazard ratio 2.60; 95% CI 1.14-5.90).Conclusion: Surgical excision with adequate margins is the mainstay of primary management when feasible. Lymph node evaluation, including sentinel nodes, may be considered in selected patients. Vulvar and vaginal sites differ markedly with respect to pathology, initial management, and survival, and they should be evaluated separately.

TI  - Qualitative assessment of geostatistical and non-geostatistical fusion techniques: a case study on landsat 8 images
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Broadly satellite images are available in two categories (1) high spectral resolution but less spatial resolution (2) high spatial resolution but less spectral resolution. But in certain applications, images with high spatial as well as high spectral resolution are required. To meet such kind of requirement, Image fusion is widely accepted and increasingly being used. In this study satellite image fusion is done using geostatistical methods (cokriging, regression kriging) and non-geostatistical methods (intensity hue saturation, principal component analysis). The study is focused on performing qualitative assessment of selected image fusion techniques. In this study, the primary variable is RGB bands of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the panchromatic band is chosen as the second variable. The output of these selected methods is compared to access spectral and spatial quality. Spectral quality is accessed by finding the correlation between the primary variable and the output, however spatial quality is accessed via texture analysis method named entropy. Overall assessment of loss of correlation, luminance distortion, and contrast distortion is done using Image quality index. Correlation index of regression kriging and PCA are comparable whereas entropy and image quality index of fused output is highest in case of regression kriging. Hence regression kriging can be concluded as the best fusion technique out of the compared techniques.

TI  - Assessment of recent changes in planform of river Ganga from Mirapur Khadar to Narora barrage, Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study was undertaken to assess the vast changes in the behavior of the course of the Ganga river by the identification of recent changes in planform and dynamic fluvial characteristics of the river and quantification of the meandering indices as well as braiding index for the region Mirapur Khadar to Narora, Uttar Pradesh. Narora barrage is located on the banks of river Ganga and its construction was completed in 1966. After its construction, the braiding index was increased from 0.17 to 0.41 from 1975 to 2015. Meandering indices were observed to be increased from 1.26 to 1.36 within a chronological period from 1975 to 2015. This shows that streams are exhibiting braiding as well as meandering pattern. The construction of Bijnor as well as Narora barrages has affected the planform geometry of river Ganga. The study reveals that the natural as well as anthropogenic factors are responsible for the oscillating nature of river Ganga. The study further reveals that Landsat images can be successfully used to identify the meandering indices, braiding index and planform change.

TI  - A Prospective Study of Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Low-Risk/Intermediate-Risk Early-Stage Endometrial Carcinoma Using Dual-Dye and Dual-Site and Injection Technique
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a prospective study aimed to identify the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in low-/intermediate-risk early-stage endometrial carcinoma and its correlation with pathological findings using dual-dye and dual-site and injection technique. Materials and MethodsIt is a prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary cancer care centre for treatment of endometrial carcinoma in the period from June 2015 to June 2017. All the patients qualifying preoperative inclusion criteria for the study with biopsy-proven case of endometrial carcinoma were enrolled. Dual-dye and dual-site intervention: both radiotracer dye (Tc 99 nanocolloidal albumin dye) and methylene blue was selected for injection at two sitescervix and subserosal. ResultsA total of 32 patients were enrolled. The median age of patients was 58.5years (range 25-72). Histological tumour grade was available at preoperative histology in 25 of the 32 patients included in the protocol (78%). Detection rate using combined cervical and subserosal injection per patient was 96.8%. Among the patient with SLN detected in pelvic area, detection was unilateral in 6 patients (19%) and bilateral in 25 cases (78%). Sentinel lymph node detection in right and left hemi-pelvis was 81% (26 cases) and 94% (30 cases), respectively. At least one sentinel lymph node is identified in 31 of 32 patients. Metastasis was noted in 6 patients out of 32 patients. Sentinel lymph nodes are identified in all 6 of these patients. ConclusionThe present study suggests that sentinel node biopsy is an adequate technique to evaluate lymph node status in early-stage disease with detection rate more than 95%, sensitivity of 100% and false negative rate of zero. With the low morbidity of the SLNB procedure, it might be desirable if all women with low- and intermediate-risk early-stage disease could undergo SLNB to help in the selecting those who actually benefits from comprehensive lymphadenectomy. The use of both cervical and subserosal techniques of injection of dye is associated with high overall and para-aortic SLN detection rate than either of them separately.

TI  - Streamlining multitemporal vegetation indices for dependable crop growth monitoring in Himalayan foothill region
T2  - SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data in conjunction with geoinformatics are used to study the land cover change dynamics, extraction of crop information and the monitoring of crop growth. The information derived from the satellite may contain contaminated values due to the atmospheric effects, geometric errors, snow and clouds. These contaminated values can be identified and eliminated using time series analysis to further streamline for agricultural monitoring and prognostic applications. The inherent advantages and disadvantages of existing streamlining methods limit their usability in particular situation. The method proposed in this study synergizes the use of interpolation, running median and moving average. This has clearly shown the proposal's capability in preserving the trend in the series in addition to streamlining the temporal profile of satellite data in the Himalayan foothills. This will make the road map for satisfactory crop growth monitoring and crop yield estimation. Analysis based on the root mean square error and F-Test has been presented to deduce the results and interpretations.

TI  - Implementation of a hemophilia management program improves clinical outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionHemophilia is a rare, inherited, coagulation disorder that impairs the body's ability to cease bleeding, making hemophiliacs susceptible to bleeding episodes. These patients often require multiple doses of clotting factor concentrates to help maintain hemostasis. In fiscal year (FY) 2016, Rush University Medical Center's drug expense for clotting factor concentrates totaled $4.6 million, which accounted for approximately 15% of the total drug budget. The Department of Pharmacy developed a Hemophilia Management Program (HMP) to improve care, reduce spending, and expand clinical pharmacy services. Prior to the HMP, the Department of Pharmacy completed drug acquisition and dispensing and no role existed for pharmacists as part of the comprehensive care team for the hemophilia population. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes after implementation of clinical pharmacy services into the management of hemophilia patients in an interdisciplinary HMP. MethodsSeveral areas for improved care and efficiency were identified prior to the implementation of the HMP: interdisciplinary education, clinical management and continuity of care, and formulary management. ResultsIn total, implementation of the HMP resulted in a net savings of $2.7 million for clotting factor expenses for FY 2017. The cost savings based on clotting factor expenses resulted in a return on investment (ROI) of 20:1, exceeding the initial projections of a modest ROI of 3:1. In addition, these costs savings were realized with the average length of stay per patient staying within the previous margins. Finally, the HMP effectively reduced the need for blood transfusions per patient. DiscussionDesign and implementation of the HMP resulted in significant cost savings, improved efficiency, and enhanced clinical services for patients with hemophilia. This expansion of pharmacy services has become the first pharmacy-led program in the country to not only reduce costs, but also improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - Indocyanine Green (ICG) Fluorescence Imaging in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) for Early Breast Cancer: First Indian Experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo explore the utility and safety of indocyanine green (ICG) for the fluorescence-guided detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer.MethodPatients diagnosed with early breast cancer with clinically negative axilla were involved in the study. ICG dye was injected as per protocol. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) was harvested and axillary clearance was done in all patients irrespective of SLN status. SLN identification rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false negative rate were calculated.ResultsForty patients were involved in the study, with most of the patients being in their fifth decade. Median BMI of patient was 24 (range 19-34). SLN was identified in all the patients, total of 110 nodes were detected, with mean being 2.75 (1-6). Seventeen of 40 patients had positive nodes on axilla, of which 16 were detected by SLN and one patient had isolated tumour cells which were detected on final grossing and histopathology report. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false negative rate were 94.1%, 100%, 100%, 95.8% and 5.8%, respectively. None of the patients had any complications with ICG injection.ConclusionICG-based fluorescence technique is easy and safe for SLNB in early breast cancer and is ready for clinical application. A well-designed study comparing the standard dual dye technique with ICG needs to be done to explore if it can replace the existing standard.

AB  - In the meninges, a unique subset of tissue-resident macrophages serves as a sentinel population against invading microorganisms while suppressing harmful inflammation. A recent report shows that when murine meningeal macrophages are killed by viruses, circulating monocytes repopulate the open niche. However, they fail to mimic all aspects of tissue-resident macrophages.

TI  - Global trend analysis in primary and secondary production of marine aerosol and aerosol optical depth during 2000-2015
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global trends in sea spray aerosol (SSA) emissions, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) flux from sea to air, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) during 2000-2015 were analyzed using the satellite-based, ECMWF reanalysis, and model-predicted data. The SSA emissions were estimated using a widely used whitecap method with a sea surface temperature (SST) dependence. The sea-to-air DMS fluxes were estimated by a thin film model based on the DMS concentration in seawater and its gas transfer velocity. The yearly global mean anomaly in DMS fluxes showed a significant downward trend during the study period, whereas the SSA emissions showed an upward trend. In terms of regional trends, the increases in SSA emissions during 2000-2015 occurred over the tropical southeastern Pacific Ocean and Southern Ocean, whereas any downward trends in SSA emissions were localized. The DMS fluxes during the study period showed a clear downward trend over most oceans, except for the strong upward trend at low latitudes. In general, the AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) showed upward trends across the entire Southern Hemisphere (SH), whereas there were downward trends in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Therefore, the upward trend of AOD in the SH were derived mainly from the SSA emission trend, due to smaller contribution of anthropogenic sources in the SH. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Algal bloom transport in Lake Erie using remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling: Sensitivity to buoyancy velocity and initial vertical distribution
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we simulate three-dimensional transport of algal blooms in Lake Erie using a combination of remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling. The remote sensing algorithms use data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI satellite sensor to derive chlorophyll-a concentration from cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Erie. The derived chlorophyll-a concentration initializes an algal bloom transport model driven by the lake component of the Water Cycle Prediction System for the Great Lakes, a system of coupled atmosphere-lake-hydrological models operated out of Environment and Climate Change Canada. The bloom is modelled as Microcystis aeruginosa, a buoyant species that is often dominant in harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie. Short-term (a few days) predictions of algal bloom transport from July 27 to October 8, 2017 are modelled in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. The Eulerian framework is used to evaluate the sensitivity of model results to the initial vertical distribution of the bloom. In this work, the Lagrangian framework is limited to two-dimensional surface confined particles. We use several error metrics to evaluate model predictions. We find that results are sensitive to the buoyancy velocity for cases where the bloom was initially distributed over a large portion of the water column. An initial vertical distribution selected from modelled chlorophyll-a half depth shows the highest accuracy for the entire range of buoyancy velocities tested. We also find that the Pierce skill score is difficult to interpret, particularly in cases where bloom intensity is greatly overpredicted by the model.

TI  - Tree Species Classification in a Highly Diverse Subtropical Forest Integrating UAV-Based Photogrammetric Point Cloud and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data for tree species classification in tropical forests is still a challenging task, due to their high floristic and spectral diversity. In this sense, novel sensors on board of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms are a rapidly evolving technology that provides new possibilities for tropical tree species mapping. Besides the acquisition of high spatial and spectral resolution images, UAV-hyperspectral cameras operating in frame format enable to produce 3D hyperspectral point clouds. This study investigated the use of UAV-acquired hyperspectral images and UAV-photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) for classification of 12 major tree species in a subtropical forest fragment in Southern Brazil. Different datasets containing hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (VNIR) bands, PPC features, canopy height model (CHM), and other features extracted from hyperspectral data (i.e., texture, vegetation indices-VIs, and minimum noise fraction-MNF) were tested using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed that the use of VNIR hyperspectral bands alone reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 57% (Kappa index of 0.53). Adding PPC features to the VNIR hyperspectral bands increased the OA by 11%. The best result was achieved combining VNIR bands, PPC features, CHM, and VIs (OA of 72.4% and Kappa index of 0.70). When only the CHM was added to VNIR bands, the OA increased by 4.2%. Among the hyperspectral features, besides all the VNIR bands and the two VIs (NDVI and PSSR), the first four MNF features and the textural mean of 565 and 679 nm spectral bands were pointed out as more important to discriminate the tree species according to Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. The SVM method proved to be a good classifier for the tree species recognition task, even in the presence of a high number of classes and a small dataset.

TI  - A Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Antennas System for Small-Satellite Applications
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Circularly polarized (CP) antennas are used in space applications for telemetry tracking and command (TT&C). In this paper, we present an antenna for a TT&C system that can employ only four antennas to achieve a wide quasi-isotropic coverage. The proposed single-feed circular polarized annular patch antenna is low profile and compact. It exhibits a wide impedance bandwidth of 19.7%, wide-angle circular polarization with an on-axis maximum gain higher than 6 dBi and an axial ratio below 4 dB in the frequency band 2.0-2.3 GHz. The developed low-cost antenna can be used for small-satellite data downlink where only two right hand circular polarized (RHCP) antennas and two left hand circular polarized (LHCP) antennas would be required since each antenna has an adequate CP gain on a wide angle. A prototype antenna has been fabricated and measured. The experimental validation shows a good agreement of the measured impedance bandwidth, axial ratio, and far-field pattern with the ones predicted by numerical full-wave study.

TI  - Deriving forest fire probability maps from the fusion of visible/infrared satellite data and geospatial data mining
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on fire probability is of vital importance to environmental and ecological studies as well as to fire management. This study aimed at comparing two forest fire probability mapping techniques, one based primarily on freely distributed EO (Earth observation) data from Landsat imagery, and another one based purely on GIS modeling. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat data was used to detect the high fire severity and probability area based on the NBR difference between pre- and post-fire conditions. The GIS-based modeling was based on a multi criterion evaluation technique, into which other attributes like anthropogenic and natural sources were also incorporated. The ability of both techniques to map forest fire probability was evaluated for a region in India, for which suitable ancillary data had been previously acquired to support a rigorous validation. Subsequently, a conceptual framework for the prediction of high fire probability zones in an area based on a newly introduced herein data fusion technique was constructed. Overall, the EO-based technique was found to be the most suitable option, since it required less computational time and resources in comparison to the GIS-based modeling approach. Furthermore, the fusion approach offered an appropriate path for developing a forest fire probability identification model for long-term pragmatic conservation of forests. The potential fusion of these two modeling approaches may provide information that can be useful to forest fire mitigation policy makers, and assist at conservation and resilience practices.

TI  - Effective care for Maori with bipolar disorder: A qualitative study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maori have high rates of bipolar disorder (BD) and mental health service use. Despite the high prevalence and the impact on functioning and whanau (family), there is limited research on treatment interventions for Maori with bipolar disorder and indeed on Maori and indigenous mental health generally. A qualitative study combining individual interviews and focus groups was conducted with the aim to explore mental health clinicians' and Maori mental health workers' perspectives of effective treatment for Maori with BD. Sixteen participants took part in either individual interviews, focus groups or both. The study found the importance of a Maori worldview; tikanga Maori (rituals); understanding the whanau context, whakawhanaugatanga (connection), the powhiri (introduction) process, and whakarongo (listening) were key to working effectively with Maori who had BD. Both the interviews and focus groups identified similar concepts. The concept of whakawhanaungatanga (connection) captures the themes from the individual interviews and focus groups. The participants in this study identified the person and their culture rather than the psychiatric diagnosis as crucial to providing effective care to Maori with BD. Without a foundation in whakawhanaungatanga, engagement, diagnosis, treatment adherence, and the process of recovery are unlikely to be as effective for Maori with BD. It was evident from the findings that it was the person not the diagnosis that was central to therapeutic engagement.

TI  - The Effect of Radiofrequency Technology on Time Spent Searching for Surgical Sponges and Associated Costs
T2  - AORN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Retained surgical items (eg, sponges, instruments) remain the most frequently reported sentinel events. The primary strategy for preventing retained sponges is the sponge count. Reconciling sponge counts is time consuming and can extend the duration of operative and other invasive procedures. The primary objective of this observational study was to evaluate the effect of a radiofrequency (RF) surgical-sponge detection system on time spent searching for surgical sponges. The study included 27,637 procedures during nine months before and after implementing an RF surgical-sponge detection system. After implementation of the system, time spent searching for sponges was reduced by 79.58%, the percentage of unreconciled counts was reduced by 71.28%, and time spent using radiography to rule out a retained sponge was reduced by 46.31%. This resulted in a reduction of costs. These findings should be used as part of a comprehensive cost analysis of alternative methods when evaluating RF sponge detection technology.

TI  - Photoacoustic clinical imaging
T2  - PHOTOACOUSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic is an emerging biomedical imaging modality, which allows imaging optical absorbers in the tissue by acoustic detectors (light in - sound out). Such a technique has an immense potential for clinical translation since it allows high resolution, sufficient imaging depth, with diverse endogenous and exogenous contrast, and is free from ionizing radiation. In recent years, tremendous developments in both the instrumentation and imaging agents have been achieved. These opened avenues for clinical imaging of various sites allowed applications such as brain functional imaging, breast cancer screening, diagnosis of psoriasis and skin lesions, biopsy and surgery guidance, the guidance of tumor therapies at the reproductive and urological systems, as well as imaging tumor metastases at the sentinel lymph nodes. Here we survey the various clinical and pre-clinical literature and discuss the potential applications and hurdles that still need to be overcome.

TI  - Genetic susceptibility to West Nile virus infection in Camargue horses
T2  - RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic neurotropic virus capable to cause lethal meningoence-phalitis (WNE) in infected hosts such as birds, horses, and humans. Due to their sensitivity, horses serve as sentinel species in areas at risk. We studied a population of Camargue horses living in Southern France in two zones with endemic WNV circulation where WNV outbreaks were recorded in 2000 and 2003-4. Two sets of microsatellite markers located in MHC and Ly49 genomic regions were genotyped as well as multiple SNPs in ten immunity-related candidate gene regions. Associations between genetic polymorphisms and resistance/susceptibility to WNE were tested. While single marker associations were weak, compound two-gene genotypes of SNPs located within the MAVS, NCR2 and IL-10 genes and microsatellites HMS082 and CZMO13 were associated with susceptibility to WNE. Combinations of microsatellite markers CZM009, ABGe17402 and ABGe9019 were associated with simple seroconversion without clinical signs of WNE (resistance). In addition, a distribution of polymorphic markers between WNV-IgG seropositive horses and a control group of WNV-IgG seronegative horses was tested. One SNP in the OAS1 gene (NC_009151.3:g.21961328A > G) was significantly associated with the seropositive phenotype (p(corr) = 0.023; OR = 40.5 CI (4.28; 383.26); RR = 8.18 CI (1.27; 52.89) in the Camargue breed. In compound genotypes, SNP markers for SLC11A1, MAVS, OAS1, TLR4, ADAM17 and NCR2 genes and ten microsatellites showed non-random distribution between seropositive and seronegative groups of horses. Further analysis of associated markers could contribute to our understanding of anti-WNV defense mechanisms in horses.

TI  - Assessing Carolina Bay Wetland Restoration Risks to Downstream Water Quality by Characterizing Land Use and Stream Proximity
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carolina Bay wetlands are distinct common components of the Southeastern US Coastal Plain. Many have a history of drainage for agriculture. Restoration of prior-drained Bays can increase P solubility and transport, with potential adverse impacts downstream. To assess risk of off-site P transport, we documented Bay land use, drained area, and proximity to streams and drainageways. We studied Bladen County, NC, where an exhaustive Bay inventory is available. Land-use was documented via classified Landsat decadal images from 1972 through 2010. We compared sequential image pairs to document land-use changes. Phosphorus risk to downstream waters was assessed based on stream proximity, agricultural land use, and arable area. At least 80% of Bays constituting 97% of total Bay area (51,704ha) exhibited evidence of land-use change. Edges of Bays comprising 80% of Bay coverage were within 15m of a stream; Bays comprising 13% were isolated. Twenty-one percent of Bay area remained drained in 2010. Prior, 28% of Bay area posed moderate to severe threats to downstream waters; as of 2010, 9%. Considering long-term effects of restoration-induced off-site transport of agrochemicals, land-use history, drained area, and stream/drainageaway proximity should be considered in choosing Bays for restoration.

TI  - Combinational shadow index for building shadow extraction in urban areas from Sentinel-2A MSI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Images from Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2A are useful for studies of urban environments and their spatio-temporal changes. However, the frequent occurrence of building shadows in urban areas brings about great challenges in urban studies. Existing building shadow indices are not effective for Sentinel-2A MSI images due to that these indices do not make full use of the rich spectral information contained in Sentinel-2A. In this study, we propose a combinational shadow index (CSI) to address this challenge. In the formulation of CSI, three features, including the proposed shadow enhancement index (SEI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the NIR band (B8), were combined to separate spectrally similar objects, such as building shadows, water and low albedo features at the Earth surface. The accuracy and robustness of CSI were tested by using six data sets from four cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China. The performance of CSI was compared with three existing shadow indices, i.e., P algorithm, the normalized saturation-value difference index (NSVDI) and the shadow index (SI). Results show that CSI can detect building shadows with fine structures in both clear and cloudy images more effectively and worked well on large areas too. CSI can separate shadows from water and low albedo features as measured by a spectral discrimination index (SDI). Compared with the existing building shadow indices, CSI can improve the performance of building shadow detection by combining the feature information of SEI, NDWI and NIR band, and yielded satisfactory results for extracting building shadows from Sentinel-2A MSI imagery.

TI  - Simulating C-Band SAR Footprint-Scale Backscatter Over Agricultural Area With a Physical Land Surface Model
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture products are ideal candidates for initializing soil moisture profiles of land surface models via data assimilation. This paper investigates the possibility of using a calibrated Integral Equation Model coupled with a hyperresolution land surface model, called Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) to simulate backscatter and compares the results with C-band RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter signals in postharvest season when the field is considered bare soil or sparsely vegetated. Modifications to SVS evaporation scheme are shown to improve the comparison against SAR measurements. An improved effective soil roughness calculation scheme was also proposed to focus on the inversion of the root mean square height (H-rms) only. Soil dielectric constant compensation was suggested to reduce the inversion error and expand the dynamic range of Integral Equation Model. The combination of SVS soil moisture and effective roughness is found superior to the absence of either of them. This method is promising considering that it does not require any in situ measurements, and yet it still outperforms the original IEM model, which uses in situ measured soil moisture and soil roughness at point scale.

TI  - Day Surgery Management of Early Breast Cancer: Feasibility and Psychological Outcomes
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Breast cancer treatment represents a substantial amount of health-care costs and has a negative impact on womens' psychological health. Day-Surgery managment (DS) is a favorable alternative to a classic inpatient setting. In our prospective study we evaluated DS-treatment feasibility in terms of patient satisfaction, same-day-discharge rate, surgical-reintervention rate, psychological impact and costs. Patients and Methods: We operated on 131 early breast cancer patients in DS. Surgical outcomes were evaluated. In 64 DS-treated breast cancer patients, psychological outcomes were analyzed using validated psychometric questionnaires and comparison was made with a corresponding group of women treated as inpatients. Results: The same-day-discharge rate was 95.4%. No patient required readmission. The surgical-reintervention rate was 6.2%. DS-treatment significantly reduced anxiety (p=0.05) and depression (p=0.01) and afforded cost savings of 49%. Conclusion: DS-treatment of early breast cancer was feasible, with low reintervention rate, reduced anxiety and depression, high patients' satisfaction and substantial financial savings.

TI  - Genome-wide association studies for milk production traits in Valle del Belice sheep using repeated measures
T2  - ANIMAL GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASes) have become a powerful tool for identifying genomic regions associated with important traits in livestock. Milk production traits in dairy sheep are measured at different time points during their life span. Using phenotypic data generated from longitudinal traits could improve the power of association studies but until now have received less attention in GWASes as a methodology and has not been implemented. The aim of this study was to carry out a GWAS for milk production traits in Valle del Belice sheep using repeated measures. After quality control, 469 ewes and 37 228 SNPs were retained for the analysis, and phenotypic data included 5586 test-day records for five milk production traits (milk yield, MY; fat yield and percentage, FY and F%; protein yield and percentage, PY and P%). Nine SNPs located within or close to known genes were found to be associated with milk production traits. In particular, rs398340969, associated with both milk yield and protein yield, is located within the DCPS gene. In addition, rs425417915 and rs417079368, both associated with both fat percentage and protein percentage, are located within the TTC7B gene and at 0.37 Mb within the SUCNR1 gene respectively. In summary, the use of repeated records was beneficial for mapping genomic regions affecting milk production traits in the Valle del Belice sheep.

TI  - Isolation of swarm sources using InSAR: the case of the February 2017 seismic swarm in western Anatolia (Turkey)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the surface deformation of a moderate size M5+ earthquake swarm-type activity which burst at the tip of the Biga peninsula (western Turkey) in early 2017. No previous M5+ earthquakes have been recorded in the instrumental period on land, however, offshore normal faults, have ruptured to produce strong (M>6) earthquakes. We use the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique and exploit a data set of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 images, to successfully detect the surface deformation caused by three M5+ events of the sequence and constrain their source models, furtherly strengthened by seismic waveform analysis. The sequence occurred at shallowdepths (<12 km) and is related with the activation of a normal fault. Our geodetic inversions constrained the rupture distribution of the main events and led us to conclude that they belong to a single fault plane, striking N110 degrees E and dipping similar to 40 degrees to the SW, compatible with the regional tectonics. Furthermore, the InSAR analysis revealed that no aseismic transients occurred during the Biga swarm. InSAR applications in seismic swarms are limited mainly due to the low displacement signal they produce, which is not always easily detectable by radar satellites. Another obstacle is the time frequency of radar satellites acquisitions that often does not allow the temporal isolation of distinct seismic events. However, here we present a study that exploits InSAR data to isolate seismic sources of a swarm and proposes its use for the understanding of shallow seismic swarms in a systematic manner.

TI  - Flood Mapping Using Remote Sensing Imagery and Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Case Study in Brumadinho, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are considered to be among the most devastating disasters and can threaten human life and environmental ecosystems. On January 25, 2019, the Brumadinho dam wall collapsed and waste material from the Corrego do Feijao mine flooded the area beneath the dam. At least hundreds of people were killed, animal habitats were swamped, and the flood invaded the river and agricultural fields. Brazilian authorities are examining how this destructive flood might threaten the water quality of the contaminated river. It is important to determine the flood distribution to prevent additional contamination by dangerous material from the flood. In this study, remote sensing was effectively used to map and calculate the dimensions of the flood. Pre- and post-flood images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were employed to devise a pixel-based classification using two artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The flood area was successfully determined using the two classifiers. The resulting post-flood damage map should be beneficial for mitigating damage from a future flood event.

TI  - Geospatial Tools for the Large-Scale Monitoring of Wetlands in the San Francisco Estuary: Opportunities and Challenges.
T2  - San Francisco Estuary & Watershed Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant wetland losses and continuing threats to remnant habitats have motivated extensive restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary of California, the largest in the western United States. Consistent monitoring of ecological outcomes from this restoration effort would help managers learn from past projects to improve the design of future endeavors. However, budget constraints and challenging field conditions can limit the scope of current monitoring programs. Geospatial tools and remote sensing data sets could help complement field efforts for a low-cost, longer, and broader monitoring of wetland resources. To understand where geospatial tools could best complement current field monitoring practices, we reviewed the metrics and monitoring methods used by 42 wetland restoration projects implemented in the estuary. Monitoring strategies within our sample of monitoring plans relied predominantly on field surveys to assess key aspects of vegetation recovery while geospatial data sets were used sparingly. Drawing on recent publications that focus on the estuary and other wetland systems, we propose additional geospatial applications to help monitor the progress made toward site-specific and regional goals. These include the use of ecological niche models to target on-the-ground monitoring efforts, the up-scaling of field measurements into regional estimates using remote sensing data, and the analysis of time-series to detect ecosystem shifts. We discuss challenges and limitations to the broadscale application of remote sensing data in wetland monitoring. These notably include the need to find a venue to store and share computationally intensive data sets, the often cumbersome pre-processing effort needed for long-term analyses, and multiple confounding factors that can obscure the signal of remote sensing data sets.

TI  - Predicting Wheat Harvest Time Using Satellite Images and Regression Models
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cereals have an important role in human food security. Therefore, accurate estimation of harvesting time is necessary to minimize the loss in wheat farming. The objective of this study was to determine wheat harvest time using satellite images accurately. Field data was sampled from the farms in Meiham region of Kordestan province in west of Iran. Also, satellite remote sensing technique was applied during wheat growing season in 2016 using Landsat 8 images. The vegetation indexes were used as input in prediction model in this study. The results illustrated that satellite imaging has enough potential to predict the harvesting time of wheat accurately. R-squared and RMSE values of the best structured stepwise regression model in this study were 0.785 as well, and 1.13 respectively. This method can beneficially be employed by farm managers to have an accurate estimation of the most appropriate harvesting time and be able to manage the process which is an important challenge for them.

TI  - Satellite-based monitoring of contrasting characteristics of suspended sediment discharged from the Red and the Ma river systems along the northern coast of Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern coast of Vietnam has accumulated a significant amount of sediment discharged from the multiple distributaries of rivers such as the Red River and Ma River. While recent decreases of the sediment supply appears to have a significant impact on coastal erosion, the complex network of these distributaries makes it difficult to determine the overall spatiotemporal characteristics of sediment discharges and related topographic changes. The goal of the current study is to develop a satellite-based monitoring system for observation of turbidity discharged from the multiple rivers and to investigate the applicability of the developed monitoring system through a case study on the northern coast of Vietnam. Based on the in-situ observed data, a formula was determined for estimation of the surface water turbidity as a function of the red band reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) images. The formula was then combined with a newly determined threshold for cloud-masking to obtain maps of the nearshore turbidity patterns. These maps capture the spatiotemporal water surface turbidity along the entire coast of the Red River Delta and the coast around the Ma River mouth over the past sixteen years with frequency of twice a day. Finally, long-term trends of the turbidity patterns from multiple rivers were compared with the in-situ observation data and it was found that the Red River and the Ma River showed clearly contrasting characteristics, which reasonably explain the recent coastal shoreline changes and characteristics of sediment sampled along the coast.

TI  - MODIS Cloud Detection Evaluation Using CALIOP over Polluted Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze pollution has frequently occurred in winter over Eastern China in recent years. Over Eastern China, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud detection data were compared with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) for three years (2013-2016) for three kinds of underlying surface types (dark, bright, and water). We found that MODIS and CALIOP agree most of the time (82% on average), but discrepancies occurred at low CALIOP cloud optical thickness (COT < 0.4) and low MODIS cloud top height (CTH < 1.5 km). In spring and summer, the CALIOP cloud fraction was higher by more than 0.1 than MODIS due to MODIS's incapability of observing clouds with a lower COT. The discrepancy increased significantly with a decrease in MODIS CTH and an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD, about 2-4 times), and MODIS observed more clouds that were undetected by CALIOP over PM2.5 > 75 mu g m(-3) regions in autumn and particularly in winter, suggesting that polluted weather over Eastern China may contaminate MODIS cloud detections because MODIS will misclassify a heavy aerosol layer as cloudy under intense haze conditions. Besides aerosols, the high solar zenith angle (SZA) in winter also affects MODIS cloud detection, and the ratio of MODIS cloud pixel numbers to CALIOP cloud-free pixel numbers at a high SZA increased a great deal (about 4-21 times) relative to that at low SZA for the three surfaces. As a result of the effects of aerosol and SZA, MODIS cloud fraction was 0.08 higher than CALIOP, and MODIS CTH was more than 2 km lower than CALIOP CTH in winter. As for the cloud phases and types, the results showed that most of the discrepancies could be attributed to water clouds and low clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus), which is consistent with most of the discrepancies at low MODIS CTH.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on upstream products of FY-4A and A-Train satellites data during August and October, 2017, an estimation algorithm of cloud base height for FY-4A has been presented utilizing Random Forest model. The algorithm is evaluated in the comparison with CloudSat and CALIPSO. The results show that cloud base height for top layer cloud can be generated by using upstream products of FY-4A. Compared with CloudSat and CALIPSO, the mean absolute error is less than 1km and the relationship coefficient is bigger than 0.8. The presence of multi-layer clouds may result in underestimate of cloud base height.

TI  - Evaluation of Cloud Top Height Retrievals from China's Next-Generation Geostationary Meteorological Satellite FY-4A
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the validity of cloud top height (CTH) retrievals from FY-4A, the first of China's next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite series, the retrievals are compared to those from Himawari-8, CloudSat, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational products from August to October 2017. Regarding CTHs from CloudSat, CALIPSO, and MODIS as truth, the results show that the performance of FY-4A CTH retrievals is similar to that of Himawari-8. Both FY-4A and Himawari-8 retrieve reasonable CTH values for single-layer clouds, but perform poorly for multi-layer clouds. The mean bias error (MBE) shows that the mean value of FY-4A CTH retrievals is smaller than that of Himawari-8 for single-layer clouds but larger for multi-layer clouds. For ice crystal clouds, both FY-4A and Himawari-8 obtain the underestimated CTHs. However, there is a tendency for FY-4A and Himawari-8 to overestimate the CTH values of CloudSat and CALIPSO mainly for low level liquid water clouds. The temperature inversion near the tops of water clouds may result in an overestimation of CTHs. According to the MBE change with altitude, FY-4A and Himawari-8 overestimate the CTHs mainly for clouds below 3 km, and the overestimation is slightly more apparent in Himawari-8 data than that in FY-4A values. As the cloud optical thickness (COT) increases, the CTH bias of FY-4A CTH retrievals gradually decreases. Two typical cases are analyzed to illustrate the differences between different satellites' CTH retrievals in detail.

TI  - Ecohydrologic Error Models for Improved Bayesian Inference in Remotely Sensed Catchments
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation indicator widely used for simulating vegetation dynamics and quantifying biomass production. Spatial and temporal variability of LAI are often characterized using satellite remote sensing products. However, these types of satellite products often have relatively low quality when compared to in situ measurements. This work presents an approach for characterizing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LAI observation errors in a Bayesian ecohydrological modeling framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer quality flags data. We introduce a novel ecohydrologic error model, which partitions observation and model residual error according to the estimated retrieval uncertainty of LAI and the quality flags for each pixel. We examine our approach in two study catchments in Australia with varying degrees of good and poor quality satellite LAI data. Results show improved LAI predictions and less model residual error for both catchments when accounting for satellite observational uncertainties in a Bayesian framework.

TI  - COSMO-SkyMed SAR for Detection and Monitoring of Archaeological and Cultural Heritage Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has long been used in archaeology since the earliest space radar missions in the 1980s. In the current scenario of SAR missions, the Italian Space Agency (ASI)'s COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) has peculiar properties that make this mission of potential use by archaeologists and heritage practitioners: high to very high spatial resolution, site revisit of up to one day, and conspicuous image archives over cultural heritage sites across the globe. While recent literature and the number of research projects using COSMO-SkyMed data for science and applied research suggest a growing interest in these data, it is felt that COSMO-SkyMed still needs to be further disseminated across the archaeological remote sensing community. This paper therefore offers a portfolio of use-cases that were developed in the last two years in the Scientific Research Unit of ASI, where COSMO-SkyMed data were analysed to study and monitor cultural landscapes and heritage sites. SAR-based applications in archaeological and cultural heritage sites in Peru, Syria, Italy, and Iraq, provide evidence on how subsurface and buried features can be detected by interpreting SAR backscatter, its spatial and temporal changes, and interferometric coherence, and how SAR-derived digital elevation models (DEM) can be used to survey surface archaeological features. The use-cases also showcase how high temporal revisit SAR time series can support environmental monitoring of land surface processes, and condition assessment of archaeological heritage and landscape disturbance due to anthropogenic impact (e.g., agriculture, mining, looting). For the first time, this paper provides an overview of the capabilities of COSMO-SkyMed imagery in StripMap Himage and Spotlight-2 mode to support archaeological studies, with the aim to encourage remote sensing scientists and archaeologists to search for and exploit these data for their investigations and research activities. Furthermore, some considerations are made with regard to the perspectives opened by the upcoming launch of ASI's COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation constellation.

TI  - Predicting non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in Australian breast cancer patients: are the nomograms still useful in the post-Z0011 era?
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in breast cancer patients with low-volume disease in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) according to Z0011 trial. We believe that nomograms developed for predicting non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases can guide the axillary treatment in patients who do not fully match the criteria of Z0011 study. We identified risk factors and evaluated the performance of three nomograms to predict NSLN status in patients with positive SLNs. Methods Data from 526 breast cancer patients with positive SLNs who underwent ALND at two Australian hospitals from 2002 to 2015 were studied. Univariate and multivariate associations for NSLN metastasis were analysed. Predictive models evaluated were MD Anderson Cancer Centre (MDA), Helsinki University Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients demonstrated NSLN metastasis. The multivariate analysis identified extranodal extension (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.07-4.80), tumour size >2 cm (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.66-3.89), macrometastasis (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.09-3.47), positive SLN ratio >0.5 (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.16-2.60) and lymphovascular invasion (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.09-2.44) as independent predictors for NSLN metastasis. MDA nomogram showed the best discrimination (area under the curve of 0.74) and a 9% false negative rate for predicted probability of NSLN metastasis <= 10%. Conclusion Our results suggest that presence of extranodal extension and tumour size >2 cm may influence the need of further axillary treatment. Conversely, ALND can be safety spared in low risk patients identified by MDA nomogram.

TI  - Risk factors for failure of sentinel lymph node mapping using indocyanine green/near-infrared fluorescent imaging in endometrial cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Side-specific systematic lymphadenectomy is suggested if sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping failed in early stages endometrial cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with failed mapping which may lead to modify SLN mapping technique, increase the success of SLN mapping and reduce the necessity of systematic lymphadenectomy.Methods Patients with early stage endometrial cancer were included in this study. All patients underwent SLN mapping with indocyanine green/near-infrared compatible surgical platforms. Indocyanine green was injected intracervical. "Bilateral mapping" and "failed bilateral SLN mapping (unilateral or bilateral failed mapping)" groups were compared for demographic, clinical, surgical, and pathological features.Results 101 cases were analyzed. The overall, unilateral, and bilateral SLN detection rates were 94.1%, 19.8%, and 74.3%, respectively. The failed (unilateral or no mapping) bilateral detection rate was 25.7%. Failed bilateral mapping rates were higher in patients with longer cervical and uterine longitudinal lengths, deep myometrial invasion and larger tumor size without statistical significance. Body mass index and operation type were not related with failed mapping. Increasing number of operations or injection of larger volume of indocyanine green (4 mL vs. 2 mL) did not improve mapping rate significantly.Conclusion Cervical indocyanine green injection may overcome the negative effect of obesity on bilateral mapping. Although there was a negative correlation trend between the longitudinal cervical and uterine lengths and bilateral mapping, this possible relation needs to be confirmed in further studies.

TI  - Extent Changes in the Perennial Snowfields of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Alaska
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Perennial snowfields in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve (GAAR) in the central Brooks Range of Alaska are a critical component of the cryosphere. They serve as habitat for an array of wildlife, including caribou, a species that is crucial as a food and cultural resource for rural subsistence hunters and Native Alaskans. Snowfields also influence hydrology, vegetation, permafrost, and have the potential to preserve valuable archaeological artifacts. By deriving time series maps using cloud computing and supervised classification of Landsat satellite imagery, we calculated areas and evaluated extent changes. We also derived changes in elevations of the perennial snowfields that remained stable for at least four years. For the study period of 1985 to 2017, we found that total areas of perennial snowfields in GAAR are decreasing, with most of the notable changes in the latter half of the study period. Equilibrium areas, or bright areas, of the snowfields are shrinking, while ablation, or dark areas, are growing. We also found that the snowfields occur at higher elevations over time. Climate change may be altering the distribution, elevation, and extent of perennial snowfields in GAAR, which could affect caribou populations and subsistence lifestyles in rural Alaska.

TI  - Study of Ancient Land Boundaries at Tauric Chersonesos Using Satellite Images
T2  - ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS FROM SCYTHIA TO SIBERIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The near chora (agricultural land) of Tauric Chersonesos was investigated using multiyear remote sensing data and field surveys. The boundaries of the land plots were studied with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) technology and an analysis of satellite images. Reliable reconstruction of the borders has been done for 231 plots (from a total of about 380), which is approximately 53% of the Chersonesean chora. During the last 50 years, most of the ancient land plots have been destroyed by modern buildings, roads, or forests. However, in the 1960s, a significant part of the chora was still preserved. Changes in preservation with time were studied with the aid of satellite images that were made in 1966 and 2015. During that period, it was found that the number of plots with almost-complete preservation decreased from 47 to 0. Those land plots whose preservation was better than 50% dropped from 104 to 4. A temporal map shows this decline in preservation. It was found that the areas of land plots could be determined accurately with satellite images; compared to field surveys, this accuracy was about 99%.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two years of hydrodynamic monitoring with an ADCP deployed at 32 m of depth at 12.5 degrees S, in association with remotely sensed and numerical modeling data were used to investigate the uplift forcing mechanisms at the narrowest continental shelf close the formation zone of the South Atlantic western boundary currents (Brazil Current and North Brazil Undercurrent). Fifteen uplift events were successfully identified by shelf-bottom temperature anomalies. Their duration varied between 3 and 21 days, presented negative anomalies as large as 2.8 degrees C, temperature amplitudes of 4.2 degrees C, maximum vertical temperature stratification of 3.5 degrees C. Wind driven processes were the main drivers for most of the mapped uplift events, especially the Ekman transport, second by cyclonic eddies that frequently acted as pre-conditioners for the elevation of the isotherms, associated with 75% of events. Although the lowest absolute temperature associated with the events was relatively high (23.3 degrees C) due to a depressed regional thermocline, their duration, intensity and vertical extent were consistent with upwelling/ uplift events from well-known upwelling regions.

TI  - Murine Model Study of a New Receptor-Targeted Tracer for Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), a critical staging and treatment step, has replaced axillary lymph node (LN) dissection as the standard staging procedure for early stage breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary LNs. Hence, using a murine sentinel lymph node (SLN) model, we investigated the localization effect of the new receptor-targeted tracer, indocyanine green (ICG)-rituximab, on breast cancer SLNB.Methods: After establishing the murine SLN model, different doses of ICG-rituximab were subcutaneously injected into the hind insteps of BALB/c mice to determine the optimal dose and imaging time using continuous (> 3 hours) MDM-I fluorescence vasculature imaging. To explore the capacity of ICG-rituximab for sustained SLN localization with the optimal dose, MDM-I imaging was monitored at 6, 12, and 24 hours.Results: The popliteal LN was defined as the SLN for hindlimb lymphatic drainage, the iliac LN as the secondary, and the para-aortic or renal LN as the tertiary LNs. The SLN initial imaging and optimal imaging times were shortened with increased ICG-rituximab doses, and the imaging rates of the secondary and tertiary LNs increased accordingly. The optimal ICG dose was 0.12 mu g, and its optimal imaging time was 34 minutes. After 24 hours, the SLN imaging rate remained 100%, while those of the secondary and the tertiary LNs increased from 0% (6 hours) and 0% (6 hours) to 10% (12 hours) and 10% (12 hours) to 20% (24 hours) and 10% (24 hours), respectively.Conclusion: ICG-rituximab localized to the SLN without imaging from the secondary or tertiary LNs within 6 hours. The optimal ICG dose was 0.12 mu g, and the optimal interval for SLN detection was 34 minutes to 6 hours post-injection. This novel receptor-targeted tracer is of great value to clinical research and application.

TI  - An evaluation of the consistency of extremes in gridded precipitation data sets
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Noting a strong imperative to understand precipitation extremes, and that considerable uncertainty affects observational data sets, this paper compares the representation of extremes in a number of widely used daily gridded products, derived from rain gauge data, satellite retrieval and reanalysis for the conterminous United States. Analysis is based upon the concept of tail dependence arising in multivariate extreme value theory, and we infer the level of temporal dependence in the joint tail of the precipitation probability distribution for pairwise comparisons of products. In this way, we consider the range of products more like an ensemble and examine the relationships between members, and do not attempt to define, or compare products to, some ground truth. Linear correlation between products is also computed. Considerable discrepancy between groups of products, both annually and seasonally, is linked to source data and complex terrain. In particular, products based on rain gauge data showed remarkable similarity, but differed considerably, showing almost total loss of extremal dependence during DJF in mountainous regions, when compared with satellite products. Additionally, simulated re-forecasts revealed reasonable temporal agreement with large scale generated extremes. The diversity and extent of discrepancies identified across all products raises important questions about their use, and we urge caution, particularly for products derived from satellite data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change and its driving factors of built-up land sprawl in Yangzhou City
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up land sprawl is the most drastic and visual manifestation of urban land -use change. Understanding spatiotemporal change of built-up land sprawl and its driving forces can reveal the inherent laws of urban sprawl, and thus scientifically regulate urban land use. In this study, we used multi -source data (e.g., 30 m resolution Landsat images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) and socioeconomic data to analyze spatiotemporal changes of built-up land sprawl in Yangzhou City. Further, we employed the boosted regression tree method to quantify the effects of geographic, social and economic factors on such sprawl. Results showed that the builtup land area gradually increased from 725.4 km2 in 1995 to 1076.5 km2 in 2015. With the increasing urbanization, the spatial form of built-up land tended to be compact and regular, and the gravity coordinates also migrated accordingly, showing local attraction and linkage of municipal districts (e.g., Hanjiang and Guangling). Among geographic, social, and economic factors, geographic factors (e.g., altitude, the distance from the county core, the distance from built-up land) had the greatest influence on built-up land sprawl, with the relative influence gradually decreasing from 73.9% in 1995-2000 to 60.2% in 2010-2015. The influence of social and economic factors gradually increased from 5.2% and 20.9% in 1995-2000 to 7.9% and 31.9% in 2010-2015. Geographic factors (e.g., the distance from the county core and the distance from built-up land) generally had negative effect on built-up land sprawl, but the effects of social and economic factors were inconsistent. For example, population density, GDP per capita and fiscal revenue promoted built-up land sprawl, gross population inhibited it, and secondary industry first inhibited built-up land sprawl and then promoted it.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for HY-1C CZI over Turbid Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - China's HY-1C ocean-observing satellite was launched successfully on September 7, 2018. It carries a four-channel wide-band coastal zone imager (CZI) that has 50 m spatial resolution and 950 km swath width. To exploit the potential of quantitative ocean color inversion, accurate atmospheric correction is needed. However, because of the CZI band settings, the realization of this goal is a challenge, especially for turbid water with complex optical properties. This study investigated the atmospheric correction algorithm for the CZI over turbid water. First, using the 6SV radiative transfer model, CZI Rayleigh lookup tables (LUTs) were built to correct for atmospheric molecular Rayleigh scattering, greatly shortening the time required for operational data processing. Second, CZI aerosol scattering was removed using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol LUTs and quasi-synchronous MODIS aerosol products. The accuracy of the CZI atmospheric correction was validated using data from the highly turbid Bohai Sea. In comparison with synchronous in situ data, the results showed the average relative error of CZI remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue, green and red bands was 32.51 %, 25.38 % and 42.10 %, respectively. Comparison of CZI Rrs with quasi-synchronous MODIS data revealed similar spatial distributions, although the spatial information from the CZI was more detailed. The results proved the validity and accuracy of the CZI atmospheric correction algorithm over turbid water, which lays a foundation for quantitative ocean color inversion with high spatial resolution in the coastal zone.

TI  - Robust fuzzy clustering for multiple instance regression
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple instance regression (MIR) operates on a collection of bags, where each bag contains many instances sharing the same real-valued label. Only few instances, called primary instances, contribute to the bag labels. The remaining ones are noisy observations. The goal in MIR is to identify the primary instances within each bag and learn a regression model that can predict the label of a previously unseen bag. In this paper, we show that regression models can be identified as clusters when appropriate features and distances are used. We introduce an algorithm, called Robust Fuzzy Clustering for Multiple Instance Regression (RFC-MIR), that can learn multiple linear models simultaneously. First, RFC-MIR uses constrained fuzzy memberships to obtain an initial partition where instances can belong to multiple models with various degrees. Then, it uses unconstrained possibilistic memberships to allow the initial local models to expand and converge to the global model. These memberships are also used to identify the primary instances within each bag. After clustering, the possibilistic memberships are used to identify the optimal number of regression models. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data sets generated by varying the dimensionality of the feature space, the number of instances per bag, and the noise level. We also validate the RFC-MIR using two real applications: prediction of the yearly average yield of a crop using remote sensing data; and drug activity prediction. These applications have been used consistently to validate existing MIR algorithms. We show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than existing methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Rainfall Variability and Flood Prognosis Analysis Using Satellite Data over North Bihar during the August 2017 Flood Event
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most common natural disasters in India. Typically, the Kosi and Gandak river basins are well-known for lingering flood affected basins in North Bihar every year, which lies in the eastern part of India. There were no such comprehensive studies available in North Bihar that discussed flood progression and regression at shorter time-scales like two day intervals. So in this study, we employed high temporal resolution data to capture inundation extent and further, the flood extent has been validated with high spatial resolution data. The specific objective of this study was to analyze the satellite-derived Near Real Time (NRT) MODIS flood product for spatiotemporal mapping of flood progression and regression over the North Bihar. The synthetic aperture RADAR (SAR) data were also used to validate the MODIS NRT Flood data. As a case study, we selected a recent flood event of August-September 2017 and captured the flood inundation spatial extent at two day intervals using the 2 day composite NRT flood data. The flood prognosis analysis has revealed that during the peak flooding period, 12% to 17% of the area was inundated and the most adversely affected districts were Darbhanga and Katihar in North Bihar. We estimated that in total nearly 6.5% area of the North Bihar was submerged. The method applied was simple, but it can still be suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in hydrological modeling. It can be concluded that the NRT MODIS flood product was beneficial to monitor flood prognosis over a larger geographical area where observational data are limited. Nevertheless, it was noticed that the flood extent area derived from MODIS NRT data has overestimated areal extent, but preserved the spatial pattern of flood. Apparently, the present flood prognosis analysis can be improved by integrating microwave remote sensing data (SAR) and hydrological models.

AB  - Each nation has its own specific features, national character, moral norms, customs, manners, traditions, and lifestyle. Each nation has its own culture that has developed over hundreds of years and certainly affects the people's way of life and educational process. The desire to teach descendants progressive traditions and advanced morality, to cultivate their positive qualities is a sign of regularity and foresight. In this work the authors analyze the literary heritage of the prominent Kazakh poets where they expressed advanced ideas in all spheres of social science, including moral education, i.e. in the field of pedagogy, that has been preserved and has reached our days. The close attention is given to the works of poets-zhyrau of the Aral Sea and Syr Darya area that greatly contributed to the cultivation of love for the Motherland in the younger generation, and had a purpose to instill in them the best human qualities. The powerful pedagogical role of these poetic works was thoroughly analyzed.

TI  - Triggered slip on multifaults after the 2018 M<sub>w</sub> 6.4 Hualien earthquake by continuous GPS and InSAR measurements
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 6 February 2018 at 23: 50 local time, a M-w 6.4 earthquake struck eastern Taiwan. We characterize the instantaneous surface ground motion and the permanent displacement induced by this event from continuous GPS data and SAR images within a short time after the mainshock. We use high-rate GPS positioning techniques to obtain epoch-by-epoch positions peak ground displacement to assess potential seismic damage. The maximum coseismic GPS horizontal displacement of about 450 mm trending to the northeast is observed at the station HUAL located on the hanging wall of the Milun fault. The PEPU located on the footwall of the Milun fault shows a coseismic horizontal displacement of 280 mm trending to the southwest and a coseismic uplift of about 70 mm. Moreover, ascending and descending tracks of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR images are processed to estimate coseismic surface deformation along the line-of-sight (LOS) toward the satellite. Then, wide coverage from east-west and uplift components of surface deformation is fulfilled by combining the LOS displacement from ascending and descending interferograms. The main deformation area revealed by both GPS results and D-InSAR interferograms is concentrated around the Milun and Lingding faults. Significant uplift on the footwall of the northern Lingding Fault implies that the Milun fault and an unknown west-dipping fault close to the Lingding fault were triggered. Both the two nodal planes of the M-w 6.4 Hualien event could be different with the kinematic behavior of the Milun fault and Lingding fault. Thus we suggest that slip on multiple faults was triggered during the 0206 event.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is a prerequisite metalloid for humans and animals. But, its essentialness or phytotoxicity is still obscure. Here, we investigated the dual effects of sodium selenite (0, 25, 50 or 100 mu M) on the physio-biochemical, anatomical and molecular alterations in different Brassicca napus L cultivars (viz. Zheda 619, Zheda 622, ZY 50, and ZS 758). Findings revealed that Se-supplementation markedly boosted the plant growth and biomasses by improving mineral uptake, water-soluble protein, sugar, photosynthetic efficiency regarding the pigments and gas exchange parameters. Higher Se-levels impaired the photosynthetic efficiency, deplete nutrients-uptake, osmotic stress by proline accumulation and higher Se-accumulation in roots led to growth and biomass reduction. Se-supplementation minimized the accumulation of ROS (hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radical), malondialdehyde and methylglyoxal (MG) levels by activating the enzymes engaged in AsA-GSH cycle and ROS-MG detoxification. But, elevated-Se impaired the oxidative metabolism by desynchronizing the antioxidants as revealed by decreasing levels of ascorbic acid, activities and expression levels of catalase, glutathione reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase. Up-regulation of secondary metabolites genes (PAL, PPO) revealed the role of Se in regulating transcriptional networks involved in oxidative stress. The damages in leaf and root ultra-structures disclosed the Se-phytotoxicity. Together, outcomes uncovered the protective mechanism of Se (till 25 mu M) by reinforcing the plant morphology, photosynthesis, osmo-protection, redox balance, enzyme activities for ROS-MG detoxification by reducing ROS and MG components. Excessive-Se prompt phytotoxicity by impairing above mentioned parameters, especially at 100 M Se. Among all B. napus cultivars, Zheda 622 was discovered as highly-susceptible and ZS 758 showed greatest-tolerance against Se stress. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer: Evidence, Controversies, Consensus
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Review
AB  - The results of the international St. Gallen Consensus Conference for the treatment of patients with primary breast cancer were discussed this year by a working group of leading breast cancer experts in view of the therapy recommendations for everyday clinical practice in Germany. Three of the breast can-cer experts are also members of this year's St. Gallen panel. The comparison of the St. Gallen recommendations with the annually updated treatment recommendations of the AGO 2019 as well as the S3 guideline is useful, since the recommendations of the St. Gallen panel represent the opinions of experts from various countries and disciplines. The recommendations of the S3 guideline and AGO are based on evidence-based research of the literature. This year's 16th St. Gallen conference featured the motto "Magnitude of clinical benefit". In addition to the evidence-based data, each therapeutic decision must also undergo a benefit/risk assessment of the patient's individual situation and be discussed with the patient.

TI  - Structural Modeling of the Concept <i>Licht</i> in the German View of the World
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at describing a fragment of the German linguistic worldview, which includes the concept Licht (light), based on a comprehensive analysis of the materials of etymological, explanatory, phraseological dictionaries, the digital dictionary system of the German language DWDS. Conceptual, figurative and axiological meanings of the concept are formed on the basis of studying the etymology and semantics of the key lexeme Licht. This lexeme is a means of objectification of the concept and of analysis of phraseological and paremiological units of the German language and literary contexts, as well as associative series using the results of the experiment. Methods and techniques of the research include the analysis of dictionary definitions, descriptive and interpretive methods, and continuous and special sampling methods, a corpus study and an associative experiment. The leading methods are the method of conceptual analysis, the implementation of which is facilitated by the methods of component analysis of lexical, phraseological and paremiological units, as well as the modeling method, which involves the concept content representation in the form of cognitive traits.The fundamental understanding of the concept, based on etymology and dictionary definitions, is defined as "glow, light" and "light sources". Also, light is a physical phenomenon or electricity; God and the divine beginning; joy (figuratively); a positive value.To identify figurative and perceptual characteristics of the concept under consideration, an experiment was conducted, which showed that light sources, heat, emotions and feelings, color perception, attitude to God, physical phenomenon, abstract concepts are associated with light by German speakers. Most of the respondents' response words have evaluative characteristics with a positive connotation.The axiological components of the concept Licht are manifested in bipolarity, that is in the opposition of light and darkness, as well as in ambivalence that gives it both positive and negative characteristics. Based on the analysis of linguistic means of the concept objectification, the following cognitive layers were introduced with sectors: a description (physical state, intellectual activity, emotional state, characteristic features, actions and behavior); clearness, obviousness, manifestation (explanation, discovery, revealing something, a vivid manifestation of a sign); aim; measure (measurement of time, speed, distance, quantity); sign (pointer, signal); aesthetics (external beauty, gloss, purity, quality).The concept Licht turns out to be a significant concept in the system of values of the German-speaking society; it represents ethical and aesthetic views in the German linguaculture.

TI  - The significance of magical realism in the novels of Elechi Amadi
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the novels The Concubine and The Great Ponds, Elechi Amadi, through the magical realist tradition, revisits the precolonial past of the Ikwerre (Nigeria) to showcase the cultural and intellectual sophistication of this society. As represented in Amadi's writing, this was a well-structured society with its own credible social and cultural values that defined and explained their worldview, with nothing to envy in the West. In The Concubine, for example, the fates of the men (Emenike, Madume, and Ekwueme) who intend to marry Ihuoma can be explained naturally as well as supernaturally. In The Great Ponds, the novelist employs African mythology to critique the Western arrogance and egocentricity that plunged the world in the purposeless and wasteful war of 1914-18, as well as complicating character and meaning in this novel through the supernatural. Through the war over fishing rights in the Wagaba pond between Chiolu and Aliakoro, Amadi transposes some of the consequences of the First World War, such as the death and suffering that involved the Central and Allied Powers, into his narrative. Amadi's magical realist fiction is a celebration of indigenous beliefs and culture, as well as a tool to explore character and history.

TI  - Determinants of inter-practice variation in childhood asthma and respiratory infections: cross-sectional study of a national sentinel network
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Respiratory infections are associated with acute exacerbations of asthma and accompanying morbidity and mortality. In this study we explore interpractice variations in respiratory infections in children with asthma and study the effect of practice-level factors on these variations.Design Cross-sectional study.Setting We analysed data from 164 general practices in the Royal College of General PractitionersResearch and Surveillance Centresentinel network in England.Participants Children 5-12 years.Interventions None. In this observational study, we used regression analysis to explore the impact of practice-level determinants on the number of respiratory infections in children with asthma.Primary and secondary outcome measures We describe the distribution of childhood asthma and the determinants of upper/lower respiratory tract infections in these children.Results 83.5% (137/164) practices were in urban locations; the mean number of general practitioners per practice was 7; and the mean duration since qualification 19.7 years. We found almost 10-fold difference in the rate of asthma (1.5-11.8 per 100 children) and 50-fold variation in respiratory infection rates between practices. Larger practices with larger lists of asthmatic children had greater rates of respiratory infections among these children.Conclusion We showed that structural/environmental variables are consistent predictors of a range of respiratory infections among children with asthma. However, contradictory results between measures of practice clinical care show that a purely structural explanation for variability in respiratory infections is limited. Further research is needed to understand how the practice factors influence individual risk behaviours relevant to respiratory infections.

TI  - ANXIETY BUFFER DISRUPTION: RELATIONSHIP THREAT, DEATH ANXIETY, AND COPING APPRAISALS AMONG LOW AND HIGH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOM SAMPLES
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Prior work suggests that people function effectively in the world, in part, by relying on sociocultural anxiety-buffer systems to protect against death anxiety. However, traumatic experiences may overwhelm and disrupt those systems, and this work tests whether posttraumatic stress symptoms reflect a vulnerability to death anxiety and risk of coping failure. Method: Following posttraumatic stress screening (n = 4129), individuals with low (n = 187) and high (n = 186) posttraumatic stress symptoms engaged in either an anxiety-buffer stressor task (contemplating relationship problems) or control task. Participants subsequently reported death anxiety and made coping appraisals. Results: Results supported four key hypotheses. Among individuals with low posttraumatic stress: (1) death anxiety was low under control conditions but moderately increased after contemplating relationship problems; and (2) perceived coping ability remained high in both conditions. However, among those with high posttraumatic stress: (3) death anxiety was exceptionally high in both the relationship problems prime and the control conditions-indicating anxiety buffer disruption; and (4) perceived coping ability was low in the control condition, and even lower after contemplating relationship problems. Conclusions: These findings support the hypotheses and make novel contributions, in that prior research on the existential implications of PTSD have not considered that anxiety buffer disruption may be associated with failure to cope with new challenges after traumatic experiences. Future research should determine whether therapies can improve the core dimensions of functional worldviews, a sense of meaning and self- esteem, and whether such improvements result in improvements to perceived coping abilities.

TI  - Cutavirus DNA in Malignant and Nonmalignant Skin of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma and Organ Transplant Patients but Not of Healthy Adults
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Three new parvoviruses of Protoparvovirus genus, bufavirus (BuV), tusavirus (TuV), and cutavirus (CuV), have recently been discovered in diarrheal stools. CuV was further detected in a proportion of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)/mycosis fungoides skin samples and in one melanoma.Patients and Methods With novel multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction and antibody assays, we studied 3 patient groups for BuV, TuV, and CuV DNA and immunoglobulin G (IgG): CTCL patients, immunosuppressed solid-organ transplant recipients, and immunocompetent healthy adults.Results CuV DNA was detected in skin biopsies of 4/25 (16.0%) CTCL and 4/136 (2.9%) transplant patients but not in any of 159 skin samples of 98 healthy adults. The dermal CuV-DNA prevalence was significantly higher in CTCL patients than in the other subjects. CuV DNA was further detected in healthy skin of 4 organ transplant recipients, 2 of whom also had CuV-positive skin carcinomas. One CTCL patient harbored CuV DNA in both malignant (CTCL, melanoma) and nonmalignant skin and sentinel lymph nodes but not in his prostate. The CuV IgG seroprevalences were among CTCL patients 9.5% (4/42), transplant recipients 6.5% (8/124), and healthy adults 3.8% (3/78). BuV and TuV DNAs were absent and antibodies infrequent in all cohorts. Parvoviral antibodies were shown to persist for 20 years and dermal CuV DNA for 4 years. All 3 CuV-DNA-positive patients, with both biopsies and sera available, were CuV-IgG positive.Conclusion Our results suggest that dermal CuV DNA carriage is associated with CTCL. Any putative roles of CuV in the carcinogenesis must be determined in forthcoming studies.This study revealed a significantly higher human cutavirus DNA prevalence in the skin of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients, compared to organ transplant recipients and healthy adults. This suggests that dermal CuV DNA is significantly associated with CTCL.

TI  - The Appropriation of Symbolic Language in Worldview Education through Bibliodrama
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main questions regarding Dutch primary education in our secularised and religiously diverse society-both with regards to public and religiously-affiliated schools-is how to get students acquainted with the symbolic language of religious and worldview-affiliated life narratives. Teaching literacy in symbolic language has become less important in the education programmes of modern-day primary schools. The dominance of scientific descriptive language is evident in the majority of contemporary curricula. This language may be highly important for teaching mathematics and science, but for religious and cultural education, and for teaching art and history, symbolic language is the vehicle for acquiring knowledge, insight, and wisdom. Our aim in this article is to reflect on the idea that stimulating symbolic speech in primary school education through role playing, will bring out the sensitivity of current-day students to confer meaning to life questions and life themes.

TI  - Sensory Integration Theory in Psychotherapy: A Case Study
T2  - CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As emotional beings in a physical body, human consciousness and perception are bombarded with information from within and without. Information comes from the body's sensory systems, which helps a human know if a situation is safe or not safe, pleasurable or painful, with which to engage or to avoid. As situations become common, the body lessens the response in deference to new situations. The push and pull of neural focus impacts perception, behavior, and emotions. This paper uses sensory integration theory to examine a psychotherapeutic case study and make connections to perceptions and worldview that stem from the body responses to the environment. Sensory systems are explained in the context of the lived experience of an adult and his reflection on childhood. This case study sheds light on the maladaptive behaviors that may arise from misperceptions and suggests a therapeutic approach that uses the connection of mind and body to build rapport, work through client resistance, and ultimately bring subconscious body processes that impact perception into consciousness.

TI  - Spatial and temporal scales of variability of cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms from NOAA GLERL airborne hyperspectral imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - NOAA GLERL has routinely flown a hyperspectral imager to detect cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) over the Great Lakes since 2015. Three consecutive years of hyperspectral imagery over the Great Lakes warn drinking water intake managers of the presence of cyanoHABs. Western basin imagery of Lake Erie contributes to a weekly report to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency using the cyanobacteria index (CI) as an indicator of the presence of cyanoHABs. The CI is also used for the weekly NOAA NCCOS cyanoHAB Lake Erie bulletin applied to satellite data. To date, there has not been a sensor comparison to look at the variability between the satellite and hyperspectral imagery on a pixel-by-pixel basis, as well as a time scale comparison between measurements from buoys and shipboard surveys. The spatial scale is a measure of size of a cyanobacteria bloom on a scale of meters to kilometers. The change in the spatial scale or spatial variability has been quantified from satellite and airborne imagery using a decorrelation scale analysis to find the point at which the values are not changing or are not correlated with each other. The decorrelation scales were also applied to the buoy and shipboard survey data to look at temporal scales or changes in time on hourly to daytime scales for blue-green algae, chlorophyll and temperature. These scales are valuable for ecosystem modelers and for those initiating sampling efforts to optimize sampling plans and to infer a potential mechanism in an observational study from a synoptic viewpoint.

TI  - Dry/wet snow mapping based on the synergistic use of dual polarimetric SAR and multispectral data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a multi-sensor multi-spectral and bi-temporal dual-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data integration scheme for dry/wet snow mapping using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data which are freely available to the research community. The integration is carried out by incorporating the information retrieved from ratio images of the conventional method for wet snow mapping and the multispectral data in two different frameworks. Firstly, a simple differencing scheme is employed for dry/wet snow mapping, where the snow cover area is derived using the Normalized Differenced Snow Index (NDSI). In the second framework, the ratio images are stacked with the multispectral bands and this stack is used for supervised and unsupervised classification using support vector machines for dry/wet snow mapping. We also investigate the potential of a state of the art backscatter model for the identification of dry/wet snow using Sentinel-1 data. The results are validated using a reference map derived from RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. A good agreement was observed between the results and the reference data with an overall accuracy greater than 0.78 for the different blending techniques examined. For all the proposed frameworks, the wet snow was better identified. The coefficient of determination between the snow wetness derived from the backscatter model and the reference based on RADARSAT-2 data was observed to be 0.58 with a significantly higher root mean square error of 1.03% by volume.

TI  - The 2015/16 El Nino-related glacier changes in the tropical Andes
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant changes in the area and snowline altitude of two glacierized mountains - Nevado Champara (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) and Cerro Tilata (Cordillera Real, Bolivia) - in the tropical Andes, before and after the recent El Nino in 2015/16 period, have been analysed using Sentinel 2A and Landsat data. It is seen that the recent El Nino has been accompanied by higher fluctuation in glacier coverage on Nevado Champara and the loss of glacier coverage on Cerro Tilata was very high during the past 16 years. Rise in snowline altitude of selected glaciers was very high after the 2015/16 El Nino. Increase in the area covered by snow and ice during the La Nina periods were not enough to cover the ice loss occurred during the previous El Nino events and the strongest El Nino in 2015/16 was followed by a significant loss of ice-covered areas in the tropical Andes. Freshwater resources in this region will be affected in the near future if the current trends in glacier decline continue. Adaptation strategies needs to be implemented to reduce the impacts of the continuing loss of glacierized on regional communities in the tropical Andean region.

TI  - Revised Global Wave Number Spectra From Recent Altimeter Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sea surface height wave number spectra are revisited using the most recent, lower-noise satellite altimeter missions from Saral/AltiKa and Sentinel-3 and compared to Jason-2 wave number spectra. Spectral preprocessing is configured to minimize the spectral slope distortion in the mesoscale wavelength range. A geographically variable wavelength range is used to calculate the spectral slopes, taking into account the regional eddy length scales based on the local Rossby radius. This dynamical wavelength range increases the spectral slope by 0.5 in middle to high latitudes, compared to a fixed wavelength range, and by -1.0 to 1.0 in different regions of the intertropical band. Using this dynamical wavelength range, mean sea surface height wave number spectra for these lower-noise missions exhibit low slope values (k(-2)) in the intertropical band, values of k(-11/3) in the midlatitudes, and reaches k(-5) in the subpolar regions and the Antarctic circumpolar current. An important seasonality is also revealed, with mesoscale spectral slope amplitudes decreasing in winter by 0.5 to 1.5 compared to summer, for the middle- to high-energy regions. A phase-locked internal tide correction is tested but has only a small impact on the spectral slope estimates when using the dynamical wavelength range.

TI  - Comparative analysis of CORINE and climate change initiative land cover maps in Europe: Implications for wildfire occurrence estimation at regional and local scales
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Updated and harmonized land cover (LC) data is essential for wildfire estimation in fire-prone areas as is the case in southern Europe. CORINE Land cover (CLC) and ESA Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) maps have been analyzed and compared their performance in the estimation of wildfire occurrence in Europe at regional and local scales for the period 2010-2014. LC maps legends were harmonized and similarities and discrepancies were compared. Overall agreement between the two maps for the whole Europe was (similar to)75%. Forest and agriculture showed the largest agreement, while shrubland and grassland the lowest. Quantity and allocation disagreements were calculated including exchange and shift components (Pontius and Santacruz, 2014) which provided detailed information about the contribution of each class to the overall disagreement. Spatial discrepancies were found in areas where grassland and shrubland were the dominant classes as in United Kingdom or East Turkey. Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) was used as ground truth for validation purposes. The agreement with LUCAS was slightly higher for CCI-LC (59%) than for CLC (56%). Generalized Linear Models (GLM), based on presence-absence of wildfires, were used to estimate wildfire occurrence at 3 x 3 km grid cell resolution from both LC maps at the European scale. LC interfaces and climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) where used as explicative variables while fires from European Forest Fire Information System EFFIS (2010-2014 period) were used as response variable. Wildfire occurrence was also estimated with the two maps at local scale in a test region (Zamora, Spain) using a more precise location of the response variable (x, y fire ignition points). At the European scale models obtained within the two maps showed similar results. CCI-LC model sensitivity was 77.26%, specificity 25.89% and omission error 22.74% while CLC model sensitivity was 75.68%, specificity 29.99% and omission error 24.32%. However, CLC performed slightly better in terms of the percent correct classification (62%). In the test region the models achieved better results in terms of specificity (66.07% and 68.93% for CCI-LC and CLC models respectively) and percent correct classification ((similar to)68% for CLC model). At local scale CLC model performed better than CCI-LC model. Wildfire occurrence estimation was more accurate at local scale because of the differences in the spatial accuracy of the response variable used.

M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful remote sensing technique, which provides high spatial resolution images with continuous temporal coverage of the Earth surface data for monitoring of long-term landslide displacement. In the current study over Gulaba Camp in Manali to Marhi (Himachal Pradesh, India) region, a novel approach called persistent scatterer interferometry is applied to monitor the landslide using 30 ascending and 23 descending Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath image data sets. Results over a span of 26 months clearly indicate trends of surface subsidence over abandoned landslide site and the adjoining areas. This study demonstrates that multi-temporal persistent scatterer interferometry have capability of high precision monitoring of the landslide displacements.

TI  - Sentinel 2-Based Nitrogen VRT Fertilization in Wheat: Comparison between Traditional and Simple Precision Practices
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to compare standard and precision nitrogen (N) fertilization with variable rate technology (VRT) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by combining data of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from the Sentinel 2 satellite, grain yield mapping, and protein content. Precision N rates were calculated using simple linear models that can be easily used by non-specialists of precision agriculture, starting from widely available Sentinel 2 NDVI data. To remove the effects of not measured or unknown factors, the study area of about 14 hectares, located in Central Italy, was divided into 168 experimental units laid down in a randomized design. The first fertilization rate was the same for all experimental units (30 kg N ha(-1)). The second one was varied according to three different treatments: 1) a standard rate of 120 kg N ha(-1) calculated by a common N balance; 2) a variable rate (60-120 kg N ha(-1)) calculated from NDVI using a linear model where the maximum rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-low); 3) a variable rate (90-150 kg N ha(-1)) calculated from NDVI using a linear model where the mean rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-high). Results indicate that differences between treatments in crop vegetation index, grain yield, and protein content were negligible and generally not significant. This evidence suggests that a low-N management approach, based on simple linear NDVI models and VRT, may considerably reduce the economic and environmental impact of N fertilization in winter wheat.

TI  - Risk of Melanoma Recurrence After Diagnosis of a High-Risk Primary Tumor
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ImportanceWith emerging new systemic treatments for metastatic melanoma, early detection of disease recurrence is increasingly important. ObjectiveTo investigate the risk of melanoma recurrence in patients with a localized melanoma at a high risk of metastasis. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA total of 1254 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed tumor category T1b to T4b melanoma in Queensland, Australia, were recruited prospectively between October 1, 2010, and October 1, 2014, for participation in a cohort study. Data analysis was conducted from February 8, 2018, to February 20, 2019. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine associations between patient and tumor factors and melanoma recurrence. ExposuresDisease-free survival (DFS) by melanoma tumor category defined by the 7th vs 8th editions of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (AJCC 7 vs AJCC 8). Main Outcomes and MeasuresMelanoma recurrences were self-reported through follow-up questionnaires administered every 6 months and confirmed by histologic or imaging findings. ResultsOf 1254 patients recruited, 825 individuals (65.8%) agreed to participate. Thirty-six were found to be ineligible after providing consent and a further 89 patients were excluded after reclassifying tumors using AJCC 8, leaving 700 participants with high-risk primary melanoma (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [13.5] years; 410 [58.6%] men). Independent predictors of recurrence were head or neck site of primary tumor, ulceration, thickness, and mitotic rate greater than 3/mm(2) (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.19-4.71). Ninety-four patients (13.4%) developed a recurrence within 2 years of diagnosis: 66 tumors (70.2%) were locoregional, and 28 tumors (29.8%) developed at distant sites. After surgery for locoregional disease, 37 of 64 patients (57.8%) remained disease free at 2 years, 7 patients (10.9%) developed new locoregional recurrence, and 20 patients (31.3%), developed distant disease. Two-year DFS was similar when comparing AJCC 7 and AJCC 8, for T1b (AJCC 7, 253 [93.3% DFS]; AJCC 8, 242 [93.0% DFS]) and T4b (AJCC 7 and AJCC 8, 50 [68.0% DFS] category tumors in both editions. Patients with T2a to T4a tumors who did not have a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at diagnosis had lower DFS than patients with the same tumor category and a negative SLNB (T2a: 136 [91.1%; 95% CI, 86.4-95.9] vs 96 [96.9%; 95 % CI, 93.4-100.0]; T4a: 33 [78.8%; 95% CI, 64.8-92.7] vs 6 [83.3; 95% CI, 53.5-100.0]). Conclusions and RelevanceThese findings suggest that 13.4% of patients with a high-risk primary melanoma will experience disease recurrence within 2 years. Head or neck location of initial tumor, SLNB positivity, and signs of rapid tumor growth may be associated with primary melanoma recurrence.

TI  - Effects of the Chinese arable land fallow system and land-use change on agricultural production and on the economy
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on economic effects of arable land fallow system and land-use change in China using a dynamic single-country, multi-regional computable general equilibrium model. Land supply is adjusted endogenously in our model. Land use in each of 31 provinces is tracked by a land-use change module, which is calibrated with satellite data. Our results reveal that the expansion of real output can be attributed to the increase in capital stock as a result of the growth of investment due to the imposition of the arable land fallow system in China. And the growth of investment is caused by the release of labor from agriculture The reduced supply of arable land in agricultural land contraction regions is partially offset by the increasing arable land in agricultural land expansion regions. Rural households benefit more than urban households from the arable land fallow policy due to relatively higher income and lower rural CPI.

TI  - Surveying Wild Animals from Satellites, Manned Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs): A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This article reviews studies regarding wild animal surveys based on multiple platforms, including satellites, manned aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), and focuses on the data used, animal detection methods, and their accuracies. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each type of remote sensing data and highlight some new research opportunities and challenges. Submeter very-high-resolution (VHR) spaceborne imagery has potential in modeling the population dynamics of large (>0.6 m) wild animals at large spatial and temporal scales, but has difficulty discerning small (<0.6 m) animals at the species level, although high-resolution commercial satellites, such as WorldView-3 and -4, have been able to collect images with a ground resolution of up to 0.31 m in panchromatic mode. This situation will not change unless the satellite image resolution is greatly improved in the future. Manned aerial surveys have long been employed to capture the centimeter-scale images required for animal censuses over large areas. However, such aerial surveys are costly to implement in small areas and can cause significant disturbances to wild animals because of their noise. In contrast, UAS surveys are seen as a safe, convenient and less expensive alternative to ground-based and conventional manned aerial surveys, but most UASs can cover only small areas. The proposed use of UAS imagery in combination with VHR satellite imagery would produce critical population data for large wild animal species and colonies over large areas. The development of software systems for automatically producing image mosaics and recognizing wild animals will further improve survey efficiency.

TI  - Calibration of the Copolarized Backscattering Measurements From Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Wave Mode Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate absolute radiometric calibration of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor is of great importance in quantitative oceanic monitoring. Traditionally, the calibration constant is determined by analyzing measurements of man-made calibrators deployed on land at a high expense. In this paper, a technique called numerical weather prediction (NWP)-based ocean calibration method for estimating the calibration constant on the basis of SAR observations over ocean is applied to the first Chinese C-band SAR satellite Gaofen-3 (GF-3). The ocean calibration is performed on GF-3 wave mode SAR images at VV and HH polarizations over a period of one year from September 2017 to August 2018. Verification against the independent scatterometer-derived winds shows that after NWP-based ocean recalibration, the accuracy of wind speed retrieval from GF-3 wave mode imagery could reach the wind speed estimation performance using the state-of-the-art of SAR data. These results indicate that GF-3 wind retrievals are promising for operational oceanic products and applications if the SAR data are appropriately calibrated by the proposed NWP-based ocean calibration approach.

TI  - Comparative Analyses of Vertical Structure of Deep Convective Clouds Retrieved from Satellites and Ground-Based Radars at Naqu over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve understanding of deep convective clouds over the Tibetan Plateau, characteristics of vertical structure of a deep strong convective cloud over Naqu station and a deep weak convective cloud approximately 100 km to the west of Naqu station, which occurred over 1300-1600 Beijing Time (BT) 9 July 2014 during the Third Tibetan Plateau Atmospheric Science Experiment (TIPEX-III), are analyzed, based on multi-source satellite data from TRMM, CloudSat, and Aqua, and radar data from ground-based vertically pointing radars (C-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar and KA-band millimeter wave cloud radar). The results are as follows. (1) The horizontal scales of both the deep strong and deep weak convective clouds were small (10-20 km), and their tops were high [15-16 km above sea level (ASL)]. Across the level of 0 degrees C isotherm in the deep strong convective cloud, the reflectivity increased rapidly, suggesting that the melting process of solid precipitation particles through the 0 degrees C level played an important role. A bright band located at 5.5 km ASL (i.e., 1 km above ground level) appeared during the period of convection weakening. (2) The reflectivity values from TRMM precipitation radar below 11 km were found to be overestimated compared to those derived from the C-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar. (3) Deep convective clouds were mainly ice clouds, and there were rich small ice particles above 10 km, while few large ice particles were found below 10 km. The microphysical processes of deep strong and deep weak convective clouds mainly included mixed-phase process and glaciated process, and the mixed-phase process can be divided into two types: one was the rimming process below the level of -25 degrees C (deep strong convective cloud) or -29 degrees C (deep weak convective cloud) and the other was aggregation and deposition process above that level. The latter process was accompanied with fast increase in ice particle effective radius. The above evidence from space-based and ground-based observational data further clarify the characteristics of vertical structure of deep convective clouds over the Tibetan Plateau, and provide a basis for the evaluation of simulation results of deep convective clouds by cloud models.

TI  - Dynamic detection of water surface area of Ebinur Lake using multi-source satellite data (Landsat and Sentinel-1A) and its responses to changing environment
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological bather of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of intermonth dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km(2) in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km(2) in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km(2). The seasonal variations showed the stages of "sharp rising" - "significant decreasing" - "gradual stabilizing" in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Subpixel Land Cover Mapping Based on Dual Processing Paths for Hyperspectral Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The subpixel mapping (SPM) technique can handle coarse fractional images derived by unmixing coarse original hyperspectral (HS) image to produce a fine land cover map at the subpixel scale. A popular SPM approach is a two-step model. It first increases the spatial resolution of coarse fractional images by subpixel sharpening to produce fine fractional images and then assigns class labels to each subpixel by the class allocation method. However, there is only a single processing path of the current SPM algorithm, and the information type of the fine fractional images is not rich. To enrich the information type, SPM based on dual processing paths (DPP) is proposed. DPP contains two processing paths, namely spatial-spectral path and multiscale path. First, the coarse original HS image and the high spatial resolution multispectral image are fused by component substitution to produce the fine fractional images with more spatial-spectral information in the spatial-spectral path. At the same time, deep Laplacian pyramid networks are used to obtain the fine fractional images with multiscale information in the multiscale path. The fine fractional images from the two paths are then integrated to generate the improved fraction images with multiscale spatial-spectral information. Finally, the multiscale spatial-spectral information is utilized to allocate class labels by the class allocationmethod. Experimental results on three realHSremote sensing data showthat the proposed DPP outperforms the other SPM methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the use of DPP in enriching the information type of the fine fractional images.

TI  - Offshore Platform Extraction Using RadarSat-2 SAR Imagery: A Two-Parameter CFAR Method Based on Maximum Entropy
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to determine the number and location of offshore platforms is of great significance for offshore oil spill monitoring and offshore oil and gas development. Considering the problem that the detection threshold parameters of the two-parameter constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm require manual and repeated adjustment of the during the extraction of offshore platform targets, this paper proposes a two-parameter CFAR target detection method based on maximum entropy based on information entropy theory. First, a series of threshold parameters are obtained using the two-parameter CFAR algorithm for target detection. Then, according to the maximum entropy principle, the optimal threshold is estimated to obtain the target detection results of the possible offshore platform. Finally, the neighborhood analysis method is used to eliminate false alarm targets such as ships, and the final target of the offshore platform is obtained. In this study, we conducted offshore platform extraction experiments and an accuracy evaluation using data from the Pearl River Estuary Basin of the South China Sea. The results show that the proposed method for platform extraction achieves an accuracy rate of 97.5% and obtains the ideal offshore platform distribution information. Thus, the proposed method can objectively obtain the optimal target detection threshold parameters, greatly reduce the influence of subjective parameter setting on the extraction results during the target detection process and effectively extract offshore platform targets.

TI  - Detecting multi-temporal land cover change and land surface temperature in Pearl River Delta by adopting local climate zone
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the spatial-temporal changes of land cover and the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region from 2000 to 2015. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) concept is used, given its standard but comprehensive classification scheme designed for urban climate studies. Firstly, historical LCZ maps of the PRD region were generated using the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) protocol. Secondly, summer mean land surface temperature (LST) during daytime and night-time was retrieved from remote sensing data to analyze the SUHI. Thirdly, the correspondence between the spatial-temporal patterns of LCZ and LST were explored. The results show that urbanization in this region comprises transformation from natural land covers to built types and conversion in the built up, in particular densification and vertical enhancement of existing urban types. The LST in the region increased in general but the spatial pattern of LST increase is affected by the land cover change. LCZ 6 (open low-rise) and LCZ 8 (large low-rise) show the greatest increase in LST. LCZ 4 (open high-rise) and LCZ 8 are the two dominant LCZs in high SUHI zone and LCZ 8 keeps growing as the most principal LCZ type.

TI  - Importance of structural and spectral parameters in modelling the aboveground carbon stock of urban vegetation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to comparatively assess the effectiveness of spectral and structural parameters of vegetation in estimating aboveground carbon (AGC) stock by vegetation type. A total of 38 structural metrics (including 21 percentiles) derived from LiDAR data, and 105 spectral indices and reflectance (including 10 percentiles for each of them) from Landsat 8 imagery were comprehensively assessed. It is found that the best-performing structural parameters vary with vegetation type. Namely, standard deviation of height is the best predictor for trees (R-2 = 0.83) while the mode of height is the best for shrubs (R-2 = 0.64). Of the spectral parameters, GNDVI(p80) (80 percentile of normalised difference vegetation index of green band) is the best for trees (R-2 = 0.51), and Green_Max is the best for shrubs (R-2 = 0.44). Furthermore, the estimation models based on structural parameters (R-2 >= 0.83 and RMSE >= 46.8 Mg C ha(-1) for trees, and R-2 >= 0.57 and RMSE >= 9.3 Mg C ha(-1) for shrubs) are more accurate than those based on spectral parameters (R-2 >= 0.46 and RMSE >= 54 Mg C ha(-1) for tress, and R-2 >= 0.44 and RMSE >= 11.9 Mg C ha(-1) for shrubs) despite the identified inaccuracy in LiDAR-derived height. Nevertheless, the joint consideration of both spectral and structural parameters in the same estimation model does not make it markedly more accurate than those involving either structural or spectral parameters.

TI  - Evaluation of Forest Damaged Area and Severity Caused by Ice-snow Frozen Disasters over Southern China with Remote Sensing
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate assessment of forest damage is important basis for the forest post-disaster recovery process and ecosystem management. This study evaluates the spatial distribution of damaged forest and its damaged severity caused by ice-snow disaster that occurred in southern China during January 10 to February 2 in 2008. The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13Q1 products are used, which include two vegetation indices data of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furtherly, after Quality Screening (QS) and Savizky-Golay (S-G) filtering of MODIS 13Q1 data, four evaluation indices are obtained, which are NDVI with QS (QSNDVI), EVI with QS (QSEVI), NDVI with S-G filtering (SGNDVI) and EVI with S-G filtering (SGEVI). The study provides a new way of firstly determining the threshold for each image pixel for damaged forest evaluation, by computing the pre-disaster reference value and change threshold with vegetation index from remote sensing data. Results show obvious improvement with the new way for forest damage evaluation, evaluation result of forest damage is much close to the field survey data with standard error of only 0.95 and 1/3 less than the result that evaluated from other threshold method. Comparatively, the QSNDVI shows better performance than other three indices on evaluating forest damages. The evaluated result with QSNDVI shows that the severe, moderate, mild damaged rates of Southern China forests are 47.33%, 34.15%, 18.52%, respectively. By analyzing the influence of topographic and meteorological factors on forest-vegetation damage, we found that the precipitation on freezing days has greater impact on forest-vegetation damage, which is regarded as the most important factor. This study could be a scientific and reliable reference for evaluating the forest damages from ice-snow frozen disasters.

TI  - Estimation of Vegetation Latent Heat Flux over Three Forest Sites in ChinaFLUX using Satellite Microwave Vegetation Water Content Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Latent heat flux (LE) and the corresponding water vapor lost from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere, which is called Evapotranspiration (ET), is one of the key processes in the water cycle and energy balance of the global climate system. Satellite remote sensing is the only feasible technique to estimate LE over a large-scale region. While most of the previous satellite LE methods are based on the optical vegetation index (VI), here we propose a microwave-VI (EDVI) based LE algorithm which can work for both day and night time, and under clear or non-raining conditions. This algorithm is totally driven by multiple-sensor satellite products of vegetation water content index, solar radiation, and cloud properties, with some aid from a reanalysis dataset. The satellite inputs and the performance of this algorithm are validated with in situ measurements at three ChinaFLUX forest sites. Our results show that the selected satellite observations can indeed serve as the inputs for the purpose of estimating ET. The instantaneous estimations of LE (LEcal) from this algorithm show strong positive temporal correlations with the in situ measured LE (LEobs) with the correlation coefficients (R) of 0.56-0.88 in the study years. The mean bias is kept within 16.0% (23.0 W/m(2)) across the three sites. At the monthly scale, the correlations between the retrieval and the in situ measurements are further improved to an R of 0.84-0.95 and the bias is less than 14.3%. The validation results also indicate that EDVI-based LE method can produce stable LEcal under different cloudy skies with good accuracy. Being independent of any in situ measurements as inputs, this algorithm shows great potential for estimating ET under both clear and cloudy skies on a global scale for climate study.

TI  - Grain and Extent Considerations Are Integral for Monitoring Landscape-Scale Desired Conditions in Fire-Adapted Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed data are commonly used to evaluate forest metrics, such as canopy cover, to assess change detection, and to inform land management planning. Often, canopy cover is measured only at the scale of the spatial data product used in the analysis, and there is a mismatch between the management question and the scale of the data. We compared four readily available remotely sensed landscape data products- Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery -at different spatial grains and multiple extents to assess their consistency and efficacy for quantifying key landscape characteristics of forest canopy patches and sensitivity to change. We examined landscape-scale patterns of forest canopy cover across three landscapes in northern Arizona and assessed their performance using six landscape metrics. Changes in grain and extent affect canopy cover patch metrics and the inferences that can be made from each data product. Overall data products performed differently across landscape metrics. When performing analyses and choosing data layers, it is essential to match the scale of the data product to the management question and understand the limitations inherent in using canopy cover as a stand-alone metric.

TI  - Semianalytical Derivation of Phytoplankton, CDOM, and Detritus Absorption Coefficients From the Landsat 8/OLI Reflectance in Coastal Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 has potential for mapping the water bio-optical properties with high spatial resolution. Landsat 8/OLI generates the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at four visible bands (lambda(1-4) = 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm) and is lack of a 412-nm band commonly included for ocean color sensors. This spectral configuration has limited the use of Landsat 8/OLI reflectance product for analytical derivation of light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and detritus. In this study, we proposed a hybrid approach to fill this gap. First, we developed an algorithm to estimate the reflectance in a virtual band centered at lambda(0) = 412 nm from the OLI reflectance spectra R-rs(lambda(1-4)). Both the estimated R-rs(lambda(0)) and measured R-rs(lambda(1-4)) were then used together to retrieve the water component absorption coefficients with existing algorithms including the quasi-analytical algorithm. We assessed the model performance using in situ measurements from the global waters. It was found that the proposed approach could estimate R-rs(412) with a median absolute percentage difference of similar to 9%. The subsequent retrievals of the component absorption coefficients were satisfactorily accurate, with median absolute percentage difference roughly equal to 35%, 40%, and 60% for phytoplankton, CDOM, and detritus, respectively. The results suggest the feasibility to generate analytically the component absorption coefficients from the Landsat 8/OLI reflectance.

TI  - Performance of MODIS Collection 6.1 Level 3 aerosol products in spatial-temporal variations over land
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the long-term Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level 3 atmospheric aerosol products over land. For this purpose, three monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets, including Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB) and combined DT and DB (DTB) during 2003-2017, are collected. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 2 Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and quality-assured) monthly measurements at 431 sites around the world are selected for comparison. This study attempts to provide a better understanding of the different MODIS products for their applicability at multiple spatial scales and their suitability for representing the long-term trend of aerosol characteristics. Experiments are performed with direct comparisons between MODIS retrievals and AERONET measurements at global, local to site scales. Meanwhile, the spatial and temporal variations are also compared and discussed. Our results illustrate that C6.1 MODIS AOD retrievals are well correlated with AERONET AOD measurements globally, while the DTB product performs best at most regions, yet the DB product is superior at the site scale. In general, Terra AOD products always overestimate while Aqua AOD products are more accurate in describing the annual mean AOD loadings over land. For long-term aerosol trends, there are small differences between Terra and Aqua aerosol products. Among the three aerosol datasets, neither one can consistently outperform the others in both spatial and temporal aerosol variations over land. In general, DTB products can more accurately capture the correct aerosol changes and are strongly recommended for selection in related aerosol studies at the global scale.

TI  - Hf-Nd-Sr isotopic fingerprinting for aeolian dust deposited on glaciers in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau region
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the isotopic compositions of Hf, Nd, and Sr in aeolian dust deposited in several glacier basins of the northeast Tibetan Plateau in order to trace the source and provenance of long-range transported (LRT) dust in the region. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) measurements and dust size distributions both indicated that LRT dust was dominant in glacier cryoconite and snowpacks. Isotopes of Hf-Nd-Sr exhibited a generally heterogeneous geographic distribution that varied from north to south. The northern sites (e.g. Miaoergou Glacier) in the Tianshan Mountains showed much higher epsilon(Nd) and epsilon(Hf) values, whereas the southern sites (e.g. Yuzhufeng Glacier) in the Kunlun Mountains had lower epsilon(Nd), with the Hf isotope exhibiting two parts: one positive epsilon(Hf) section and one negative epsilon(Hf) section. Lower Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were apparent in the Miaoergou Glacier compared to other locations. In general, the Miaoergou Glacier had similar Hf-Nd-Sr isotopic compositions to those of southern Mongolian Gobi and Taklimakan Deserts. By contrast, Qilian Mountain locations exhibited similar Hf, Nd, and Sr isotopic compositions to those of the north Tibetan Plateau soil crust and Chinese Gobi Deserts. However, the Yuzhufeng Glacier, located in the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau, had LRT dust that was derived predominantly from the north Tibetan Plateau desert and surface crust, but also partly from the Taklimakan desert. Compared with Nd-Sr isotopes, Hf-Nd isotopes provided new evidence for LRT dust transport. For example, the Yuzhufeng and Miaoergou Glaciers had similar Hf-Nd isotopes to those of the Taklimakan Desert and Mongolian Gobi, respectively, implying the potential LRT dust source and atmospheric transport routes. The marked spatial differences in LRT dust source were mainly caused by large-scale atmospheric circulation interactions (e.g. the Mongolian High and Westerlies) during spring and summer. Wind stream analysis and MODIS AOD also demonstrated the potential differences in the sources of dust and the routes taken between northern and southern locations. This work provides new evidence and a more complete view of aeolian transport over the northeast Tibetan Plateau region under the current climate.

TI  - Re-biopsy of partially sampled thin melanoma impacts sentinel lymph node sampling as well as surgical margins
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - To assess the impact of re-biopsy on partially sampled melanoma in situ (MIS), atypical melanocytic proliferation (AMP) and thin invasive melanoma. Materials & methods: We retrospectively identified cases of re-biopsied partially sampled neoplasms initially diagnosed as melanoma in situ, AMP or thin melanoma (Breslow depth <= 0.75 mm). Results & conclusion: Re-biopsy led to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in 18.3% of cases. No patients upstaged from AMP or MIS had a positive SLNB. One out of nine (11.1%) initially diagnosed as a thinmelanoma <= 0.75 mm, upstagedwith a re-biopsy, had a positive SLNB. After re-biopsy 8.5% underwent an increased surgical margin. Selective re-biopsy of partially sampled melanoma with gross residual disease can increase the accuracy of microstaging and optimize treatment regarding surgical margins and SLNB.

TI  - NDVI indicated inter-seasonal non-uniform time-lag responses of terrestrial vegetation growth to daily maximum and minimum temperature
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warning exhibits asymmetric patterns over a diel cycle, with the trend of daily minimum temperature (Tmin) exceeds that of daily maximum temperature (Tmax), which is expected to significantly affect terrestrial vegetation growth. To date, many studies have documented the instantaneously asymmetric impacts of Tmax and/ or Tmin on terrestrial ecosystems, but little is known about the non-uniform time-lag effects of Tmax and/or Tmin on vegetation growth. Using monthly datasets of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the proxy for vegetation vigor and the accumulated Tmax and Tmin on representatives of asymmetric warming, we quantitatively investigated the inter-seasonal non-uniform time-lag effects of Tmax and/or Tmin on terrestrial vegetation growth from 1982 to 2014 by applying partial correlation and time-lag analyses. Our results indicate that both Tmax and Tmin have significant time-lag effects on vegetation growth that exhibit spatial heterogeneities; the same vegetation type exhibits distinguished asymmetric responses to Tmax vs. Tmin; and different vegetation types respond to Tmax and/or Tmin with diverse time-lag effects; the overall average lagged times of Tmax and Tmin on vegetation growth were 1.68 +/- 1.05 months and 1.45 +/- 0.96 months, respectively; terrestrial vegetation growth correlates with Tmax reversely against Tmin over most regions and vegetation types. This study provided new insights into the non-uniform responses of vegetation to asymmetric warming. Moreover, our findings highlight the urgency of the currently used climate-vegetation models to consider the non-uniform time-lag effects found in this study so as to improve their performances in future investigation of vegetation-climate interactions.

TI  - Benthic Habitat Mapping Model and Cross Validation Using Machine-Learning Classification Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was aimed at developing the mapping model of benthic habitat mapping using machine-learning classification algorithms and tested the applicability of the model in different areas. We integrated in situ benthic habitat data and image processing of WorldView-2 (WV2) image to parameterise the machine-learning algorithm, namely: Random Forest (RF), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification inputs are sunglint-free bands, water column corrected bands, Principle Component (PC) bands, bathymetry, and the slope of underwater topography. Kemujan Island was used in developing the model, while Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar, and Menjangan Kecil Islands served as test areas. The results obtained indicated that RF was more accurate than any other classification algorithm based on the statistics and benthic habitats spatial distribution. The maximum accuracy of RF was 94.17% (4 classes) and 88.54% (14 classes). The accuracies from RF, CTA, and SVM were consistent across different input bands for each classification scheme. The application of RF model in the classification of benthic habitat in other areas revealed that it is recommended to make use of the more general classification scheme in order to avoid several issues regarding benthic habitat variations. The result also established the possibility of mapping a benthic habitat without the use of training areas.

TI  - Distinct Characteristics of SST Variabilities in the Sulawesi Sea and the Northern Part of the Maluku Sea During the Southeast Monsoon
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sulawesi Sea and the northern part of theMaluku Sea belong to the western equatorial Pacific that is influenced by the Mindanao Current. During the southeast (SE) monsoon, contrasting sea surface temperature (SST) distributions occur between these two seas. The purpose of this research is to investigate the mechanisms of contrasting SST distribution in the Sulawesi Sea and the northern part of the Maluku Sea under the condition of strong southerly wind during the SE monsoon season. Our analysis was based on satellite observations. Warmer (colder) SSTs are identified in the Sulawesi Sea (northern part of the Maluku Sea), which correspond to the weaker (stronger) southerly wind speed. Strong southerly winds in the northern part of the Maluku Sea generate eastwardEkmanmass transport (EMT) that carries thewater mass away from the coast, inducing upwelling. In contrast, the southerly winds fromtheMaluku Sea are blocked by theGorontalo andNorth Sulawesi Mountains, creating low-wind areas in the Sulawesi Sea that are located on the lee side of those mountains. Furthermore, the existence of a valley between those mountains acts as a wind gap that channels the southerly wind to the Sulawesi Sea. Since the seaward EMT is weak and the latent heat release is not dominant, SSTs in front of the wind gap are only slightly reduced, possibly through the mechanisms of oceanic mixing.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance of Respiratory Disease in Free-Living Chimpanzees
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Disease surveillance in wildlife is rapidly expanding in scope and methodology, emphasizing the need for formal evaluations of system performance. We examined a syndromic surveillance system for respiratory disease detection in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 2004 to 2012, with respect to data quality, disease trends, and respiratory disease detection. Data quality was assessed by examining community coverage, completeness, and consistency. The data were examined for baseline trends; signs of respiratory disease occurred at a mean frequency of less than 1 case per week, with most weeks containing zero observations of abnormalities. Seasonal and secular (i.e., over a period of years) trends in respiratory disease frequency were not identified. These baselines were used to develop algorithms for outbreak detection using both weekly counts and weekly prevalence thresholds and then compared retrospectively on the detection of 13 respiratory disease clusters from 2005 to 2012. Prospective application of outbreak detection algorithms to real-time syndromic data would be useful in triggering a rapid outbreak response, such as targeted diagnostic sampling, enhanced surveillance, or mitigation.

TI  - Preoperative Sonographic Assessment of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Newly Diagnosed Invasive Breast Cancer
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the sonographic features and fine needle aspiration of ipsilateral metastatic axillary lymph nodes of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer.Methods: This was a retrospective review of the sonographic features of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes of patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers, attending a single radiology centre from January 2014 to December 2016. Among 449 axillae review, 362 axillae of 355 breast cancer patients with available sonographic images and surgical histopathology or positive fine needle aspiration cytology were analysed. Qualitative morphological assessments and quantitative measurements of the axillary lymph nodes were performed.Results: Various dimensions, areas, and ratios of the entire lymph node and its cortex were associated with nodal metastasis (p < 0.001), with the maximal cortical thickness showed superior performance. Using a 4-point grading system, the sonographic morphological features including focal cortical thickening, hilar displacement or replacement, and perinodal infiltration were associated with nodal metastasis (p < 0.001) with sensitivity 65.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 58.2%-71.8%) and specificity 96.9% (95% CI = 92.9%-99.0%). With the surgical histopathological result as the reference standard, the ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology showed moderate sensitivity 74.7% (95% CI = 63.3%-84.0%) and high specificity 100% (95% CI = 923%-400%).Conclusion: Axillary ultrasound helps in preoperative axillary nodal staging of patients with invasive breast cancer. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology offers additional information to the metastatic nodal status with high specificity.

TI  - A Review of Options for Localization of Axillary Lymph Nodes in the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive breast cancer is a common disease, and the most common initial site of metastatic disease are the axillary lymph nodes. As the standard of care shifts towards less invasive surgery in the axilla for patients with invasive breast cancer, techniques have been developed for axillary node localization that allow targeted dissection of specific lymph nodes without requiring full axillary lymph node dissection. Many of these techniques have been adapted from technologies developed for localization of lesions within the breast and include marker clip placement with intraoperative ultrasound, carbon-suspension liquids, localization wires, radioactive seeds, magnetic seeds, radar reflectors, and radiofrequency identification devices.The purpose of this article is to summarize these methods and describe benefits and drawbacks of each method for performing localization of lymph nodes in the axilla.

TI  - The Impact of Peatland Restoration on Local Climate: Restoration of a Cool Humid Island
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) have been directly altering climate, and it has been proposed that such changes could mitigate anthropogenic climate warming brought about by increases in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Changes due to LULUCF alter the Bowen ratio, surface roughness, and albedo and so directly change air temperatures. Previous studies have focused on changes in the area of forestry and have used space-for-time substitutions to assess the impact of LULUCF. This study considered 18 years of daytime land surface temperature over an area of actual land use change in comparison to its surrounding landscape and considered the restoration of a lowland peat bog: satellite land surface temperature data across 49, 1-km(2) grid squares with 20 on peatland and 29 on surrounding agricultural land on mineral soils from 2000 to 2017. The peatland squares were, until 2004, dug for horticultural peat and after 2004 were restored with revegetation of bare soil and restoration of natural water tables. Over the 18 years, the average annual daytime land surface temperature significantly decreased for six grid squares, five of which were on the restored peatland where land surface temperature decreased by 2 K. In 2000, before restoration, the peatland was 0.7 K warmer than the surrounding agricultural land on mineral soils but by 2016 was 0.5 K cooler. This study has shown that anthropogenic land use change could cool a landscape and that functioning peatlands could act as cool, humid islands within a landscape.

TI  - The use of remotely sensed environmental parameters for spatial and temporal schistosomiasis prediction across climate zones in Ghana
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Schistosomiasis control in sub-Saharan Africa is enacted primarily through preventive chemotherapy. Predictive models can play an important role in filling knowledge gaps in the distribution of the disease and help guide theallocation of limited resources. Previous modeling approaches have used localized cross-sectional survey data and environmental data typically collected at a discrete point in time. In this analysis, 8years (2008-2015) of monthly schistosomiasis cases reported into Ghana's national surveillance system were used to assess temporal and spatial relationships between disease rates and three remotely sensed environmental variables: land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and accumulated precipitation (AP). Furthermore, the analysis was stratified by three major and nine minor climate zones, defined using a new climate classification method. Results showed a downward trend in reported disease rates (similar to 1% per month) for all climate zones. Seasonality was present in the north with two peaks (March and September), and in the middle of the country with a single peak (July). Lowest disease rates were observed in December/January across climate zones. Seasonal patterns in the environmental variables and their associations with reported schistosomiasis infection rates varied across climate zones. Precipitation consistently demonstrated a positive association with disease outcome, with a 1-cm increase in rainfall contributing a 0.3-1.6% increase in monthly reported schistosomiasis infection rates. Generally, surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries continues to suffer from data quality issues. However, with systematic improvements, our approach demonstrates a way for health departments to use routine surveillance data in combination with publicly available remote sensing data to analyze disease patterns with wide geographic coverage and varying levels of spatial and temporal aggregation.

TI  - Cloud Data and Computing Services Allow Regional Environmental Assessment: A Case Study of Macquarie-Castlereagh Basin, Australia
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of data at various temporal and spatial scales require terabyte (TB) level storage and computation, both of which are not easy for researchers to access. Cloud data and computing services provide another solution to store, process, share and explore environmental data with low costs, stronger computation capacity and easy access. The purpose of this paper is to examine the benefits and challenges of using freely available satellite data products from Australian Geoscience DataCube and Google Earth Engine (GEE) online data with time series for integrative environmental analysis of the Macquarie-Castlereagh Basin in the last 15 years as a case study. Results revealed that the cloud platform simplifies the procedure of traditional catalog data processing and analysis. The integrated analysis based on the cloud computing and traditional methods represents a great potential as a low-cost, efficient and user-friendly method for global and regional environmental study. The user can save considerable time and cost on data integration. The research shows that there is an excellent promise in performing regional environmental analysis by using a cloud platform. The incoming challenge of the cloud platform is that not all kinds of data are available on the cloud platform. How data are integrated into a single platform while protecting or recognizing the data property, or how one portal can be used to explore data archived on different platforms represent considerable challenges.

TI  - Glacier mass balance over the central Nyaincientanglha Range during recent decades derived from remote-sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain information on changes in glacier mass balance in the central Nyaincientanglha Range, a comprehensive study was carried out based on digital-elevation models derived from the 1968 topographic maps, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM (2000) and TerraSAR-X/ TanDEM-X (2013). Glacier area changes between 1968 and 2016 were derived from topographic maps and Landsat OLI images. This showed the area contained 715 glaciers, with an area of 1713.42 +/- 51.82 km(2), in 2016. Ice cover has been shrinking by 0.68 +/- 0.05% a(-1) since 1968. The glacier area covered by debris accounted for 11.9% of the total and decreased in the SE-NW directions. Using digital elevation model differencing and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, a significant mass loss of 0.46 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1) has been recorded since 1968; mass losses accelerated from 0.42 +/- 0.20 m w.e. a(-1) to 0.60 +/- 0.20 m w.e. a(-1) between 1968-2000 and 2000-2013, with thinning noticeably greater on the debris-covered ice than the clean ice. Surface-elevation changes can be influenced by ice cliffs, as well as debris cover and land- or lake-terminating glaciers. Changes showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity and a substantial correlation with climate warming and decreased precipitation.

TI  - Satellite-Based Assessment of Local Environment Change by Wind Farms in China
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a widely used renewable energy, migrating to wind power can help reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions. However, the construction of wind farms could have certain impacts on the local ecology and meteorology. Based on satellite observations along with the ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology, this study examines the difference of vegetation characteristics, local wind speed, and surface temperature between the wind power regions and adjacent comparison areas in XilinGol. It shows that the construction of wind farms results in significant differences (p = 0.01) of normalized difference vegetation index values in the study areas compared to the adjacent areas in summer. The construction of the wind farms in study area has considerable influence on the change of local vegetation growth and related meteorological variables. It reduces the fraction of grassland, disrupts the wind field when speed are less than 4 m/s, and changes the spatial pattern of temperature during daytime and nighttime. However, the influence decreases with time after the installment of wind turbines. This study suggests that it is necessary to assess the impact of renewable energy construction on ecological environment and local climate, particularly for the short-term period after its installment.

TI  - Change of winter wheat planting area and its impacts on groundwater depletion in the North China Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Plain is one of the most water-stressed areas in China. Irrigation of winter wheat mainly utilizes groundwater resources, which has resulted in severe environmental problems. Accurate estimation of crop water consumption and net irrigation water consumption is crucial to guarantee the management of agricultural water resources. An actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model was proposed, by combining FAO Penman-Monteith method with remote sensing data. The planting area of winter wheat has a significant impact on water consumption; therefore, the planting area was also retrieved. The estimated ET showed good agreement with field-observed ET at four stations. The average relative bias and root mean square error (RMSE) for ET estimation were -2.2% and 25.5 mm, respectively. The results showed the planting area and water consumption of winter wheat had a decreasing trend in the Northern Hebei Plain (N-HBP) and Southern Hebei Plain (S-HBP). Moreover, in these two regions, there was a significant negative correlation between accumulated net irrigation water consumption and groundwater table. The total net irrigation water consumption in the N-HBP and S-HBP accounted for 12.9x10(9) m(3) and 31.9x10(9) m(3) during 2001-2016, respectively. Before and after 2001, the decline rate of groundwater table had a decreasing trend, as did the planting area of winter wheat in the N-HBP and S-HBP. The decrease of winter wheat planting area alleviated the decline of groundwater table in these two regions while the total net irrigation water consumption was both up to 28.5x10(9) m(3) during 2001-2016 in the Northwestern Shandong Plain (NW-SDP) and Northern Henan Plain (N-HNP). In these two regions, there was no significant correlation between accumulated net irrigation water consumption and groundwater table. The Yellow River was able to supply irrigation and the groundwater table had no significant declining trend.

TI  - Vegetation and soil wind erosion dynamics of sandstorm control programs in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To combat soil erosion and desertification, large-scale sandstorm control programs have been put in place since 2000 in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China. Vegetation dynamics as well as soil wind erosion control effects are very important for assessing the ecological success of sandstorm control programs in China. However, no comprehensive evaluation of vegetation dynamics and soil wind erosion control effects in this region has been achieved. In this study, we illustrate the vegetation and soil wind erosion dynamics of sandstorm control programs in the northern Shanxi Province using remote sensing data and soil wind erosion models. There was a significant increase in vegetation cover for 63.59% of the study area from 2001 to 2014 and a significant decrease for 2.00% of the study area. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the largest increase occurred in autumn. Soil wind erosion mass decreased from 20.90 million tons in 2001 to 7.65 million tons in 2014. Compared with 2001, the soil wind erosion moduli were reduced by 43.05%, 36.16%, and 62.66% in 2005, 2010, and 2014, respectively. Spatially, soil wind erosion in most of the study area was alleviated between 2001 and 2014. The relationship between NDVI and soil wind erosion mass showed that the increased vegetation coverage reduced the soil wind erosion mass. In addition, wind was the main driving force behind the soil wind erosion dynamics. The results indicate that the vegetation coverage has increased and soil wind erosion mass has been reduced following the implementation of the sandstorm control programs. However, the ecological effects of the sandstorm control programs may vary over different periods. While the programs appear to be beneficial in the short term, there may be unintended consequences in the long term. Research on the sustainability of the ecological benefits of sandstorm control programs needs to be conducted in the future.

TI  - From multiple cropping index to multiple cropping frequency: Observing cropland use intensity at a finer scale
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate observations on multiple cropping practices are required to better understand the status and potential of cropland use intensity. However, previous studies largely relied on multiple cropping index (MCI), which only measures the average state for an administrative unit. In this study we use various satellite images to observe the multiple cropping frequency (MCF), in order to know how MCF improves the observation of multiple cropping practices as an alternative of MCI, and how temporal and spatial resolution affect the observation of MCF. We apply the NDVI time-series curve to observe cropland phenology, and subsequently to estimate the MCF by counting the number of peaks. Three MCF maps are developed for the experimental region (Jinxian County, Poyang Lake Plain, South China) in the year 2015 based on MODIS, GF (GF-1/WFV) and GF-MODIS fusion, which represent a character of higher temporal resolution, higher spatial resolution, and higher temporal-spatial resolution, respectively. All these maps have detected multiple cropping patterns, including various single-, double-and triple-cropping pixels: 90.38%, 9.54%, and 0.08% from the MODIS map, 70.32%, 29.27%, and 0.41% from the GF map, and 64.85%, 33.62%, and 1.53% from the GF-MODIS map. The confusion matrix containing 161 field samples shows that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are 62.11% and 0.34, 78.88% and 0.65, and 90.06% and 0.84, for the MODIS, GF, and GF-MODIS maps, respectively. Moreover, the statistics show that the county-level MCI is 1.42, while the aggregated MCI for these maps are 1.10, 1.30, and 1.37, respectively. Our study indicates that the GF-MODIS map not only has highest accuracy but also has a closest estimation on MCI. It implies that higher spatial resolution is the first necessity for mapping the MCF in the landscape fragmented region. Higher temporal resolution is also important to distinguish the nuances on MCF induced by crop rotation.

TI  - An Algorithm for Daytime Sea Fog Detection over the Greenland Sea Based on MODIS and CALIOP Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea fog is one of the dangerous weather disasters affecting scientific investigation and maritime transportation on the Arctic Ocean. In this paper, a detection algorithm for daytime sea fog over the Arctic Ocean is proposed taking the Greenland Sea as an example. With the assistance of satellite lidar data from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations)/CALIOP (Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), a large number of sample points of sea fog, low level clouds, mid-high level clouds, the sea surface, ice, and snow were extracted from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. The radiance (reflectance and emissivity) and texture (mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, and correlation) characteristics of each MODIS channel for sea fog and other features were analyzed. Thereafter, a new algorithm for sea fog detection is proposed. The step-by-step algorithm first masks the sea surface, sea ice, and snow using the reflectance of MODIS channels 2 and 7. Then, the sea fog is separated from low and medium-high level clouds using the homogeneity of channel 18. The validation compared with CALIOP data shows encouraging accuracy for sea fog detection with probabilities of detection (POD) similar to 80 %, and probabilities of falsity (POF) similar to 8.5 %.

TI  - Comparison of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau from reanalysis and observations
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface sensible and latent heat fluxes (SH and LE) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been under research since 1950s, especially for recent several years, by mainly using observation, reanalysis, and satellite data. However, the spatiotemporal changes are not consistent among different studies. This paper focuses on the spatiotemporal variation of SH and LE over the TP from 1981 to 2013 using reanalysis data sets (ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA) and observations. Results show that the spatiotemporal changes from the three reanalysis data sets are significantly different and the probable causes are discussed. Averaged for the whole TP, both SH and LE from MERRA are obviously higher than the other two reanalysis data sets. ERA-Interim shows a significant downward trend for SH and JRA-55 shows a significant increase of LE during the 33 years with other data sets having no obvious changes. By comparing the heat fluxes and some climate factors from the reanalysis with observations, it is found that the differences of heat fluxes among the three reanalysis data sets are closely related to their differences in meteorological conditions as well as the different parameterizations for surface transfer coefficients. In general, the heat fluxes from the three reanalysis have a better representation in the western TP than that in the eastern TP under inter-annual scale. While in terms of monthly variation, ERA-Interim may have better applicability in the eastern TP with dense vegetation conditions, while SH of JRA-55 and LE of MERRA are probably more representative for the middle and western TP with poor vegetation conditions.

TI  - Ascending-Descending Bias Correction of Microwave Radiation Imager on Board FengYun-3C
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave radiation imager (MWRI) is regarded as one of the most important microwave payloads on board China FengYun-3C Meteorological Satellite. The instrument suffers from calibration anomalies and exhibits observation-background (O-B) calibration bias difference between the ascending and descending passes at all channels (hereinafter AD bias). The calibration bias difference of MWRI between ascending and descending orbits hampers data assimilation in the numerical weather predictions and reanalysis systems. This paper proposes a physical-based correction algorithm for MWRI calibration, following a brief introduction to the calibration process of the instrument. The relationship between the observed brightness temperatures and the physical temperature of the hot load reflector is established to mitigate the intrusion of the emissive hot reflector at all channels which was not accurately estimated in the previous calibration process. Before-and after-correction comparisons using one-year observations show that the AD bias is effectively reduced, i.e., from similar to 2 K before correction to less than 0.2 K after correction, when rectifying the emissivity of the hot reflector in the calibration equation, whereas the change in the mean values of MWRI radiance is negligible.

TI  - Temporal and Vertical Variations of Particulate and Dissolved Optical Properties in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two Bio-Argo floats measured the concentration of chlorophyll-a, the backscattering coefficient, the fluorescence of humic-like dissolved organic matter, dissolved oxygen, and temperature and salinity in the northern and central basins of the South China Sea for over 2 years. Temporal evolutions of bio-optical properties were analyzed at surface, subsurface, and in the whole water column, respectively. It was found that (1) The seasonal variability of the surface chlorophyll-a was highly controlled by photoacclimation, especially in the central basin; (2) backscattering in the upper 150 m was nearly constant, exhibiting no distinct seasonality; (3) with vertical mixing, particles from the deep chlorophyll maxima were entrained into the mixed layer resulting in enhanced surface chlorophyll during the early winter. This phenomenon may mislead a study based on satellite data which is likely to interpret it as blooming rather than a redistribution of phytoplankton within the water column; (4) analysis of a winter bloom and an anticyclonic eddy reveal that physical entrainment and biological photoacclimation modulated the vertical distributions of chlorophyll-a and particles and potentially also changes of phytoplankton community composition; and (5) fluorescent dissolved organic matter was found to be highly coupled to phytoplankton dynamics in both basins, with a maximum (after removing the contribution of physical convective mixing) located at the depth of chlorophyll-a subsurface maximum.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on water resources assessment in ungauged or sparse gauged areas, a comparative evaluation of areal precipitation was conducted by remote sensing data, limited gauged data, and a fusion of gauged data and remote sensing data based on machine learning. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to fuse the remote sensing precipitation and ground gauge precipitation. The correlation coefficient, root mean square deviation, relative deviation and consistency principle were used to evaluate the reliability of the remote sensing precipitation. The case study in the Qaidam Basin, northwest of China, shows that the precision of the original remote sensing precipitation product of Tropical Precipitation Measurement Satellite (TRMM)-3B42RT and TRMM-3B43 was 0.61, 72.25 mm, 36.51%, 27% and 0.70, 64.24 mm, 31.63%, 32%, respectively, comparing with gauged precipitation. The precision of corrected TRMM-3B42RT and TRMM-3B43 improved to 0.89, 37.51 mm, -0.08%, 41% and 0.91, 34.22 mm, 0.11%, 42%, respectively, which indicates that the data mining considering elevation, longitude and latitude as the main influencing factors of precipitation is efficient and effective. The evaluation of areal precipitation in the Qaidam Basin shows that the mean annual precipitation is 104.34 mm, 186.01 mm and 174.76 mm based on the gauge data, corrected TRMM-3B42RT and corrected TRMM-3B43. The results show many differences in the areal precipitation based on sparse gauge precipitation data and fusion remote sensing data.

TI  - Recovery of forest carbon density and carbon storage in a soil-degraded landscape in southeastern China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptive managements on susceptible forested regions not only benefit forest recovery, but also help to improve the stability of soil-degraded area and carbon (C) sequestration. The gain of afforestation on C sink has not been addressed clearly especially in tropical and subtropical regions that will be critical in an era of global warming. Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical soil-water conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from 20.14Mg C ha(-1) (0.38Tg C) in 1981 to 43.57Mg C ha(-1) (1.98Tg C) in 2015 (p<0.05) and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past 35years. The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics. The ecological-dominated approaches should be put in a high priority for the issue of C sequestration especially in a changing climate.

TI  - A spectral space partition guided ensemble method for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration in inland waters from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research proposes an ensemble method for synergistically combining multiple empirical algorithms to better estimate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. In previous studies, different empirical algorithms have been employed separately and a single algorithm was often identified as the most suitable predictor for Chl-a retrieval. Our ensemble method combines different individual algorithms to form an ensemble predictor that exploits advantages of each individual algorithm to maximize the overall estimation accuracy. We evaluated two ensemble predictors: the optimally weighted ensemble predictor and the spectral space partition guided ensemble predictor. The ensemble method has been successfully applied to a Sentinel-2A multispectral image acquired over Harsha Lake, Ohio in 2016. Based on in situ water reference data and satellite imagery, we constructed two ensemble predictors that consist of three individual empirical algorithms/estimators, including 2BDA (two-band algorithm), 3BDA (three-band algorithm), and NDCI (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index). For the optimally weighted ensemble predictor, the weights for individual algorithms are computed by solving an overdetermined linear system with the pseudoinverse technique. For the spectral space partition guided ensemble predictor, the rules for partitioning spectral space into spectral regions were established as a decision-tree using the CART method. The optimal Chl-a estimate for a pixel is obtained by selectively using the empirical algorithm in the ensemble that has the highest expected accuracy in the spectral region where the pixel is located. Our assessments suggest that the spectral space partition guided ensemble method performs significantly better than three individual empirical algorithms and also better than the optimally weighted ensemble method.

TI  - New Regression Method to Merge Different MODIS Aerosol Products Based on NDVI Datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate resolution and imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 operational aerosol products that are based on the dark target (DT) method over vegetated regions and the enhanced deep blue (DB) algorithms over bright pixels provide daily global aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, increasing the data coverage by merging the DT and DB merged AOD product has recently become the focus of research. Therefore, this study aims to improve the merged AOD performance by introducing a new regression method (DTBRG), depending on the normalized difference vegetation index values when DT and DB AOD are valid. The DTBRG AOD is validated on a global scale while using aerosol robot network AOD measurements. Merged AOD550s from the MODIS official method and Bilal's customized methods are evaluated for the same period for comparison. The inter-comparison of merged AOD550s from different methods with an equal number of coincident observations demonstrates that the DTBRG method performs better than the MODIS official algorithm with increased expected error (83% versus 76%), R (0.92 versus 0.90), and decreased bias (-0.001 versus 0.012). Therefore, it can be operationally used for global merged aerosol retrievals.

TI  - Socio-ecological dimensions of Andean pastoral landscape change: bridging traditional ecological knowledge and satellite image analysis in Sajama National Park, Bolivia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Andes, indigenous pastoral communities are confronting new challenges in managing mountain peatland pastures, locally called bofedales. Assessing land cover change using satellite images, vegetation survey, and local knowledge (i.e., traditional ecological knowledge) reveals the multi-faceted socio-ecological dimensions of bofedal change in Sajama National Park (PNS), Bolivia. Here, we present results from focus groups held in 2016 and 2017 to learn about the local knowledge of bofedales in five Aymara communities in PNS. Land cover maps, created from Landsat satellite imagery, provided a baseline reference of the decadal change of bofedales (1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016) and were field verified with vegetation sampling. At the park level, the land cover maps show a reduction of healthy bofedales (i.e., Juncaceae dominated peatland) cover from 33.8km(2) in 1986 to 21.7km(2) in 2016, and an increase in dry mixed grasses (e.g., Poaceae dominated land cover) from 5.1km(2) (1986) to 20.3km(2) (2016). Locals identify climate change, lack of irrigation, difficulty in water access, and loss of communal water management practices as key bofedal management challenges. Local improvement of bofedales was found in one community due to community-based irrigation efforts. Bridging knowledge of mountain land cover change helps to articulate the socio-ecological dimensions that influence local decision-making regarding bofedal management, and consideration of local actions that may be strengthened to support the sustainability of bofedales for local livelihoods in the context of climate change in the Andes.

TI  - Long-term outcome following sentinel node navigation surgery for cT1 gastric cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) has become a standard procedure for early-stage melanoma and breast cancer. However, very few studies have evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes following SNNS for gastric cancer. The present study analyzed 51 patients with cT1 gastric cancer who underwent SNNS at our hospital. Sentinel nodes (SNs) were identified using the dual tracer method. Patients underwent limited gastrectomy with SN station dissection when the SNs were reported as pathologically negative during surgery. When SNs were pathologically positive, standard gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed. Out of the 51 cases, 42 cases (82%) were pathologically diagnosed as SN-negative using a frozen section. The surgical procedures included segmental gastrectomy (n=33) and local resection (n=9). A total of 9 patients (18%) had lymph node metastasis in SNs. The mean observation period was 3,125 +/- 167 days, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 98%. There was no recurrence, and body weight loss was minimal following the SNNS. Remnant gastric cancer developed in 4 (8%) of the 50 patients except total gastrectomy. Thus, SNNS was a useful procedure for cT1 gastric cancer from the long-term clinical outcomes, though metachronous gastric cancer should paid further attention to.

TI  - Glacier mapping based on Chinese high-resolution remote sensing GF-1 satellite and topographic data
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise glacier boundary is a fundamental requirement for glacier inventory, the assessment of climate change and water management in remote mountain areas. However, some glaciers in mountain areas are covered by debris. The high spatial resolution images bring opportunities in mapping debris-covered glaciers. To discuss the capability of Chinese GaoFen-1 satellite lacking the short wave infrared band and thermal infrared band in mapping glaciers, this study distinguished supraglacial terrain from surrounding debris by combining GaoFen-1 (GF-1) wide-field-view (WFV) images, the ratio of the thermal infrared imagery and morphometric parameters (DEM and slope) with 30 m resolution. The overall accuracy of 90.94% indicated that this method was effective for mapping supraglacial terrain in mountain areas. Comparing this result with the combination of GF-1 WFV and low-resolution morphometric parameters shows that a high-quality DEM and the thermal infrared band enhanced the accuracy of glacier mapping especially debris-covered ice in steep terrain. The user's and producer's accuracies of glacier area were also improved from 89.67% and 85.95% to 92.83% and 90.34%, respectively. GF data is recommended for mapping heavily debris-covered glaciers and will be combined with SAR data for future studies.

TI  - NDVI spatiotemporal variation in Yulin after grain for green project
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the start of returning cropland to forest and grassland project, vegetation in the Loess Plateau has grown rapidly. To clarify the vegetation variation and change trends in this region, trend analysis, standard deviation analysis, and Hurst index were applied to analyze the MODIS 250 m resolution NDVI in Yulin from 2000 to 2017. The NDVI was increased by 88.56% from 2000 to 2017, with an annual rate of 4.92%. The NDVI of cultivated land, woodland, grassland and unused land were all obviously increased. The NDVI in different elevations and slope ranges also increased significantly. NDVI was positively correlated with rainfall but not with temperature. Increased grain yield, the total number of domestic animals, and the total area of returning cropland to forest and grassland had a significant correlation with NDVI, suggesting that after the transformation and upgrading of agricultural production, ecological environment governance and rural economy had achieved coordinated development. According to the forecast results of Hurst index, the returning cropland to forest and grassland project in this area was close to its carrying potential, but NDVI index had about 10% growth potential. In the extreme drought years of future, vegetation would experience the threat of drought-induced death and the risk of NDVI index reduction, mainly concentrated in the hilly and gully areas with better NDVI recovery. In the period of after returning cropland to forest and grassland, it is an important task to coordinate the rational allocation of soil and water resources for realizing ecological construction in this area.

TI  - Utilizing Satellite Surface Soil Moisture Data in Calibrating a Distributed Hydrological Model Applied in Humid Regions Through a Multi-Objective Bayesian Hierarchical Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional calibration objective of hydrological models is to optimize streamflow simulations. To identify the value of satellite soil moisture data in calibrating hydrological models, a new objective of optimizing soil moisture simulations has been added to bring in satellite data. However, it leads to problems: (i) how to consider the trade-off between various objectives; (ii) how to consider the uncertainty these satellite data bring in. Among existing methods, the multi-objective Bayesian calibration framework has the potential to solve both problems but is more suitable for lumped models since it can only deal with constant variances (in time and space) of model residuals. In this study, to investigate the utilization of a soil moisture product from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in calibrating a distributed hydrological model, the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) -based Distributed Rainfall-Runoff Model (DDRM), a multi-objective Bayesian hierarchical framework is employed in two humid catchments of southwestern China. This hierarchical framework is superior to the non-hierarchical framework when applied to distributed models since it considers the spatial and temporal residual heteroscedasticity of distributed model simulations. Taking the streamflow-based single objective calibration as the benchmark, results of adding satellite soil moisture data in calibration show that (i) there is less uncertainty in streamflow simulations and better performance of soil moisture simulations either in time and space; (ii) streamflow simulations are largely affected, while soil moisture simulations are slightly affected by weights of objectives. Overall, the introduction of satellite soil moisture data in addition to observed streamflow in calibration and putting more weights on the streamflow calibration objective lead to better hydrological performance. The multi-objective Bayesian hierarchical framework implemented here successfully provides insights into the value of satellite soil moisture data in distributed model calibration.

TI  - In-season biomass estimation of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) using fully polarimetric SAR imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of crop biophysical and biochemical parameters during crop growing seasons is essential for improving site-specific management and yield estimation. The potential ability of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in estimating above-ground biomass of oilseed rape was investigated in this study. The temporal profile of different scattering intensity and polarimetric features during the entire growing season was identified with ground measurements. A polarimetric feature, relying on the polarimetric decomposition method, was put forward to estimate the biomass of oilseed rape. Validation results revealed great potential with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.85, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 41.6g/m(2), and relative error (RE) of 28.5% for dry biomass, and an R-2 of 0.76, RMSE of 527.4g/m(2) and RE of 28.6% for fresh biomass. Moreover, the use of full polarization SAR data was compared with single and dual polarization SAR data. The results suggest that when full polarization SAR data is available, a simpler model, higher saturation point and better accuracy can be achieved in biomass estimation of oilseed rape, which highlights the importance and value of polarimetry information in quantitative crop monitoring. This study provides guidelines for in-season monitoring of crop growth parameters with SAR data, which further improves crop monitoring capability in adverse weather conditions.

TI  - Probability Index of Low Stratus and Fog at Dawn using Dual Geostationary Satellite Observations from COMS and FY-2D near the Korean Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a new remote sensing method for detecting low stratus and fog (LSF) at dawn in terms of probability index (PI) of LSF from simultaneous stereo observations of two geostationary-orbit satellites; the Korean Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS; 128.2 degrees E); and the Chinese FengYun satellite (FY-2D; 86.5 degrees E). The algorithm was validated near the Korean Peninsula between the months of April and August from April 2012 to June 2015, by using surface observations at 45 meteorological stations in South Korea. The optical features of LSF were estimated by using satellite retrievals and simulated data from the radiative transfer model. The PI was calculated using the combination of three satellite-observed variables: 1) the reflectance at 0.67 m (R-0.67) from COMS, and 2) the FY-2D R-0.67 minus the COMS R-0.67 (oR(0.67)) and 3) the FY-2D-COMS difference in the brightness temperature difference between 3.7 and 11.0 m (BTD3.7-11). The three variables, adopted from the top three probability of detection (POD) scores for their fog detection thresholds: oR(0.67) (0.82) > BTD3.7-11 (0.73) > R-0.67 (0.70) > BTD3.7-11 (0.51). The LSF PI for this algorithm was significantly better in the two case studies compared to that using COMS only (i.e., R-0.67 or BTD3.7-11), so that this improvement was due to oR(0.67) and BTD3.7-11. Overall, PI in the LSF spatial distribution has the merits of a high detection rate, a specific probability display, and a low rate of seasonality and variability in detection accuracy. Therefore, PI would be useful for monitoring LSF in near-real-time, and to further its forecast ability, using next-generation satellites.

TI  - Supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap mapped using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial rivers set efficacy and time lags by which surface meltwater is routed to the englacial, subglacial, and proglacial portions of ice masses. However, these hydrologic features remain poorly studied mainly because they are too narrow (typically < 30 m) to be reliably delineated in conventional moderate-resolution satellite images (e.g., 30 m Landsat-8 imagery). This study demonstrates the utility of 10 m Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument images to map supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap, covering a total area of similar to 10,000 km(2). Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 both capture overall supraglacial drainage patterns, but Sentinel-2 images are superior to Landsat-8 images for delineating narrow and continuous supraglacial rivers. Sentinel-2 mapping across the three study areas reveals a variety of supraglacial drainage patterns. In northwest Greenland near Inglefield Land, subparallel supraglacial rivers up to 55 km long drain meltwater directly off the ice sheet onto the proglacial zone. On the Devon and the Barnes ice caps, shorter supraglacial rivers (up to 15-30 km long) are commonly interrupted by moulins, which drain intemally drained catchments on the ice surface to subglacial systems. We conclude that Sentinel-2 offers strong potential for investigating supraglacial meltwater drainage patterns and improving our understanding of the hydrological conditions of ice masses globally.

TI  - Analysis of Forest Deforestation and its Driving Factors in Myanmar from 1988 to 2017
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Myanmar, abundant in natural resources, is one of the countries with high forest cover in Southeast Asia. Along with its rapid socio-economic development, however, the construction of large-scale infrastructure, expansion of agricultural land, and an increasing demand for timber products have posed serious threats to the forests and significantly affected regional sustainable development. However, the geographical environment in Myanmar is complex, resulting in the lack of long-term sequence of land cover data products. Based on 30 years' Landsat satellite remote sensing imagery data and the land cover data extracted by a mixed classification method, this paper examined the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of forest cover in Myanmar and investigated driving factors of the spatio-temporal evolution. Results show that the forest cover has decreased by 110,621 km(2) in the past 30 years with the annual deforestation rate of 0.87%. Cropland expansion is the main reason for the deforestation throughout the study period. The study can provide basic information of the forest cover data to the Myanmar government for ecological environment protection. At the same time, it can provide important support to the Belt and Road initiative to invest in the region's economy.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture content using laboratory spectral data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture is important for agriculture and forestry and plays an essential role in land surface processes as well as providing feedback among the earth's surface ecosystems. Large-scale regional soil moisture spatial data can be obtained with a reliable and operational approach using remote sensing. In this paper, we provide an operational framework for retrieving soil moisture using laboratory spectral data. The inverted Gaussian function was used to fit soil spectral data, and its feature parameters, including absorption depth (AD) and absorption area (AA), were selected as variables for a soil moisture estimate model. There was a significant correlative relationship between soil moisture and AD, as well as AA near 1400 and 1900nm. A one-variable linear regression model was established to estimate soil moisture. The model was evaluated using the determination coefficients (R-2), root mean square error and average precision. Four models were established and evaluated in this study. The determination coefficients of the four models ranged from 0.794 to 0.845. The average accuracy for soil moisture estimates ranged from 90 to 92%. The results prove that it is feasible to estimate soil moisture using remote sensing technology.

TI  - FusionCNN: a remote sensing image fusion algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing image fusion field, traditional algorithms based on the human-made fusion rules are severely sensitive to the source images. In this paper, we proposed an image fusion algorithm using convolutional neural networks (FusionCNN). The fusion model implicitly represents a fusion rule whose inputs are a pair of source images and the output is a fused image with end-to-end property. As no datasets can be used to train FusionCNN in remote sensing field, we constructed a new dataset from a natural image set to approximate MS and Pan images. In order to obtain higher fusion quality, low frequency information of MS is used to enhance the Pan image in the pre-processing step. The method proposed in this paper overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fusion methods in which the fusion rules are artificially formulated, because it learns an adaptive strong robust fusion function through a large amount of training data. In this paper, Landsat and Quickbird satellite data are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion algorithm is superior to the comparative algorithms in terms of both subjective and objective evaluation.

AB  - Natural disasters not only cause harm to humans, but also cause changes in the shape of the earth surface. A sudden earthquake occurred in Pohang City with a moment magnitude of 5.4 and caused a serious aftermath to human and property and, furthermore, the geological characteristics of Pohang City worsen the damage from earthquake itself. The present study makes an attempt to analyze the ground displacement as the effects of the earthquake by applying PS-InSAR technique in Sentinel-1A images. The advantage of PS-InSAR in terms of time-series analysis makes it easy to generate the trend of land displacement from the Pohang City. The result in this study indicates that the earthquake has caused the displacement in coastal area of Pohang City.

TI  - Breast Edema Following Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiotherapy: Patient-Reported Prevalence, Determinants, and Effect on Health-Related Quality of Life
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The association between lymphedema of the arm and impaired health-related QoL (HR-QoL) has led to changes in clinical practice. However, data on lymphedema of the breast (ie, breast edema) are lacking. We prospectively evaluated patient-reported prevalence and determinants of breast edema and its effect on patient-reported HR-QoL and breast pain.Methods: We prospectively included 836 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy between October 2013 and October 2016 (UMBRELLA cohort). Patient-reported breast edema, HR-QoL, and breast pain were assessed by means of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer- C30/BR23 before starting radiotherapy and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter. We assessed which patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were associated with breast edema. With mixed-effects models, we assessed the impact of breast edema on patient- reported HR-QoL domains and breast pain over time, adjusting for confounders.Results: Within a median follow-up of 28 months (interquartile range [IQR] = 15), 207 (24.8%) patients reported breast edema at some point in time. Prevalence of breast edema was highest at 6 months (12.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.0 to 14.7). Larger tumor size, oncoplastic surgery, axillary lymph node dissection, locoregional radiotherapy, radiotherapy boost on the tumor bed, and adjuvant chemotherapy were associated with breast edema. Breast edema was independently associated with more breast pain and with poorer QoL, physical functioning, and body image.Conclusions: Breast edema occurs frequently within the first year after breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy and is independently associated with impaired HR-QoL and more breast pain. This information is important for use in clinical practice and should be discussed with patients during shared decision making.

M3  - Article
AB  - THE AIM of this work was to investigate land capability and soil suitability of Wadi El Heriga, north western coast zone (NWCZ) of Egypt using the Microcomputer Land Elevation information system (MicroLEIS).To achieve this objective,a digital elevation model (DEM) and Landsat 8 image were usedto extract the landform units of the investigated area. Eighteen soil profiles were dug to represent different landforms.Soil samples were collected and prepared for laboratory analysis. The correlation between landforms and soil data was carried out and then the soil map was compiled using Arc-GIS 10.3. Results showed that the investigated area include five landforms, i. e.,peneplain, foot slope, back slope, tablelandand undulating. The main sub great groups of the investigated soils are TypicHaplocalcids, TypicTorripasanunents and TypicTorriorthents with the TypicTorripasammentswas the most common one. The investigated soils were categorized into three capability classes; (S2) good (50%), (S3) moderate (45.5%) and (N) marginal (4.5%).Rustles of soil suitability showed that about 20% of the studied area is suitable (S2) for fruit crops (olive, peach and citrus). About 25% of the area is suitable (S2) for watermelon, alfalfa, sugar beet, sunflower, cotton and soybean. Nearly, 49, 37 and 44% of the area is moderately suitable (S3) for wheat, maize and potato, respectively. The most limiting factors for crop cultivation are texture, soil depth, drainage and excess of CaCO3 content.

TI  - Drought Assessment using GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Deficit in Mongolia from 2002 to 2017
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming can result in increases in the frequency and magnitude of drought events, leading to water shortages and socioeconomic losses. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data have been used to monitor and estimate drought events. However, there is little information on detecting the characteristics of droughts in Mongolia due to sparse observations. In this study, we estimate the drought conditions in Mongolia using GRACE terrestrial water storage data during 2002-2017. Water storage deficit (WSD) is used to identify the drought event and calculate the water storage deficit index (WSDI). The WSDI was compared with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The results showed that there were two turning points of WSD in 2007 and 2012. Eight drought events were identified and the most severe drought occurred in 2007-2009 lasting for 38 months with a WSDI of -0.98 and a total WSD of -290.8 mm. Overall, the WSD and WSDI were effective in analyzing and assessing the drought severity in a region where hydrological observations are lacking.

TI  - Forest Leaf Area Index Inversion Based on Landsat OLI Data in the Shangri-La City
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important index that reflects the growth status of forest vegetation and land surface processes. It is of important practical significance to quantitatively and accurately estimate Leaf Area Index. We used the Landsat-8 operational land imager single-band images, and 15 vegetation indices that were extracted from the multi-band were combined with the LAI data measured from the CI-110 canopy digital imager to establish the LAI estimation model. Through the leave-one-out cross-validation method, the accuracy of various model estimation results was verified and compared, and the optimal estimation model was obtained to generate the LAI distribution map of Shangri-La City. The results show that: (1) the multivariable model method is better than the single-variable model method when estimating LAI, and its determination coefficient is the highest (R-2=0.7903). (2) The full-sample dataset is divided into Alpine Pine forest, Oak forest, Spruce-fir forest, and Yunnan Pine forest for analysis. The coefficient of determination of the model simulation is improved to varying degrees, and the highest R-2 increased by 0.1652, 0.1040, 0.1264, and 0.0079, respectively, over the full-sample. The corresponding best models are LAI-DVI (Difference Vegetation Index), LAI-NNIR (normalized near-infrared), LAI-NMDI (Normalized Multi-band Drought Index), and LAI-RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index). (3) The LAI values in Shangri-La City ranged from 0.9654 to 5.5145 and are mainly concentrated in high vegetation coverage areas; and the higher the vegetation coverage level, the higher the LAI value.

TI  - Microphysical Properties of Convective Clouds in Summer over the Tibetan Plateau from SNPP/VIIRS Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role in formation and development of the East Asian atmospheric circulation, climate variability, and disastrous weathers in China. Among the many topics on TP meteorology, it is critical to understand the microphysical characteristics of clouds over the TP; however, observations of the cloud micro-physics in this area are insufficient mainly due to sparse stations and limited cloud physical data. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite, has an improved imaging spectroradiometer with 17 channels of 750-m moderate resolution and 5 channels of 375-m image resolution. The high-resolution instrument has an advantage for observing the small or initial convective clouds. Based on the methodologies that we proposed before for retrieving cloud microphysical properties from SNPP, an automated mapping software package named Automatic Mapping of Convective Clouds (AMCC) has been developed at the scale of satellite swath. The properties of convective clouds are retrieved by AMCC and their values are averaged over 0.33 degrees x 0.33 degrees grids based on the SNPP/VIIRS satellite data over the TP during the summers of 2013-17. The results show that: (1) the temperature of lifting condensation level (T-LCL) at Naqu meteorological station and the cloud base temperature (T-b) retrieved from VIIRS are linearly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 and standard deviation (STD) of 3.0 degrees C; (2) convective clouds over the TP have the following macro- and micro-physical properties. First, the cloud base temperature (T-b) is about -5 degrees C, the cloud base height above the ground (H-b) ranges between 1800 and 2200 m, and the cloud water content is low. Second, the cloud condensation nuclei concentration (N-CCN) is between 200 and 400 mg(-1) with 0.7% in maximum supersaturation (S-max); consequently, the condensation growth of water cloud droplet with less N-CCN and higher S-max is fast. Third, because the precipitation initiation depth (D-14) varies within 1500-2000 m and 500-1000 m at the Yarlung Zangbo River basin and southern Tibet, respectively, the clouds over these areas are more prone to precipitation. Fourth, mean height of the cloud top above sea level (H-top) is between 10 and 13 km, but the cloud depth (D-cld) is rather small, which is about 5000 m in southern TP and gradually reduces to 2500 m in northern TP. Fifth, the glaciation temperature (T-g) ranges from -30 degrees C in central and southern TP to -25 degrees C in northern TP, which, combined with the warmer T-g and the T-b less than 0 degrees C, leads to the domination of ice process in the clouds; (3) the macro- and microphysical properties of convective clouds over the TP explain why rainfall there is frequent and lasts over a short time with small amount and large rain drops.

TI  - Sentinel node and breast cancer: A state-of-the-art in 2019
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Since 1994 and Giuliano's description of sentinel lymph node technique, this procedure has considerably improved and is nowadays, one of the essential pillars in the management of breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is effective on regional control, especially on axillary lymph node. Various learned societies recommend that the initial proved GS can be realized before (CNGOF 2010, Saint-Paul de Vence 2013, ESMO 2015, St-Gallen 2015, NCCN 2016) or after (ASCO 2014, ESMO 2015, Saint-Gallen 2015) CNA when the patient is considered like NO. In patients with initial lymph node involvement, GS searching it is not yet recommended. SLN detection before NAC remains an important prognostic factor especially in N+ patients before surgery. The purpose of this article was a reviewing of medical literature regarding possible indications for SLN detection and axillary dissection in patients with NAC according to sentinel lymph node status. The secondary objective was to put forward different perspectives and studies dealing with this subject. The complete pathological response appears to be an important selection criterion for proposing SLN to these patients and avoiding a "useless" AD. It is important to include patients in the trials to make recommendations progress on SLN after NAC and avoid a rate of uninjured AD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Generalization of Parameter Selection of SVM and LS-SVM for Regression
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression is a popular machine learning model that aims to solve nonlinear function approximation problems wherein explicit model equations are difficult to formulate. The performance of an SVM depends largely on the selection of its parameters. Choosing between an SVM that solves an optimization problem with inequality constrains and one that solves the least square of errors (LS-SVM) adds to the complexity. Various methods have been proposed for tuning parameters, but no article puts the SVM and LS-SVM side by side to discuss the issue using a large dataset from the real world, which could be problematic for existing parameter tuning methods. We investigated both the SVM and LS-SVM with an artificial dataset and a dataset of more than 200,000 points used for the reconstruction of the global surface ocean CO2 concentration. The results reveal that: (1) the two models are most sensitive to the parameter of the kernel function, which lies in a narrow range for scaled input data; (2) the optimal values of other parameters do not change much for different datasets; and (3) the LS-SVM performs better than the SVM in general. The LS-SVM is recommended, as it has less parameters to be tuned and yields a smaller bias. Nevertheless, the SVM has advantages of consuming less computer resources and taking less time to train. The results suggest initial parameter guesses for using the models.

TI  - Glacial lake evolution and glacier-lake interactions in the Poiqu River basin, central Himalaya, 1964-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite previous studies, glacier-lake interactions and future lake development in the Poiqu River basin, central Himalaya, are still not well understood. We mapped glacial lakes, glaciers, their frontal positions and ice flow from optical remote sensing data, and calculated glacier surface elevation change from digital terrain models. During 1964-2017, the total glacial-lake area increased by similar to 110%. Glaciers retreated with an average rate of similar to 1.4 km(2) a(-1) between 1975 and 2015. Based on rapid area expansion (>150%), and information from previous studies, eight lakes were considered to be potentially dangerous glacial lakes. Corresponding lake-terminating glaciers showed an overall retreat of 6.0 +/- 1.4 to 26.6 +/- 1.1 m a(-1) and accompanying lake expansion. The regional mean glacier elevation change was -0.39 +/- 0.13 m a(-1) while the glaciers associated with the eight potentially dangerous lakes lowered by -0.71 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) from 1974 to 2017. The mean ice flow speed of these glaciers was similar to 10 m a(-1) from 2013 to 2017; about double the mean for the entire study area. Analysis of these data along with climate observations suggests that ice melting and calving processes play the dominant role in driving lake enlargement. Modelling of future lake development shows where new lakes might emerge and existing lakes could expand with projected glacial recession.

TI  - A Tripole Pattern of Summertime Rainfall and the Teleconnections Linking Northern China to the Indian Subcontinent
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the interactive margin between the East Asian summer monsoon and westerly circulation, summer rainfall in northern China (NC) exhibits high variability. By employing reanalysis data and geostationary satellite data from the Fengyun-2G (FY-2G) satellite and using the linear baroclinic model (LBM) and Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, this study suggests a tripole pattern in summer rainfall over NC and the Indian subcontinent (IS) that is related to the Indian summer monsoon. The distributions of atmospheric circulation indicate three teleconnections: one is from the IS via the Indo-China Peninsula (ICP) and NC, enhancing the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern; another is from the IS via west-central Asia and NC, arousing a Eurasian wave pattern; and the third is an IS-TP-NC pattern via the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Those teleconnections modulate vorticity and atmospheric stability over NC. In addition, along with the circulation distribution related to those teleconnections, two pathways of moisture transport related to the IS rainfall are suggested, except for moisture transport via the Bay of Bengal: one is from the Indo-Pacific to NC due to enhancing cyclones over the Indo-Pacific and a PJ-like pattern; and another is from the IS to NC via the TP within the midtroposphere, which modulates midtroposphere moisture fluxes and atmospheric stability over NC. Both teleconnections and moisture transport result in anomalous rainfall over NC. This study reveals a new mechanism and pathway of the Indian summer monsoon impacting NC rainfall, possibly explaining the reason behind the high variability in NC rainfall.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Model in the Arctic Waters Based on Support Vector Regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric data are essential for navigation and marine engineering. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is an effective supplement to the ship-based echo sounder, especially for bathymetric measurement in the area that is difficult to reach. Accurate SDB in the Arctic waters is more complex by weak light, cloud, mist, floating ice and so on than in middle or lower latitude clean waters. This paper performs SDB based on Support vector regression (SVR) from multi-spectral imagery of Sentinel-2 in shallow water (0-20 m) of Pomorskiy Proliv of Northern Russia, and corrects the estimated water depth with the interpolation of residuals. The results indicate that the highest accuracy of SDB based on SVR is achieved by employing radial basis function on the full feature inputs, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.5 m and the mean relative error of 44.9 %. After the residual interpolation correction, the overall MAE reduces to 2.0 m, and the root mean square errors decrease by at least 0.3 m among different depth ranges. The approach provides technical support for obtaining a wide range and relatively high spatial resolution of bathymetric data in the Arctic region.

TI  - Carbon storage of a subtropical forest ecosystem: a case study of the Jinggang Mountain National Nature Reserve in south-eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon cycle of forest ecosystems plays a key role in regulating CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Research on carbon storage estimation of forest ecosystems has become a major research topic. However, carbon budgets of subtropical forest ecosystems have received little attention. Reports of soil carbon storage and topographic heterogeneity of carbon storage are limited. This study focused on the Jinggang Mountain National Nature Reserve as an example of a mid-subtropical forest and evaluated soil and vegetation carbon storage by field sampling combined with GIS, RS and GPS technology. We classified the forest into nine forest types using ALOS high-resolution remote sensing images. The evergreen broad-leaved forest has the largest area, occupying 26.5% of the total area, followed by coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests and warm temperate coniferous forest, occupying 24.2 and 22.9%, respectively. The vegetation and soil carbon storage of the whole forest ecosystem were 1,692,344 and 5,514,707t, with a carbon density of 7.4 and 24.2kg/m(2), respectively, which suggests that the ecosystem has great carbon storage capacity. The topographic heterogeneity of the carbon storage was also analysed. The largest vegetation storage and soil storage is at 700-800 and 1000-1100m, respectively. The vegetation carbon storage is highest in the southeast, south and southwest.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation in Sea Surface Temperature from Landsat Time Series Data Using Annual Temperature Cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems and the biogeochemical cycle. Multi-temporal remote-sensing observations may be desirable alternatives to traditional in situ sensors for SST measurement. However, the frequently used low-to-moderate-resolution remote sensors usually cannot identify subtle SST variations in coastal areas due to the pixel radiance contamination caused by shoreline influences. For alleviating this problem, the SST of Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) between 1986 and 2017 was estimated by means of Landsat thermal infrared data and the single-channel retrieval algorithm. The retrieved results were validated by field-measured water temperature and bootstrap method. Then, the estimated SST was divided into five-year intervals and calculated the SST climatology for each period. With use of the annual temperature cycle fitting model, the time series data not only demonstrated the spatial-temporal variation of the water temperature of JZB but also effectively compensated for the lack of remote sensing data due to adverse weather in summer. The estimation results showed that the SST of JZB increased gently during the past 30 years, especially in coastal areas. The increase of SST near artificial facilities was evident, indicating the influence of urbanization and industrialization in coastal area. A correlation analysis of SST and meteorological factors revealed that air temperature influenced SST variation, especially in the central bay, whereas wind speed and precipitation had nearly no influence.

TI  - Contrasting the Performance of Eight Satellite-Based GPP Models in Water-Limited and Temperature-Limited Grassland Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Models constitute the primary approaches for predicting terrestrial ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) at regional and global scales. Many satellite-based GPP models have been developed due to the simple algorithms and the low requirements of model inputs. The performances of these models are well documented at the biome level. However, their performances among vegetation subtypes limited by different environmental stresses within a biome remains largely unexplored. Taking grasslands in northern China as an example, we compared the performance of eight satellite-based GPP models, including three light-use efficiency (LUE) models (vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM), modified VPM (MVPM), and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer GPP algorithm (MODIS-GPP)) and five statistical models (temperature and greenness model (TG), greenness and radiation model (GR), vegetation index model (VI), alpine vegetation model (AVM), and photosynthetic capacity model (PCM)), between the water-limited temperate steppe and the temperature-limited alpine meadow based on 16 site-year GPP estimates at four eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. The results showed that all the GPP models performed better in the alpine meadow, particularly in the alpine shrub meadow (R-2 0.84), than in the temperate steppe (R-2 0.68). The performance varied greatly among the models in the temperate steppe, while slight intermodel differences existed in the alpine meadow. Overall, MVPM (of the LUE models) and VI (of the statistical models) were the two best-performing models in the temperate steppe due to their better representation of the effect of water stress on vegetation productivity. Additionally, we found that the relatively worse model performances in the temperate steppe were seriously exaggerated by drought events, which may occur more frequently in the future. This study highlights the varying performances of satellite-based GPP models among vegetation subtypes of a biome in different precipitation years and suggests priorities for improving the water stress variables of these models in future efforts.

TI  - Automated Glacier Extraction Index by Optimization of Red/SWIR and NIR/SWIR Ratio Index for Glacier Mapping Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are recognized as key indicators of climate change on account of their sensitive reaction to minute climate variations. Extracting more accurate glacier boundaries from satellite data has become increasingly popular over the past decade, particularly when glacier outlines are regarded as a basis for change assessment. Automated multispectral glacier mapping methods based on Landsat imagery are more accurate, efficient and repeatable compared with previous glacier classification methods. However, some challenges still exist in regard to shadowed areas, clouds, water, and debris cover. In this study, a new index called the automated glacier extraction index (AGEI) is proposed to reduce water and shadow classification errors and improve the mapping accuracy of debris-free glaciers using Landsat imagery. Four test areas in China were selected and the performances of four commonly used methods: Maximum-likelihood supervised classification (ML), normalized difference snow and ice index (NDSI), single-band ratios Red/SWIR, and NIR/SWIR, were compared with the AGEI. Multiple thresholds identified by inspecting the shadowed glacier areas were tested to determine an optimal threshold. The confusion matrix, sub-pixel analysis, and plot-scale validation were calculated to evaluate the accuracies of glacier maps. The overall accuracies (OAs) created by AGEI were the highest compared to the four existing automatic methods. The sub-pixel analysis revealed that AGEI was the most accurate method for classifying glacier edge mixed pixels. Plot-scale validation indicated AGEI was good at separating challenging features from glaciers and matched the actual distribution of debris-free glaciers most closely. Therefore, the AGEI with an optimal threshold can be used for mapping debris-free glaciers with high accuracy, particularly in areas with shadows and water features.

TI  - Harmonizing Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images for Summer Corn Growth Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of crop growth status using time-series remote sensing image is essential for crop management and yield prediction. The growing season of summer corn in the North China Plain with the period of rain and hot, which makes the acquisition of cloud-free satellite imagery very difficult. Therefore, we focused on developing image datasets with both a high temporal resolution and medium spatial resolution by harmonizing the time-series of MOD09GA Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images and 30-m-resolution GF-1 WFV images using the improved Kalman filter model. The harmonized images, GF-1 images, and Landsat 8 images were then combined and used to monitor the summer corn growth from 5th June to 6th October, 2014, in three counties of Hebei Province, China, in conjunction with meteorological data and MODIS Evapotranspiration Data Set. The prediction residuals (<mml:semantics>PRK</mml:semantics>) in NDVI between the GF-1 observations and the harmonized images was in the range of -0.2 to 0.2 with Gauss distribution. Moreover, the obtained phenological curves manifested distinctive growth features for summer corn at field scales. Changes in NDVI over time were more effectively evaluated and represented corn growth trends, when considered in conjunction with meteorological data and MODIS Evapotranspiration Data Set. We observed that the NDVI of summer corn showed a process of first decreasing and then rising in the early growing stage and discuss how the temperature and moisture of the environment changed with the growth stage. The study demonstrated that the synthesized dataset constructed using this methodology was highly accurate, with high temporal resolution and medium spatial resolution and it was possible to harmonize multi-source remote sensing imagery by the improved Kalman filter for long-term field monitoring.

TI  - Glacier changes from 1975 to 2016 in the Aksu River Basin, Central Tianshan Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed glacier changes in the Aksu River Basin during the period 1975-2016, based on Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI imagery analysis and the Chinese Glacier Inventory (CGI). The results showed that the total number, area, and volume of the studied glaciers in the Aksu River Basin decreased by 202 (7.65%), 965.7 km(2) (25.88%), and 74.85-78.52 km(3) (23.72%-24.3%), respectively. The rate of glacier retreat in the basin was slower in the north, northwest and west, but reached the highest in the east (measuring 0.86% yr(-1)). Furthermore, there were significant regional differences in the distribution and change of glaciers, the Kumalak River Basin had the largest glacier number and area, about 63.15% and 76.47% of the studied basin, and the rate of glacier retreat in the Kumalak River Basin was 0.65% yr(-1), it was higher than the Toxkan River Basin which reached 0.57% yr(-1). We found the shrinkage rate of glacier for different periods in the past 41 years, during 1975-1990 the glaciers showed the greatest retreat, while the rate of glacier area retreat slowed down significantly from 1990 to 2000. In recent 16 years since 2000, the rate of glacier retreat in the Toxkan River Basin was higher compared with 1990-2000. The RGI50-13.04920 glacier of Kumalak River Basin had been in a state of retreat since 1990. Over the past 41 years, the temperature and precipitation in the Aksu River Basin increased obviously, and the warming temperatures were clearly the main reason for glacier retreat in the region, while the increased precipitation in the mountain area may have a direct relation with the retreating rate of glaciers.

TI  - 2D joint inversion of MT, gravity, magnetic and seismic first-arrival wave traveltime with cross-gradient constraints
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately detect complex geological structures in the subsurface and solve the problems in geophysical inversion such as multiple solutions and inconsistency of the single parameter inversion model, the comprehensive geophysical interpretation based on the cross-gradient joint inversion has been widely concerned and applied in recent years. In this paper, we first study the cross-gradient joint inversion algorithm of two geophysical methods. Then, we derive and implement the 2D joint inversion algorithm of multiple cross-gradients constraints of various geophysical methods (magnetotellurics (MT), gravity, magnetic, and seismic first-arrival traveltime). Next, we design models with inconsistent structure and a complex structure, respectively, and carry out simulation calculations focusing on the accuracy and effectiveness of the multiple joint inversion algorithm. Meanwhile, the results of separate inversion and joint inversion of complex model are compared with the cross-gradient value and cross-plots of pairs of different physical properties. Finally, this work applies the mature satellite data multi-spectral comprehensive analysis technology to the joint inversion, and synthesizes the multiple parameter inversion model results through RGB (red-green-blue) mode to obtain the fused RGB composite image. The results show that whether in the physical value or in the spatial geometry, the result of the joint inversion is closer to the real model. Furthermore, we also prove that this joint inversion model has a higher structure similarity and physical correlation by comparing the cross-gradient value and crossplots of pairs of different physical properties. From the obtained RGB composite images, we can analyze the inversion results more intuitively, which permits to accurately classify models of underground models.

TI  - Risk Factors for Perioperative Respiratory Failure following Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis for Micrognathia: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The frequency of respiratory events in the perioperative period, and optimal duration of intubation during early mandibular distraction osteogenesis activation, are poorly understood. This study assesses potential risk factors associated with perioperative respiratory events, particularly the need for reintubation, following mandibular distraction osteogenesis surgery. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for infants (younger than 1 year) undergoing mandibular distraction osteogenesis for tongue-based airway obstruction between November of 2010 and December of 2017. Univariate and multivariate analyses of sentinel events and outcomes were performed. Results: Ninety infants (median age, 35 days) were included (50 percent were syndromic). Twenty-seven subjects (30 percent) experienced a respiratory event requiring intervention before discharge, including 14 subjects who failed initial extubation. Subjects extubated earlier than postoperative day 5 failed extubation more frequently (33%) compared to those extubated later (9%; p = 0.005). Respiratory events occurred more frequently when extubation was attempted at distraction lengths of 5 mm or less (42 percent) compared to greater than 5 mm (21 percent; p = 0.032). Logistic regression modeling showed that syndromic status (OR, 14.8) and secondary airway anomaly (OR, 6.1) were significant predictors for respiratory events, whereas greater length of distraction at the time of extubation was protective (OR, 0.8; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Postoperative intubation of at least 5 days with associated mean distraction of 5 mm appears to be associated with successful extubation trial following mandibular distraction osteogenesis surgery. Patients with congenital syndromes and secondary airway anomalies are more likely to experience perioperative respiratory events. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 143: 1725, 2019.)

CL  - Iasi, ROMANIA
AB  - As one of the largest coastal wetlands in northern China, the ecological function of Caofeidian wetland has gradually degraded due to the influence of climate and surrounding environment. In order to regulate and repair the water area of the wetland, it is necessary to study and analyse the historical changes and influencing factors of the water area of Caofeidian wetland This paper extracts the water area of Caofeidian Wetland in 1984 similar to 2013 from the images collected by Landsat satellites using the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and analyzes the causes of water area variation in the wetland according to the climate data of Caofeidian Meteorological Station and the Tangshan Statistical Yearbook. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the water area of Caofeidian wetland had been fluctuating in 1984 similar to 2013, showing a slow upward trend. (2) Considering the water area variation and the climate data of Caofeidian Meteorological Station, it is concluded that the mean precipitation of Caofeidian Wetland showed a slight decrease while the annual mean temperature exhibited a slow increase. The correlation analysis reveals that the water area variation is not highly correlated with annual precipitation or annual mean temperature. Thus, the natural factors have a slight impact on the water area variation in Caofeidian Wetland. (3) Based on the water area variation and the data in the Tangshan Statistical Yearbook, the author discovered a prominent growth in resident population in Caofeidian District, and a huge increase in the local aquaculture area. The correlation analysis shows that the water area variation in the wetland is highly correlated with the resident population and strongly correlated with aquaculture area. Because Caofeidian wetland is located in the underdeveloped areas of industry and economy, local people have built a large number of breeding ponds in the wetland, so the main influencing factor of the wetland water area is the breeding area, followed by the permanent population.

TI  - Mapping the agricultural land use of the North China Plain in 2002 and 2012
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS NDVI data and Landsat TM/ETM data of 2002 and 2012, this paper extracts the planting area of winter wheatsummer maize, single spring maize, cotton and forest/fruit trees, vegetable and paddy, and made the agricultural land use map of the North China Plain (NCP). Agricultural land use area accounted for 63.32% compared to the total area of the NCP in 2002. And it increased to 65.66% in 2012, which mainly caused by the vegetables and forest/fruit trees increasing. Planting areas of winter wheatsummer maize, cotton, single spring maize, forest/fruit trees, vegetables and paddy were 5031.21x10(3), 865.90x10(3), 1226.10x10(3), 1271.17x10(3), 648.02x10(3), 216.51x10(3) ha in 2012. Rank of changes was: vegetables (+45%) > forest/fruit trees (+27.4%) > paddy (-23.7%) > cotton (-20.4%) > single spring maize (+17.3%) > winter wheatsummer maize (-0.6%). In developed region like Beijing and Tianjin, planting area of crops with high economic benefit (such as fruit trees and vegetables) increased significantly. Government policies for groundwater protection caused obvious decline of winter wheat cultivation in Hebei Province. Cotton planting in Shandong Province decreased more than 200,000 ha during 2002-2012. The data products will be published in the website: http://hydro.sjziam.ac.cn/Default.aspx. To clarify the agricultural land use in the NCP will be very helpful for the regional agricultural water consumption research, which is the serious problem in the NCP.

TI  - The Controlling Factors of Atmospheric Formaldehyde (HCHO) in Amazon as Seen From Satellite
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the relative importance of biogenic emission, biomass burning emission on volatile organic compounds in Amazon, the spatial and temporal correlations between atmospheric column-integrated formaldehyde (HCHO) and fire count, vegetation hydrological states index, surface solar radiation flux, near-surface air temperature are studied using synergized satellite products and reanalysis data. A recently developed microwave-based vegetation index (emissivity difference vegetation index, EDVI) with high temporal resolution is used for the linkages between vegetation and HCHO at daily scale with and without fire contaminations. At large regional scale, EDVI shows highest spatial correlation with HCHO indicating the important controlling effect of biogenic emission. In given subregions with frequent fires, the temporal variations of monthly HCHO show much stronger correlations with fire count. The temporal correlations between monthly HCHO and EDVI are vague and even negative in some subregions. Radiation and temperature show stable positive temporal correlations with HCHO, particularly in areas with few fires. After excluding the samples contaminated by fires, the daily temporal correlation between vegetation (EDVI) and HCHO becomes significant and positive in most areas except the northern rainforest with weak temporal variations of EDVI. We proposed a bilinear model of biogenic-emission-induced HCHO (B-HCHO) using radiation and EDVI as inputs. The bias between modeled long-term mean B-HCHO and satellite observation is less than 20%. And the daily time series of modeled B-HCHO matches observations as well. It is the first time to provide satellite observational evidences of the relative importance of biogenic emission and biomass burning emission on HCHO, the proxy of atmospheric volatile organic compounds concentration.Plain Language Summary Air quality, weather, and climate are deeply affected by aerosol, the small suspending particles in the air. A large part of the aerosol is formed from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be released from vegetation and biomass burning. However, VOCs are hard to measure at large-scale regions. Alternatively, atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO), the oxidation product of VOCs, is measurable with satellite remote sensing techniques. Meanwhile, fires, vegetation states, and solar radiation also can be observed by satellites. In this study over Amazon, the linkages between HCHO and its potential controlling factors are investigated using satellite remote sensing data sets. Spatially, atmospheric HCHO is high over areas with dense vegetation indicating the importance of vegetation emission of VOCs. In areas with frequent fires, fire becomes more important and can blanket the effects from vegetation emission on VOCs. These two effects can be untangled by using combined satellite observations of fire and vegetation at high temporal resolution. Based on the statistics, we proposed a model to estimate the vegetation-emission-induced HCHO using properties of vegetation and solar radiation as inputs. This study helps us to understand the relative importance of vegetation and fire on determining the organic composition of atmosphere.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel ship detection method using cascaded convolutional neural network (CCNet) with multispectral image is proposed to achieve high-speed detection. The CCNet employs two cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNN) for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) , locating and segmenting ship objects sequentially. Benefit from the abundant details of the multispectral image, CCNet can extract more robust feature for achieving more accurate detection. The efficiency of CCNet has been validated by the experiments on the SPOT 6 satellite multispectral images. Compared with the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based ship detection algorithms, the proposed ship detection algorithm accelerates the processing by more than 5 times with a higher detection accuracy.

TI  - Estimating reservoir evaporation losses for the United States: Fusing remote sensing and modeling approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation from open surface water is a critical and continuous process in the water cycle. Globally, evaporation losses from reservoirs are estimated to be greater than the combined consumption from industrial and domestic water uses. However, this large volume of water loss is only coarsely considered in modern water resources management practices due to the complexities involved with quantifying these losses. By fusing remote sensing and modeling approaches, this study developed a novel method to accurately estimate the evaporation losses from 721 reservoirs in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Reservoir surface areas were extracted and enhanced from the Landsat based Global Surface Water Dataset (GSWD) from March 1984 to October 2015. The evaporation rate was modeled using the Penman Equation in which the lake heat storage term was considered. Validation results using in situ observations suggest that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated monthly reservoir evaporation rate. The evaporation losses were subsequently estimated as the product of the surface area and evaporation rate. This paper presents a first of its kind, comprehensively validated, locally practical, and continentally consistent reservoir evaporation dataset. The results suggest that the long term averaged annual evaporation volume from these 721 reservoirs is 33.73 x 10(9) m(3), which is equivalent to 93% of the annual public water supply of the United States (in 2010). An increasing trend of the evaporation rate (0.0076 mm/d/year) and a slightly decreasing trend of the total surface area (-0.011 x 10(9) m(2)/year) were both detected during the study period. As a result, the total evaporation shows an insignificant trend, yet with significant spatial heterogeneity. This new reservoir evaporation dataset can help facilitate more efficient water management practices.

TI  - Analysis on Susceptibility of Vegetation Canopy Spectra in Coal Mining Area to Land Reclamation
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land reclamation and its monitoring in coal mining area is of great significance to land use and ecological environment governance in China. The Microbial Reclamation Technology can promote the plant's absorption and utilization for mineral nutrient and water, and strengthen the soil fertility, having a significant effect on ecological restoration of mining area. The traditional method for monitoring the land reclamation on plant growth is usually collecting plant and soil samples in the field for indoor analysis. But this method not only destroys rhizosphere soil, causing damages to plants, but also consumes large quantity of manpower, material resources, and time. The hyperspectral remote sensing technology has the advantages of fast data acquisition, large information, high precision and nondestructive for plants, having great potential for land reclamation monitoring. At present, the research on the monitoring of land reclamation through remote sensing still stays at the laboratory level of observing the leaf spectra of potted soybean, corn and other crops. In fact, the observation of satellite remote sensing data is the canopy spectra, not the leaf spectra, but now there is no research result on the monitoring of land reclamation in the mining area based on vegetation canopy spectra. The vegetation canopy spectrum is not only affected by the leaf spectrum, but also influenced by other factors such as plant growth condition and underlying surface, and the spectral change is more complicated. Analysis on susceptibility of vegetation canopy spectra in coal mining area to land reclamation is the basis of the quantitative inversion for the physical and chemical parameters of vegetation, and the main bottlenecks of the hyperspectral technology to be applied in large area reclamation monitoring. This research performs field experiment on vegetation canopy spectral observation in the land reclamation basement of coal mining area, obtains the wild plant canopy spectral data of reclamation group and the control group, and comprehensively analyses the spectral susceptibility of vegetation canopy spectra to land reclamation, from the aspects of spectral waveform and spectral feature parameters. In terms of the spectral waveform of canopy, standard deviation and spectral sensitivity are used as effective indicators for the difference of spectral waveform within each group and between two groups. As for the canopy spectral feature parameters, we selected the red edge, yellow edge, blue edge, red valley and green mountain as typical spectral features, calculated their parameters (such as wavelength position, slope and area) and performed descriptive statistical analysis and one-way ANOVA to investigate the canopy spectral feature parameters' sensitivity to the effect of land reclamation. Results showed that the canopy spectral waveform trend of the reclamation group is similar with that of the control group, but the plants in the reclamation group have smaller spectral difference, and their vegetation typical features, such as green peak and red valley, are more prominent. This indicated that land reclamation can reduce the canopy spectral difference between plants and strengthen the typical vegetation spectral features, while green peak and red valley are the most sensible spectral features to land reclamation effect.In terms of the specific canopy spectral feature parameters, the wavelengths of green peak, red valley and red edge tend to shift to longer wavelength significantly under the function of land reclamation, but the slope of red edge and blue edge, which are sensitive to land reclamation changes in previous studies on leaf spectra, are not significant any more in this research. This showed that the analysis results based on vegetation canopy spectra in the field are not in consistent with previous laboratory analysis results of leaf spectra, which may be caused by vegetation types, growth cycle, the interference of soil background, etc. When monitoring the vegetation environment in mining area based on satellite or aerial remote sensing, the data obtained are canopy spectra, not leaf spectra. Therefore, the conclusions of this research have strong reference value for future practical applications.

TI  - Normalization of the temporal effect on the MODIS land surface temperature product using random forest regression
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about land surface temperature (LST) acquired from remote sensing satellite observations is very important to monitor surface energy and water exchange processes at the land-atmosphere interface. However, the wide-view of the popularly used polar-orbiting satellites (Terra and Aqua) face the challenge from the temporal effect on their LST products induced by the big temporal differences along the scan line. To generate a time-consistent LST product, a practical normalization method is proposed in this study based on random forest regression for LST observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on-board Terra satellite. A linking model is constructed to express LST as a function of various surface variables including vegetation indices, leaf area index, surface albedo, water index, solar radiation factor, and surface elevation. Under the assumption that the temporal effect is induced primarily by the differences in incident solar radiation, the temporal effect normalization is conducted by deriving a temporally consistent solar radiation factor which is used to drive the linking model and obtain the normalized LST. The proposed method is applied to the central Iberian Peninsula on the day of year 170 and 181, 2015. Results show that the areas with positive complement in solar radiation factor generally exhibit a positive increase in LST. An obvious improvement can be observed in the spatial pattern of the normalized LST data with the disappearance of the temperature boundary due to the big difference of satellite observation time. The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) LST data which have the observations at the same local solar time is used for quantitative validation. The evaluation shows that the normalized LST data is more coincident with the MSG LST data than the original MODIS LST data, with significant improvements in the root mean squared deviation and bias with the MSG LST data (1.23 K and 1.66 K, respectively). Unlike previous normalization methods, the proposed method is conducted based on only satellite observations without other ancillary data. Therefore, the method demonstrates good potential for normalizing the temporal effect of the wide-view polar-orbiting satellite observations.

T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A fiber-optic coupler with all glass materials is presented in this paper to realize high-precision, ultrastable interferometry. Firstly, we introduce the working principle of interferometry systems and the design of the fiber-optic coupler. Secondly, through theoretical analysis, selection of aspheric lenses is performed based on specific parameters of the lenses, which are investigated using numerical and software analysis. Then, we carry out a tolerance analysis of matching degrees of beam parameters and beam vectors, along with a thermal analysis of the structures. Finally, by combining theoretical analysis with precise adjustment, the manufacturing process of the fiber-optic coupler is finalized. Experimental results indicate that the error of the spot size compared to the result of simulations is about 3.4%. The difference between two beams' spot size is about 0.9%, their center distance is less then 40 mu m and their included angle is about 60 mu rad. This data can satisfy the application requirements of the interferometric system.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and its influencing factors of grassland net primary productivity in Inner Mongolia, China during the period 2000-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of changes in long-term trends in grassland net primary productivity (NPP) and its large-scale driving forces are important for understanding terrestrial ecosystem changes in arid and semi-arid regions. Based on the MODIS-NPP dataset, this study investigated patterns in the spatiotemporal variations in NPP and its possible influencing factors in Inner Mongolia during 2000-2014 using the linear trend analysis method, correlation analysis, and an F test. The results show that grassland NPP had an annual rate of increase of 4.53 g C/(m(2).a) with a significant increasing trend (p < 0.01). Spatial analysis results indicate that the average grassland NPP presented a gradual increasing trend from southwest to northeast, with an area of longitudinal zonality being identified. Grassland NPP presented a significant increase (p < 0.05) in more than 31.93% of the region. Grassland NPP and growing season precipitation (GSP) had a significant negative correlation in 54.78% of the study area. Grassland NPP and the growing season average land surface temperature (GSALST) had a significant negative correlation for 65.93% of the study area; growing season average temperature (GSAT) had no significant effect on the grassland NPP. For different grassland types, GSP had the greatest impact on alpine meadows (r = 0.73), and GSALST had the greatest impact on alpine steppes and alpine meadows (r = - 0.81). Related ecological restoration projects such as fenced rangeland and planted grass played a positive impact on annual NPP in the study area.

TI  - FengYun-3 B Satellite Medium Resolution Spectral Imager Visible On-Board Calibrator Radiometric Output Degradation Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The output of the FengYun-3 B (FY-3B) satellite's medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) visible on-board calibrator (OBC) degrades with time, causing concerns regarding its reliability in radiometric calibration. Special efforts have been made to extract the variation in information of the interior lamps. The specifications include: 1) digital count retrieval from the OBC files and an exponential plus linear fit applied to determine the relative change in the MERSI response; 2) anchoring to cross calibration with MODIS to acquire the absolute radiometric calibration coefficients; 3) a time series calibration tracking method based on the pseudoinvariant target site applied to monitor the degradation of the FY-3B MERSI instrument; and 4) "net" interior lamp radiometric output (ILRO) obtained by subtracting long-term pseudoinvariant tracking results from the scaled visible on-board calibrator-based model gain coefficients. The results show that the decay rates of the ILRO are wavelength dependent and the shortwave outputs are found to experience a large degradation, particularly at 470, 550, 412, 443, 490, 520, and 565 nm. The largest annual degradation rate is greater than 15% in the first year. The implementation of the current procedure combined with a detailed analysis will provide a basis for further determining lamp changes, leading to improved absolute calibration accuracy of MERSI products.

TI  - Chaplin in Yuri Olesha's narrative
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the role of the "Chaplin code" in Yuri Olesha's narrative. Olesha's journal entries, essays, and literary works are analyzed regarding his personal "cinematic poetics." This work suggests that Olesha views the relationships between the languages of cinema and literature as a form of synthesis and, at the same time, as a conflicting communication. His works show visual phantasmata not only as being universal in different forms of art but also as being essentially antithetic to one another.Olesha's journal entries refer to Chaplin's method as a mixture between poetic sentiment and buffoonery. Moreover, Olesha regards Chaplin as a self-referential figure who contaminates the traits of a poet and a trickster and represents a part of a larger personal myth of an artist who (metaphysically) becomes a beggar in the "new world." In Olesha's literary works, the presence of characters who refer to "the Tramp" or share some of his attributes can influence the intrigue (adding the motifs of circus, theatre, and cinema) as well as the structure of the narrative (changing narrative tense and narrative voice). For example, in "Zavisf (Envy)," Kavalerov and Ivan Babichev both share some of "the Tramp's" features (appearance, clothing, stagey behavior, lack of money). In addition, the text sometimes refers to both of them as "comedians."The paper concludes with the claim that the "Chaplin code" plays several metanarrative roles: it indexes the "balagan-type" worldview, serves as a key element of cinematic poetics, and, overall, becomes the essential part of Olesha's ideas regarding the nature of artistic creation.

TI  - Discriminating Urban Forest Types from Sentinel-2A Image Data through Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis: A Case Study of Xuzhou, East China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests are an important component of the urban ecosystem. Urban forest types are a key piece of information required for monitoring the condition of an urban ecosystem. In this study, we propose an urban forest type discrimination method based on linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) and a support vector machine (SVM) in the case study of Xuzhou, east China. From 10-m Sentinel-2A imagery data, three different vegetation endmembers, namely broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, and low vegetation, and their abundances were extracted through LSMA. Using a combination of image spectra, topography, texture, and vegetation abundances, four SVM classification models were performed and compared to investigate the impact of these features on classification accuracy. With a particular interest in the role that vegetation abundances play in classification, we also compared SVM and other classifiers, i.e., random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and quick unbiased efficient statistical tree (QUEST). Results indicate that (1) the LSMA method can derive accurate vegetation abundances from Sentinel-2A image data, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.019; (2) the classification accuracies of the four SVM models were improved after adding topographic features, textural features, and vegetation abundances one after the other; (3) the SVM produced higher classification accuracies than the other three classifiers when identical classification features were used; and (4) vegetation endmember abundances improved classification accuracy regardless of which classifier was used. It is concluded that Sentinel-2A image data has a strong capability to discriminate urban forest types in spectrally heterogeneous urban areas, and that vegetation abundances derived from LSMA can enhance such discrimination.

TI  - Influence of the three Gorges Reservoir on the shrinkage of China's two largest freshwater lakes
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the largest hydropower project in the world, has altered the sediment deposition and erosion regime of downstream-linked rivers and lakes. The extent to which the TGR impoundment has changed the surface areas of the two largest freshwater lakes in China, Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang, remains largely unknown. Here, we compared the surface areas of the two lakes pre and post the TGR impoundment as well as with a modelled non-TGR scenario. We found that the mean surface areas of Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang during the post-TGR period (2003-2016) were significantly smaller than in the pre-TGR period (1956-2002) and in the modelled non-TGR scenario (2003-2016). The impoundment of TGR has led to a shift from a sediment deposition regime to an erosion-dominated regime of the downstream-linked rivers and the two lakes. The impoundment of TGR further changed the seasonal variabilities in discharge and water level in the downstream-linked rivers and the two lakes, especially in the flood season. Our results suggest that TGR resulted in a 5.1%, 16.2%, and 12.2% decrease of the surface area of Lake Dongting in June 2003-September 2006, October 2006-September 2008, and October 2008-December 2016, respectively, and a corresponding decrease of 12.4%, 19.6%, and 15.8% for Lake Poyang. These changes cannot be attributed to variations in rainfall as no significant differences were found in the annual or monthly mean rainfall in the watersheds upstream of Luoshan and Jiujiang + Hukou between the pre-TGR and the post-TGR period. Our results call for the development of a strong holistic management plan for cascading reservoirs, including TGR, to minimize the damage of downstream lake ecosystems.

TI  - Simulation and spatio-temporal pattern of vegetation NPP in northwest China
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The data production of MOD17A3 NPP in northwest China is seriously deficient, with consequences on further research on vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) in this region. Based on the meteorological data, DEM, NDVI, and MOD17A3 NPP with high quality, the BP neural network model was constructed to simulate vegetation NPP and fill the areas without NPP data in northwest China from 2000 to 2014. Its spatio-temporal variations and relationships with meteorological factors were analyzed using unitary linear regression, R/S analysis, and partial correlation analysis. The results showed that: (1) Coefficients of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) between MODIS NPP and simulated NPP were 0.833-0.906, 25.84-40.1, 0.16-0.23, 34.5759.36, respectively, which well met the accuracy requirements. The BP neural network model was suitable for vegetation NPP simulation in northwest China. (2) The annual mean NPP had a strong spatial variation, showing a gradual decline from southeast to northwest and a high-value block area in the northwest of Xinjiang. (3) The annual mean NPP ranged between 106.64 and 156.17 g C . m(-2) . a-I from 2000 to 2014, with a slightly fluctuating downward trend in the interannual variation. (4) From 2000 to 2014, the change of NPP in northwest China had spatial heterogeneity, which was mainly reduced. Only 10.79% of the areas passed the significance test. NPP change was weakly persistent. The future change trend of NPP is mainly uncertain, supplemented by improved and declined areas, with the improved area being larger than the declined area. (5) Responses of vegetation NPP to temperature and precipitation varied spatially, which were generally more closely related to precipitation.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF PARAMETERS OF MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS BASED ON SATELLITE AND UPPER-AIR SOUNDING DATABASE
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using by ground-based and satellite tools, an analysis of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) has been carried out. In the course of the study, we assessed a repeatability for the warm season (April to September) for 2008-2018. Within warm season of 2015-2018, the synoptic situations favorable to formation of MCSs which produced hazardous phenomena has been determined. To estimate of atmospheric stability we applied K-index and Lifted-index. On the basis of MatLab calculation method the linear dimensions of MCSs has been defined. The method used is visual interpretation of clouds to assess the repeatability and parameters of MCSs in the southeastern part of Western Siberia based on RGB composite imagery (0.65; 0.45; 0.35 mu m) using MODIS data. The study area is limited to 50 and 60 degrees N and 70 and 90 degrees E, which includes five administrative units geographically located in the West Siberia: Tomsk Oblast, Novosibirsk Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, The Altai Republic and Altai Krai. The object of study is considered the mesoscale convective system (MCS), in the paper is classified as a complex of Cumulonimbus clouds with a diameter of 50 km and more. It is important to note that the study area is not predisposed to the MCS formation, and even such a small cloud cluster is capable of generating hazardous phenomena such as thunderstorms, hail, severe and prolonged downpours. A specific feature of the MCSs is a long period of existence (about 10 hours), but its effect on weather conditions track up to 24-36 hours. To characterize the atmospheric stability on days with MCSs we used measurements taken by five upper-air stations (Aleksandrovskoe, Barabinsk, Barnaul, Kolpashevo, Novosibirsk) at 0000 and 1200 UTC from 2015 to 2018. The results of upper-air sounding accommodate discrete information about the values of air temperature and humidity and wind characteristics within the entire thickness of the atmosphere, in which convection over Western Siberia may develops, namely up to 10-15 km. As convection parameters, we applied a stability indices that are widely utilize to forecast the thunderstorm/hail/squall development etc. Thus the Lifted-index describes the latent instability of the atmosphere whereas a calculation of K-index based on the vertical temperature lapse rate, and the amount and vertical extent of low-level moisture in the atmosphere.During warm season the total number of days with MCSs equals 230 days for the entire period 2008-2018. The peak frequency of days with MCSs (31) was observed in 2016. This is due to the 2016 anomaly in many meteorological parameters. The minimum number of days with MCSs (12) was registered in 2010. The evaluation of atmospheric stability on the days with MCSs showed the following: the Lifted-index classifies the state of the atmosphere as slightly unstable (53% of all cases) in accordance with the generally accepted classification and only showers are observed throughout the territory. Using the K-index, in 51% of cases the state was assessed as unstable. The MCSs are mainly formed when the atmosphere is moderate and slightly unstable and their evolution accompanied by the presence of showers and isolated thunderstorms across the territory. Comparing the synoptic situations related with MCSs generation, it was found that the share of MCSs formed on the cold front equal a third of all events, and this ratio decreases markedly while activation of strong meridional circulation. The total share of contribution of occlusion processes to the MCSs frequency largely depends on the anomalies and by the end of the study period has the predominant part of the processes associated with the occluded front. Unlike the frontal cases, the processes formed at the stage of development of a cloud vortex, cold air developed system or mesovortex, have been found to be much more dangerous due to less possibility of prediction.

TI  - An improved algorithm for mapping burnt areas in the Mediterranean forest landscape of Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of burnt forests and their monitoring provide essential information for the suitable management and conservation of these ecosystems. This research focuses on the use of remote sensing with MODIS sensor data in a Mediterranean environment, precisely in the Rif region known for its high occurrence of forest fires and the largest burnt areas in Morocco. It mapped the burnt areas during the summer of 2016 using spectral indices from MODIS images, namely the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Burnt Area Index for MODIS (BAIM). Two field surveys were used to calibrate spectral indices and validate the maps. First, a monotemporal analysis using a single pre-fire image determined the appropriate threshold of the spectral indices (BAIM and NBR) for burn detecting. Secondly, a multitemporal method was applied based on dBAIM and dNBR images which represented pre-fire and postfire differences of the BAIM and NBR images, respectively. The results show that separate use of monotemporal postfire and multitemporal methods produced an overestimation of the burnt areas. Finally, we propose a new algorithm combining both methods for burnt area mapping that we name Burnt Area Algorithm. MCD45A1 and MCD64A1 MODIS burnt area products were compared to the proposed algorithm. Validation of the estimated burnt areas using reference data of the Moroccan High Commission for Water, Forests and Fight against Desertification showed satisfactory results using the proposed algorithm, with a determination coefficient of 0.68 and a root mean square error of 44.0ha.

TI  - Uptake of sentinel lymph node procedures in women with vulvar cancer over time in a population based study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate trends in uptake of sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedures over time and associated factors in women with vulvar cancer.Methods. A retrospective population-based cohort study identified women with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva using health administrative data for the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2016. Patients who underwent SLN procedures were compared to those who had groin node dissection (GND). Multivariable analysis was used to identify factors associated with SLN procedures.Results. 1385 patients with SCC of the vulva were identified; 1079 had a surgical procedure. Only those with groin node assessment were included in the study cohort (n = 732, 68%). SLN procedures were done in 52%. When comparing SLN versus GND, the rate of SLNs was significantly different by year of diagnosis (P < 0.001), associated comorbidity (P < 0.001) and institution (P < 0.0001). The rates of SLNs by institution with gynecologic oncologist were variable and ranged from 32% to 79% among 9 centers. There were no differences in age, income quintile, and urban/rural residence.The proportion of SLN procedures increased from 30.1% (CI 18.9-45.6) in 2008 to 65.2% (CI 36.5-107.6) in 2016. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SLN procedures were more recent year of diagnosis (OR 7.9, CI 2.7-23.5) associated comorbidities (OR 2.7, CI 1.5-5.0) and institution (Site 5, OR 19.6 [CI 3.6-108.3] and Site 6, [OR 6, CI 1.1-33.4]).Conclusions. The proportion of SLN procedures in women with vulvar cancer has increased over time, but uptake is not uniform across institutions. Barriers to uptake should be explored. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - POPULATION ABUNDANCE OF Aedes albopictus AND Culex quinquefasciatus IN 24 HOURS CYCLE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS, PENANG USING DIFFERENT TRAPPING METHODS.
T2  - Serangga
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing concern on the current activity of Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes as pest and diseases vector in the residential areas require thorough and immediate evaluation. Therefore, 24 hours trapping was conducted at the urban Sungai Dua and sub-urban Batu Maung residence area, Penang, Malaysia, using two different traps; BG-Sentinel Trap and CDC Fay-Prince Light Trap under two different light conditions to investigate the possibility effect of light to both mosquito species. CDC Fay-Prince light trap was effective in trapping Cx. quinquefasciatus than BG-Sentinel traps. The results indicated that both traps were ineffective to capture Ae. albopictus. In this study, the peak activity of Ae. albopictus was not following the diel host-seeking activity which this species active at daylight (6:00am-8:00am) and during night time (6:00pm-8:00pm). Whereas, Cx. quinquefasctus was captured mostly during the nocturnal time (12:00am-6:00am) with a greater number of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes captured under no light conditions. Meteorological parameter recorded within experiment such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed did not correlate with the abundance of both mosquito species (p> 0.05). However, light intensity parameters significantly affected Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito abundance in both residential areas (p= 0.002), but not the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes (p= 0.086 Sungai Dua; p= 0.803 Batu Maung) as light is not a primary cue attraction factor to any host source towards this species. Ovitraps seem to be better tools for collecting and surveillance population of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes as compared to BG-Sentinel trap (Paired t-test; p= 0.019) and CDC Fay-Prince light trap (Paired t-test; p= 0.025). As a conclusion, BG-Sentinel trap and CDC Fay-Prince light traps is a not suitable tool for monitoring the activities of Ae. albopictus in the residential area, but CDC Fay-Prince light traps still found effective to use to capture Cx. quinquefasciatus. This study has therefore established immature sampling as the most effective method of capturing Ae. albopictus in a residential area.

TI  - THE JEWISH FAITH AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AMONG XXIST CENTURY RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jewish faith and lifestyle requires the individual to address issues that involve many facets of life, including education, religious matters, self scholarship, personal development, and many other issues. The main problem in the 21st century is that modern Jewish society does not subscribe to a homogenous worldview concerning Judaism. There are several different typical sectors within Jewish society. Haredi (Ultra-orthodox) Jews, secular Jews, Modern Orthodox, and traditional (meaning: less observant). The article does not discuss the two extremes: Haredi Jews and secular Jews. The main concern of this article involves Modern Orthodox and traditional Jews and their personal development within the Jewish faith. In many cases, Modern Orthodox and traditional Jews in the 21st century are inclined to increasing strictness and extreme attitudes in all issues related to Judaism, as a result of ignorance and personal lack of development in Jewish religious matters. This stands in complete contrast to the situation in the distant past, i.e., the Mishna and Talmud periods (first to six century AD), when the Jewish establishment encouraged scholarly personal development in all spiritual religious aspects.

TI  - A Landsat-based vegetation trend product of the Tibetan Plateau for the time-period 1990-2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is a unique, biodiverse ecosystem with an important role in the climate and hydrological system of Asia. Its vegetation supports important functions including fodder provision, erosion prevention and water retention. Assessing vegetation trends of the Tibetan Plateau is crucial to understand effects of recent climate and land-use changes. Most existing vegetation trend products covering the entire Tibetan Plateau have a coarse spatial grain and cover short temporal ranges. This hampers their applicability in studies conducted at local scales where land-use decisions take place and at time scales where climate changes become apparent. Here, we present vegetation trend products for the entire Tibetan Plateau at a spatial resolution of 30 m for the time period 1990-2018. These products include results of a modified Mann-Kendall trend test applied to annual Landsat-based NDVI mosaics, composed from all satellite observations acquired during the vegetation periods as well as NDVI difference images. These data can be valuable to many researchers including for example wildlife ecologists, rangeland experts and climate change researchers.

TI  - Multiband Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Ocean Color Retrievals
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) current atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm for ocean color utilizes two bands and their ratio in the near infrared (NIR) to estimate aerosol reflectance and aerosol type. The algorithm then extrapolates the spectral dependence of aerosol reflectance to the visible wavelengths based on modeled spectral dependence of the identified aerosol type. Future advanced ocean color sensors, such as the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) that will be carried on the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite, will be capable of measuring the hyperspectral radiance from 340 to 890 nm at 5-nm spectral resolution and at seven discrete short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels: 940, 1,038, 1,250, 1,378, 1,615, 2,130, and 2,260 nm. To optimally employ this unprecedented instrument capability, we propose an improved AC algorithm that utilizes all atmospheric-window channels in the NIR to SWIR spectral range to reduce the uncertainty in the AC process. A theoretical uncertainty analysis of this, namely, multiband AC (MBAC), indicates that the algorithm can reduce the uncertainty in remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) retrievals of the ocean caused by sensor random noise. Furthermore, in optically complex waters, where the NIR signal is affected by contributions from highly reflective turbid waters, the MBAC algorithm can be adaptively weighted to the strongly absorbing SWIR channels to enable improved ocean color retrievals in coastal waters. We provide here a description of the algorithm and demonstrate the improved performance in ocean color retrievals, relative to the current NASA standard AC algorithm, through comparison with field measurements and assessment of propagated uncertainties in applying the MBAC algorithm to MODIS and simulated PACE OCI data.

TI  - Geodetically estimated location and geometry of the fault plane involved in the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - By applying the InSAR method to ALOS-2 SAR data acquired before and after the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake, the ground displacement fields were successfully mapped. Ground deformation is distributed on the eastern side of an active fault, known as the Ishikari-Teichi-Toen fault zone (ITTFZ). Uplift of up to similar to 7cm is distributed throughout the source region, and eastward movement of up to similar to 4cm is widely observed on the eastern side of the source region. The fault model constructed by inverting InSAR and GNSS data under an assumption of a uniform slip on a rectangular fault plane shows reverse fault motion on a plane dipping eastward at 74 degrees. The fault top is positioned around a depth of 15 km, suggesting that the slip significantly occurs deeper than the typical seismogenic zone for the Japanese island. The fault plane is at a relatively high dip angle, and the shallow extension of the estimated fault plane does not connect to any known surface traces of the ITTFZ. This may suggest that the fault involved with the 2018 event is physically separated from the ITTFZ, or that the fault plane bends to a lower dip angle at a shallow crustal depth. The fault rupture area is located in a spatially inhomogeneous seismic velocity structure field and the main slip occurs at the western edge of a low Vp area which vertically thickens on the eastern side of the fault. This may suggest that the 2018 earthquake occurred at seismic velocity boundary. An estimate of Coulomb Failure Function change suggests that the static stress change due to the 2018 event can promote reverse fault slip on the southern part of the ITTFZ.

TI  - Indigenous business success: a hybrid perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to address the notion that the relationship between being indigenous and business success is inconclusive because there are tensions between indigenous values and business success. The research questions are: How do indigenous entrepreneurs define success? Does the third space create a different meaning of success in the indigenous context? Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was adopted for this study because the ability to define success requires subjective meanings. Participants' lived experiences and stories were the main sources of information. Open conversational-style interviews were used because they allow participants to freely share their stories. Findings A defining line is that not all indigenous entrepreneurs have the same view of success. The homogeneity that emanates from sharing indigeneity does not equal unity in views, but shows that people from the same group can view success differently. However, the meaning and views formed are also connected to the wider community, relationships and predominant values that characterise the social cultural context of the entrepreneur.Originality/value This paper suggests a different view of success in an indigenous context using the hybridity viewpoint to explain why success can be perceived using the in-between space without opposite binary.

TI  - Long-term distribution patterns of remotely sensed water quality variables in Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pearl River Delta (PRD) is the third largest and one of the most productive Deltas in south China, where long-term monitoring and its assessment of water quality are necessary to understand the distribution patterns to infer the coastal zone management. The studies on long-term monitoring in water quality variable concerning the changing climate and anthropogenic effects can be made possible by continuous coverage of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. This study attempts to study the long-term trends, quantitative measurements, and assessment of water quality variables including total suspended solids (TSS), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (K-d (490)), and sea surface temperature (SST) using 8-day composite and monthly data products of MODIS data for the period between July 2002 and August 2018 in the turbid waters of the PRD. Monthly products are used to quantify the variability of these water quality properties on long-term climatology, seasonal and as well as spatial distributions to interannual time scales. We observed a decreasing trend of TSS and K-d (490) between 2002 and 2018, though not significant, whereas, an increasing trend of SST has recorded for the PRD region during the same time. Seasonal patterns of TSS, K-d (490) and SST showed significant differences between the seasons. The high values of TSS (> 15 gm(-3)) and K-d (490) (> 2 m(-1)) were found in summer, autumn followed by winter, and low values (< 0.5 gm(-3) and 0.1 m(-1)) in spring. Consequently, high SSTs were noticed in the in summer-Autumn season and low SSTs in winter. The spatial concentrations of TSS, K-d (490) and SST were found high in the northern region and low values in the offshore and the southern part of the PRD. The increased values of TSS and K-d (490) in summer can be attributed to the high amount of precipitation, and strong monsoonal winds lead to the significant amounts of highly turbid waters in the water column. Based on the MODIS derived time series of TSS and K-d (490), a significant correlation with wind speed was found between these variables, suggesting a critical role of precipitation, river discharge and wind forcing in the variability of ocean variables in the PRD region.

TI  - Contrasting Climates at Both Sides of the Andes in Argentina and Chile
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented. This study quantifies the abrupt changes of precipitation and cloud properties at both sides of the Andes south of 20 degrees S by using surface daily precipitation and satellite (CloudSat and MODIS) data during the 2006-2016 period. Results show that the precipitation changes drastically and precipitating clouds can be of very different nature on each side of the Andes. In the tropical Andes (20-25 degrees S), precipitation normally falls from a sole layer of thick stratiform and convective precipitating clouds during the warm semester, but the annual mean accumulation is about 10-100 times larger on the eastern than on the western slopes. A sole layer of low stratus clouds dominates over the Pacific coast, occasionally producing light rains, whereas high, thin, and non-precipitating clouds dominate most of the time over the continent. In the subtropical Andes (25-35 degrees S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes. These different features on both slopes denote a climatic transition between the tropics and extratropics. In the extratropical Andes (south of 35 degrees S), stratiform cloud types produces precipitation on both sides during all the year, but the annual mean precipitation and cloud frequency are enhanced on the western slopes and strongly reduced on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Cloud frequencies are higher than in the subtropics and evenly distributed as single- or multi-layers of low, middle and high clouds. Frozen particles become important in precipitating clouds over the mountains and on the lee side. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of the Andes cordillera on the climate all along southwestern South America, and constitute an excellent example of how the simple dependence of climate on latitude can be substantially altered by the topography.

TI  - Cross-validation of an algorithm detecting acute gastroenteritis episodes from prescribed drug dispensing data in France: comparison with clinical data reported in a primary care surveillance system, winter seasons 2014/15 to 2016/17
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study compares an algorithm to detect acute gastroenteritis (AG) episodes from drug dispensing data to the validated data reported in a primary care surveillance system in France.Methods: We used drug dispensing data collected in a drugstore database and data collected by primary care physicians involved in a French surveillance network, from season 2014/15 to 2016/17. We used an adapted version of an AG discrimination algorithm to identify AG episodes from the drugstore database. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between weekly AG signals obtained from the two data sources during winter months, in the overall population, by specific age-groups and by regions.Results: Correlations between AG signals for all ages were 0.84 [95%CI 0.69; 0.92] for season 2014/15, 0.87 [95%CI 0.75; 0.93] for season 2015/16 and 0.94 [95%CI 0.88; 0.97] for season 2016/17. The association between AG signals estimated from two data sources varied significantly across age groups in season 2016/17 (p-value < 0.01), and across regions in all three seasons studied (p-value < 0.01).Conclusions: There is a strong agreement between the dynamic of AG activity estimated from drug dispensing data and from validated primary care surveillance data collected during winter months in the overall population but the agreement is poorer in several age groups and in several regions. Once automated, the reuse of drug dispensing data, already collected for reimbursement purposes, could be a cost-efficient method to monitor AG activity at the national level.

TI  - Therapeutic Immunoadsorption and Conventional Plasma Exchange in ABO-incompatible Renal Transplant: An Exculpatory Evidence
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThe objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of immunoadsorption (IA) with conventional therapeutic plasma-exchange (cTPE) in ABO-incompatible (ABOi) renal transplant.MethodsData of patients from July 2015 to June 2017 (category-I, number of patients (N) = 11; IA +/- cTPE) on the average length of stay (ALOS), number of cTPE/IA, antibody-titers (AT), creatinine, patient and graft survival at one year were compared retrospectively with patients in period from February 2012 to June 2015 (category-II, N = 29; cTPE only). AT of patients not decreasing to less than one fold after two cTPE were shifted for IA. For patients undergoing IA, real-time AT was done and IA stopped after target titer (TT < 1:8) was achieved. Post-transplant cTPE was done if, titers rebounded to >= 1: 8. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given after every cTPE/IA. Cost comparisons were made.ResultsIn category-I, seven patients (63.63%) were shifted to IA from cTPE. The mean cTPE procedures in category I and II are 3.5 +/- 2.4 and 4.8 +/- 2.5, respectively (p = 0.206). The mean IA procedures in category-I are 1.6 +/- 0.5. The number of patients requiring post-operative TPE was less in category-I than category-II, i. e., N = 5, 45.5% vs N = 20, 69%, respectively (p = 0.171). The expense of IA in category-I vs cTPE in category-II was statistically not significant (p = 0.422) but had significant lesser ALOS (p = 0.044). Expenses, when a patient undergoes both cTPE and IA (category-I), are significantly higher to category-II (p = 0.003). The two groups were comparable in AT, creatinine value, graft and patient survival rates at one year.ConclusionContrary to the general judgment of IA being expensive than cTPE, this study shows equivalent expenditures with comparable therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundWhether patients receive low-value hospital care (care that is not expected to provide a net benefit) may be influenced by unmeasured factors at the hospital they attend or the hospital's Local Health District (LHD), or the patients' areas of residence. Multilevel modelling presents a method to examine the effects of these different levels simultaneously and assess their relative importance to the outcome. Knowing which of these levels has the greatest contextual effects can help target further investigation or initiatives to reduce low-value care.MethodsWe conducted multilevel logistic regression modelling for nine low-value hospital procedures. We fit a series of six models for each procedure. The baseline model included only episode-level variables with no multilevel structure. We then added each level (hospital, LHD, Statistical Local Area [SLA] of residence) separately and used the change in the c statistic from the baseline model as a measure of the contribution of the level to the outcome. We then examined the variance partition coefficients (VPCs) and median odds ratios for a model including all three levels. Finally, we added level-specific covariates to examine if they were associated with the outcome.ResultsAnalysis of the c statistics showed that hospital was more important than LHD or SLA in explaining whether patients receive low-value care. The greatest increases were 0.16 for endoscopy for dyspepsia, 0.13 for colonoscopy for constipation, and 0.14 forsentinel lymph node biopsy for early melanoma. SLA gave a small increase in c compared with the baseline model, but no increase over the model with hospital. The VPCs indicated that hospital accounted for most of the variation not explained by the episode-level variables, reaching 36.8% (95% CI, 31.9-39.0) for knee arthroscopy. ERCP (8.5%; 95% CI, 3.9-14.7) and EVAR (7.8%; 95% CI, 2.9-15.8) had the lowest residual variation at the hospital level. The variables at the hospital, LHD and SLA levels that were available for this study generally showed no significant effect.ConclusionsInvestigations into the causes of low-value care and initiatives to reduce low-value care might best be targeted at the hospital level, as the high variation at this level suggests the greatest potential to reduce low-value care.

TI  - Relating vegetation condition to grazing management systems in the central Keiskamma Catchment, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation degradation has been identified as a serious environmental problem, around the communal villages of South Africa. An investigation of the relationship between vegetation condition and local grazing management systems was undertaken across the communal villages of the central Keiskamma Catchment, Eastern Cape Province. The hypothesis that "differences in grazing management strategies may explain the variations in vegetation condition within these communal villages" was tested. Landsat TM imagery of 1984 and 1999, in conjunction with SPOT-4 imagery of 2011, was used to assess the spatial and temporal trends in vegetation. Structured interviews were administered among communal village authorities to obtain information regarding the functionality of local grazing management structures. Using the logistic regression in IDRISI Selva remote sensing software, relationships between vegetation condition and grazing management systems were analysed. Spatial and temporal trends in vegetation cover revealed a drastic reduction in fair vegetation, an increase in extremely degraded vegetation and bare/eroded surfaces, particularly in villages with ineffective rangeland management practices. The hypothesis was accepted; a distinct relationship between the respective grazing practices and vegetation condition was identified. Variations in the functionality of local grazing management structures in the communal villages account for the vegetation condition disparities observed. A revitalisation of these structures is key in vegetation restoration endeavours.

TI  - Synergistic Effects of Climate and Land-Cover Change on Long-Term Bird Population Trends of the Western USA: A Test of Modeled Predictions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use change are predicted to lead to widespread changes in population dynamics, but quantitative predictions on the relative effects of these stressors have not yet been examined empirically. We analyzed historical abundance data of 110 terrestrial bird species sampled from 1983 to 2010 along 406 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) across the western USA. Using boosted-regression trees, we modeled bird abundance at the beginning of this interval as a function of (1) climate variables, (2) Landsat-derived landcover data, (3) the additive and interactive effects of climate and land-cover variables. We evaluated the capacity of each model set to predict observed 27-year bird population trends. On average, 45 species significantly declined over the period observed and only 8 increased (mean trend = -0.84%/year). Climate change alone significantly predicted observed abundance trends for 44/108 species (mean 0.37 +/- 0.09 [SD]), land-cover changes alone predicted trends for 47/108 species (mean r = 0.36 +/- 0.09), and the synergistic effects predicted 59/108 species (mean r = 0.37 +/- 0.11). However, for 37 of these species, including information on land-cover change increased prediction success over climate data alone. Across stressors, species with trends that were predicted accurately were more likely to be in decline across the western USA. For instance, species with high correlations between predicted and observed abundances (>r = 0.6) were declining at rates that were on average >2%/year. We provide the first empirical evidence that abundance models based on land cover and climate have the capacity to predict the species most likely to be at risk from climate and land-use change. However, for many species there were substantial discrepancies between modeled and observed trends. Nevertheless, our results highlight that climate change is already influencing bird populations of the western U.S. and that such effects often operate synergistically with land-cover change to affect population declines.

TI  - The cost function of the data fusion process and its application
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - When the complete data fusion method is used to fuse inconsistent measurements, it is necessary to add to the measurement covariance matrix of each fusing profile a covariance matrix that takes into account the inconsistencies. A realistic estimate of these inconsistency covariance matrices is required for effectual fused products. We evaluate the possibility of assisting the estimate of the inconsistency covariance matrices using the value of the cost function minimized in the complete data fusion. The analytical expressions of expected value and variance of the cost function are derived. Modelling the inconsistency covariance matrix with one parameter, we determine the value of the parameter that makes the reduced cost function equal to its expected value and use the variance to assign an error to this determination. The quality of the inconsistency covariance matrix determined in this way is tested for simulated measurements of ozone profiles obtained in the thermal infrared in the framework of the Sentinel-4 mission of the Copernicus programme. As expected, the method requires sufficient statistics and poor results are obtained when a small number of profiles are being fused together, but very good results are obtained when the fusion involves a large number of profiles.

TI  - Zooplankton diel vertical migration in the Corsica Channel (north-western Mediterranean Sea) detected by a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a survival strategy adopted by zooplankton that we investigated in the Corsica Channel using acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data from April 2014 to November 2016. The principal aim of the study is to characterize migration patterns and biomass temporal evolution of zooplankton along the water column. The ADCP measured vertical velocity and echo intensity in the water column range between about 70 and 390m (the bottom depth is 443 m). During the investigated period, zooplanktonic biomass had a well-defined daily and seasonal cycle, with peaks occurring in late winter to spring (2015 and 2016) when the stratification of the water column is weaker. Zooplanktonic biomass temporal distribution in the whole water column is well correlated with biomass of primary producers, estimated with satellite data. Zooplanktonic blooming and non-blooming periods have been identified and studied separately. During the non-blooming period zooplanktonic biomass was most abundant in the upper and the deep layers, while during the blooming period the upper-layer maximum in zooplanktonic biomass disappeared and the deep layer with high zooplanktonic biomass became thicker. These two layers are likely to correspond to two different zooplanktonic communities. The evolution of zooplanktonic biomass is well correlated with chlorophyll, with phytoplankton biomass peaks preceding the upper-layer secondary production by a lag of about 3.5 weeks. Nocturnal DVM appears to be the main pattern during both periods, but reverse and twilight migration are also detected. Nocturnal DVM was more evident at mid-water than in the deep and the upper layers. DVM occurred with different intensities during blooming and non-blooming periods. One of the main outcomes is that the principal drivers for DVM are light intensity and stratification, but other factors, like the moon cycle and primary production, are also taken in consideration.

TI  - Highly conductive and complete spin filtering of nickel atomic contacts in a nitrogen atmosphere
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating efficient and highly spin-polarized currents through nanoscale junctions is essential in the field of nanoelectronics and spintronics. In this paper, using ab initio electron transport calculations, we predict highly conductive and perfect spin filtering of nickel atomic contacts in a nitrogen environment, where a single N-2 molecule sits in parallel (energetically most favorable) between two nickel electrodes. Such a particular performance is due to the wave function orthogonality between majority-spin s-like states of ferromagnetic electrodes and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the N-2 molecule, and thus, majority-spin electrons are completely blocked at the interface. For the minority spin, on the contrary, two almost saturated conducting channels are formed due to the effective coupling between d(zx,zy) of the Ni atom and p(x,y) of the N atom, resulting in a large conductance of about 1G(0) (=2e(2)/h). As a consequence, a single N-2 molecule acts as a highly conductive and half-metallic conductor. On the other hand, the CO and NO incorporated molecular junctions exhibit rather low conductance with a partially spin-polarized current.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This dataset consists of 33 years (1985 to 2018), of global significant wave height and wind speed obtained from 13 altimeters, namely: GEOSAT, ERS-1, TOPEX, ERS-2, GFO, JASON-1, ENVISAT, JASON-2, CRYOSAT-2, HY-2A, SARAL, JASON-3 and SENTINEL-3A. The altimeter data have been calibrated and validated against National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) buoy data. Differences between altimeter and buoy data as a function of time are investigated for long-term stability. A cross validation between altimeters is also carried out in order to check the stability and consistency of the calibrations developed. Quantile-quantile comparisons between altimeter and buoy data as well as between altimeters are undertaken to test consistency of probability distributions and extreme value performance. The data were binned into 1 degrees by 1 degrees bins globally, to provide convenient access for users to download only the regions of interest. All data are quality controlled. This globally calibrated and cross-validated dataset provides a single point of storage for all altimeter missions in a consistent format.

TI  - Intercomparison in spatial distributions and temporal trends derived from multi-source satellite aerosol products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol products provide long-term and large-scale observations for analysing aerosol distributions and variations, climate-scale aerosol simulations, and aerosol-climate interactions. Therefore, a better understanding of the consistencies and differences among multiple aerosol products is important. The objective of this study is to compare 11 global monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, which are the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VI-IRS), and POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) products. AErosol RObotic NEtwork (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 monthly measurements at 308 sites around the world are selected for comparison. Our results illustrate that the spatial distributions and temporal variations of most aerosol products are highly consistent globally but exhibit certain differences on regional and site scales. In general, the AATSR Dual View (ADV) and SeaWiFS products show the lowest spatial coverage with numerous missing values, while the MODIS products can cover most areas (average of 87 %) of the world. The best performance is observed in September-October-November (SON) and the worst is in June-July-August (JJA). All the products perform unsatisfactorily over northern Africa and Middle East, southern and eastern Asia, and their coastal areas due to the influence from surface brightness and human activities. In general, the MODIS products show the best agreement with the AERONET-based AOD values on different spatial scales among all the products. Furthermore, all aerosol products can capture the correct aerosol trends at most cases, especially in areas where aerosols change significantly. The MODIS products perform best in capturing the global temporal variations in aerosols. These results provide a reference for users to select appropriate aerosol products for their particular studies.

TI  - Elevation Drives Gradients in Surface Soil Temperature Within Salt Marshes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevation differences in salt marshes result in numerous ecological consequences as a result of variation in tidal flooding. We demonstrate here that elevation differences are also negatively correlated with soil temperature on the marsh platform, irrespective of tidal flooding. Field observations of soil temperature at 10-cm depth in a Georgia marsh showed that elevation increases of 0.5 m corresponded to decreases in average soil temperature of 0.9-1.7 degrees C during both winter and summer. Landsat 8 estimates of land surface temperatures across the marsh in dry (nonflooded) scenes also showed that temperature decreased with increasing elevation, which was consistent with soil observations. Similar satellite results were also found in a test marsh in Virginia. Biological reactions are temperature-dependent, and these findings indicate that metabolic processes will vary over short distances. This is important for accurately estimating marsh metabolism and predicting how changes in temperature will affect future productivity.

TI  - Meaning-making, suffering, and religion: a worldview conception
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH RELIGION & CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Park's meaning-making model suggests that events such as the loss of a loved one may cause distress because people's appraised meaning of the difficult event may challenge their global orienting systems. Meaning-making alleviates distress by reducing this discrepancy. Research has shown the important role that religions often play in the meaning-making process. However, this body of research has largely been limited by a reluctance to address the religious content of meaning-making processes and outcomes. Here we advocate for inclusion of religious beliefs in the study of meaning-making in suffering, and recommend the construct of worldview as a promising resource for this endeavour. Finally, we illustrate the promise of this approach by exploring the contrasting worldviews of three religious traditions: Buddhism, Christianity, and atheism. We trace the ontological, anthropological, axiological, and praxiological assumptions in these worldviews, contrast them, and note the implications for research.

TI  - Multiple <i>SCN5A</i> variant enhancers modulate its cardiac gene expression and the QT interval
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The rationale for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results is sequence variation in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) modulating a target gene's expression as the major cause of trait variation. To understand the complete molecular landscape of one of these GWAS loci, we performed in vitro reporter screens in cardiomyocyte cell lines for CREs overlapping nearly all common variants associated with any of five independent QT interval (QTi)-associated GWAS hits at the SCN5A SCN10A locus. We identified 13 causal CRE variants using allelic reporter activity, cardiomyocyte nuclear extract-based binding assays, overlap with human cardiac tissue DNasel hypersensitive regions, and predicted impact of sequence variants on DNasel sensitivity. Our analyses identified at least one high-confidence causal CRE variant for each of the five sentinel hits that could collectively predict SCN5A cardiac gene expression and QTi association. Although all 13 variants could explain SCN5A gene expression, the highest statistical significance was obtained with seven variants (inclusive of the five above). Thus, multiple, causal, mutually associated CRE variants can underlie GWAS signals.

TI  - Daytime Evolution of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles Observed by the First Republic of China Satellite
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasma bubbles in the equatorial F region are thought of as nighttime phenomena because they develop at night and are assumed to vanish after sunrise. However, bubbles occasionally persist throughout the night and into the day. This study investigates the origin of daytime irregularities and their evolution using data from the first Republic of China satellite. Our results show that daytime irregularities occur in the longitudes where bubbles have developed on previous nights. A newly reported feature is the observation of the temporal variation of the locations of daytime irregularities; daytime irregularities are concentrated near the magnetic equator early in the morning, but the location gradually shifts to higher latitudes with time. This phenomenon is explained in terms of the latitudinal redistribution of fossil bubbles by the ionospheric fountain effect.Plain Language Summary Severe electron density disturbances are created at night in the equatorial ionosphere by the upward transport of the low-density plasma from the bottomside of the ionosphere. These phenomena are called bubbles because the plasma density at the locations of the disturbances is smaller than that of the ambient plasma. Bubbles are thought of as nighttime phenomena because bubbles develop after sunset and decay away after sunrise. However, our study using satellite data shows that some parts of these nighttime bubbles survive through the day and become the major sources of daytime electron density irregularities. The new finding of our study is that the locations of daytime irregularities move from the magnetic equator to higher latitudes over time. The redistribution of fossil bubbles is driven by the same ionospheric electrodynamics that creates the ionospheric equatorial arcs.

TI  - Establishment of a model of sentinel lymph node metastasis using immunodeficient swine
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastasis occurs via the migration of cancer cells through the lymphatic system. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a common diagnostic strategy. SLNs have been studied using healthy rodents and large animals without metastasis. Here we used immunodeficient swine to establish a model of lymph node metastasis. We used RAG2-knockout immunodeficient swine. A431 human epithelial carcinoma cells expressing green fluorescent protein were injected subcutaneously into the posterior sides of the auricle, forelimb and hindlimb of knockout swine. Indigo carmine dye was injected subcutaneously 8 weeks after tumour cell transplantation. SLNs were extracted, observed using a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope and analysed histologically using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Lymphoid follicles were found in wild-type swine, and a few aggregated lymphocytes and immature lymphoid follicles were observed in knockout swine. Fluorescence in the lymph nodes indicated metastasis of tumour cells to the lymph nodes. Tumour cells replaced lymph node architectures, showed high-grade nuclear atypia and formed irregular tumour nests. Our model may be useful for the preclinical validation of diagnostic methods and minimally invasive treatment of metastatic cancer.

TI  - Characteristics of Brazilian melanomas: real-world results before and after the introduction of new therapies
T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study is a characterization of the treatment patterns and outcomes of a Brazilian melanoma cohort collected of 1848 patients enrolled between 1996 and 2015.ResultsThe superficial spreading subtype (35.1%) was the most prevalent, and the favoured anatomical location was the trunk (32.8%). The most common clinical stage was I (27.6%). The most frequent initial treatment was surgery (84.7%). Sentinel node biopsy was positive in 23.3% of cases. Chemotherapy was used to treat 298 patients (16.1%), immunotherapy for 67 (3.6%) and targeted therapy for 19 (1.0%). Distant recurrence was commonly observed (22.5%) and the mutation status of the BRAF gene was verified in 132 cases, with 42.4% positivity in this subset of patients. The melanoma specific actuarial 5-year survival for the cohort was 68.8%. There was a higher 5-year survival observed in metastatic melanoma patients who received immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy (34.2%) compared patients treated with just chemotherapy (20.0%). The survival analysis showed that sex, age, Breslow, clinical stage and distant recurrence were significant prognostic factors. This study provides a real-world description of how the introduction of new therapies such as immunotherapy and BRAF inhibitors is changing treatment strategies for melanoma in developing countries.

TI  - Tracking Seasonal Fluctuations in Land Water Storage Using Global Models and GRACE Satellites
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal water storage fluctuations are critical for evaluating water scarcity linked to climate forcing and human intervention. Here we compare seasonal changes in land total water storage anomalies using seven global hydrologic and land surface models (WGHM, PCR-GLOBWB, and five GLDAS models) to GRACE satellite data in 183 river basins globally. This work builds on previous analysis that focused on total water storage anomaly trends. Results show that most models underestimate seasonal water storage amplitudes in tropical and (semi)arid basins and land surface models generally overestimate amplitudes in northern basins. Some models (CLM-5.0 and PCR-GLOBWB) agree better with GRACE than others. Causes of model-GRACE discrepancies are attributed to missing storage compartments (e.g., surface water and/or groundwater) and underestimation of modeled storage capacities in tropical basins and to variations in modeled fluxes in northern basins. This study underscores the importance of considering water storage, in addition to water fluxes, to improve global models.Plain Language Summary We are relying more and more on global models to understand the water cycle, but we need to assess the reliability of model output. In this study we compare seasonal amplitudes in land total water storage from global models with those from GRACE satellite data in river basins globally. We found that seasonal amplitudes in total water storage account for more than half of the total signal, except in semiarid basins Seasonal amplitudes are highest in tropical basins and lowest in semiarid basins. Some models agree better with GRACE than others (CLM-5.0 and PCR-GLOBWB). Most models underestimate GRACE-derived seasonal amplitudes in tropical and semiarid basins but overestimate seasonal amplitudes in northern high latitude basins. The main cause of the discrepancies in tropical basins is likely insufficient storage capacity and lack of surface water inundation to accommodate the large seasonal storage variations. In northern high latitude basins, differences in snow physics and evapotranspiration increase seasonal amplitudes in water storage in newer versions of land surface models, overestimating GRACE-derived seasonal amplitudes and reducing agreement with GRACE relative to earlier versions. Reliable models of seasonal variations in water storage are critical for assessing water scarcity, estimating response to climate extremes, and managing water resources.

TI  - First high-resolution BrO column retrievals from TROPOMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than 2 decades, satellite observations from instruments such as GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OMI have been used for the monitoring of bromine monoxide BrO) distributions on global and regional scales. In October 2017, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument TROPOMI) was launched on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor platform with the goal of continuous daily global trace gas observations with unprecedented spatial resolution. In this study, sensitivity tests were performed to find an optimal wavelength range for TROPOMI BrO retrievals under various measurement conditions. From these sensitivity tests, a wavelength range for TROPOMI BrO retrievals was determined and global data for April 2018 as well as for several case studies were retrieved. Comparison with GOME-2 and OMI BrO retrievals shows good consistency and low scatter of the columns. The examples of individual TROPOMI overpasses show that due to the better signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution of 3.5 x 7 km(2), TROPOMI BrO retrievals provide good data quality with low fitting errors and unique information on small-scale variabilities in various BrO source regions such as Arctic sea ice, salt marshes, and volcanoes.

TI  - The Tropical Transition in the Western North Pacific: The Case of Tropical Cyclone Peipah (2007)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the transition of an extratropical disturbance to a tropical cyclone (TC), Peipah (2007), in the western North Pacific (WNP), using reanalysis and geostationary satellite data. Instead of regular diurnal fluctuations of deep convection, the pre-TC disturbance accompanies deep convection only for short durations every other day. When the pre-TC vorticity is traced back to 7days prior to its formation, the traced-back vorticity indicates a strong potential vorticity (PV) trough in the subtropical upper troposphere that originated from the midlatitude lower stratosphere. The quasi-geostrophic forcing and reduced static stability at the leading edge of the PV trough result in the formation of an extratropical disturbance. The vertical structure of the extratropical disturbance shows maximum vorticity in the upper troposphere and cold temperature anomaly within it throughout the entire troposphere. As the extratropical disturbance moved into the tropical WNP, deep convection associated with quasi-geostrophic dynamics over the warm ocean initiated tropical transition of the extratropical disturbance to a TC through diabatic redistribution of PV in the tropospheric column as well as transition of the cold anomaly into a warm anomaly within the vortex. With additional contribution of barotropic energy conversion in the lower troposphere, the warm-core low system finally developed into a TC-strength vortex. These results indicate that PV troughs of the stratospheric origin over the subtropical Pacific Ocean can contribute to TC formations in the WNP.

TI  - Co-expression network analysis identifies gonad- and embryo- associated protein modules in the sentinel species <i>Gammarus fossarum</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies have recently expanded the availability of whole transcriptomes and proteomes beyond classical model organisms in molecular biology, even in absence of an annotated genome. However, the fragmented nature of transcriptomic and proteomic data reduces the ability to interpret the data, notably in non-model organisms. Network-based approaches may help extracting important biological information from -omics datasets. The reproductive cycle of the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum. provides an excellent case study to test the relevance of a network analysis in non-model organisms. Here, we illustrated how the use of a co-expression network analysis (based on Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis algorithm, WGCNA) allowed identifying protein modules whose expression profiles described germ cell maturation and embryonic development in the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum. Proteome datasets included testes, ovaries or embryos samples at different maturation or developmental stages, respectively. We identified an embryonic module correlated with mid-developmental stages corresponding to the organogenesis and it was characterized by enrichment in proteins involved in RNA editing and splicing. An ovarian module was enriched in vitellogenin-like proteins and clottable proteins, confirming the diversity of proteins belonging to the large lipid transfer family involved in oocytes maturations in this freshwater amphipod. Moreover, our results found evidence of a fine-tuned regulation between energy production by glycolysis and actin-myosin-dependent events in G. fossarum spermatogenesis. This study illustrates the importance of applying systems biology approaches to emergent animal models to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating important physiological events with ecological relevance.

TI  - Spatial and diurnal Diurnal Variations of Summer Hourly Rainfall Over Three Super City Clusters in Eastern China and Their Possible Link to the Urbanization
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Three super city clusters in eastern China, that is, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD), have been developed in recent decades. The spatial and diurnal variations of summer hourly rainfall over these city clusters and their possible link to the urbanization are investigated in this study, with the Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) satellite precipitation estimates at high spatial-temporal resolutions for 2004-2009. Although the summer rainfall in eastern China is mainly characterized by large-scale pattern, significant regional rainfall features over the three city clusters can be clearly observed, which are related to the clustered urbanization. Large hourly rainfall intensity is found over the city clusters or downwind from them. Those regions with large hourly rainfall intensity are named as the city cluster impacted regions (CCIRs), contrast to the surrounding mountainous regions where high frequency and large amount but low hourly intensity of rainfall occur. Location and geometry of each CCIR are unique because of the distinctive geography and structures among city clusters. The CCIR situates right over YRD, but it is shifted to the downwind region with an elongated shape for BTH and a circular shape for PRD. More heavy rain but less light rain occurs over the CCIRs than the surrounding regions. Diurnal variations of light rain amount and frequency can be influenced by both mountain and urbanization, and a diurnal cycle amplitude increase related to the urbanization is detected only over the CCIR of YRD where the terrains are mostly low and flat.

TI  - Flexible atmospheric compensation technique (FACT): a 6S based atmospheric correction scheme for remote sensing data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is an important pre-processing step in various spatio-temporal and multi-sensor remote sensing data analyzes based applications. Absolute atmospheric corrections are carried out using physical based models, generally known as radiative transfer (RT) codes such as MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN), Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) etc. Most of the available atmospheric correction schemes are commercially off-the-shelf and use patented RT codes. The objective of the present work is to develop an open-end atmospheric correction scheme, named as Flexible Atmospheric Compensation Technique (FACT), based on open source 6S RT code. The proposed FACT scheme utilizes look-up architecture for simulating the outputs of 6S RT code for various input parameters' combination. Input parameters such as initial visibility, columnar water vapour are estimated using the dark object and the Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR) methods respectively. The proposed FACT scheme has been evaluated exhaustively using spatio-spectral statistical error measures such as Spatial-Root Mean Square Error (S-RMSE), Spatial-Mean Absolute Error (S-MAE) and spectral-RMSE by comparing the performance with widely used Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH) and the customized NASA JPL's atmospheric correction scheme. Datasets from hyperspectral (AVIRIS-NG and Hyperion) and multispectral (LANDSAT-8 OLI and WorldView-3) remote sensors were chosen for comparative analysis of the developed atmospheric correction scheme against other atmospheric correction schemes. Results confirm that the proposed FACT scheme offers accuracy of about 95% for hyperspectral imaging sensors and close to 98% for multispectral imaging sensors when compared with FLAASH. Despite marginal disagreements for certain land cover features at the water vapour absorbing spectral regions, we find the proposed FACT scheme a plausible option for carrying out absolute atmospheric correction of various operational remote imaging sensors.

TI  - The FLUXCOM ensemble of global land-atmosphere energy fluxes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Although a key driver of Earth's climate system, global land-atmosphere energy fluxes are poorly constrained. Here we use machine learning to merge energy flux measurements from FLUXNET eddy covariance towers with remote sensing and meteorological data to estimate global gridded net radiation, latent and sensible heat and their uncertainties. The resulting FLUXCOM database comprises 147 products in two setups: (1) 0.0833 degrees resolution using MODIS remote sensing data (RS) and (2) 0.5 degrees resolution using remote sensing and meteorological data (RS + METEO). Within each setup we use a full factorial design across machine learning methods, forcing datasets and energy balance closure corrections. For RS and RS + METEO setups respectively, we estimate 2001-2013 global (+/- 1s.d.) net radiation as 75.49 +/- 1.39 W m(-2) and 77.52 +/- 2.43 W m(-2), sensible heat as 32.39 +/- 4.17 W m(-2) and 35.58 +/- 4.75 W m(-2), and latent heat flux as 39.14 +/- 6.60 W m(-2) and 39.49 +/- 4.51 W m(-2) (as evapotranspiration, 75.6 +/- 9.8 x 10(3) km(3) yr(-1) and 76 +/- 6.8 x 10(3) km(3) yr(-1)). FLUXCOM products are suitable to quantify global land-atmosphere interactions and benchmark land surface model simulations.

TI  - 'God Was Here First': Value, Hierarchy, and Conversion in a Melanesian Christianity
T2  - ETHNOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world, conversion to evangelical and Pentecostal Christianity produces what Joel Robbins calls 'duplex cultural formations', whereby surviving aspects of local cosmology and worldview are brought into tension with paramount Christian values through a process of critical evaluation. I explore the dynamics of this process within Oksapmin understandings of human and cosmic origins. Traditional anthropogonic models explaining the emergence of lineages from primordial figures have been brought into tension with more-valued understandings of God as creator of the universe through the process of diabolisation, in this case, local figures being associated with fallen angels expelled from Heaven. I argue that these beings are permitted to continue because the anthropogenic and historic nature of their power does not significantly contradict the cosmogonic and eternally present conception of God's creative capacity, but are diabolised owing to their continued existence as symbols of creative power and the source of sinful ritual practices.

TI  - A reflection on critical realism and ethics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL REALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on my own work and experience, this paper brings together the various connections between critical realism (CR) and ethics. It argues that, against both determinism and physicalist reductionism, CR provides the very conditions of possibility for ethics. It goes on to identify a number of ethical matters that CR addresses that have not received adequate notice: Truth as among the conditions of possibility for ethics and as a democratic value in itself; the ethics of belief as opposed to action; the distinction between micro and macro-morality and the privatization of the latter; and moral purpose. The paper argues finally that ethics need to be grounded ontologically somehow, presumably in some transcendental way, which implies a connection with religion or at least some grounding secular worldview that treads on the religious domain.

TI  - Towards refined estimation of vegetation carbon stock in Auckland, New Zealand using WorldView-2 and LiDAR data: the impact of scaling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to estimate carbon (C) stored in urban vegetation for the purpose of carbon accounting and trading. This study aims to develop a refined method for reliably estimating above-ground carbon (AGC) stock of urban vegetation from integrated WorldView-2 imagery and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data in Auckland, New Zealand. Also assessed in this study is the impact of image resolution on regional AGC estimates by vegetation type. The integration of WorldView-2 imagery with a 2-m digital surface model produced from LiDAR data enables urban vegetation to be mapped into trees (101.5 km(2)), shrubs (64.9 km(2)), and grasses (172.2 km(2)) at a producer's accuracy over 95.9%. The AGC stock of trees, shrubs and grasses is estimated at 1,134,287, 207,606, and 127,427 Mg C, respectively, from the vegetation map. Overall, the total AGC of all types of vegetation does not vary significantly with image spatial resolution over the range of 5 to 30 m if estimated using the same model. This is because high AGC densities are generalised at a coarser resolution, but the larger pixel size compensates for the decrease. Although the spatial resolution does not affect the most significant spectral predicators of plot-level AGC noticeably, it has an obvious effect on both model accuracy and complexity. Thus, the impact of image resolution on AGC would be pronounced if it were estimated using different models that were the best at a given resolution. Of the three vegetation types, the AGC of shrubs is the most variable with spatial resolution, followed by trees. Thus, the AGC of relatively small but more spatially fragmented vegetation parcels is more susceptible to change in image spatial resolution. The estimation model based on spectral features of vegetation has the lowest room-mean-square-error at 15 m. More research is needed to confirm whether it is true in other natural environments in future studies.

TI  - Evaluating Aerosol Optical Depth From Himawari-8 With Sun Photometer Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), the primary sensor aboard the Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary satellite, measures regional aerosol observations with high temporal-spatial resolution. To improve product quality and scientific applications, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of AHI aerosol products (version 1.0). We compared nearly 2 years (15 July 2015 to 31 June 2017) of AHI aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD500) with AODs from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN). Results showed that, over land, AHI retrievals exhibit a large overall bias of -0.062, with an R of 0.78; over ocean, average bias measured 0.036 (0.051 for MAN), with an R of 0.89 (0.95 for MAN). AHI retrievals collocated with AERONET AODs ((A)) showed the following expected AHI AOD errors: (-0.66 x (A) + 0.02, -0.34 x (A) + 0.16) over land and (-0.24 x (A) + 0.03, 0.10 x (A) + 0.11) over ocean. AHI retrievals with degraded performance correlated to different regions, angles, aerosol types, and surface types, suggesting that the AHI aerosol algorithm can be improved by changing aerosol optical models, using better cloud filters, and combining multiple methods to estimate ground reflectance. Collocated comparisons of AHI-MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-AERONET demonstrate that, over land, AHI daytime AODs clearly improve when retrievals with a large viewing zenith angle and small scattering angle are excluded.

TI  - Direct Comparison and Triple Collocation: Which Is More Reliable in the Validation of Coarse-Scale Satellite Surface Albedo Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A rigorous and reliable validation is the prerequisite and basis to properly understand the accuracy of satellite surface albedo products. However, the representativeness error of point scale in situ measurements, which mainly results from the spatial mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements as well as the surface heterogeneities, generally hinders an effective validation of satellite surface albedo products based on the conventional direct comparison method. Triple collocation technique has been recognized as a powerful tool to estimate the errors of satellite products without requiring the truth. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of both the direct comparison and extended triple collocation (ETC) methods in tackling with the representativeness error of in situ measurements and characterizing the performances of satellite surface albedo products (MCD43A3 [V006], GLASS, and NPP VIIRS albedos) given whether the in situ-based pixel-scale albedo was available or not. The ETC method is shown to be advantageous over the direct comparison based on single point in situ measurements, because it is less affected by representativeness errors. However, it shall not substitute for the direct comparison method based on in situ-based pixel-scale albedo measurements, because its effectiveness in solving representativeness errors and estimating product errors is very limited and dependent on the choice of the data in the triplets. Furthermore, the ETC technique cannot be used to estimate the true physical errors of satellite surface albedo products.

TI  - Radiolocalization of atypical lesions for intraoperative identification: technical factors, localization quality, success rates, patient safety, and spectrum of applications
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo retrospectively analyze perilesional technetium Tc-99m MAA injection for intraoperative localization of atypical soft-tissue and bone lesions within a single tertiary referral center in order to determine technique, safety, and clinical utility of these procedures.MethodsAn IRB compliant, retrospective electronic chart review (2010-2017) exploring surgical excision of atypical (non-pulmonary, non-breast, non-sentinel node) lesions guided by Tc-99m MAA perilesional injection. Patient demographics, lesion location, lesion size, radiotracer injection technique, radiotracer injection complications, scintigraphy technique, scintigraphic quality, intraoperative time, lesion identification in surgery, and pathological diagnoses were recorded.ResultsTwenty-two atypical radiolocalization exams were identified. Lesion sites included rib (7), lymph node (4), abdominal wall (3), mesenteric (3), gallbladder fossa (1), retroperitoneum (1), parietal pleura (1), anterior mediastinum (1), and iliac bone (1). Average lesion size was 14mm (range 5-23mm). Eighteen (82%) radiotracer injections used computed tomography guidance and 4 (18%) used ultrasound guidance. The mean activity of Tc-99m MAA administered was 11.8MBq (0.32mCi). A 22-gauge needle was most often used for perilesional injection. No injection complications were reported. The lesions were identified with a hand-held gamma probe during surgery in 100% of cases. Of the samples sent to pathology, 100% were identified and given a diagnosis.ConclusionRadiolocalization of atypical lesions may be a valuable technique, guiding minimally invasive surgical removal of lesions that would otherwise be difficult to identify intraoperatively such as non-palpable rib, central mesenteric nodal, and abdominal wall lesions.

TI  - Stress-strain analysis by genetic algorithm-based integration of long-term subsidence time series from different synthetic aperture radar platforms in Darab, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry was shown to study the compaction of the aquifer system in Darab plain, Iran. In so doing, two different datasets, including Envisat advanced SAR (ASAR) spanning 2010 and Sentinel-1A spanning 2016 to 2017, were applied in small baseline subset time series analysis. To estimate the subsidence in the time period for which there is no SAR data available, i.e., 2010 to 2016, the time series analysis results separately obtained from the two datasets were to be integrated using an appropriate model, which should have been fitted to both sets of results. However, as both deformation time series results were calculated taking into account a distinct temporal reference, fitting the model was not a straightforward task. Accordingly, the main attempt was to find the subsidence value corresponding to the temporal reference of Sentinel-1A time series with respect to that of Envisat ASAR. This shift value was optimally determined using a genetic algorithm so as to minimize the misfit between the model and the deformation time series corresponding to the entire period. The average value of the root mean square error estimated as the misfit between the model and the calculated time series at all pixels is 0.011 m, which is an indication of the high performance of the proposed method for modeling the deformation time series. The integration results were further used to derive the stress-strain relationships to study the storage properties of the aquifer system. The fact that the strain linearly increases along with the decrease in water level in most piezometric wells indicates that the subsidence is highly correlated with groundwater exploitation.

TI  - Estimating fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation in a typical grassland area of northern China based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid accurate estimation of the fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) is essential for monitoring desertification, managing grassland resources, assessing soil erosion and grassland fire risk, and preserving the grassland ecological environment. However, there have been very few studies using multispectral remote sensing images (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images in this study) to estimate f(NPV) in typical grassland areas in northern China. In this study, using field spectra obtained from ground measurements in May and October 2017 and corresponding f(NPV) data, we calculated eight non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) from the simulated MODIS bands. We then determined the NPVIs that were suitable for the estimation of f(NPV). Based on the determined NPVIs, we established a remote sensing estimation model for f(NPV) in typical grassland areas using MODIS image data. The spatial distribution of f(NPV) in the studied area was also investigated. The results indicated that the determined NPVIs, including the dead fuel index (DFI), shortwave-infrared ratio (SWIR32), normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), modified soil-adjusted crop residue index (MSACRI), and soil tillage index (STI), used bands 6 and 7 in the shortwave-infrared region of the MODIS data; the DFI had the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.68 and root mean square error of leave-one-out cross-validation (RMSECV) of 0.1390. The models based on MODIS image data for the estimation of f(NPV) using NPVIs had relatively good regression relations, and we determined that the DFI linear regression model was the best remote sensing model for monitoring f(NPV) in typical grassland areas, with an estimation accuracy exceeding 73.00%. Additionally, our results indicated that the distribution of non-photosynthetic vegetation exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity and that f(NPV) gradually decreased from the north-eastern to south-western portions of the study area.

TI  - Exploring intra-annual variation in cropland classification accuracy using monthly, seasonal, and yearly sample set
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring cropland dynamics is critical for water management and crop-yield estimation but cropland mapping is still a challenge because of its seasonality and human intervention. Both large-area mapping and change detection studies use images from certain or the same seasons; however, the uneven distribution of Landsat data within a year may affect accuracy. This study aimed to explore the accuracy and uncertainty of cropland mapping performance in different season and month by analyzing all available images in three Landsat footprints in Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa from 1984 to 2016. Three different combinations of training models (using yearly, seasonal, and monthly sample set) were used to compare the effect on cropland classification in different month and season through 10-fold cross-validation. There was a tendency to achieve better cropland mapping performance in the dry season and peak growth cycle in all three sites. We showed that monthly and seasonal cropland mapping accuracy was only slightly (similar to 2%) increased using training data in corresponded month. Therefore, we recommended transfer seasonal/yearly training data to fine temporal resolution (i.e., monthly and seasonal) cropland mapping for time and labor efficiency.

TI  - Landsat 8 OLI data for identification of hydrothermal alteration zone in Singhbhum Shear Zone using successive band depth difference technique - a new image processing approach
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in calculation algorithms have led to a new level of image processing for mineral identification and mapping. Mineral outcrop mapping has a decade's history of using conventional methods like band combintion, band ratioing and relative absorption band depth (RBD) technique. Modification of these algorithms enriches the capabilities of object identification and mapping. Band combination and band ratioing help to locate the distribution of a hydrothermal altered zone. In the current study, an attempt has been made to modify the the RBD approach. Newly introduced successive band depth difference (SBDD) measures the difference of reflectance values in successive bands by dividing the sum of the two highest successive shoulders by the shoulder of the lowest value before the starting shoulder. Band math function has been used in various bands of Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) data to access the precise distribution of points of the hydrothermal altered zone. SBDD method has achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.86 which depicts significant levels of accuracy.

TI  - Cloud Detectionof ZY-3 Remote Sensing Images Based on Fully Convolutional Neural Network and Conditional Random Field
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method for the cloud detection of ZY-3 satellite remote sensing images is proposed based on the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) combined with the conditional random field. The model of a fully convolutional neural network is optimized and the FCN after three times of upsampling (FCN-8s) is upsampled. The momentum combined adaptive algorithm is used for the acceleration of convergence by adjusting the learning rate of parameters. The fully convolutional neural network is combined with the conditional random field, the fully convolutional output image is taken as the first-order potential of the front end, and the Gaussian kernel function is used as the second-order potential of the back end. The mean-shift regional constraints arc added to protect the local feature information of images and the posterior probability of the conditional random field model is inferred by the mean field algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed cloud detection method can increase the identification accuracy rate of an image cloud region to 97.38%, which is 13.42% higher than that from FCN-8s.

TI  - Detection of Sea-Ice Drift Based on Different Polarization Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing data obtained from the Sentinel-I spacecraft allows the application of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarization feature data to the detection of the sea-ice drift. The difference in the usage of the horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (EIV) polarization data for the detection of the sea-ice drift is discussed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. The information detected using these two kinds of polarization data is observed to be complementary. Using feature fusion, the feature information detected using these two kinds of polarization data can be used for monitoring the sea-ice drift. The experimental results indicate that the sea-ice drift vector obtained using the proposed method is improved in terms of the spatial distribution and coverage rate, suggesting that the proposed method can be effectively applied for monitoring the sea-ice drift.

TI  - Including shaded leaves in a sample affects the accuracy of remotely estimating foliar nitrogen
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote estimation of foliar nitrogen (N) has largely assumed that the spectral reflectance value measured on a remote sensing platform comes from only the sunlit leaves of the canopy. Whilst this could have been valid for leaf-level spectroscopy studies, the landscape level estimation of foliar N presents new challenges that need investigation. In addition, a growing interest in the application of broadband satellites in foliar N estimation has triggered the need to understand the confounding factors affecting the relationship between N and spectral reflectance. Field sampling criteria is therefore critical in obtaining representative foliar samples. However, the effect of using leaf samples drawn from different levels in the canopy on the accuracy of remotely estimating N is still poorly understood. Our study was carried out in the expansive miombo woodlands. A bootstrapped random forest regression technique, in the R environment, was used to predict foliar N from sentinel-2 broadband satellite remote sensing image. A weighted mean of foliar N was calculated by considering values from two levels in the canopy, from 0% to 100% at intervals of 10%. Our results showed that the most accurate model was the one where the mean N had equal weighting from both levels. Furthermore, there were significant (p < 0.05) differences amongst the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of prediction of the models considered. We conclude that sampling leaves from two levels in the canopy improves the accuracy of remotely estimating N. This finding is significant in the canopy sampling for remotely estimating foliar N.

AB  - Good research demands that researchers are reflexive, understanding that all findings are socially constructed and susceptible to the unacknowledged interests of the researcher. When studying the consumption of religion and spirituality, how does a researcher mitigate a potential secularist worldview to consider consumers' alternative metaphysical assumptions? And when these alternative worldviews posit divine and occult forces, how should the researcher study and theorise these forces? Based on our research of Pentecostalism in Ghana, we offer four suggestions. First, we demonstrate the importance of delineating the socio-historical context of our informants' worldview. Second, we encourage exploring the potential of indigenous methods that may be more culturally sensitive; in this case, we show how religious testimony offers new insights as a way of knowing that is consistent with our informants' worldview. Third, we advocate theorising within the frame of the indigenous metaphysical worldviews, such as understanding the religious testimonies as affective performances. Finally, we reflect on the benefits of moving beyond reflexivity to paths of action that seek rapprochement among differing worldviews.

TI  - Multistage Soybean Biomass Inversion Models and Spatiotemporal Analyses considering Microtopography at the Sub-Field Scale
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop biomass is an agricultural indicator of productivity, and knowledge of the temporal and spatial variation in biomass in different topography is critical for the application of precision management techniques. This study integrates microtopography with multitemporal remote sensing observations to reveal biomass- and yield-limiting variables. Three SPOT-6 high spatial resolution images and six topographic variables were combined to model the spatial variation in soybean biomass at multiple stages during the growing season. The results showed the following. (i) The multiple regression model for biomass estimation that combines topographic variables with vegetation indices can achieve higher accuracy than a vegetation index model. (ii) Biomass varied dramatically with topography during the growing season. (iii) Microtopographic variables, such as curvature and slope, had distinctive impacts on crop conditions over a growing season. Early in the growing season, sunny upper slopes produced more biomass than shady lower slopes, whereas this trend reversed over the season. Gentle concave slopes (-1.2 m(-1) < curvature < 0 m(-1)) showed greater productivity later in the season, while slopes with high concavity (curvature < -1.2 m(-1)) or high convexity (curvature > 0.75 m(-1)) suppressed crop growth. These conclusions can be used directly to precisely manage nutrients and water applications.

TI  - Sensitivity of liquid cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals to cloud bow and glory conditions using two SEVIRI imagers
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrievals of cloud properties from geostationary satellite sensors offer extensive spatial and temporal coverage and resolution. The high temporal resolution allows the observation of diurnally resolved cloud properties. However, retrievals are sensitive to varying illumination and viewing geometries, including cloud glory and cloud bow conditions, which can lead to irregularities in the diurnal data record. In this study, these conditions and their effects on liquid cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals are analyzed using the Cloud Physical Properties (CPP) algorithm. This analysis is based on the use of Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) reflectances and products from Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-10, which are located over the Indian and Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and cover an extensive common area under different viewing angles. Comparisons of the retrievals from two full days, over ocean and land, and using different spectral combinations of visible and shortwave-infrared channels, are performed, to assess the importance of these factors in the retrieval process. The sensitivity of the cloud-bow- and cloud-glory-related irregularities to the width of the assumed droplet size distribution is analyzed by using different values of the effective variance of the size distribution. The results suggest for marine stratocumulus clouds an effective variance of around 0.05, which implies a narrower size distribution than typically assumed in satellite-based retrievals. For the case with continental clouds a broader size distribution (effective variance around 0.15) is obtained. This highlights the importance of appropriate size distribution assumptions and provides a way to improve the quality of cloud products in future climate data record releases.

TI  - Detection of mammagloblin by RT-PCR as a biomarker for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThis meta-analysis presents evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of mammaglobin detected using the RT-PCR technique, related to the presence of sentinel node metastasis in breast cancer patients.MethodsThe following databases were consulted: Cochrane, Lilacs, Scielo, Hinary, PubMed, Elsevier, Embase, ProQuest, the Universidad del Rosario's Centro de Recursos Para el Aprendizaje y la Investigacion (CRAI-UR) [ Resource Center for Learning and Research], and the Google Scholar search engine. The quality of the studies was assessed using the QUA-DAS-2 and CASpe tools. The selected studies presented the necessary data to calculate diagnostic validity index of mammaglobin detection using RT-PCR, compared with the reference standard test. Global values for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, probability ratios, diagnostic ORs, and summary ROC curves of this meta-analysis were obtained using the Meta-DiSc 1.4 program.ResultsInitially, 731 articles were obtained; but only 25 were included in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity was 84% (95% CI: 83%-86%), and specificity was 92% (95% CI: 91%-93%). Positive and negative predictive values were 9.26 (95% CI: 6.47-13.26) and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.13-0.23), respectively. The diagnostic OR was 66.34 (95% CI: 42.52-103.52). The predictive area under the sROC curve was 94.78 (Q = 0.8876).ConclusionsThe evaluated diagnostic index showed that the expression of the mammaglobin biomarker has diagnostic prediction for detecting lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients, when analyzed using RT-PCR, although more than 50% heterogeneity was found.

TI  - Evaluation of C-Band SAR for Identification of Flooded Vegetation in Emergency Response Products
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data set of the Peace Athabasca Delta, Alberta, was used to evaluate approaches to flooded vegetation mapping. A primary objective was to identify how to add a flooded vegetation layer to the Emergency Geomatics Service (EGS) SAR-derived flood products. Field data were used to identify non-flooded and flooded vegetation. A combination of statistical analyses and box plot visual inspection was used to evaluate the magnitude-only images, the polarimetric and compact polarimetric parameters/decompositions, and the coherence products for mapping flooded vegetation. This paper provides some background on the use of SAR for flood mapping, describes the data and processing methods, and presents the results of this comparison. To some degree all polarizations and techniques were effective for mapping flooded vegetation due to the increased backscatter intensity and the phase shift from the double bounce scattering. In particular, all polarization combinations, the HH/HV ratio, Shannon entropy, and the m-chi double bounce produce good separation. The water/vegetation interface remains coherent when flooded, also allowing flooded vegetation to be identified with seasonal coherence. These results demonstrate that the use of multi-mode RADARSAT Constellation Mission data for providing a flooded vegetation layer to EGS flood maps is possible.

TI  - Epidemiological, clinical and genotypic features of human Metapneumovirus in patients with influenza-like illness in Senegal, 2012 to 2016
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a causal agent of acute respiratory infection, especially in primarily children. At the clinical level, HMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years. Here, we carried out a retrospective pilot study, based on the processing of nasopharyngeal swabs, with a focus on the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of HMPV in Senegal.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016. Briefly, all outpatients presenting to healthcare sentinel sites were screened for surveillance enrollment and included if they met criteria for ILI. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible participants. For viral respiratory pathogens detection, including HMPV, the Anyplex (TM) II RV16 Detection kit was used. A fragment of the hMPV F gene was targeted for sequencing.Results: In total, 8209 patients with ILI were enrolled. Half of them (49.7%) were children under 5 years. Fever was the most common symptom followed by cough, and rhinitis. Three hundred eight patients were positive for HMPV (3.75%). 89 (28.9%) were detected as single infection. In co-infection cases, the most common co-infecting viruses were influenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus. HMPV detection rates in the different age groups varied significantly with the children under 5 years group accounting for 71.7% of positive patients. The temporal distribution pattern for HMPV infection showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher activity during the rainy period (July-September). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HMPV specimens circulating in Senegal were distributed into the two main genetic lineages, A and B. We also noted a co-circulation of both genetic lineages during the whole study period except in 2014.Conclusion: In summary, the present study characterized the recent prevalence, seasonality and genetic diversity of HMPV in a large outpatient population presented with ILI in Senegal between 2012 and 2016. Globally our results show a clear seasonal circulation pattern of HMPV in Senegal. Our findings identified children less than 5 years as more susceptible group to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating.

TI  - New insights in sources of the sub-micrometre aerosol at Mt. Zeppelin observatory (Spitsbergen) in the year 2015
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate the potential impact of the Arctic anthropogenic emission sources it is essential to understand better the natural aerosol sources of the inner Arctic and the atmospheric processing of the aerosols during their transport in the Arctic atmosphere. A 1-year time series of chemically specific measurements of the sub-micrometre aerosol during 2015 has been taken at the Mt. Zeppelin observatory in the European Arctic. A source apportionment study combined measured molecular tracers as source markers, positive matrix factorization, analysis of the potential source distribution and auxiliary information from satellite data and ground-based observations. The annual average sub-micrometre mass was apportioned to regional background secondary sulphate (56%), sea spray (17%), biomass burning (15%), secondary nitrate (5.8%), secondary marine biogenic (4.5%), mixed combustion (1.6%), and two types of marine gel sources (together 0.7%). Secondary nitrate aerosol mainly contributed towards the end of summer and during autumn. During spring and summer, the secondary marine biogenic factor reached a contribution of up to 50% in some samples. The most likely origin of the mixed combustion source is due to oil and gas extraction activities in Eastern Siberia. The two marine polymer gel sources predominantly occurred in autumn and winter. The small contribution of the marine gel sources at Mt. Zeppelin observatory in summer as opposed to regions closer to the North Pole is attributed to differences in ocean biology, vertical distribution of phytoplankton, and the earlier start of the summer season.

TI  - Effects of air pollution control policies on PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution improvement in China from 2005 to 2017: a satellite-based perspective
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effectiveness of air pollution control policies is important for future policy making. China has implemented strict air pollution control policies since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack of overall evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005-2013 from one of our previous studies. For the data of 2014-2017, we developed a two-stage statistical model to retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD), assimilated meteorology, and land use data. The first stage is a day-specific linear mixed effects (LME) model and the second stage is a generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and focused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5 reductions. The increasing trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and 3.14 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004-2007, p<0.005) were suppressed after 2007. The overall PM2.5 trend for all of China was -0.56 mu g m(-3) year(-1) with marginal significance (p = 0. 053) and PM2.5 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta region had a big drop (4.81 mu g m(-3) year(-1), p<0.001) in 2007-2010. The ECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically an extension of the 11th FYP policy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which comprises primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc. Since the ECER policy focused on single-pollutant control, it had shown great limitation for PM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5 concentrations did not decrease from 2010 to 2013 in polluted areas (p values of the trends were greater than 0.05). Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies: the 12th FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013. The goal of air quality improvement (especially PM2.5 concentration improvement) and measures for multi-pollutant control were proposed. These policies led to dramatic decreases in PM2.5 after 2013 (4.27 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China in 2013-2017, p<0.001).

TI  - Agricultural drought monitoring based on soil moisture derived from the optical trapezoid model in Mozambique
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) at three depths (15, 25, and 30 cm), derived from the optical trapezoidal model (OPTRAM), was used for multiyear, multisite monitoring of agricultural droughts over two agricultural crops (Maize and Soybean) in southern Mozambique. The OPTRAM was implemented using satellite data from Sentinel-2 and was validated against field SM assessed by gravimetric methods and by Watermark Sensors in sandy-soils with very low water holding capacity (0.13 cm(3)/cm(3)). The OPTRAM model estimated the SM at 15 and 25 cm yielding a R-2 >= 0.79 and RMSE <= 0.030 cm(3)/cm(3). The OPTRAM-derived SM was successfully used as input to compute and map the soil water deficit index, an indicator of agricultural drought. The results indicate that OPTRAM can provide useful information to improve water productivity in cropland under the specific conditions of Mozambique agricultural systems and for early warning systems development.

TI  - Selectively hampered activation of lymph node-resident dendritic cells precedes profound T cell suppression and metastatic spread in the breast cancer sentinel lymph node
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immune regulated pathways influence both breast cancer (BrC) development and response to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy. The sentinel lymph node (SLN), as the first metastatic site, is also the first site where BrC-induced suppression of immune effector subsets occurs. Since intricate knowledge of the phenotypic and functional status of these immune effector subsets is lacking, we set out to map the immune landscape of BrC SLN.Methods: Viable LN cells from BrC SLN (n = 58) were used for detailed flowcytometry-assisted mapping of the immune landscape of BrC SLN in a comparative analysis with healthy (i.e. prophylactic mastectomy-derived) axillary lymph nodes (HLN, n = 17). Findings were related to clinicopathological characteristics.Results: Our data show that BrC-induced immune suppression in tumor-involved SLN, as evidenced by increased Treg and MDSC rates as well as by a generalized state of T cell anergy, coincides with hampered activation of LN-resident (LNR) dendritic cell (DC) subsets rather than of migratory DC subsets. Importantly, suppression of these LN-resident DC subsets preceded profoundly disabled T cell effector functions in tumor-involved SLN. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the suppressed state of LNR-cDC is not only related to nodal involvement but is also related to high-risk breast cancer subtypes that lack expression of hormone receptors and may be a negative predictor of disease-free survival.Conclusion: These data thus provide new insights in the mechanisms underlying loco-regional immune suppression induced by BrC and how these relate to clinical outcome. They identify the LNR-cDC subset as a pivotal regulatory node in cellular immune suppressive pathways and therefore as a promising therapeutic target to combat immune suppression and secure the induction of effective antitumor immunity, e.g. in combination with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Wide-field auroral imager onboard the Fengyun satellite
T2  - LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly launched Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite carried a wide-field auroral imager (WAI) that was developed by Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP), which will provide a large field of view (FOV), high spatial resolution, and broadband ultraviolet images of the aurora and the ionosphere by imaging the N-2 LBH bands of emissions. The WAI consists of two identical cameras, each with an FOV of 68 degrees in the along-track direction and 10 degrees in the cross-track direction. The two cameras are tilted relative to each other to cover a fan-shaped field of size 130 degrees x 10 degrees. Each camera consists of an unobstructed four-mirror anastigmatic optical system, a BaF2 filter, and a photon-counting imaging detector. The spatial resolution of WAI is similar to 10 km at the nadir point at a reference height of 110 km above the Earth's surface. The sensitivity is >0.01 counts s(-1) Rayleigh(-1) pixel(-1) (140-180 nm) for both cameras, which is sufficient for mapping the boundaries and the fine structures of the auroral oval during storms/substorms. Based on the tests and calibrations that were conducted prior to launch, the data processing algorithm includes photon signal decoding, geometric distortion correction, photometric correction, flat-field correction, line-of-sight projection and correction, and normalization between the two cameras. Preliminarily processed images are compared with DMSP SSUSI images. The agreement between the images that were captured by two instruments demonstrates that the WAI and the data processing algorithm operate normally and can provide high-quality scientific data for future studies on auroral dynamics.

TI  - SFTGAN: a generative adversarial network for pan-sharpening equipped with spatial feature transform layers
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is an indispensable technology for remote sensing that aims to combine low-resolution multispectral images and high-resolution panchromatic images to create a multispectral image with high resolution. However, pan-sharpening approaches often encounter spectral distortion and detail distortion issues. In order to overcome the drawbacks of pan-sharpening methodologies, we propose an end-to-end pan-sharpening model consisting of an effective generative adversarial network architecture equipped with spatial feature transform layers that generate spatial detail features under spectral feature constraints. Through a large number of quantitative and visual assessments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Using MODIS estimates of fractional snow cover area to improve streamflow forecasts in interior Alaska
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed snow cover observations provide an opportunity to improve operational snowmelt and streamflow forecasting in remote regions. This is particularly true in Alaska, where remote basins and a spatially and temporally sparse gaging network plague efforts to understand and forecast the hydrology of subarctic boreal basins and where climate change is leading to rapid shifts in basin function. In this study, the operational framework employed by the United States (US) National Weather Service, including the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center, is adapted to integrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed observations of fractional snow cover area (fSCA) to determine if these data improve streamflow forecasts in interior Alaska river basins. Two versions of MODIS fSCA are tested against a base case extent of snow cover derived by aerial depletion curves: the MODIS 10A1 (MOD10A1) and the MODIS Snow Cover Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) product over the period 2000-2010. Observed runoff is compared to simulated runoff to calibrate both iterations of the model. MODIS-forced simulations have improved snow depletion timing compared with snow telemetry sites in the basins, with discernable increases in skill for the streamflow simulations. The MODSCAG fSCA version provides moderate increases in skill but is similar to the MOD10A1 results. The basins with the largest improvement in streamflow simulations have the sparsest streamflow observations. Considering the numerous low-quality gages (discontinuous, short, or unreliable) and ungauged systems throughout the high-latitude regions of the globe, this result is valuable and indicates the utility of the MODIS fSCA data in these regions. Additionally, while improvements in predicted discharge values are subtle, the snow model better represents the physical conditions of the snowpack and therefore provides more robust simulations, which are consistent with the US National Weather Service's move toward a physically based National Water Model. Physically based models may also be more capable of adapting to changing climates than statistical models corrected to past regimes. This work provides direction for both the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center and other forecast centers across the US to implement remote-sensing observations within their operational framework, to refine the representation of snow, and to improve streamflow forecasting skill in basins with few or poor-quality observations.

TI  - Current accounts of antimicrobial resistance: stabilisation, individualisation and antibiotics as infrastructure
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the latest issues to galvanise political and financial investment as an emerging global health threat. This paper explores the construction of AMR as a problem, following three lines of analysis. First, an examination of some of the ways in which AMR has become an object for action-through defining, counting and projecting it. Following Lakoff's work on emerging infectious diseases, the paper illustrates that while an 'actuarial' approach to AMR may be challenging to stabilise due to definitional and logistical issues, it has been successfully stabilised through a 'sentinel' approach that emphasises the threat of AMR. Second, the paper draws out a contrast between the way AMR is formulated in terms of a problem of connectedness-a 'One Health' issue-and the frequent solutions to AMR being focused on individual behaviour. The paper suggests that AMR presents an opportunity to take seriously connections, scale and systems but that this effort is undermined by the prevailing tendency to reduce health issues to matters for individual responsibility. Third, the paper takes AMR as a moment of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star) when antimicrobials and the work they do are rendered more visible. This leads to the proposal of antibiotics as infrastructure-part of the woodwork that we take for granted, and entangled with our ways of doing life, in particular modern life. These explorations render visible the ways social, economic and political frames continue to define AMR and how it may be acted upon, which opens up possibilities for reconfiguring AMR research and action.

TI  - Heterogeneous vegetation sensitivity at local and regional scales: Implications for pollen-based climate reconstruction
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation-climate relationships are often different at varying spatial scales, which is seldom taken into account in reconstructing past climate changes from fossil pollen spectra represent more local vegetation composition but using regional or extra-regional modern pollen-climate calibration set. In this paper, we employ 2620 surface pollen spectra and six pollen sequences from continental East Asia to reconstruct Holocene climate with modern analogue technique. A novel data set of vegetation sensitivity index (VSI) is introduced to examine vegetation-climate relationships in 0.5 degrees search windows around the fossil sites (local) and in the tailored calibration sets (regional). Then, we compare them to the explanatory abilities of (reconstructed) climate variables on explaining the pollen variance in calibration sets and in the fossil pollen data sets using constrained ordination, cross-validation and significance test. By this procedure that we called local-regional-fossil comparison, we can better determine which variable reconstruction is valid and useful. In our cases, moisture variable reconstructions in temperate forest-steppe ecotone at the East Asian summer monsoon margin are reliable. Consistent Holocene moisture variations with a strong monsoon influence during 8.6-4.0 cal ka BP which can help us to better interpret human adaptations along the Great Wall. However, quantitative climate reconstructions at some sites are less reliable due to highly heterogeneous vegetation sensitivities surrounding the site, particularly for areas with complicated topographical contexts. We stress that vegetation sensitivities at local and regional scales both need to be investigated before conducting quantitative climate reconstruction.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial pattern of annual urban growth by using time series Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies of urbanization have largely focused on the irreversible urban growth process and the conversion of non-urban lands into impervious surfaces, but less on the conversion from impervious surfaces to green space, also referred to as deurbanization. However, urbanization and deurbanization are both typical urban renewal process, which may happen simultaneously during the urban renewal. In this study, we proposed a new method to retrieve and map annual impervious surface percentage (ISP) and to characterize urban growth patterns using time series medium-resolution images. The method is implemented by employing the Cubist tree model for annual ISP inversion (AoCubist), optimizing multi-temporal Landsat composite images to minimize the impact of phenology and inter-year climate variation, and developing the C5.0 decision tree algorithm with temporal-spatial filtering rules to improve the space-time continuity and separability of patterns derived by unsupervised K-means classification. The method was applied to investigate the urban renewal in Guangzhou, China, between 2000 and 2010. The results demonstrate that the use of ISP slope series can capture the spatial variations and temporal trends of urban growth. Validation by fieldwork and comparing with Google Earth imagery indicates that our classification yielded a reasonable overall accuracy, ranging from 88.32% to 90.85%. Annual urban expansion rate remained between 4% and 10%, while annual deurbanization rate varied from 1% to 5%. In addition, the total pixels of rapid deurbanization surpassed that of rapid urban expansion. This finding suggests that various change directions occurred in the urban renewal process and that deurbanization was a way to counter-balance the rapid urbanization. This study provides a solid methodology for ISP change detection and fresh insight into the characteristics of urban growth in terms of timing, duration, and magnitude. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evapotranspiration evaluation models based on machine learning algorithms-A comparative study
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The constant need to increase agricultural production, together with the more and more frequent drought events in many areas of the world, requires a more careful assessment of irrigation needs and, therefore, a more accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration. In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets.Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate.The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results. Model 2, which adds the wind speed to the input variables of Model 3, has provided results that are absolutely comparable to those of Model 3 itself.

TI  - Grassland production in response to changes in biological metrics over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A clear interannual variability in annual production of grasslands (termed AEVI) has been reported over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but the underlying mechanism has not been fully understood. Here, we explained the interannual variability of AEVI during 2001-2015 by two phenological metrics (the start and end of the growing season, termed SOS and EOS, respectively) and one physiological metric (the maximum capacity of canopy light absorbance, termed MEVI) using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data over the TP. The results showed that the interannual variability of AEVI can be well attributed to not only the trends of, but also the sensitivities of AEVI to, the selected biological metrics. On the one hand, the advancing SOS and delaying EOS dominated the study area while both increased and decreased MEVI were observed. On the other hand, the AEVI responded negatively to the SOS and positively to the EOS and MEVI, exhibiting significant variations along the temperature and precipitation gradients. Hence, the current interannual variability of SOS and EOS mainly increased the AEVI; meanwhile, both enhancement and suppression of the interannual variability of MEVI to the AEVI were widespread over the TP. Overall, the interannual variability of MEVI mostly contributed to that of the AEVI, indicating a dominant role of the physiological metric rather than phenological metrics in carbon gain of TP grasslands. The achievements of this study are helpful to understand the underlying biological causes of the interannual variability of grassland production over the TP. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Bovine respiratory syncytial virus in experimentally exposed and rechallenged calves; viral shedding related to clinical signs and the potential for transmission
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important respiratory pathogen worldwide, detrimentally affecting the economy and animal welfare. To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated.A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six naive calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two naive calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA.ResultsAll the EG calves seroconverted and showed clinical signs of respiratory disease. Viral RNA was detected from days 1-27 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease.ConclusionViral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from the calves up to four weeks after exposure. The detection and amount of viral RNA corresponded well with the degree of respiratory signs. The calves were shedding infective virions for a considerable shorter period, and naive calves introduced after four weeks were not infected. Infected calves were protected from reinfection for at least seven weeks. This knowledge is useful to prevent spread of BRSV.

TI  - The unintended consequence of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> regulations over China: increase of ammonia levels and impact on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution reaching hazardous levels in many Chinese cities has been a major concern in China over the past decades. New policies have been applied to regulate anthropogenic pollutant emissions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and in particulate matter (PM) production. Increasing levels of atmospheric ammonia columns have been observed by satellite during recent years. In particular, observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) reveal an increase of these columns by 15 % and 65 % from 2011 to 2013 and 2015, respectively, over eastern China. In this paper we performed model simulations for 2011, 2013 and 2015 in order to understand the origin of this increase and to quantify the link between ammonia and the inorganic components of particles: NH4(P)+/SO4(p)2-/NO3(p)-. Interannual change of meteorology 3 can be excluded as a reason: year 2015 meteorology leads to enhanced sulfate production over eastern China, which increases the ammonium and decreases the ammonia content, which is contrary to satellite observations. Reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from 2011 to 2015 of 37.5 % and 21 % respectively, as constrained from satellite data, lead to decreased inorganic matter (by 14 % for NH4(P)+/SO4(p)2-/NO3(p)-). This in turn leads to increased 4(p) P gaseous NH3(g) tropospheric columns by as much as 24 % and 49 % (sampled corresponding to IASI data availability) from 2011 to 2013 and 2015 respectively and thus can explain most of the observed increase.

TI  - Religious Unbelief in Three Western European Countries: Identifying and Characterizing Unbeliever Types Using Latent Class Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The different forms of religious unbelief are still much of an open question. Using data (N = 4,404) from three European countries-Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands-we sought to identify underlying unbeliever groups among those with the strongest disbelief in God (N = 2,258). Latent class analyses were conducted on the nontheistic supernatural beliefs of this subsection of participants, resulting in the same three unbeliever groups in each country: analytic atheists, spiritual but not religious (SBNR), and uncertain nonbelievers. Next, we explored these groups on a variety of dimensions, especially on the group members' attitudes to religion, certainty of beliefs, cognitive dispositions, and worldview. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed similarities as well as distinct characters for each of the latent groups. The groups differed most in intuitive thinking style, overmentalizing bias, and other ontological confusions. To compare the latent groups to all other individuals who took part in the study, two discriminant analyses were run with all participants. This resulted in four meaningful dimensions that supported and extended the ANOVAs findings and allowed for the consideration of other (non)believers. Overall, this study supports earlier findings on analytic atheists and SBNR while providing new information about their dispositions. Of interest, the uncertain nonbeliever group has been largely unexplored previously, and it should gain more attention in future studies.

TI  - Variability of temperature and ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere from multi-satellite observations and reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature and ozone changes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) are important components of climate change. In this paper, variability and trends of temperature and ozone in the UTLS are investigated for the period 2002-2017 using high-quality, high vertical resolution Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS RO) data and improved merged satellite data sets. As part of the Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S -RIP), three reanalysis data sets, including the ERA-I, MERRA2 and the recently released ERAS, are evaluated for their representation of temperature and ozone in the UTLS. The recent temperature and ozone trends are updated with a multiple linear regression (MLR) method and related to sea surface temperature (SST) changes based on model simulations made with NCAR's Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM).All reanalysis temperatures show good agreement with the GNSS RO measurements in both absolute value and annual cycle. Interannual variations in temperature related to Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) processes are well represented by all reanalyses. However, evident biases can be seen in reanalyses for the linear trends of temperature since they are affected by discontinuities in assimilated observations and methods. Such biases can be corrected and the estimated trends can be significantly improved. ERAS is significantly improved compared to ERA-I and shows the best agreement with the GNSS RO temperature.The MLR results indicate a significant warming of 0.2-0.3 K per decade in most areas of the troposphere, with a stronger increase of 0.4-0.5 K per decade at midlatitudes of both hemispheres. In contrast, the stratospheric temperature decreases at a rate of 0.1-0.3 K per decade, which is most significant in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Positive temperature trends of 0.1-0.3 K per decade are seen in the tropical lower stratosphere (100-50 hPa). Negative trends of ozone are found in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) at 150-50 hPa, while positive trends are evident in the tropical lower stratosphere. Asymmetric trends of ozone can be found in the midlatitudes of two hemispheres in the middle stratosphere, with significant ozone decrease in the NH and increase in ozone in the SH. Large biases exist in reanalyses, and it is still challenging to do trend analysis based on reanalysis ozone data.According to single-factor-controlled model simulations with WACCM, the temperature increase in the troposphere and the ozone decrease in the NH stratosphere are mainly connected to the increase in SST and subsequent changes of atmospheric circulations. Both the increase in SSTs and the decrease in ozone in the NH contribute to the temperature decrease in the NH stratosphere. The increase in temperature in the lower stratospheric tropics may be related to an increase in ozone in that region, while warming SSTs contribute to a cooling in that area.

TI  - Optimizing cropping area by proposing a combined water-energy productivity function for Neyshabur Basin, Iran
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is a major challenge facing semi-arid and arid regions of the world, where groundwater is the primary source of irrigation water. Conversion of some agricultural land to fallow land is one of the possible solutions to reduce the groundwater withdrawal to bring it to safe yield. Such a solution has a negative economic impact. In this study, we have developed an optimization approach that can use used to identify the size (and type) of the agricultural area to be fallowed to ensure sustainable groundwater use for irrigation with as little economic impact as possible. This approach is based on the concept of profit productivity, which relies on Landsat imageries to calculate crop yield and irrigation water withdrawal, and available in-situ data to calculate energy cost. We have applied this approach to the Neyshabour basin in Iran that has been experiencing unsustainable groundwater withdrawal for the last 30 years. Our sample results indicate that in order to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal with minimum economic impact, 4% of the agricultural land needs to be converted to fallow land by fallowing most of the agricultural land used for growing tomatoes.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration of pistachio crop based on SEBAL algorithm using Landsat 8 satellite imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Stationary actual evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods deal with some issues such as maintenance problems, the point data recording for a particular location, the complex hydrological process calculation, and requiring the expert workers. To solve this, ET estimation methods like Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) method can be used based on the satellite images. However, the efficiency of the SEBAL model varies in ET estimation for different products and environmental conditions. On the other hand, pistachio is an important crop of Iran which little investigation were accomplished to estimate its ET using the presented models. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of SEBAL algorithm in estimating ET of pistachio crop. In this regard, actual ET of a 100 hectares pistachio farm, located in Safaeieh region in the Semnan province, Iran, was selected as the study area. Implementations were performed using 29 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images during the 2013-2017 period. The results were verified and compared with the results of evapotranspiration in standard condition estimated by the Intelligent Meteorological instrument (iMetos-Pessl) as the ground truth. The results of this study indicate the determination coefficient and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimated actual ET for pistachio plant as 0.8 and 2.5 mm, respectively. Moreover, the results indicate the high spatial variability of ET in the pistachio growth period and the need to use a satellite data analysis method, like the SEBAL method, to prepare the ET map. Overall, the results show the good efficiency of the SEBAL model for estimating the actual ET of the pistachio product.

TI  - Batch-processing of AquaCrop plug-in for rainfed maize using satellite derived Fractional Vegetation Cover data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coupling crop growth models and remote sensing data has shown great potential to improve crop yield and biomass forecasting. However, few such applications are used at field level. In this study, the plug-in version of AquaCrop, a water driven model initially designed for conditions in which water is the limiting factor in crop production, was adapted to assess maize in Belgium. Field campaigns were organised in 2015, 2016 and 2017, during which ground measurements were collected. At field level and under rainfed conditions, above ground total dry biomass and field management information (crop density, planting dates, biomass measurements etc.) was collected. Green fractional vegetation cover (fCover) data were retrieved from high spatial and temporal satellite images (DMC-2/ DEIMOS-1 and Sentinel-2). Maximum canopy cover and emergence date were derived from the time series and assimilated into AquaCrop. The model was calibrated with the 2015-2016 dataset and validated with 2017 data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the biomass assessment was 0.7 ton/ha and the R-2 reached 0.85. The R-2 between the canopy cover simulated by the model and the remotely sensed fCover ranged from 0.76-0.98 in most of the cases. To simultaneously run and evaluate the ensemble of field-level simulations, a semi-automated R-environment was developed. This robust and automated approach offers vast potential for large-scale field-level yield assessments for temperate as well as tropical conditions.

TI  - Quantifying increased groundwater demand from prolonged drought in the East African Rift Valley
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of people in the arid regions of Kenya and Ethiopia face water scarcity and frequent drought. Water resource forecasting and reliable operation of groundwater distribution systems may improve drought resilience. In this study, we examined three remote sensing data sets against in-situ sensor-collected groundwater extraction data from 221 water points serving over 1.34 million people across northern Kenya and Afar, Ethiopia between January 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. In models containing rainfall as a binary variable, we observed an overall 23% increase in borehole runtime following weeks with no rainfall compared to weeks preceded by some rainfall. Further, a 1 mm increase in rainfall was associated with a 1% decrease in borehole use the following week. When surface water availability is reduced during the dry seasons, groundwater demand increases. Our findings emphasize the imperative to maintain functionality of groundwater boreholes in these regions which often suffer drought related emergencies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Haze, especially PM2.5, poses a serious threat to public health in China. PM2.5 primarily originates from urban activities, and built environment may affect its formation and dispersion. Previous studies were based on limited data from ground-monitoring stations, and high resolution pollution maps are unavailable for statistical analyses. In this study, a 1 km*1 km wall-to-wall map of PM2.5 concentration is developed with remote sensing data in Wuhan, China, and spatial statistics are used to figure out the influence of the built environment on PM2.5 concentrations. In terms of land cover, high-rise high-density building areas have the largest impact on PM2.5 concentrations, and the effect of forestland on the concentrations is not obvious in winter. In terms of land use, industrial lands are unrelated to air pollution in the downtown, while transportation has become a main source of PM2.5 pollution. In terms of urban form, floor area ratio and building density are positively associated with PM2.5 concentrations, and different types of road densities have different effects on air pollution. Finally, the implications of the study for urban planning and development are given. It is necessary to develop a polycentric urban structure to balance high population density and reduce traffic emissions in downtown areas. Road and bus networks should be optimized simultaneously to reduce traffic emissions and "small blocks and narrow roads" may be considered as an alternative for urban development. The spatial morphology of streets and buildings should be considered during urban design and urban renewal. In general, the study contributes to the application of remote sensing in urban planning and development, and remotely sensed PM2.5 concentration data could provide further findings than the air pollution data obtained from ground monitoring and "bottom-up" models in past studies.

TI  - Analysis of the temporal-spatial changes in surface radiation budget over the Antarctic sea ice region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface radiation budget (SRB) of the Antarctic sea ice region (ASIR) is important for the climate change in Antarctica, which partly explains the global warming. Long-term (1982-2015) satellite-derived (EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring, CLARA-A2) and reanalysis (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ERA-Interim) datasets provided high qualify and global coverage surface radiation products, which enabled us to quantify the SRB of the ASIR and widen our understanding of the polar climate. The downwelling longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiation from the two datasets were validated at two Baseline Surface Radiation Network Stations (i.e., Neumayer and Syowa). Cloud LW emission dominated over cloud SW reflection and absorption due to high-albedo over the sea ice surface, thereby leading to a positive all wave cloud radiative forcing (CRF) within 0-100 W m(-2). This result indicated a warming effect. on the surface of the ASIR, except during the austral summer. Compared with the all sky, substantial solar radiation was absorbed by the surface which under the clear sky will result in the increasing of temperature and sea ice melting during the austral summer; hence, the SW CRF had a major influence on all-wave CRF and caused more than -150 W m(-2) of cooling near the edge of the sea ice. The summer averages of all-wave CRF over the ASIR surface were -43.02 and -35.74 W m(-2) for the ERA-Interim and CLARA-A2 datasets, respectively. Contrary to the effect of CRF, the surface net LW radiation (LWnet) exhibited a cooling effect over the ASIR surface throughout the year and peaks at -47.21 W m(-2) for CLARA-A2 dataset in December. Meanwhile, a warming effect was caused by the surface net SW radiation (SWnet) peaks at 101.52 and 104.09 W m(-2) for the ERA-Interim and CLARA-A2 datasets, respectively. In summer, the warming effect caused by the surface net all-wave radiation in East Antarctica was deeper than that in West Antarctica. The time series and trend analysis showed that the surface net radiation and CRF over the entire ASIR basically exhibited a decreasing trend. The descending speed of SWnet (-3.652 W m(-2) decade(-1)) about five times faster than that of LWnet (-0.722 W m(-2) decade(-1)). Although a significant trough appeared in 1993/1994 of the time series curves of All-wave CRF, it had a deeply negative trend with about -3.443 W m(-2) decade(-1). Detailed analysis on the five longitudinal sectors around Antarctica (the Weddell Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Ross Sea, and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea) can further help us understand the SRB of the ASIR.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation over flat lands in the Argentinian Pampas region using Sentinel-1A data and non-parametric methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A procedure for soil moisture (SM) estimation over flat lands in the Argentinian Pampas region, using the water balance equation that considers SM to be the result of water inflows and outflows to the soil system, is presented. In recent years, remotely sensed data with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and radiometer sensors have been used to develop different methodologies to obtain SM maps. Thus, a variety of methodologies with different levels of complexity are available nowadays. These models require soil information such as soil physical properties and mineral composition, not readily available in Argentina and many other remote areas of the world. The procedure presented in this paper takes into account water input and output processes of the soil system and represents them with different hydro-environmental variables and SAR data. The water balance equation was solved with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) statistical models, fed with readily available data over Comisio In Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE) core site located in Cordoba province, Argentina. The resulting models were obtained with precipitation (PP), air temperature () and relative humidity (RH) observations and with SAR data from the Sentinel-1A satellite mission. The accuracy of the model estimates represents 10 of the observed measured values of SM and is in line with state of the art algorithms. Results suggest that any model can be used with similar precision, since they show similar errors, although the MLR method allows analyzing and quantifying the errors introduced by the variables.

TI  - Detection of algal blooms over optically complex waters of the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman using MODIS fluorescence data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman are two of the most complex and turbid ecosystems in the world where algal blooms frequently occur. The conventional blue/green band ratio shows low performance to detect these algal batches in this region due to the effect of the non-algal parameters, shallow water depth, and atmospheric aerosols. Thus, an attempt to use MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) fluorescence for the detection of algal blooms in this region have been undertaken using in situ measurements (Chlorophyll a: Chl-a, coloured dissolved organic matters: CDOM, Secchi disk depth: SDD, and radiometric) collected in 2006, 2013, and 2014, and MODIS satellite images. MODIS fluorescence line height (FLH in W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) data showed low correlation (coefficient of determination: R-2 similar to 0.46) with near-concurrent in situ Chl-a (mg m(-3)). This disparity is caused by the effect of the suspended sediments (SDD), CDOM (2 mg m(-3)), and bottom reflectance (water depth: WD) parameters, where an increase of 1% in their magnitudes can cause a respective change of 13.4%, -0.8% or 6%, and 1.4% in the FLH. In this work, the positions of the FLH bands have been relocated to include 645 nm to reduce the effect of these parameters on Chl-a, which has improved the performance to R-2 of 0.76. This modified FLH (MFLH) model was found to perform well in the Arabian Gulf where the estimated bias, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination are, respectively, 0.03, 1.06, and 0.76. High values of MFLH are indicating the areas of the algal blooms, while no overestimation was observed in the mixed pixel coastal areas. This result is explained by less sensitivity of this model to the non-algal particles, shallow water, and aerosols.

TI  - Proof of concept of a novel cloud computing approach for object-based remote sensing data analysis and classification
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in the development of Earth observation data acquisition systems have led to the continuously growing production of remote sensing datasets, for which timely analysis has become a major challenge. In this context, distributed computing technology can provide support for efficiently handling large amounts of data. Moreover, the use of distributed computing techniques, once restricted by the availability of physical computer clusters, is currently widespread due to the increasing offer of cloud computing infrastructure services. In this work, we introduce a cloud computing approach for object-based image analysis and classification of arbitrarily large remote sensing datasets. The approach is an original combination of different distributed methods which enables exploiting machine learning methods in the creation of classification models, through the use of a web-based notebook system. A prototype of the proposed approach was implemented with the methods available in the InterCloud system integrated with the Apache Zeppelin notebook system, for collaborative data analysis and visualization. In this implementation, the Apache Zeppelin system provided the means for using the scikit-learn Python machine learning library in the design of a classification model. In this work we also evaluated the approach with an object-based image land-cover classification of a GeoEye-1 scene, using resources from a commercial cloud computing infrastructure service provided. The obtained results showed the effectiveness of the approach in efficiently handling a large data volume in a scalable way, in terms of the number of allocated computing resources.

TI  - Vicarious calibration of GOCI for the SeaDAS ocean color retrieval
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A key on-orbit calibration step for satellite remote sensing of ocean color is the vicarious calibration. This establishes the final gains for each spectral band on the sensor that minimize bias in the retrieved ocean color signal. The vicarious calibration is specific to the instrument and the atmospheric correction algorithm. The vicarious calibration gains for the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) are presented here, which were derived to optimize the performance of NASA's standard atmospheric correction algorithm as implemented in the l2gen code and distributed through the SeaDAS open-source software package. Following NASA's protocols, the near-infrared (NIR) bands were calibrated first, and the visible bands were then calibrated relative to this fixed NIR calibration. The gain for the 745-nm NIR band was derived using a fixed aerosol model, which was chosen based on the Angstrom Coefficients derived from MODIS on Aqua (MODISA). For the vicarious gains of the visible bands, two sources for the target water-leaving radiances were tested: matchups from MODISA and climatological data from SeaWiFS. A validation analysis using AERONET-OC data shows an improvement in sensor performance when compared with results using the current vicarious gains and results using no vicarious calibration. Good agreement was found in vicarious gains derived using both concurrent MODISA and climatological SeaWiFS as vicarious calibration data sources. These results support the use of a concurrent sensor for the vicarious calibration when in situ data are not available and demonstrate that using climatology from a well-calibrated sensor like SeaWiFS for the vicarious calibration is a valid alternative when it is not possible to use a concurrent sensor or in situ data. We recommend using the gains derived from concurrent GOCI matchups with MODISA for GOCI processing in SeaDAS/l2gen.

TI  - Leaf to canopy upscaling approach affects the estimation of canopy traits
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing applications, leaf traits are often upscaled to canopy level using sunlit leaf samples collected from the upper canopy. The implicit assumption is that the top of canopy foliage material dominates canopy reflectance and the variability in leaf traits across the canopy is very small. However, the effect of different approaches of upscaling leaf traits to canopy level on model performance and estimation accuracy remains poorly understood. This is especially important in short or sparse canopies where foliage material from the lower canopy potentially contributes to the canopy reflectance. The principal aim of this study is to examine the effect of different approaches when upscaling leaf traits to canopy level on model performance and estimation accuracy using spectral measurements (in-situ canopy hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data) in short woody vegetation. To achieve this, we measured foliar nitrogen (N), leaf mass per area (LMA), foliar chlorophyll and carbon together with leaf area index (LAI) at three vertical canopy layers (lower, middle and upper) along the plant stem in a controlled laboratory environment. We then upscaled the leaf traits to canopy level by multiplying leaf traits by LAI based on different combinations of the three canopy layers. Concurrently, in-situ canopy reflectance was measured using an ASD FieldSpec-3 Pro FR spectrometer, and the canopy traits were related to in-situ spectral measurements using partial least square regression (PLSR). The PLSR models were cross-validated based on repeated k-fold, and the normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE(cv)) obtained from each upscaling approach were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Results of the study showed that leaf-to-canopy upscaling approaches that consider the contribution of leaf traits from the exposed upper canopy layer together with the shaded middle canopy layer yield significantly (p < 0.05) lower error (nRMSE(cv) < 0.2 for canopy N, LMA and carbon) as well as high explained variance (R-2 > 0.71) for both in-situ hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data. The widely-used upscaling approach that considers only leaf traits from the upper illuminated canopy layer yielded a relatively high error (nRMSE(cv)>0.2) and lower explained variance (R-2 < 0.71) for canopy N, LMA and carbon. In contrast, canopy chlorophyll upscaled based on leaf samples collected from the upper canopy and total canopy LAI exhibited a more accurate relationship with spectral measurements compared with other upscaling approaches. Results of this study demonstrate that leaf to canopy upscaling approaches have a profound effect on canopy traits estimation for both in-situ hyperspectral measurements and simulated Sentinel-2 data in short woody vegetation. These findings have implications for field sampling protocols of leaf traits measurement as well as upscaling leaf traits to canopy level especially in short and less foliated vegetation where leaves from the lower canopy contribute to the canopy reflectance.

TI  - Spatial and temporal characteristics and removal methodology of suspended particulate matter speckles from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reviewing six years of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration images from 2011 to 2016 revealed unexpected and some enormously high or low values. These speckles are randomly scattered throughout the entire study area or congregated at a certain part, which has strongly restricted the scientific applications of GOCI data thus far. They can be classified into four types: isolated, near-cloud, patch-type, and slot-related speckles, based on spatial distribution and potential causes. These types are investigated. The speckles are induced by a moving-cloud during a complete observation of 8 bands for each slot of GOCI, partly by an incomplete cloud masking procedure near cloud edges, by relatively low reflectance of pixels corresponding to a cloud shadow, by imperfect atmospheric corrections related to water vapor after cloud passage, or by sensor-related troubles related to the effects of stray light. Spatial and temporal variabilities of the identified speckles are investigated and used to develop a methodology for their removal. The SPM concentration values of the error-free pixels, passing through the post-processing of the speckle removal procedure, are compared to those previously with speckles. As a result, the enormously large values of SPM, occupying 6.06% of the pixel numbers, are all eliminated. Typical seasonality of SPM, unrevealed using the speckled images, is clearly presented through the removal procedure. This study addresses the importance of preprocessing for speckle error in SPM concentrations from GOCI data and implies more reliable SPM data without speckles can be used in scientific application research.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground vegetation biomass based on Landsat-8 OLI satellite images in the Guanzhong Basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) through the selection of different estimation methods based on numerous vegetation types (i.e., broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, shrub and grassland) at a regional scale. The proposed method is based on three models, namely, the stepwise regression, an improved back-propagation neural network (Improved BBPNN) model based on the Gaussian error function, and the support vector machine (SVM) technique, Meanwhile, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) image data and geo-parameters are employed to select 68 feature variables and optimize 213 data samples. Our results reveal that, the stepwise regression method provides the best AGB estimation performance for broadleaf forests and coniferous forests, while the SVM technique shows the best performance for grasslands and shrubs. Different vegetation types should be selected for additional biomass estimation models that have been proven to enhance the biomass estimation. This study on the AGB not only promotes research on the net primary productivity (NPP), but also plays a key role in global carbon cycle research.

TI  - Monitoring surface changes in discontinuous permafrost terrain using small baseline SAR interferometry, object-based classification, and geological features: a case study from Mayo, Yukon Territory, Canada
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost-induced deformation of ground features is threating infrastructure in northern communities. An understanding of permafrost distribution is therefore critical for sustainable adaptation planning and infrastructure maintenance. Considering the large area underlain by permafrost in the Yukon Territory, there is a need for baseline information to characterize the permafrost in this region. In this study, the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique was used to identify areas of ground movement likely caused by changes in permafrost. The DInSAR technique was applied to a series of repeat-pass C-band RADARSAT-2 observations collected in 2015 over the Village of Mayo, in central Yukon Territory, Canada. The conventional DInSAR technique demonstrated that ground deformation could be detected in this area, but the resulting deformation maps contained errors due to a loss of coherence from changes in vegetation and atmospheric phase delay. To address these limitations, the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR technique was applied to reduce phase error, thus improving the deformation maps. To understand the relationship between the deformation maps and land cover types, an object-based Random Forest classification was developed to classify the study area into different land cover types. Integration of the InSAR results and the classification map revealed that the built-up class (e.g., airport) was affected by subsidence on the order of -2 to -4 cm. The spatial extent of the surface displacement map obtained using the SBAS InSAR technique was then correlated with the surficial geology map. This revealed that much of the main infrastructure in the Village of Mayo is underlain by interbedded glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine sediments, the latter of which caused the most damage to human made structures. This study provides a method for permafrost monitoring that builds upon the synergistic use of the SBAS InSAR technique, object-based image analysis, and surficial geology data.

TI  - A quad polarimetric SAR calibration algorithm using rotation symmetry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric calibration, precisely deciphering the polarimetric information hidden in the polarized characteristics of a radar scene, is the core step before applying quad polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for ground parameter inversion and classification. The previously published techniques for polarimetric calibration generally use at least one known point calibration target to completely determine the polarimetric distortions (cross-talks and channel imbalances) between the various polarized channels. This paper describes a novel method that solely relies on the image itself with the property of rotation symmetry. The algorithm derives the entire cross-talk and channel imbalance parameters using an iterative operation to circularly modify the observed average covariance matrix, which is independent on the known point calibration targets in the illuminated scene. The proposed method is validated to be reliable and efficient through polarimetric calibration experiments using the airborne C-band and RadarSat-2 quad polarimetric SAR images. The experimental results indicate that the new technique achieves similar calibration precision to the Ainsworth algorithm but without using any known calibration point target.

TI  - NDVI dynamics as reflected in climatic variables: spatial and temporal trends - a case study of Hungary
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climate change and revealing its future paths on a local level is a great challenge for the future. Beside the expanding sets of available climatic data, satellite images provide a valuable source of information. In our study we aimed to reveal whether satellite data are an appropriate way to identify global trends, given their shorter available time range. We used the CARPATCLIM (CC) database (1961-2010) and the MODIS NDVI images (2000-2016) and evaluated the time period covered by both (2000-2010). We performed a regression analysis between the NDVI and CC variables, and a time series analysis for the 1961-2008 and 2000-2008 periods at all data points. The results justified the belief that maximum temperature (TMAX), potential evapotranspiration and aridity all have a strong correlation with the NDVI; furthermore, the short period trend of TMAX can be described with a functional connection with its long period trend. Consequently, TMAX is an appropriate tool as an explanatory variable for NDVI spatial and temporal variance. Spatial pattern analysis revealed that with regression coefficients, macro-regions reflected topography (plains, hills and mountains), while in the case of time series regression slopes, it justified a decreasing trend from western areas (Transdanubia) to eastern ones (The Great Hungarian Plain). This is an important consideration for future agricultural and land use planning; i.e. that western areas have to allow for greater effects of climate change.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing could be the most effective means for scaling up grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) from the sample scale to the regional scale. Remote sensing approaches using statistical models based on vegetation indexes (VIs) are frequently used because of their simplicity and reliability. And many researchers have already proven the method is scientific, feasible, and can bring relatively better effects in practice. However, the only deficiency of the method has been criticized because of the uncertainties introduced by saturation of spectral reflectance at high-density vegetation levels and the soil surface at low-density vegetation levels. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve grassland AGB estimates by using modified VIs (MVIs) to minimize the influence of the soil background. The field study was conducted in the Chen Barag Banner, the Ewenkizu Banner, and the Xin Barag Left Banner in the Hulun Buir Grassland, Inner Mongolia, northern China. Field plots were photographed and AGB samples were collected during field sampling. Remote sensing data were obtained from MOD09A1 (TERRA satellite). Four MVIs were first calculated based on the corresponding VI: the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), and the Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), by improving estimates of vegetation cover (VC). Then, MVIs, i.e., MRVI, MDVI, MNDVI, and MMSAVI, were regressed with the sample-scale AGB using an exponential function, a linear function, a logarithmic function, and a power function. When the accuracy of the models was tested by comparing root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE), and coefficient of determination (R-2), the results demonstrated that MVI-AGB models performed better than the VI-AGB models. The logarithmic MNDVI-AGB model was the best of the regression functions. This model gave the best estimates of AGB from remote sensing data, compared with the values measured in field analyses. Our proposed method provides a new way to estimate regional grassland AGB and will be useful to analyze ecosystem responses under climate change.

TI  - Dock extraction from China's Gaofen-2 multispectral imagery based on region-line primitive association analyses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the mainstream technique for the analysis of high-spatial-resolution (HSR) images. However, routine OBIAs often follow a region-based technical framework, which limits their performance in remote sensing information extraction. In this study, a more flexible OBIA technical framework and methods are designed to extract a man-made object, i.e., docks, from HSR images. The proposed method includes the following steps. 1) Waters are extracted by object-based land/water classification, and buffer zones around the shorelines are built to limit the dock searching. 2) Edge line primitives (ELPs) for dock extraction are obtained from the shorelines by edge scanning and are closed into region primitives (RPs) for region-based OBIA. 3) Straight line primitives (SLPs) in contact with the RPs are extracted and spatial relationships between the RPs and SLPs are built based on the region-line primitive association framework (RLPAF). 4) Docks are then detected and refined by RLPAF features. Different with routine OBIAs, RPs are not simply obtained by image segmentation. The proposed line-to-region conversion prevents the influence of segmentation errors and imprecise segment boundaries and makes RPs accurate in morphology. In addition, synergetic analyses involving multiple region and line primitives make a flexible OBIA and improve its performance. The proposed method is tested using China's Gaofen-2 multispectral images with spatial resolution of 4 m, and compared with the results obtained with eCognition's rule-based classification. Experiments show that the proposed method can extract docks from HSR images with much better accuracy than routine OBIAs. In the three experimental areas, accuracy measures such as precision, recall, F-measure and boundary recall are more than 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.85, respectively.

TI  - Statistical analysis of surface urban heat island intensity variations: A case study of Babol city, Iran
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island is considered as one of the most important climate change phenomena in urban areas, which can result in remarkable negative effects on flora, concentration of pollutants, air quality, energy and water consumption, human health, ecological and economic impacts, and even on global warming. The variation analysis of the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) is important for understanding the effect of urbanization and urban planning. The objective of this study was to present a new strategy based on the Shannon's entropy and Pearson chi-square statistic to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the SUHII. In this study, Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI and TIRS images, MODIS products, meteorological data, topographic and population maps of the Babol city, Iran, from 1985 to 2017, and air temperature data recorded by ground recorder devices in 2017 were used. First, Single-Channel algorithm was used to estimate land surface temperature (LST), and the maximum likelihood classifier was employed to classify Landsat images. Then, based on LST maps, surface urban heat island ratio index was employed to calculate the SUHII. Further, several statistical methods, such as the degree-of-freedom, degree-of-sprawl and degree-of-goodness, were used to analyse the SUHII variation along different geographic directions and in various time periods. Finally, correlation between various parameters such as air temperature, SUHII, population variation and degree-of-goodness index values were investigated. The results indicated that the SUHII value increased by 24% in Babol over different time periods. The correlation coefficient yielded 0.82 between the values of the difference between the mean air temperature of the urban and suburbs and the SUHII values for the geographic directions. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the population variation and the degree-of-goodness index values reached 0.8. The results suggested that the SUHII variation of Babol city had a high degree-of-freedom, high degree-of-sprawl and negative degree-of-goodness.

TI  - Projecting future land use/land cover by integrating drivers and plan prescriptions: the case for watershed applications
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed planning is a pivotal exercise for all jurisdictions irrespective of size, landscape complexity, or other nuances. As a result of the intricate relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and water resources, it becomes prudent to not only develop historical and contemporary LULC data for watershed planning purposes, but more importantly, the production of future LULC datasets has the potential to better inform watershed planners. This study explored an optimal workflow that can be adopted for the production of baseline LULC input images from a moderate spatial resolution sensor such as Landsat, and the identification, translation, and configuration of land change drivers and regional comprehensive plan prescriptions in the creation of future LULC data for a regional watershed. The study conducted in the Lower Chippewa River Watershed, Wisconsin, USA demonstrated that an object-based hybrid classification approach resulted in the generation of improved projected images with a 15% increase in area under the curve (AUC) value compared to a pixel-based hybrid classification method even though both methods displayed comparable overall image classification accuracies (<= 1.8%). Results further displayed that configuring anthropogenic drivers in a trend format rather than individual year values can result in a more efficient training of a multi-layer perceptron neural network - Markov Chain model. The calibrated and validated model demonstrated that on average, residential, commercial, institutional, green vegetation/shrub, and industrial LULC are expected to grow through 2050, though at a slower rate (12%) compared to contemporary period (39%), while forest and agricultural lands are slated to decline (-2%).

TI  - Annual land-cover mapping based on multi-temporal cloud-contaminated landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat images, which have fine spatial resolution, are an important data source for land-cover mapping. Multi-temporal Landsat classification has become popular because of the abundance of free-access Landsat images that are available. However, cloud cover is inevitable due to the relatively low temporal frequency of the data. In this paper, a novel approach for multi-temporal Landsat land-cover classification is proposed. The land cover for each Landsat acquisition date was first classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and then the classification results were combined using different strategies, with missing observations allowed. Three strategies, including the majority vote (MultiSVM-MV), Expectation Maximisation (MultiSVM-EM) and joint SVM probability (JSVM), were used to merge the multi-temporal classification maps. The three algorithms were then applied to a region of the path/row 143/31 scene using 2010 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images. The results demonstrated that, for these three algorithms, the average overall accuracy (OA) improved with the increase in temporal depth; also, for a given temporal depth, the performance of JSVM was clearly better than that of MultiSVM-MV and MultiSVM-EM, and the performance of MultiSVM-EM was slightly better than that of MultiSVM-MV. The OA values for the three classification results, which use all epochs, were 70.28%, 72.40% and 74.80% for MultiSVM-MV, MultiSVM-EM and JSVM, respectively. In comparison, two other annual composite image-based classification methods, annual maximum Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composite image-based classification and annual best-available-pixel (BAP) composite image-based classification, gave OA values of 68.08% and 69.92%, respectively, meaning that our method produced a better performance. Therefore, the novel multi-temporal Landsat classification method presented in this paper can deal with the cloud-contamination problem and produce accurate annual land-cover mapping using multi-temporal cloud-contaminated images, which is of importance for regional and global land-cover mapping.

TI  - Systematic review of the rotavirus infection burden in the WHO-EMRO region
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Rotavirus gastroenteritis imposes a heavy burden on low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization defines the Eastern Mediterranean region (WHO-EMRO) as a diverse area in terms of socioeconomic status and health indicators. Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced, at least partially, in 19 out of the 22 EM countries; however, vaccine coverage remains low, and data on rotavirus disease burden is scarce. Available data on rotavirus prevalence, seasonality, vaccination status, and genotype evolution was systematically compiled following a literature review that identified 165 relevant WHO-EMRO epidemiology studies published between 1990 and 2017. Although the infectious agents responsible for acute gastroenteritis vary over time, rotavirus remained the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, as seen in 76.3% of reviewed publications. Younger children (<2 years old) were at higher risk and thus increased vaccination coverage and surveillance systems are required to reduce the rotavirus gastroenteritis burden in WHO-EMRO countries.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Automated detection of lineaments express geological linear features of a tropical region using topographic fabric grain algorithm and the SRTM DEM
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of the large volume of remote sensing data has allowed for the developing of several automated algorithms for detecting linear geological features and more reliable analysis. However, most of the algorithms focus on edge detection and tone change on a satellite image, which represents all geological and non-geological features. In this study, a topographic fabric algorithm, which calculates the slope and aspect at each point in a DEM, is applied for automatically geological linear features mapping in Bau Goldfield, Malaysia using the new version of the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM. A series of topographic fabric input parameters was tested using different combinations of input values in order to decide the optimal parameters that provided the suitable detection parameters, best fit and the highest accuracy. Comparison with the geological map demonstrated that the tested parameters made the algorithm able to automatically detect geological structures.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Fine scale spatial variation in soil moisture influences plant performance, species distributions and diversity. However, detailed information on local soil moisture variation is scarce, particularly in species-rich tropical forests. We measured soil water potential and soil water content in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, one of the best-studied tropical forests in the world. We present maps of soil water potential for several dry season stages during a regular year and during an El Nino drought. Additionally, we provide code that allows users to create maps for specific dates. The maps can be combined with other freely available datasets such as long-term vegetation censuses (ranging from seeds to adult trees), data on other resources (e.g. light and nutrients) and remote sensing data (e.g. LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy). Users can study questions in various disciplines such as population and community ecology, plant physiology and hydrology under current and future climate conditions.

TI  - The recent developments in cloud removal approaches of MODIS snow cover product
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover products of optical remote sensing systems play an important role in research into global climate change, the hydrological cycle, and the energy balance. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products are the most popular datasets used in the community. However, for MODIS, cloud cover results in spatial and temporal discontinuity for long-term snow monitoring. In the last few decades, a large number of cloud removal methods for MODIS snow cover products have been proposed. In this paper, our goal is to make a comprehensive summarization of the existing algorithms for generating cloud-free MODIS snow cover products and to expose the development trends. The methods of generating cloud-free MODIS snow cover products are classified into spatial methods, temporal methods, spatio-temporal methods, and multisource fusion methods. The spatial methods and temporal methods remove the cloud cover of the snow product based on the spatial patterns and temporal changing correlation of the snowpack, respectively. The spatio-temporal methods utilize the spatial and temporal features of snow jointly. The multi-source fusion methods utilize the complementary information among different sources among optical observations, microwave observations, and station observations.

TI  - Serological evidence of continued Japanese encephalitis virus transmission in Singapore nearly three decades after end of pig farming
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSingapore used to report an annual average of 14 cases of Japanese encephalitis, but ever since the abolishment of pig farms in the early 1990s, the local incidence rate for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections has reduced drastically. Studies done in the early 2000s demonstrated the presence of JEV-specific antibodies in animals such as wild boars, dogs, chickens and goats on the offshore island and peripheral parts of the Singapore, indicative of prior JEV exposure. A JEV wildlife and sentinel chicken surveillance system was initiated in 2010 through to 2017 to study the animal host seroprofiles.ResultsA total of 12/371 (3.23%) of resident bird samples, 24/254 (9.45%) of migratory bird samples and 10/66 (15.16%) of wild boar samples were positive for the presence of JEV antibodies. Seroconversions in sentinel chickens were observed at two time points. Through this study, two sites with active transmission of JEV amongst avian or porcine hosts were identified.ConclusionsJEV transmission in animal hosts has continued despite the phasing out of pig farming nearly thirty years ago; however, the public health risk of transmission remains low. Environmental management for mosquito population remains key to keeping this risk low.

TI  - Delineating functional territories from outer space
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The delimitation of functional spatial units or functional territories is an important topic in regional science and economic geography, since the empirical verification of many causal relationships is affected by the size and shape of these areas. This paper proposes a two-step method for the delimitation of functional territories and presents an application for three developing countries: Mexico, Colombia and Chile. The first step of this method uses nighttime satellite images to identify the boundaries of urban continuums (conurbations). When these continuums extend over more than one municipality, we group and redefine them as a new single spatial unit. The second step calculates a dissimilarity index using bidirectional labor-commuting flows between the resulting areas of the first step and then applies a standard clustering procedure to delineate the definitive functional territories. Our results suggest that, using nighttime satellite images, our method can lead to a more accurate definition of functional territories, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries where the official data on labor-commuting flows are often outdated or unreliable.

TI  - Regularized Coulomb Friction Laws for Ice Sheet Sliding: Application to Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The choice of the best basal friction law to use in ice-sheet models remains a source of uncertainty in projections of sea level. The parameters in commonly used friction laws can produce a broad range of behavior and are poorly constrained. Here we use a time series of elevation and speed data to examine the simulated transient response of Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, to a loss of basal traction as its grounding line retreats. We evaluate a variety of friction laws, which produces a diversity of responses, to determine which best reproduces the observed speedup when forced with the observed thinning. Forms of the commonly used power law friction provide much larger model-data disagreement than less commonly used regularized Coulomb friction in which cavitation effects yield an upper bound on basal friction. Thus, adoption of such friction laws could substantially improve the fidelity of large-scale simulations to determine future sea level.Plain Language Summary Although much effort has gone into improving numerical simulations of ice-sheet behavior for sea-level projection, the best choice for the friction law that governs the sliding of ice over its bed remains poorly known. As a consequence, a wide range of friction laws is used by the ice-sheet modeling community. Here we take advantage of several remotely sensed data sets to model the changes in speed of Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, over nearly two decades, using a variety of existing friction laws. We find that the behavior of this glacier is simulated far more faithfully relative to observations when a "regularized Coulomb" friction law is used. This type of friction law accounts for the formation of pressurized basal water pockets (cavitation) that occur when ice slides rapidly over its bed, which limits friction in a way that may amplify ice-sheet instability. By contrast, low-order exponents in more traditional power law friction parameterizations yield unbounded basal friction as speed increases, placing a much stronger brake on unstable ice-sheet behavior. Thus, these results make a strong case for adopting bounded regularized Coulomb friction laws in place of the more commonly used unbounded friction laws.

TI  - Incorporating nocturnal UAV side-view images with VIIRS data for accurate population estimation: a test at the urban administrative district scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to daytime remote sensing used for observing the Earth, night-time light remote sensing with satellites primarily assesses human activity using urban parameters such as building lights or lighted highways to help determine population density and other habitation characteristics. One limitation to conventional night-time remote sensing is that light emitted from high-rise buildings, for example, is not easily detected because of optical geometry as satellite sensors are generally pointed in only a downward direction. Furthermore, satellite sensors often receive weak optical signals because of streetlights reflected from the Earth's surface. As a result, accurate information on night-time human activity cannot be gathered from existing satellite remote-sensing methods. To address this, a new method for night-time remote setting is presented. Specifically, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used to capture panoramic images of night-time light and processed to reveal side-view light spot information from urban buildings. This dataset was used to predict population density alone, and with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data by simple multiple linear regression. The results confirm that nocturnal UAV side-view data or VIIRS data alone can be used to estimate population density, while the combination of the two significantly increases the accuracy of population density estimation compared against estimating population density using nocturnal UAV side-view data or VIIRS data alone. This outcome suggests that multi-angular night-time remote-sensing data sources increase the accuracy of urban population density estimation. One reason for this may be that the side-view night-time data and orthophoto data infer urban population density from different agent variables: building occupancy is a proxy of side-view night-time data, while density of illuminated road network is that of orthophoto data.

TI  - Sensitivity of Arctic sulfate aerosol and clouds to changes in future surface seawater dimethylsulfide concentrations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dimethylsulfide (DMS), outgassed from ocean waters, plays an important role in the climate system, as it oxidizes to methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which can lead to the formation of sulfate aerosol. Newly formed sulfate aerosol resulting from DMS oxidation may grow by condensation of gases, in-cloud oxidation, and coagulation to sizes where they may act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and influence cloud properties. Under future global warming conditions, sea ice in the Arctic region is expected to decline significantly, which may lead to increased emissions of DMS from the open ocean and changes in cloud regimes. In this study we evaluate impacts of DMS on Arctic sulfate aerosol budget, changes in cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), and cloud radiative forcing in the Arctic region under current and future sea ice conditions using an atmospheric global climate model. Given that future DMS concentrations are highly uncertain, several simulations with different surface seawater DMS concentrations and spatial distributions in the Arctic were performed in order to determine the sensitivity of sulfate aerosol budgets, CDNC, and cloud radiative forcing to Arctic surface seawater DMS concentrations. For any given amount and distribution of Arctic surface seawater DMS, similar amounts of sulfate are produced by oxidation of DMS in 2000 and 2050 despite large increases in DMS emission in the latter period due to sea ice retreat in the simulations. This relatively low sensitivity of sulfate burden is related to enhanced sulfate wet removal by precipitation in 2050. However simulated aerosol nucleation rates are higher in 2050, which results in an overall increase in CDNC and substantially more negative cloud radiative forcing. Thus potential future reductions in sea ice extent may cause cloud albedos to increase, resulting in a negative climate feedback on radiative forcing in the Arctic associated with ocean DMS emissions.

TI  - Satellite chlorophyll concentration as an aid to understanding the dynamics of Indian oil sardine in the southeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal waters of Kerala, which form an integral part of the Malabar upwelling zone off the southwest coast of India, constitute an important fishing region for small pelagics. Satellite remote sensing data from 1998-2014 were used to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in the landings of Sardinella longiceps, the major pelagic fish landed in the area designated as the South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS), are influenced by seasonal variability in phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a [chl a] concentration), under the changing strength of physical parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), alongshore wind stress, Ekman mass transport, sea level anomaly (SLA) and Kerala rainfall. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) was used to assess the influence of physical forcing mechanisms on chl a concentration on monthly and seasonal scales. We found that SLA, alongshore wind stress, SST and rainfall were ranked 1 to 4, respectively, and the first 3 factors significantly influenced the chl a concentration of SEAS. Pearson's correlation analysis between monthly chl a and sardine landing (with chl a leading) showed a maximum positive correlation (+0.26) at 2 and 3 mo lags, emphasizing that the influence of chl a on the fishery of S. longiceps is seasonal (r = 0.35 for seasonal lead-lag correlation) in the coastal waters of SEAS. Variation in phytoplankton biomass, as evidenced by chl a fluctuations, seems to have a decisive role in regulating the physiological condition of larvae spawned during the southwest monsoon season, their juveniles and finally the adults that are recruited into the fishery in the next season. Using the quantity of phytoplankton as a predictive tool will exploit the presumptive trophic link to aid understanding of sardine fishery dynamics in upwelling zones.

TI  - A leaf area index data set acquired in Sahelian rangelands of Gourma in Mali over the 2005-2017 period
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index of Sahelian rangelands and related variables such as the vegetation cover fraction, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and the clumping index were measured between 2005 and 2017 in the Gourma region of northern Mali. These variables, known as climate essential variables, were derived from the acquisition and the processing of hemispherical photographs taken along 1 km linear sampling transects for five contrasted canopies and one millet field. The same sampling protocol was applied in a seasonally inundated Acacia open forest, along a 0.5 km transect, by taking photographs of the understorey and the tree canopy. These observations collected over more than a decade, in a remote and not very accessible region, provide a relevant and unique data set that can be used for a better understanding of the Sahelian vegetation response to the current rainfall changes. The collected data can also be used for satellite product evaluation and land surface model development and validation. This paper aims to present the field work that was carried out during 13 successive rainy seasons, the measured vegetation variables, and the associated open database. Finally, a few examples of data use are shown. DOI of the referenced data set: https://doi.org/10.17178/AMMA-CATCH.CE.Veg_Gh.

TI  - Active-Passive Surface Water Classification: A New Method for high-Resolution monitoring of Surface Water Dynamics
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a new, highly efficient method to produce accurate, high-resolution surface water maps. The "active-passive surface water classification" method leverages cloud-based computing resources and machine learning techniques to merge Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar and Landsat observations and generate monthly 10-m-resolution water body maps. The skill of the active-passive surface water classification method is demonstrated by mapping surface water change over the Awash River basin in Ethiopia during the 2015 East African regional drought and 2016 localized flood events. Errors of omission (water incorrectly classified as nonwater) and commission (nonwater incorrectly classified as water) in the case study area are 7.16% and 1.91%, respectively. The case study demonstrates the method's ability to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps depicting surface water dynamics in data-sparse regions. The developed technique will facilitate better monitoring and understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on global freshwater ecosystems.Plain Language Summary Freshwater is one of the world's most important natural resources. However, data scarcity in many parts of the world is a substantial barrier to understanding and predicting the impact of environmental changes on freshwater ecosystems. Satellites provide data on water resources in data-poor regions. The "active-passive surface water classification" method merges observations from two types of sensors, passive sensors from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Landsat satellites and radar sensors from Sentinel 1 satellites, to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps. The technique is demonstrated by mapping surface water over the Awash River basin, Ethiopia, during the 2015 East African drought and 2016 flood events. Our results show the severe impact of the drought on basin water bodies, basin recovery to predrought conditions after the 2016 summer rains, and localized flooding from these rains. Our study is one of the first to generate water body maps by merging Landsat and Sentinel 1 data and use them to analyze spatial and temporal water body changes for monthly periods at a 10-m resolution. High-resolution maps of temporal surface water change will help water managers better target humanitarian response efforts, inform water policy decisions, and improve understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Aspects of Invasiveness of <i>Ludwigia</i> and <i>Nelumbo</i> in Shallow Temperate Fluvial Lakes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between invasive plant functional traits and their invasiveness is still the subject of scientific investigation, and the backgrounds of transition from non-native to invasive species in ecosystems are therefore poorly understood. Furthermore, our current knowledge on species invasiveness is heavily biased toward terrestrial species; we know much less about the influence of allochthonous plant traits on their invasiveness in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we present the results of a study on physiological and ecological traits of two introduced and three native macrophyte species in the Mantua lakes system (northern Italy). We compared their photophysiology, pigment content, leaf reflectance, and phenology in order to assess how the invasive Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala perform compared to native species, Nuphar lutea, Nymphaea alba, and Trapa natans. We found L. hexapetala to have higher photosynthetic efficiency and to tolerate higher light intensities than N. nucifera and the native species especially at extreme weather conditions (prolonged exposure to high light and higher temperatures). Chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids content of both allochthonous species were substantially higher than those of native plants, suggesting adaptive response to the ecosystem of Mantua lakes system. Higher variability of recorded data in invasive species was also observed. These observations suggest advanced photosynthetic efficiency of the invasive species, especially L. hexapetala, resulting in faster growth rates and higher productivity. This was supported by the evaluation of seasonal dynamics mapped from satellite remote sensing data. This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between specific plant physiological traits and invasiveness of aquatic plant species, highlighting the importance of trait studies in predicting ecosystem-level impacts of invasive plant species.

TI  - Use of the moving epidemic method (MEM) to assess national surveillance data for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the Netherlands, 2005 to 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To control respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes acute respiratory infections, data and methods to assess its epidemiology are important. Aim: We sought to describe RSV seasonality, affected age groups and RSV-type distribution over 12 consecutive seasons in the Netherlands, as well as to validate the moving epidemic method (MEM) for monitoring RSV epidemics. Methods: We used 2005-17 laboratory surveillance data and sentinel data. For RSV seasonality evaluation, epidemic thresholds (i) at 1.2% of the cumulative number of RSV-positive patients per season and (ii) at 20 detections per week (for laboratory data) were employed. We also assessed MEM thresholds. Results: In laboratory data RSV was reported 25,491 times (no denominator). In sentinel data 5.6% (767/13,577) of specimens tested RSV positive. Over 12 seasons, sentinel data showed percentage increases of RSV positive samples. The average epidemic length was 18.0 weeks (95%confidence intervals (CI): 16.3-19.7) and 16.5 weeks (95% CI:14.0-18.0) for laboratory and sentinel data, respectively. Epidemics started on average in week 46 (95%CI: 45-48) and 47 (95%CI: 46-49), respectively. The peak was on average in the first week of January in both datasets. MEM showed similar results to the other methods. RSV incidence was highest in youngest (0-1 and >1-2 years) and oldest (>65-75 and >75 years) age groups, with age distribution remaining stable over time. RSV-type dominance alternated every one or two seasons. Conclusions: Our findings provide baseline information for immunisation advisory groups. The possibility of employing MEM to monitor RSV epidemics allows prospective, nearly real-time use of surveillance data.

TI  - Assessing the impact of Chinese FY-3/MERSI AOD data assimilation on air quality forecasts: Sand dust events in northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important parameter characterizing the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols and can be used to indicate aerosol loading and evaluate air quality. In this study, a FY-3/medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI) AOD data assimilation (DA) system was developed using a three-dimensional variational DA method to assess the impact of Chinese FY-3/MERSI AOD data assimilation on air quality forecasts. Two typical sand-dust weather events occurred during the spring season of years 2010 and 2011 were selected as case study. The DA system and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a chemical model (WRF-Chem) were used to evaluate the impacts of FY-3/MERSI AOD DA on air quality forecasts. This was based on comparisons between modeled AOD data and AOD data acquired by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites. Results from both case studies revealed that FY-3/MERSI AOD DA apparently improved the air quality forecasts. Key findings of the FY3/MERSI AOD DA experiments included: (1) FY-3/MERSI AOD DA adjusted the simulated aerosol particle content of the WRF-Chem model and efficiently improved the extinction coefficient fields below 500 hPa. Moreover, AOD DA had the strongest effect on adjusting the extinction coefficients at 750 hPa (approximately 2km). Compared with the AOD background field, the AOD analysis field was similar to the satellite observation field. (2) Compared with the control experiments without DA, the AOD DA experiment produced more accurate 24-h AOD forecasts, more consistent with the AERONET and satellite observations. (3) Due to the spatial distribution and intensity difference of satellite AOD data, satellite AOD data assimilation has obvious individual characteristics for the improvement of particle concentration prediction. Our study findings suggest that the developed DA system can facilitate the effective use of AOD data acquired by Chinese satellites in air quality forecasting models and can improve dust forecasting results.

TI  - Application of WorldView-3 imagery and ASTER TIR data to map alteration minerals associated with the Rodalquilar gold deposits, southeast Spain
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rodalquilar epithermal quartz-alunite gold deposits that occur within the Rodalquilar caldera complex in southeast Spain, are associated with a pronounced hydrothermal alteration of the country rocks. The hydrothermal alteration zones that are exposed on the surface consist of the vuggy silica zone, the advanced argillic alteration zone, the intermediate argillic alteration zone, the propylitic alteration zone, and a second stage supergene acid sulfate alteration. High spatial resolution multispectral imagery recorded by the WorldView-3 satellite was used in this study to map the spatial distribution of the main alteration minerals in the Rodalquilar caldera complex. Thermal infrared (TIR) data of the ASTER satellite were used to detect the quartz-rich zones. The analysis of the Rodalquilar WorldView-3 data was based on the Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE), a partial unmixing algorithm. The ACE processing accurately mapped the spatial distribution of alunite, kaolinite, illite and goethite. Alunite is abundant in the vuggy silica and advanced argillic alteration zones, and in the second stage supergene acid sulfate alteration. Kaolinite is predominant in the intermediate argillic alteration zone. Illite is abundant in the outer parts of the intermediate argillic alteration zone. Goethite image maps gossans that mainly occur in the vuggy silica and advanced argillic alteration zones, and in the areas characterized by the second stage supergene acid sulfate alteration. The detection of quartz-rich zones from the ASTER TIR data complemented the WorldView-3 mapping results. The study shows the efficiency of high spatial resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery recorded by the WorldView-3 satellite for district-level mineral exploration studies. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - Dynamic forage-livestock balance analysis in alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage-livestock balance is important for sustainable management of alpine grasslands under global change, but the robustness of diverse algorithms for assessing forage-livestock balance is still unclear. This study compiled long-term (2009-2014) field observations of aboveground biomass (AGB). Using climate and remote sensing data, we evaluated the inter-annual dynamics of the forage-livestock balance on the Northern Tibetan Plateau (NIP). Here, we assumed that AGB dynamics in fenced grasslands (AGB(F)) is only driven by climate change; whereas AGB dynamics in open grasslands grazed by livestock (AGB(G)) is driven by a combination of climate change and human activities. Thus, human-induced change in AGB (AGB(H)) could be estimated via the difference between AGB(F) and AGB(G). Furthermore, differences in the temporal trends between AGB(F) and AGB(H) could indicate the state of forage-livestock balance, overgrazed or not, in alpine grasslands. Our results showed that the overall status of the forage-livestock balance from 2000 to 2006 was overgrazed owing to poor climatic conditions. Ecological projects and economic policies for alpine grassland conservation had not been implemented at that time, which also resulted in local overgrazing. From 2006 to 2014, the alpine grasslands in some areas were in a less-grazed state. We suggest that the livestock number could potentially increase in northern NTP and should be reduced or strictly controlled to maintain the balance between livestock and forage in the southern and southeast areas. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the evaluation of the forage-livestock balance in the NTP should include the local climatic conditions and make better use of grassland resources while ensuring ecological security.

TI  - Remote-sensing disturbance detection index to identify spatio-temporal varying flood impact on crop production
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is the most common type of natural hazards that can interrupt crop growth and reduce production. Current understanding of flood impact on crops is largely obtained from broad-scale studies without considering the influence of localized variations. Due to the highly localized features of flooding, it is essential to develop an effective and systematic approach to investigate and better understand the spatio-temporal varying flood disturbances at fine spatial scales. Based on the pixel-based time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, two satellite-based flood disturbance detection indices (DIs), i.e. EVI and peak EVI, are developed to recognize the difference between the signals induced by natural variations and instantaneous/non-instantaneous flood impact in crop growth processes. To define flood impact, the actual and predicted normal values of temporal trajectories of EVI and peak EVI during the crop growing seasons are compared to detect and remove the interference from the crop's intra-annual natural variations. A range of natural variations are considered to discern the signal induced by the crop's inter-annual natural variations. Furthermore, recovery of crops from flooding is also considered by comparing the peak EVI during crop growing seasons to detect the final flood impact. Using the Northeast China as a case study area, we successfully demonstrate the capacity of these two DIs to identify spatio-temporal varying flood impact on crop production. The DIs also reveal positive response of crops to extreme precipitation under certain conditions. Further analysis demonstrates the non-linear relationships between flood disturbances and terrain slope, distance from rivers, and flow accumulation area, which enable the development of empirical regression models to sufficiently capture the variation of flood damage extent. The research findings confirm that the two DIs proposed in this work are useful in detecting flood disturbances to crops and facilitating informed decision-making in agricultural flood management.

TI  - Climate variability and life history impact stress, thyroid, and immune markers in California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during El Nino conditions
T2  - CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife is exposed to a diverse set of extrinsic and intrinsic stressors, such as climatic variation or life history constraints, which may impact individual health and fitness. El Nino and climatic anomalies between 2013 and 2016 had major ecological impacts on the California Current ecosystem. As top marine predators, California sea lions (CSL) experienced decreased prey availability and foraging success, impacting their nutritional state. We hypothesize that chronic stress to juvenile CSL increased during the 2015-2016 El Nino and that breeding represents a period of chronic stress for adults, which impact a variety of physiological processes. We opportunistically captured and sampled juvenile CSL (female, n=29; male, n=38) in central California and adult male CSL (n=76) in Astoria, Oregon and quantified a suite of analytes in serum as indicators of acute stress markers, metabolism and thyroid function, and adaptive immune response. We found that stress hormones and glucose were decreased in juvenile CSL during 2016 relative to 2015 and in adult male CSL after the breeding season, which may indicate chronic stress downregulating HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis sensitivity with associated metabolic impacts. Conversely, thyroid hormones for both juvenile and adult male CSL were increased, suggesting greater energetic requirements resulting from increased foraging activity during suboptimal conditions in juveniles and breeding tenure in adult males. Immunoglobulin IgG was elevated in juveniles in 2016 but reduced in adult males post-breeding. This suggests that juveniles may face immunostimulatory pressure during anomalously warm ocean environments; however, for adult males, breeding is a significant energetic cost resulting in reductions to immune function. Our results indicate that environmental conditions and life history stage may influence physiological responses in an important marine predator and a sentinel species of changing ocean ecosystems.

TI  - Forest degradation promotes fire during drought in moist tropical forests of Ghana
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest reserves in Ghana are the only significant refugia of natural tropical forests, but they are threatened by land use pressures that have led to widespread forest degradation. Additional stress from climate perturbations, such as droughts, can reduce fuel moisture and lead to fires that render the reserves more vulnerable to further degradation. Here, we explore recent drought-associated wildfires in the forest zone of Ghana to better understand the combined effects of forest degradation and drought stress on fire in the forest reserves. We used remotely sensed Earth observations from MODIS and Landsat 8 along with Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) precipitation data, to study fires that occurred during drought conditions in 2016. Fires were widespread in 2016, with an estimated 2137 km(2) of forest reserve area burned. During the period 2003-2017, forest reserves experienced the most active fire detections in 2016. The majority of these fires were located in the moist semi-deciduous forests, the largest and most economically valuable forest type, accounting for more than 50% of all active fires and burned area. Forest reserves within the moist semi-deciduous forest type also had the highest standardized fire anomalies in 2016. There was a higher percentage of burned area in degraded forest reserves than in more intact reserves. These results underscore the vulnerability of Ghana's forest reserves, particularly in the moist semi-deciduous type, to fires during severe droughts. Although drought predisposes moist tropical forests to fire, forest degradation also influences the spatial pattern and extent of burned forests. Fire-induced forest degradation presents a major challenge for conservation of humid tropical forests in the region. Within the context of REDD + and other climate change mitigation and adaptation programs in West Africa, it will be imperative to incorporate effective fire management strategies into ongoing efforts to reduce forest degradation and sustain forest resilience.

AB  - The present review aims to analyze the current data available on the different applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in gynecology. A semantic review of English-language publications was performed by searching for MeSH terms and keywords in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were finally selected by one author according to the aim of this review. ICG is a highly water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that fluoresces in the NIR spectrum. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it can be administered either IV (usual dose of 5 mg) or locally/submucosally (usual dose of 5-6.25 mg) according to the pathology or indication. It is used most often in the setting of oncology, endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. In oncological applications, ICG is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) using near-infrared light in endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. The main advantages that it offers include a reduction of surgical time, improved SLN detection rates, and the ability to avoid radioactivity. In cases of endometrial (submucosal or hysteroscopic applications) or cervical (intracervical administration) cancer, ICG can detect SLN at an accuracy of 95% to 98%. For vulvar cancer, the SLN detection rate can reach 100%. In endometriosis, the lack of good evidence hinders the final evaluation of this method in both diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. An analytical, well-designed, prospective study is currently underway.

TI  - Study of permafrost distribution in Sikkim Himalayas using Sentinel-2 satellite images and logistic regression modelling
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Sentinel-2A (S-2A) Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Level 1C (L1C) products are used for identification and mapping of rock glaciers within a transect under observation in Sikkim Himalayas. The mapped rock glaciers were classified on the basis of their activity (intact or relict) and their origin (glacier-derived or talus-derived). Logistic regression models were applied to calculate the probability of permafrost distribution within transect under observation. We observed that freely available high resolution S-2A MSI L1C products are a valuable addition to the already existing freely available high resolution satellite images that can be exploited to study rock glaciers in Himalayan region. The distribution of rock glaciers in Sikkim Himalayas is found to be strongly controlled by elevation and aspect. Topoclimatic conditions above 5000 m a.s.l. are favourable for the presence of permafrost in Sikkim Himalayas. More glacier-derived rock glaciers than talus-derived rock glaciers were observed within transect under observation. Outputs from logistic regression models were capable to reasonably estimate the spatially-distributed probability of permafrost occurrence in the region. However, outputs from these models depended upon the selection of the initiation line location points of rock glaciers and topoclimatic and topographic variables used as predictors for model computation. Based on probability distribution maps, more than 60% (>800 km(2)) area of transect under observation could contain permafrost. This high areal abundance of permafrost in Sikkim Himalayas suggests increased risks of thawing permafrost under the influence of climate warming in future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration using the crop canopy temperature at field to regional scales in large irrigation district
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the hydrologic cycle, and its accurate estimation is essential in water resource management. In this study, field experiments were performed from 2015 to 2016 in the Jiefangzha Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, in China. To estimate the daily crop ET (ETd) using the midday canopy and air temperature difference (T-c-T-a) and net radiation (Rn-d), the S-I model (Seguin and Itier, 1983) was calibrated and validated based on observations from maize and sunflower fields. The canopy temperature and meteorological factors were monitored continuously and synchronously from June to August with a Canopy Temperature and Meteorology Monitoring System (CTMS). Parameters a and b in the S-I model were fitted at 10:00 to 16:00 by linear regression analysis between (ETd - Rn-d) and (T-c-T-a), from June to August 2015. Based on the values of a and b, the daily ET can be estimated using the S-I model (named ETM) from 10:00 to 16:00 in 2016, which provided good results for all the statistical parameters. The S-I model has performed reasonably well in predicting the ETd during the maize and sunflower growth period at the field scale. The Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) was employed to produce and fuse daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) (30 m) data by integrating high-spatial Landsat data and high-temporal MODIS images during the primary growing period of maize and sunflowers from June to August in 2015 and 2016. The fused LSTs exhibited good performance compared with the canopy temperature observed using the CTMS system in situ. Afterwards, the daily scale-field ET (30 m) was estimated by using the validated S-I model during the primary growing periods for maize and sunflowers at 11:00 in 2015 and 2016. The results showed that the estimated values of ET from the S-I model were consistent with the results for the regional water balance, with average relative error (RE) values of 7.0%, 5.0%, 9.4% and 7.3% (absolute value) in two years, in the Huangji, Qinghui, Wula and Yangjiahe sections of the Jiefangzha Irrigation Area, respectively. This finding indicates that as a relatively simple and convenient method, the S-I model could be applied to estimate the ET at a regional scale.

TI  - Global Observations of Fine-Scale Ocean Surface Topography With the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The future international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, planned for launch in 2021, will make high-resolution 2D observations of sea-surface height using SAR radar interferometric techniques. SWOT will map the global and coastal oceans up to 77.6 degrees latitude every 21 days over a swath of 120 km (20 km nadir gap). Today's 2D mapped altimeter data can resolve ocean scales of 150 km wavelength whereas the SWOT measurement will extend our 2D observations down to 15-30 km, depending on sea state. SWOT will offer new opportunities to observe the oceanic dynamic processes at scales that are important in the generation and dissipation of kinetic energy in the ocean, and that facilitate the exchange of energy between the ocean interior and the upper layer. The active vertical exchanges linked to these scales have impacts on the local and global budgets of heat and carbon, and on nutrients for biogeochemical cycles. This review paper highlights the issues being addressed by the SWOT science community to understand SWOT's very precise sea surface height (SSH)/surface pressure observations, and it explores how SWOT data will be combined with other satellite and in situ data and models to better understand the upper ocean 4D circulation (x, y, z, t) over the next decade. SWOT will provide unprecedented 2D ocean SSH observations down to 15-30 km in wavelength, which encompasses the scales of "balanced" geostrophic eddy motions, high-frequency internal tides and internal waves. This presents both a challenge in reconstructing the 4D upper ocean circulation, or in the assimilation of SSH in models, but also an opportunity to have global observations of the 2D structure of these phenomena, and to learn more about their interactions. At these small scales, ocean dynamics evolve rapidly, and combining SWOT 2D SSH data with other satellite or in situ data with different space-time coverage is also a challenge. SWOT's new technology will be a forerunner for the future altimetric observing system, and so advancing on these issues today will pave the way for our future.

TI  - Congenital Rubella Syndrome Surveillance in South Africa Using a Sentinel Site Approach: A Cross-sectional Study
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) includes disorders associated with intrauterine rubella infection. Incidence of CRS is higher in countries with no rubella-containing vaccines (RCV) in their immunization schedules. In the World Health Organization African region, RCVs are being introduced as part of the 2012-2020 global measles and rubella strategic plan. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of confirmed CRS in South Africa prior to introduction of RCVs in the immunization schedule.Methods. This was a descriptive study with 28 sentinel sites reporting laboratory-confirmed CRS cases in all 9 provinces of South Africa. In the retrospective phase (2010 to 2014), CRS cases were retrieved from medical records, and in the prospective phase (2015 to 2017) clinicians at study sites reported CRS cases monthly.Results. There were 42 confirmed CRS cases in the retrospective phase and 53 confirmed CRS cases in the prospective phase. Most frequently reported birth defects were congenital heart disease and cataracts. The median age of mothers of CRS cases was 21 years in the retrospective phase (range: 11 to 38 years) and 22 years in the prospective phase (range: 15 to 38 years).Conclusion. Baseline data on laboratory-confirmed CRS will enable planning and monitoring of RCV implementation in the South African Expanded Programme on Immunization program. Ninety-eight percent of mothers of infants with CRS were young women 14-30 years old, indicating a potential immunity gap in this age group for consideration during introduction of RCV.

TI  - Reconstructing pre-fire vegetation condition in the wildland urban interface (WUI) using artificial neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires occurring near and within cities are a potential threat to the population's life and health and can cause significant economic damage by destroying infrastructure and private property. Due to the relatively small area of these wildlands, the accuracy of fire risk-assessment plays a significant role in fire management. Introducing the experience of real events can improve accuracy. But this approach is limited by a lack of knowledge of pre-fire conditions, mainly vegetation characteristics as related to their definition as a fuel parameter because of their high temporal variation. To solve this problem, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed to reconstruct the spectral characteristics of the vegetation just before the fire with spatial resolution 0.5-2 m from the Landsat image. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the approach has been examined on urban vegetation sites and applied to restore spectral information of the actual vegetation patch before it was burned in 2016 in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the reconstructed RGB image allows for mapping the location of green vegetation with high spatial accuracy. However, spectral data in the visible range have some limitations when it comes to identifying differences between soil and dry plants. The reconstructed image was used to sharp the original data from Landsat. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps were produced from the resulting high-resolution multispectral image. The output maps allow to determine the location of vegetation and estimate the level of its dryness on the urban wildland landscape. The proposed method aims to estimate vegetation dryness and, as a result, identify the fuel characteristics at the time of the fire. It has the potential of using for evaluation and improve the weights of the input parameters for the fire-risk assessment and fire-behavior modeling on a specific area.

TI  - Mapping soil organic matter contents at field level with Cubist, Random Forest and kriging
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil organic matter (SOM) content is strongly related to soil fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Knowledge of the soil SOM content is therefore necessary for efficient and sustainable management practices. In this study, we compare the performance of five machine learning techniques for the prediction of SOM contents using remote sensing, proximal soil sensors and topographic data as environmental predictor. The methods used were kriging, Cubist, Random Forest and regression-kriging (Cubist- kriging and Random Forest kriging). 285 soil samples were collected from a 10 ha field in Denmark. 75% of the data were used for training and 25% for validation. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), DVI (Difference Vegetation Index) and SAW (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) were derived from Sentinel 2 images with 10 m resolution as auxiliary variables. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 1.6 m resolution. The performance of the methods was compared based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that kriging achieved the best performance, followed by regression-kriging. The models using only Cubist and Random forest had the poorest performance. The results, therefore, demonstrate that kriging can predict SOM contents without the need of auxiliary variables for fields with high sampling densities.

TI  - Right sizing for vaccine effectiveness studies: how many is enough for reliable estimation?
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe precision of vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates is dependent on sample size and sampling methods. In Victoria, participating general practitioners (GPs) are not limited by the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) patients they collect respiratory samples (swabs) from in sentinel surveillance. However, in the context of scarce resources it is of interest to determine the minimum sample size needed for reliable estimates.MethodsFollowing the test-negative design, patients with ILI were recruited by GPs and tested for influenza. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess possible selection bias introduced by GPs. VE was calculated by logistic regression as [1 - odds ratio] x 100% and adjusted for week of presentation and age. Random 20% and 50% samples were selected without replacement to estimate the effect of swab rates on VE estimates.ResultsGPs swabbed a smaller proportion of patients aged >= 65 years (45.9%, n=238) than those <5 (75.6%, n=288), 5-17 (67.9%, n=547) and 18-64 (75.6%, n=2662) years. Decreasing the swab rate did not alter VE point estimates significantly. However, it reduced the precision of estimates and in some instances resulted in too small a sample size to estimate VE.ConclusionImposing a 20% or 50% swabbing rate produces less robust VE estimates. The number of swabs required per year to produce precise estimates should be dictated by seasonal severity, rather than an arbitrary rate. It would be beneficial for GPs to swab patients systematically by age group to ensure there are sufficient data to investigate VE against a particular subtype in a given age group.

TI  - Reimagining the potential of Earth observations for ecosystem service assessments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The benefits nature provides to people, called ecosystem services, are increasingly recognized and accounted for in assessments of infrastructure development, agricultural management, conservation prioritization, and sustainable sourcing. These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Contrasting wheat phenological responses to climate change in global scale
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive analysis of how wheat phenology responds to environmental factors in global scale is helpful for tackling the possible adverse effects of ongoing climate change on wheat production. In this study, six phenological parameters of global wheat, i.e., the growing season start (SGS), peak (PGS), end (EGS), length (LGS), as well as the vegetative period length (LVP) and reproductive period length (LRP), were retrieved from remote sensing data (1981-2014) by threshold-, logistic-, and shape-based methods. And then, we analyzed the effects of temperature, precipitation, short-wave (SW) radiation, and frost on spatiotemporal patterns of wheat phenology. In addition, haze impacts on wheat phenology were investigated in China and India where haze weather appears frequently in winter-spring seasons. Results showed that the occurrence time of SGS/PGS/EGS is gradually advanced from the pole to the equator and annual mean air temperature can explain >70% of their spatial variations. A dominant advanced SGS/PGS/EGS and a shortened LGS/LVP/LRP were detected in the study region due to the significant increase in temperature and SW radiation, as well as the decrease in frost days. Interannual fluctuations of SGS/PGS/EGS are primarily controlled by air temperature, while precipitation and frost only exerted some obvious impacts in some locations. Higher preseason temperature would induce an earlier wheat phenology and a shorter growing season, while adequate precipitation and frequent frost in preseason could delay the occurrence timing of wheat phenology and lead to a longer growing season. Besides, the decreased temperature resulted from severe haze weather may have partly counteracted the global-warming-induced advancing trend of wheat phenology in China, but further advanced the occurrence timing of wheat phenology through prompting vernalization in India. Overall, though wheat growth is largely constrained by human management, we still highlight the strong impacts of global climate change on wheat phenology. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving remotely-sensed crop monitoring by NDVI-based crop phenology estimators for corn and soybeans in Iowa and Illinois, USA
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather-related risks in crop production are not only crucial for farmers but also for market participants and policymakers since securing food supply is an important issue for society. Although crop growth condition and phenology represent essential information regarding such risks, extensive observations of these variables are virtually non-existent in many parts of the world. In this study, we developed an integrative approach to remotely monitor crop growth at a large scale. For corn and soybeans in Iowa and Illinois in the United States (2003-2015), we monitored crop growth and crop phenology with earth observation data and compared it against the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop statistics. For crop phenology, we calculated three phenology metrics (i.e., start of season, end of season, and peak of season) at the pixel level from the MODIS 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For growth condition, we used two distinct approaches to acquire crop growth condition indicators: a process-based crop growth modeling and a satellite-NDVI-based method. Based on their pixel-wise historical distributions, we monitored relative growth strength and scaled-up that to the state-level. The estimates were compared with the crop progress and condition data of NASS. For the state-level phenology, the avg. root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the estimates was 8.6 days for the all three metrics after bias correction. The absolute mean errors for the three metrics were smaller than 2.6 days after bias correction. For the condition, the state-level 10-day estimates showed moderate agreements with the observations (avg. RMSE = 10.02%). Notably, the condition estimates were sensitive to the severe degradation in 2003, 2012, and 2013 for both crops. In 2010, 2011 and 2013, unusually high errors occurred at the very beginning stage of growth (DOY 140-150), which attenuated over time. As the cumulative biomass and NDVI showed little change in comparison to the period mean biomass and NDVI for the spikes, this seems to be an error associated with variations in growth timing. Overall, the model using accumulated NDVI (S5) is preferable due to its performance and methodological simplicity. The proposed approach enables us to monitor crop growth for any given period and place where long-term statistics are available. It can be used to assist crop monitoring at large scales.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration zones and lineaments associated with orogenic gold mineralization using ASTER data: A case study from the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) is considered as an important region for gold exploration in the western sector of Iran. Its mountainous topography and unpaved routes make its study challenging for researchers and raise the costs for mining companies strating new exploration plans. Gold mineralization mainly occurs as irregular to lenticular sulfide-bearing quartz veins along shear zones in deformed mafic to intermediate metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. In this investigation, ASTER data are used for mapping hydrothermal alteration minerals and to better discriminate geological structural features associated with orogenic gold occurrences in the area. Image transformation techniques such as specialized band ratioing and Principal Component Analysis are used to delineate lithological units and alteration minerals. Supervised classification techniques, namely Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) are applied to detect subtle differences between indicator alteration minerals associated with ground-truth gold locations in the area. The directional filtering technique is applied to help in tracing along the strike the different linear structures. Results demonstrate that the integration of image transformation techniques and supervised classification of ASTER data with fieldwork and geochemical exploration studies has a great efficiency in targeting new prospects of gold mineralization in the the SSZ.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS and two reanalysis aerosol optical depth products over AERONET sites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study selects 400 sites from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over 2002-2015 to develop an aerosol optical depth (AOD) evaluation dataset, which is used to evaluate two reanalysis AOD datasets (MERRAero and MERRA-2) from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) projects, and satellite AOD datasets from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. Each AOD dataset is first evaluated individually, and then, a comparison of the MODIS, MERRAero and MERRA-2 datasets is conducted. The results show that the reanalysis MERRA-2 AOD dataset has a comparable accuracy (RMSE = 0.119, MBE = - 0.008) with the satellite MODIS AOD datasets (RMSE = 0.110, MBE = 0.011). The MERRA-2 AOD dataset has similar spatial distributions with MODIS data and can capture the dynamic changes of AOD temporally. Compared to MERRAero, the MERRA-2 product improves, but it still slightly underestimates AERONET AOD in general. The MODIS AOD datasets perform differently compared to AERONET AOD due to different algorithms and spatial resolutions. Compared to AERONET AOD, the MODIS AOD datasets generated by the deep blue algorithm are negative biased, while the MODIS AOD datasets from dark target algorithm and the merged dataset are positively biased. The precisions of the Aqua MODIS AOD datasets are higher than the corresponding Terra MODIS AOD datasets.

TI  - Fire Responses to the 2010 and 2015/2016 Amazonian Droughts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme droughts in Amazonia cause anomalous increase in fire occurrence, disrupting the stability of environmental, social, and economic systems. Thus, understanding how droughts affect fire patterns in this region is essential for anticipating and planning actions for remediation of possible impacts. Focused on the Brazilian Amazon biome, we investigated fire responses to the 2010 and 2015/2016 Amazonian droughts using remote sensing data. Our results revealed that the 2015/2016 drought surpassed the 2010 drought in intensity and extent. During the 2010 drought, we found a maximum area of 846,800 km(2) (24% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) rainfall decrease in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 the maximum area reached 1,702,800 km(2) (47% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. On the other hand, the 2010 drought had a maximum area of 840,400 km(2) (23% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) land surface temperature increase in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 drought the maximum area was 2,188,800 km(2) (61% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. Unlike the 2010 drought, during the 2015/2016 drought, significant positive anomalies of active fire and CO2 emissions occurred mainly during the wet season, between October 2015 and March 2016. During the 2010 drought, positive active fire anomalies resulted from the simultaneous increase of burned forest, non-forest vegetation and productive lands. During the 2015/2016 drought, however, this increase was dominated by burned forests. The two analyzed droughts emitted together 0.47 Pg CO2, with 0.23 Pg CO2 in 2010, 0.15 Tg CO2 in 2015 and 0.09 Tg CO2 in 2016, which represented, respectively, 209%, 136%, 82% of annual Brazil's national target for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation by 2017 (approximately 0.11 Pg CO2 year(-1) from 2006 to 2017). Finally, we anticipate that the increase of fires during the droughts showed here may intensify and can become more frequent in Amazonia due to changes in climatic variability if no regulations on fire use are implemented.

TI  - Trends in Vegetation fires in South and Southeast Asian Countries
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the fire trends from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (2003-2016) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (2012-2016) in South/Southeast Asia (S/SEA) at a country level and vegetation types. We also quantified the fire frequencies, anomalies and climate drivers. MODIS data suggested India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Myanmar as having the most fires. Also, the VIIRS-detected fires were higher than MODIS (AQUA and TERRA) by a factor of 7 and 5 in S/SEA. Thirty percent of S/SEA had recurrent fires with the most in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Statistically-significant increasing fire trends were found for India (p = 0.004), Cambodia (p = 0.001), and Vietnam (p = 0.050) whereas Timor Leste (p = 0.004) had a decreasing trend. An increasing trend in fire radiative power (FRP) were found for Cambodia (p = 0.005), India (0.039), and Pakistan (0.06) and declining trend in Afghanistan (0.041). Fire trends from VIIRS were not significant due to limited duration of data. In S/SEA, fires in croplands were equally frequent as in forests, with increasing fires in India, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Specific to climate drivers, precipitation could explain more variations in fires than the temperature with stronger correlations in Southeast Asia than South Asia. Our results on fire statistics including spatial geography, variations, frequencies, anomalies, trends, and climate drivers can be useful for fire management in S/SEA countries.

TI  - Global ionospheric scintillations revealed by GPS radio occultation data with FY3C satellite before midnight during the March 2015 storm
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global observations of S4 amplitude scintillation index by the GPS Occultation Sounder (GNOS) on FengYun-3 C (FY3C) satellite reveal global dynamic patterns of a strong pre-midnight scintillations in F-region of the ionosphere during the St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic super storm of 17-19 March 2015. The observed strong scintillations mainly occurred in the low latitudes, caused by equatorial plasma bubbles. During the main storm phase (March 17), the scintillations were first triggered in the New Zealand sector near 160 degrees E longitudes, extending beyond 40 degrees S dip latitude. They were also enhanced in the Indian sector, but significantly suppressed in East Asia near 120 degrees E longitude and in Africa around 30 degrees E longitude. During the initial recovery phase (March 18-19), the global scintillations were seldom observed in GNOS data. During the later recovery phase (after March 19), the scintillations recovered to the pre-storm level in Indian, African, and American sectors, but not in East Asian and any of Pacific sectors. These results closely correlate with observations of the density depletion structures by the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite, and ground-based instruments. Such consistency indicates reliability of our scintillation sensing approach even in a case-by-case comparison study. The prompt penetration electric field and disturbance dynamo electric field are suggested as the main factors that control the enhancement and inhibition of the scintillations during the storm, respectively.

TI  - Reconstruction of high spatial resolution surface air temperature data across China: A new geo-intelligent multisource data-based machine learning technique
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Good knowledge of the surface air temperature (SAT) is critical for scientific understanding of ecological environment changes and land-atmosphere thermodynamic interactions. However, sparse and uneven spatial distribution of the temperature gauging stations introduces remarkable uncertainties into analysis of the SAT pattern. From a geo-intelligent perspective, here we proposed a new SAT reconstruction method based on the multi-source data and machine learning technique which was developed by considering autocorrelation of the in situ observed SAT in both space and time, or simply STAML, i.e. Geoi-SVM (Geo-Intelligent Support Vector Machine), Geoi-BPNN (Geo-Intelligent Back Propagation Neural Network) and Geoi-RF (Geo-Intelligent Random Forest). The multisource data used in this study include the in situ observed SAT and multisource remotely sensed data such as MODIS land surface temperature, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. Intermodel comparisons amidst reconstructed SAT data were done to evaluate reconstructing performance of abovementioned models. Besides, the SAT reconstructed by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) was also included to evaluate the reconstructing performance of the models considered in this study when compared to SAT data by CART algorithm. We found that the estimation error of the reconstructed SAT by the STAML is smaller than 0.5 K (Kelvin). In addition, it is interesting to note that the Geoi-RF performs better with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 0.25 K, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (SD) of lower than 0.5 K respectively. Correlation coefficients between the reconstructed SAT by Geoi-RF and the observed SAT are close to 1. Besides, the estimation accuracy of the SAT by the Geoi-RF technique is 18.51-63.17% higher than that by the other techniques considered in this study. This study provides a new idea and technique for reconstruction of SAT over large spatial extent at regional and even global scale. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The human bitter taste receptor TAS2R7 facilitates the detection of bitter salts
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The human sense of taste is devoted to the analysis of the chemical composition of food prior to ingestion. Among the five basic taste qualities bitter taste perception is believed to avoid ingestion of potentially toxic substances. The receptors facilitating the detection of hundreds of chemically different bitter compounds belong to the taste 2 receptor (TAS2R) family, which are part of the G protein-coupled superfamily. Although the chemical classes of bitter compounds that have been identified as agonists of one of the 25 potentially functional human bitter taste receptors cover an enormous chemical space, one distinct group of bitter compounds, the bitter salts have not been assigned to any bitter taste receptor. To close this gap, we screened the entire human bitter taste receptor repertoire by functional calcium mobilization assays with the most famous bitter salt, magnesium sulfate, also known as Epsom salt. Although the profound pharmacological activity and the bitter taste of spring water containing magnesium sulfate has been known since 1697, the molecular basis for its taste has not been elucidated until now. Our screening resulted in the identification of a single receptor, the TAS2R7, responding to magnesium sulfate at concentrations humans perceive this salt as bitter. Subsequently, TAS2R7 was stimulated with other salts and it was found that this receptor also responds to manganese(2+) and iron(2+) ions, but not to potassium ions. Magnesium sulfate is known to exert a number of beneficial effects on the human body and thus, has been used as medicine against premature uterine contractions, as anti arrhythmic drug and as laxative, however, magnesium sulfate overdosage can result in cardiac arrest and thus have fatal consequences. Therefore, it appears reasonable that nature placed TAS2R7 as sentinel for high concentrations of bitter salts on our tongues. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Fluorescence imaging is an emerging technology that can provide real-time information about the operating field during cancer surgery. Non-specific fluorescent agents, used for the assessment of blood flow and sentinel lymph node detection, have so far dominated this field. However, over the last decade, several clinical studies have demonstrated the great potential of targeted fluorescent tracers to visualize tumor lesions in a more specific way. This has led to an exponential growth in the development of novel molecular fluorescent contrast agents. In this review, the design of fluorescent molecular tracers will be discussed, with particular attention for agents and approaches that are of interest for clinical translation.

TI  - Impact of the surgical modality for axillary lymph node dissection on postoperative drainage and seroma formation after total mastectomy
T2  - PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe most common complications after total mastectomy with axillary lymph node treatment are prolonged drainage and seroma formation. The aim of this study was to find factors correlated with prolonged fluid discharge (prolonged drainage or seroma formation after 20th operative day or later), including surgical techniques or devices and clinical factors.Patients and methodsA total of 202 conclusive primary breast cancer patients underwent total mastectomy with axillary lymph node treatment between January 7, 2014 and June 20, 2018 at our hospital. The factors that correlated with the total fluid discharge volume and prolonged fluid discharge were examined statistically. The surgical modalities for total mastectomy with axillary treatment were classified into the following three groups:, Group A; skin flap formation by EC and axillary lymph node dissection by EC with ligation of the arteries and veins, Group B; skin flap formation by EC and axillary lymph node dissection by ultrasonic dissector (UD) without ligation of the vessels. Group D; skin flap formation by electrocautery (EC) and axillary lymph node dissection by picking up using forceps and ligation (PL).ResultsThe total fluid discharge volume and prolonged fluid discharge after total mastectomy with sentinel node retrieval (33 patients) were significantly lower than those after total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (169 patients). In patients treated without drainage, a high rate of seroma formation and prolonged fluid discharge were observed, and 1 patient developed seroma infection.In the total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection group, logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index, 1-week drainage volume, and surgical modality were independently correlated with prolonged fluid discharge.ConclusionsThe surgical procedure for axillary lymph node dissection should be considered to avoid prolonged fluid discharge, and the lymph vessels should be ligated in axillary lymph node dissection. An ultrasonic dissector was not effective in reducing the total fluid discharge volume. An optimal axillary lymph node dissection technique should be developed. For the patients without drainage, careful postoperative treatment should be given to avoid infectious seroma formation, even for patients who underwent total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node retrieval.

TI  - Machine learning to refine decision making within a syndromic surveillance service
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWorldwide, syndromic surveillance is increasingly used for improved and timely situational awareness and early identification of public health threats. Syndromic data streams are fed into detection algorithms, which produce statistical alarms highlighting potential activity of public health importance. All alarms must be assessed to confirm whether they are of public health importance. In England, approximately 100 alarms are generated daily and, although their analysis is formalised through a risk assessment process, the process requires notable time, training, and maintenance of an expertise base to determine which alarms are of public health importance. The process is made more complicated by the observation that only 0.1% of statistical alarms are deemed to be of public health importance. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate machine learning as a tool for computer-assisted human decision-making when assessing statistical alarms.MethodsA record of the risk assessment process was obtained from Public Health England for all 67,505 statistical alarms between August 2013 and October 2015. This record contained information on the characteristics of the alarm (e.g. size, location). We used three Bayesian classifiers- naive Bayes, tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets - to examine the risk assessment record in England with respect to the final Decision' outcome made by an epidemiologist of Alert', Monitor' or No-action'. Two further classifications based upon tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets were implemented to account for the predominance of No-action' outcomes.ResultsThe attributes of each individual risk assessment were linked to the final decision made by an epidemiologist, providing confidence in the current process. The naive Bayesian classifier performed best, correctly classifying 51.5% of Alert' outcomes. If the Alert' and Monitor' actions are combined then performance increases to 82.6% correctly classified. We demonstrate how a decision support system based upon a naive Bayes classifier could be operationalised within an operational syndromic surveillance system.ConclusionsWithin syndromic surveillance systems, machine learning techniques have the potential to make risk assessment following statistical alarms more automated, robust, and rigorous. However, our results also highlight the importance of specialist human input to the process.

TI  - Floodwater impact on Galveston Bay phytoplankton taxonomy, pigment composition and photo-physiological state following Hurricane Harvey from field and ocean color (Sentinel-3A OLCI) observations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton taxonomy, pigment composition and photo-physiological state were studied in Galveston Bay (GB), Texas (USA), following the extreme flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey (25-29 August 2017) using field and satellite ocean color observations. The percentage of chlorophyll a (Chl a) in different phytoplankton groups was determined from a semi-analytical IOP (inherent optical property) inversion algorithm. The IOP inversion algorithm revealed the dominance of freshwater species (diatom, cyanobacteria and green algae) in the bay following the hurricane passage (29 September 2017) under low salinity conditions associated with the discharge of floodwaters into GB. Two months after the hurricane (29-30 October 2017), under more seasonal salinity conditions, the phytoplankton community transitioned to an increase in small-sized groups such as haptophytes and prochlorophytes. Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI)-derived Chl a obtained using a red / NIR (near-infrared) band ratio algorithm for the turbid estuarine waters was highly correlated (R-2 > 0.90) to the (high-performance liquid chromatography) HPLC-derived Chl a. Long-term observations of OLCI-derived Chl a (August 2016-December 2017) in GB revealed that hurricane-induced Chl a declined to background mean state in late October 2017. A non-negative least squares (NNLS) inversion model was then applied to OLCI-derived Chl a maps of GB to investigate spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton diagnostic pigments pre- and post-hurricane; results appeared consistent with extracted phytoplankton taxonomic composition derived from the IOP inversion algorithm and microplankton pictures obtained from an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB). OLCI-derived diagnostic pigment distributions also exhibited good agreement with HPLC measurements during both surveys, with R-2 ranging from 0.40 for diatoxanthin to 0.96 for Chl a. Environmental factors (e.g., floodwaters) combined with phytoplankton taxonomy also strongly modulated phytoplankton physiology in the bay as indicated by measurements of photosynthetic parameters with a fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) system. Phytoplankton in well-mixed waters (mid-bay area) exhibited maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and a low effective absorption cross section (sigma(PSII)), while the areas adjacent to the shelf (likely nutrient-limited) showed low F-v/F-m and elevated sigma(PSII) values. Overall, the approach using field and ocean color data combined with inversion models allowed, for the first time, an assessment of phytoplankton response to a large hurricane-related floodwater perturbation in a turbid estuarine environment based on its taxonomy, pigment composition and physiological state.

TI  - A Novel Method for Multispectral Image Classification by Using Social Spider Optimization Algorithm Integrated to Fuzzy <i>C</i>-Mean Clustering
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) is a robust method in determining membership grades of a pixel belonging to 1 or more classes. This paper proposes a novel approach by using the social spider optimization (SSO) algorithm in solving the search for optimal cluster centers in FCM. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, was chosen as a case study because of its spatial complexity. Multispectral satellite datasets of Landsat 8, Sentinel 2A and SPOT 7 were used. The experiment started with the segmentation process, followed by an examination of the model, then the results were compared with several conventional clustering methods. For accuracy assessment, the FCM minimizing objective functions, user and producer accuracies and overall accuracy were used. The results showed that SSO significantly improved the performance of FCM and outperformed the benchmarked classifiers or other common optimization algorithms. It could be concluded that the model was successfully deployed in the study area and could be suggested as an alternative solution for urban pattern detection. In a broader sense, classification methods will be enriched with the active and fast-growing contribution of nature-inspired algorithms.

TI  - Glacier-Surface Velocity Derived Ice Volume and Retreat Assessment in the Dhauliganga Basin, Central Himalaya - A Remote Sensing and Modeling Based Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers are a storehouse of fresh water and play a significant role in influencing the runoff through numerous perennial rivers flowing over the Indo-Gangetic plains, providing freshwater to the second largest populated country in the world. For suitable management of this water resource, measurement of glacier-ice volume is extremely important in the current scenario of climate change and water scarcity. To address this concern, the present study endeavors to find a suitable methodology to quantify glacier volume and retreat in the Central Himalaya. Herein, two methods were implemented to estimate the total glacier ice volume - conventional area-based scaling method and glacier-surface velocity based modeling technique. The availability of field data allowed a validation assessment to be carried out on two Himalayan glaciers (Chhota Shigri and Satopanth). Here, we propose a volume-area power law, appropriate for the application in the context of Himalayan glaciers. The ice volume of 15 glaciers larger than 1 km(2) calculated using a spatially distributed ice thickness model is 3.78 x 10(9) m(3) (f = 0.8), with an overall uncertainty of 18.4%. The total volume of the remaining glaciers in the basin, calculated using a tuned volume-area scaling relation is 2.71 x 10(9) m(3). A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the influence of input parameters on the model and volume-area scaling performance. The study also incorporates investigation of the glacier bed topography for discrete identification of the overdeepening sites in the glacier valley which are potential lake formation sites in the future. A total of 54 overdeepening sites covering an area of 2.85 km(2) have been identified. In addition, the relative glacier area loss of the glaciers is investigated using historical CORONA and Landsat satellite imageries. Glaciers with a smaller area and those with lower mean ice thickness near the terminus shrank significantly more, as compared to the larger ones. The total area of the selected larger glaciers is estimated to be 68 km(2) in 2015 and deglaciation of 4.7 km(2) is observed over the period of 48 years that accounts for 6.9% of the total area in 1968.

TI  - <i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>: a Powerful Bio-indicator for Water Pollution by Emerging Pollutants
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eichhornia crassipes is well known as an invasive aquatic plant. It is also used very effectively in phytoremediation, particularly for the rhizofiltration of effluents contaminated by heavy metals. In this article, we show that it is also an excellent bioindicator of water polluted by worrying organic pollutants such as endocrine disruptors and neonicotinoids. As a proof of concept, di-n-hexylphtha late, pentabromodiphenyl ether, nitenpyram, acetamiprid and bis (3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylphenyl) sulfide were clearly identified by UHPLC-HRMS or GC-MS in the root system of E. crassipes after a short period of exposure. These results open up new perspectives for the remediation of water polluted by alarming organic pollutants.

TI  - Ground-truth of a 1-km downscaled NLDAS air temperature product using the New York City Community Air Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-truthing results are presented for a new 1-km air temperature product down-scaled for New York City (NYC) from similar to 12 km North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) air temperature data using 1 km moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface temperature data. The downscaled product was compared against a unique highly spatially resolved ground-level ambient air temperature dataset collected through the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), a neighborhood level air pollution and temperature monitoring network, for the years 2009 and 2010. This work focuses on the spatial variation in daily minimum temperatures within the five counties that comprise NYC (similar to 784 km(2)). Overall, the downscaled daily minimum temperature was well correlated with ground station data, with NYCCAS minimum temperatures being slightly higher. Minimum temperature R-2 values were 0.9 and 0.92, and mean absolute errors were 0.69 degrees C and 0.86 degrees C for years 2009 and 2010, respectively. The smallest differences between NYCCAS and the downscaled data were seen at lower temperatures, in less densely urbanized areas, and in areas with higher vegetative cover, suggesting systematic bias in the downscaled data related to land-use. The 1-km dataset discerned neighborhood level temperature differences in high-density urban situations with heterogeneous land cover. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Analytical study of seasonal variability in land surface temperature with normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, normalized difference built-up index, and normalized multiband drought index
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technique often analyzes the thermal characteristics of any area. Our study focuses on estimating land surface temperature (LST) of Raipur City, emphasizing the urban heat island (UHI) and non-UHI inside the city boundary and the relationships of LST with four spectral indices (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, normalized difference built-up index, and normalized multiband drought index). Mono-window algorithm is used as LST retrieval method on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data, which needs spectral radiance and emissivity of TIRS bands. The entire study is performed on 11 multidate Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS images taken from four different seasons; premonsoon, monsoon, postmonsoon, and winter, in a single-year time period. The Landsat 8 data derived LST is validated significantly with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD11A1) data. The results show that the UHI zones are mainly developed along the northern and southern portions of the city. The common area of UHI for four different seasons is developed mainly in the northwestern parts of the city, and the value of LST in the common UHI area varies from 26.45 degrees C to 36.51 degrees C. Moreover, the strongest regression between LST and these spectral indices is observed in monsoon and postmonsoon seasons, whereas winter and premonsoon seasons revealed comparatively weak regression. The results also indicate that landscape heterogeneity reduces the reliability of the regression between LST with these spectral indices.

TI  - Assessment of forest restoration with multitemporal remote sensing imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and man-made impacts have severely damaged forests around the world in recent years, which calls for an urgent need of restoration aiming toward long-term sustainability for the forest environment. This paper proposes a new three-level decision tree (TLDT) approach to map forest, shadowy, bare and low-vegetated lands sequentially by integrating three spectral indices. TLDT requires neither image normalization nor atmospheric correction, and improves on the other methods by introducing more levels of decision tree classification with inputs from the same multispectral imagery. This approach is validated by comparing the results obtained from aerial orthophotos (25 cm) that were acquired at approximately the same time in which the Formosa-2 images (8 m) were being taken. The overall accuracy is as high as 96.8% after excluding the deviations near the boundary of each class caused by the different resolutions. With TLDT, the effectiveness of forest restoration at 30 sites are assessed using all available multispectral Formosat-2 images acquired between 2005 and 2016. The distinction between natural regeneration and regrowth enhanced by restoration efforts were also made by using the existing dataset and TLDT developed in this research. This work supports the use of multitemporal remote sensing imagery as a reliable source of data for assessing the effectiveness of forest restoration on a regular basis. This work also serves as the basis for studying the global trend of forest restoration in the future.

TI  - Anthropogenic subsidence along railway and road infrastructures in Northern Italy highlighted by Cosmo-SkyMed satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use X-band Cosmo-SkyMed InSAR data to highlight several subsidence phenomena resting on some railway and road infrastructures in Lombardia region, Northern Italy, mainly induced by anthropogenic activities. We show eight case studies, namely "Como," Erba, Oggiono, Valmadrera, Olginate, Verduggio, Melzo, and San Giuliano M., where we detect local subsidence effects affecting several railway and highway lines with deformation rates of about 5 mm/year. The geological features of this part of Italy and the large presence of industrial areas in the surrounding of Milano, Lecco, and Como cities lead to such phenomena. The stability and security of the nested road and railway network could be affected by these surface deformation fields. To guarantee the safety of people, continuous maintenance of the condition of railways and roads together with the monitoring of the conditions of the lands on which they rest on should be done.

TI  - The Values and Usefulness of Same-Sex Marriages Among the Females in Igbo Culture in the Continuity of Lineage or Posterity
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Igbo world in Southeastern Nigeria, as a patriarchal society, believes in passing the family inheritance along the male line excluding the female. This sociocultural belief and practice leads to gender role problems, especially in the case of families with no children or male child who will inherit the family estate. Same-sex marriage among women is used to bridge the gap created by the challenges of the socially and culturally constructed gender roles with the aim of "male daughters" and "female husbands" becoming sons and husbands to wives for procreation and continuity of the family's lineage. Through Gender Studies and Gender and Power theory, this study examines the reasons and benefits of such practices, the risks the practices expose women to, as well as the sociocultural implications of the practice to the Igbo worldview.

TI  - Identification of hydrothermal alteration minerals associated with geothermal system using ASTER and Hyperion satellite data: a case study from Yankari Park, NE Nigeria
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Concealed and fossilized geothermal systems are not characterized by obvious surface manifestations like hotsprings and fumaroles, therefore, could not be easily identifiable using conventional techniques. In this investigation, the applicability of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Hyperion data-sets were evaluated in discriminating hydrothermal alteration minerals associated with geothermal systems as a proxy in identifying subtle Geothermal systems at Yankari Park, Nigeria. Feature-oriented principal component selection, spectral angle mapper, linear spectral unmixing were applied to ASTER data based on spectral characteristics of hydrothermal alteration key minerals for a systematic selective extraction of the information of interest. Analytical imaging and geophysics-developed processing methods were applied to Hyperion data for mapping iron oxide/hydroxide minerals and clay mineral assemblages in hydrothermal alteration zones. The results indicate that ASTER and Hyperion could be complemented for reconnaissance stage of targeting subtle alteration mineral assemblages associated with geothermal systems.

AB  - Snowmelt makes an essential component of the hydrological system of Kashmir Himalayas. The present study was carried out to examine the status of Snow Cover Area (SCA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day Snow Cover Product between 2000 and 2016. The intra- and inter-annual variability in SCA and in meteorological parameters was observed and various statistical tests were used to study the interrelationship. Results of statistical analysis indicate decrease in maximum temperature (-0.05 degrees C/year) and minimum temperatures (-0.02 degrees C/year) while rise in precipitation (19.13 mm/year). It also showed an increase in annual mean SCA (43.5 sq km) during the study period. The analysis was also carried out on a seasonal basis. The results revealed that in Kashmir Himalayas, climate plays a dominating role in controlling the SCA. The results depict the short-term fluctuations in SCA and show the magnitude of change between two successive values being very large in SCA.

TI  - Global mapping of eco-environmental vulnerability from human and nature disturbances
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environments are threatened by intensively natural variation and continuously increased human-made disturbances. Assessment of the global eco-environment vulnerability (global EV or GEV) caused by both natural and human-induced disturbances plays a key role in providing valuable information about ecological and environmental background for designing suitable policy measures to improve and restore environment. We present the first global-scale map of quantified eco-environmental vulnerability by integrating remote sensing, GIS modelling, and global census datasets, employing 16 influential factors across five domains: socioeconomics, land resources, natural hazards, hydrometeorology, and topography. The GEV is classified into six levels, namely very low vulnerability, low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, medium high vulnerability, high vulnerability, and very high vulnerability. At global scale, a small fraction of the globe (10.1%) is strongly (high and very high vulnerability) affected by influential factors. Among continents, the largest fraction of very high vulnerability level is attributed to Asia (74.6%) followed by Africa (19.6%). National-scale analysis shows that China and India are the most vulnerable in Asia and in the world. Our study provides accumulative impacts of manmade and natural disturbances, which are vital for decision makers to set improvement targets on specific areas over local, regional, and global scales, and design and adopt new practices to lessen natural and manmade disturbances on environment, while keeping track of evolution of the other environmental aspects.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand epidemiological characteristics of human rabies in China in 2017 and provide evidence for the development of strategy of human rabies control and prevention. Methods: The descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted based on the epidemic data from Chinese Infectious Disease Surveillance Reporting System, sentinel surveillance system in 6 provinces (Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangsu and Shandong) and National Bureau of Statistics in 2017. Results: A total of 516 human rabies cases, including 502 deaths, were reported by 27 provinces in 2017 with the morbidity rate and mortality rate of 0.037/100 000 and 0.036/100 000, respectively. The case number and death number decreased by 19.88% (128/644) and 15.20% (90/592) respectively compared with 2016. Rabies epidemics were mainly found in southern and central areas. The first 5 provinces reporting high case numbers were Hunan (71 cases), Henan (52 cases), Guangxi (41 cases), Anhui (39 cases) and Hubei (39 cases), their cases accounted for 46.90% (242/516) of the total reported cases in China. Rabies mainly occurred in summer and autumn, and the majority of patients were farmers, students and children outside child care settings. The male to female ratio of the cases was 2.46 ∶ 1 (367 ∶ 149). Cases was reported in all age groups, and more cases occurred in middle aged and old adults than in adolescents. Questionnaires survey was conducted for 186 cases, the results indicated that 94.89% (167/176) of exposures were caused by dog bites. The exposure degree was mainly category Ⅲ, accounting for 68.86% (115/167), and only 6.02% (10/166) of cases were immunized after exposure. The median of latent period of these cases was 72 days. Conclusions: By 2017, the human rabies incidence in China had declined consecutively for ten years, more cases were reported in southern area than in northern area. The case number showed downward trends in provinces with high incidences and fluctuant increase in provinces with low incidence. Rabies cases mainly occurred in rural areas, and most cases were men and farmers. Low rate of post exposure prophylaxis, low rates of vaccination and passive immunization product injection were main causes for the onset of human rabies. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance for human rabies, especially in rural areas, health education about treatment after rabies exposure and expend the coverage of canine immunization.
AB  - 目的： 分析2017年我国狂犬病的流行病学特征，掌握疫情变化规律，为防控策略的调整提供科学依据。 方法： 收集2017年"传染病疾病监测信息报告管理系统"和6个省份（湖南省、广西壮族自治区、安徽省、贵州省、江苏省和山东省）监测点以及国家统计局上报的数据资料，采用描述性流行病学方法对资料进行统计、分析。 结果： 2017年全国27个省份共报告狂犬病病例516例，报告死亡502例，报告发病率为0.037/10万，报告死亡率为0.036/10万。报告发病数和死亡数分别较2016年下降19.88%（128/644）和15.20%（90/592）。我国狂犬病疫情分布仍以南部和中部地区为主，报告发病数居前5位的省份依次为湖南省（71例）、河南省（52例）、广西壮族自治区（41例）、安徽省（39例）和湖北省39例，占全国报告发病总数的46.90%（242/516）。高发季节为夏秋季，病例仍以农民、学生和散居儿童为主。病例男女性别比为2.46∶1（367∶149）。各年龄段均有发病，中老年发病多于青少年。共收集186例狂犬病病例个案调查表，致伤动物仍以犬为主，占94.89%（167/176）。暴露程度以Ⅲ级暴露为主，占68.86%（115/167）。暴露后疫苗接种率仅为6.02%（10/166）。病例潜伏期中位数为72 d。 结论： 2017年我国狂犬病疫情持续下降，南方病例仍然高于北方，高发省份出现下降趋势，低发省份出现上浮波动。病例主要分布于农村地区，以男性和农民为主。病例暴露后伤口处置率、疫苗接种率和被动免疫制剂注射率低仍是发病的直接因素。应加强狂犬病的监测力度，以农村地区为重点，加大狂犬病暴露后预防处置的宣传力度，提高犬只免疫率。.

T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) underscored the importance of influenza detection and response in China. From 2004, the Chinese National InfluenzaCenter (CNIC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC) initiated Cooperative Agreements to build capacity in influenza surveillance in China.From 2004 to 2014, CNIC and USCDC collaborated on the following activities: 1) developing human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology in China; 2) developing a comprehensive influenza surveillance system by enhancing influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting and virological characterization; 3) strengthening analysis, utilization and dissemination of surveillance data; and 4) improving early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential.Since 2004, CNIC expanded its national influenza surveillance and response system which, as of 2014, included 408 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. With support from USCDC, more than 2500 public health staff from China received virology and epidemiology training, enabling >98% network laboratories to establish virus isolation and/or nucleic acid detection techniques. CNIC established viral drug resistance surveillance and platforms for gene sequencing, reverse genetics, serologic detection, and vaccine strains development. CNIC also built a bioinformatics platform to strengthen data analysis and utilization, publishing weekly on-line influenza surveillance reports in English and Chinese. The surveillance system collects 200,000-400,000 specimens and tests more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually, which provides valuable information for World Health Organization (WHO) influenza vaccine strain recommendations. In 2010, CNIC became the sixth WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza. CNIC has strengthened virus and data sharing, and has provided training and reagents for other countries to improve global capacity for influenza control and prevention.The collaboration's successes were built upon shared mission and values, emphasis on long-term capacity development and sustainability, and leadership commitment.

TI  - A case of giant cell tumor of the breast, clinically suspected as malignant breast tumor
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Giant cell tumor (GCT) of the breast is scarce. We report a case of GCT of the breast which was suspected as a malignant breast tumor.Case presentation: A 74-year-old woman noticed a tender lump in her right breast. We suspected a malignant tumor spreading widely with axillary lymph node metastasis on clinical examination and imaging. Histological evaluation of the biopsy tissue revealed a tumor composed the proliferation of oval to spindle-shaped cells and multinucleated giant cells without malignant epithelial cells. The tumor cells stained positively for CD68 and negatively for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The pathological findings suggested GCT, and fine needle aspiration biopsy for the axillary lymph node was negative. However, there was a gap between the clinical presentation, such as a tender mass suggesting rapid growth and multiple lymphadenopathies, and the pathological presentation of biopsy, which made us hesitate to conclude GCT as the final preoperative diagnosis. We could not rule out the possibility of malignant tumors with OGCs before surgery. We performed mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy according to a surgical procedure for node-negative breast cancer with a wide ductal spread. The resected tissue histologically showed the same findings to the biopsy tissue. The definitive diagnosis of GCT of the breast was given, because the tumor lacked epithelial components, marked cellular atypia, and pleomorphism.Conclusions: GCT of the breast occasionally pretends as breast malignant tumors. Complete tumor resection should be performed for local control and the definitive diagnosis.

AB  - The analysis of earthquake time series in a new time domain termed natural time enables the uncovering of hidden properties in time series of complex systems and has been recently employed as the basis of a method to estimate seismic risk. Natural time also enables the determination of the order parameter of seismicity, which is a quantity by means of which one can identify when the system approaches the critical point (the mainshock occurrence is considered the new phase). Applying this analysis, as an example, to the Japanese seismic data from 1 January 1984 until the supergiant M 9 Tohoku earthquake on 11 March 2011, we find that almost 3 months before its occurrence the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal is minimized on 22 December 2010, which signals an impending major earthquake. On this date the order parameter fluctuations of seismicity exhibit an abrupt increase. This increase is accompanied by various phenomena; e.g., from this date the horizontal GPS azimuths start to become gradually oriented toward the southern direction, while they had random orientation during the preceding period. Two weeks later, a minimum of the order parameter fluctuations of seismicity appears accompanied by anomalous Earth magnetic field variations and by full alignment of the orientations of GPS azimuths southwards leading to the most intense crust uplift. These phenomena are discussed and found to be in accordance with a physical model which seems to explain on a unified basis anomalous precursory changes observed either in ground-based measurements or in satellite data.

TI  - Cloud Detection Algorithm for Greenhouse Gas Retrieval
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-5 satellite is equipped with a greenhouse gas monitoring instrument (GMI) and a directional polarization camera. Both devices have their own advantages as well as limitations in cloud detection. This study proposes a novel collaborative cloud screening algorithm that uses data from both devices to improve the efficiency of cloud screening for greenhouse gas retrieval. This algorithm is tested with 77581 GMI observation points from the global 16-day on-track measured data, and 9508 clear-sky observation points, i.e. 12.26% points arc screened. With the fused moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer cloud mask and cirrus reflectance dataset, the validity of cloud detection by the proposed algorithm is confirmed. The accurate rates of cloud detection of 92.93% and 81.91% over land and oceans arc obtained, respectively.

TI  - Multiplatform evaluation of global trends in wind speed and wave height
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, global satellite data were analyzed to determine trends in oceanic wind speed and significant wave height over the 33-year period from 1985 to 2018. The analysis uses an extensive database obtained from 31 satellite missions comprising three types of instruments-altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers. The analysis shows small increases in mean wind speed and significant wave height over this period, with larger increases in extreme conditions (90th percentiles). The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the wind speed trends are confirmed by all three satellite systems. An extensive set of sensitivity analyses confirms that both the mean and 90th percentile trends are robust, with only small impacts caused by satellite calibration and sampling patterns.

TI  - Estimation of spatio-temporal vegetation trends in different land use environments across Greece
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our work deals with the estimation of spatio-temporal vegetation trends in various land use types in a typical Mediterranean country like Greece. Analysis of vegetation during all seasons was performed using remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000-2017 in conjunction with the various land use environments. Results highlighted the dominating vegetation greening all over the country during all seasons. Sporadic spots with a negative vegetation trend were observed in areas that had experienced fire events. Forests and semi-natural areas, characterized by absence of human activities, demonstrated the highest greening vegetation pattern, indicating thus the possible climate change implications. Urban areas, representing the land portions mostly influenced by human interventions, showed a greening pattern, attributed to a combination of increased temperature and CO2 in those areas, but also highlighted the possible positive environmental footprint of economic recession period that Greece is undergoing during the last decade.[GRAPHICS]

TI  - Processing and quality control of FY-3C GNOS data used in numerical weather prediction applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese radio occultation sounder GNOS (Global Navigation Occultation Sounder) is on the FY-3C satellite, which was launched on 23 September 2013. Currently, GNOS data are transmitted via the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), providing 450-500 profiles per day for numerical weather prediction applications. This paper describes the processing of the GNOS profiles with large biases related to L2 signal degradation. A new extrapolation procedure in bending angle space corrects the L2 bending angles using a thin ionosphere model and the fitting relationship between L1 and L2. We apply the approach to improve the L2 extrapolation of GNOS. The new method can effectively eliminate about 90% of large departures. In addition to the procedure for the L2 degradation, this paper also describes our quality control (QC) for FY-3C GNOS. A noise estimate for the new L2 extrapolation can be used as a QC parameter to evaluate the performance of the extrapolation. A statistical comparison between GNOS bending angles and short-range ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) forecast bending angles demonstrates that GNOS performs almost as well as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding (GRAS), especially in the core region from around 10 to 35 km. The GNOS data with the new L2 extrapolation are suitable for assimilation into numerical weather prediction systems.

TI  - Using the random forest algorithm to integrate hydroacoustic data with satellite images to improve the mapping of shallow nearshore benthic features in a marine protected area in Jamaica
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydroacoustic and optical remote sensing have been commonly used to map shallow nearshore benthic features. However, the number, type, scale, and accuracy of the mapping products that can be obtained from the two sensors differ; as such, there can be limited agreement between their mapping products. These differences can be further accentuated if the hydroacoustic data are interpolated to produce a map. Interpolation introduces spatial uncertainty and reduces map accuracy. Consequently, maps generated from the two sensors may provide dissimilar spatial and temporal representations of the same benthic features. We therefore compared the performance of a random forest regression (RFr) and a universal kriging (UK) interpolation method and a post-classification enhancement that can be used to increase the accuracy and complementarity of benthic habitat maps derived from hydroacoustic data. First, we used single beam echosounder (SBES) survey bathymetry data from the Bluefields Bay marine protected area (MPA) in western Jamaica (13.82 km(2) in size), to create a bathymetric surface model (BSM), from which rugosity and bathymetric position index (BPI) maps were generated. Next, the RFr was used to create submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) percentage cover maps from the SBES SAV cover data by predicting cover at un-sampled locations. Predictors included auxiliary data such as depth, BPI, survey points coordinates and radiometrically corrected, deglinted and water column corrected image reflectance index values from each of the following: WorldView-2, Geoeye-1 and Landsat 8. Additionally, a SAV map was created using the UK. The most accurate SAV cover thresholds were identified and were used to create binary maps from the RFr and UK maps. A rugosity derived coral reef map was then added to the binary maps. The resulting benthic habitat maps had comparable accuracies and class coverage to benthic maps classified from GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images using pixel and object-based classifiers. However, map accuracies were calculated using a suboptimal number of reference points (<50) for two of the benthic map classes (SAV absent and coral reef). This was not considered to be problematic as the addition of the coral reef class to the binary maps resulted in a significant decrease in uncertainty (standard error and confidence interval width of the overall accuracy) and a significant increase in the user's accuracy of the SAV absent map class. Also, the difference in uncertainty and accuracy between the map classes did not change. The methods used in this study can therefore be used to increase the accuracy (and to decrease the uncertainty) and the complementarity of maps derived from hydroacoustic data.

TI  - Learning for Life: A Hermeneutical-Communicative Model for Worldview Education and White Normativity
T2  - RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the project Learning for Life we developed a hermeneutical-communicative model for worldview education that answers the European challenges of worldview diversity and worldview illiteracy. We implemented the model in a participatory action research project at nine schools for primary education in the Netherlands and monitored the outcomes. A meta-analysis shows that the model can be fruitfully applied in confessional and public schools, as well as in cooperation schools, which are a merger of confessional and public schools. The model is demanding with regard to the skills and attitude of worldview teachers. We suggest improvements for two aspects of the model from the perspective of white normativity.

TI  - High Platform Elevations Highlight the Role of Storms and Spring Tides in Salt Marsh Evolution
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We combine sea level records and repeat lidar surveys at 8 sites in the United Kingdom and the United States to explore controls on marsh accretion. We compare marsh elevations relative to sea level as well as lidar-derived marsh accretion rates to simple 0-dimensional settling simulations in order to explore constraints on suspended sediment concentration and particle size. We find that the marsh platforms examined occupy a narrow range of elevations in the upper tidal frame, situated between Mean High Tide MHT and the Observed Highest High Tide OHHT. Under sinusoidal tidal forcing, common in marsh accretion models, marshes at these elevations are never inundated, highlighting the inadequacy of sinusoidal forcing in numerical models of salt marshes. Forcing the model with year-long tidal records, deposition rates follow hyperbolic contour lines when expressed as a function of sediment concentration and median grain size. We also observe that when using a median sediment grain size D-50 = 50 mu m and sediment concentrations derived from satellite data, modeled deposition rates are much lower than when using field data. We find that the deposition of coarse, concentrated sediment is necessary for platforms in the upper tidal frame to withstand sea level rise, suggesting a strong dependance on infrequent high-deposition events. This is particularly true for marshes that are very high in the tidal frame, making accretion increasingly storm-driven as marsh platforms gain elevation. Finally, we reflect on the capacity of marshes to regenerate after erosion events within a context of changing sediment supply conditions.

TI  - Carbon stock assessment of date palm using remote sensing coupled with field-based measurements in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at developing a remote sensing based model to estimate carbon stock (CS) in date palm plantations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Data from Landsat 8 OLI were used to assess the correlation between spectral reflectance and different vegetation indices on one side, and aboveground biomass (AGB) derived from ground measurements on the other. AGB and CS (ton ha(-1)) were estimated using traditional destructive methods of standard sampling techniques and allometric equations developed in a previous study for date palms in the area. The relationships between the estimated AGB and parameters derived from remote sensing (RS) data were tested using single and multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated a significant correlation with certain RS parameters. For mature palms class alone (>10 years), the correlation with single bands was only significant with SWIR1 and SWIR2 while the correlation was significant with all tested VI's except for TCB vegetation index. A combination of bands R, SWIR1, and SWIR2 improved the determination of this class to a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.961. However, for the medium and young age classes (10-5 and less than 5 years), the correlation was not significant (with the exception of SWIR1 and TCB index for medium class), where the use of higher spatial resolution can be a good alternative. On the other hand, for mixed ages (young, medium and mature palms), the strongest correlations were found using SWIR2 single band and the SR vegetation index; having R-2 values of 0.753 and 0.871, respectively. The R-2 was improved to 0.952 by using stepwise multiple regression combining DVI, NDI, and RVI vegetation indices. Finally, results obtained showed that CS represented 53.87% of the total AGB in date palms. Subsequently, the average amount of carbon stock (CS) for both mature and mixed classes was calculated at 15.81 and 10.3 ton ha(-1) respectively.

TI  - Varicella zoster and fever rash surveillance in Lao People's Democratic Republic
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn Lao PDR, the epidemiology of varicella infection is uncertain, since it is not a notifiable disease and VZV outbreaks are rarely reported as fever/rash (F/R) diseases.MethodsWe estimated the seroprevalence of VZV (IgG ELISA) in different age cohorts (9months to 46years; N=3139) and investigated VZV and 6 other viruses in patients during F/R outbreaks and in an ad hoc sentinel site in the context of the national reporting system (IgM ELISA, PCR).ResultsAt least 80% of the sampled population had evidence of VZV infection before the age of 15. The largest increase in seroprevalence occurred between the age groups 1 to 5 and 6 to 7year-olds. A VZV outbreak (clade 2) also occurred in this age group mostly during the first year of primary school (median age 6years, interquartile range 4.0-7.5). During a dengue outbreak, 6% had varicella. At our F/R sentinel site, 14% of children with viral etiology were laboratory diagnosed as varicella and among others, a sizeable number of measles (N=12) and rubella cases (N=25) was detected compared to those reported for the whole country (N=56 and 45), highlighting nationwide a large challenge of underreporting or misdiagnosis of these notifiable diseases because of lack of diagnostic laboratory capacity.ConclusionWe recommend strengthening the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of VZV, measles and rubella, the surveillance and reporting of notifiable F/R diseases by retraining of healthcare workers and by setting up sentinel sites and enhancing laboratory capacity.

TI  - Anopheline species composition and the 1014F-genotype in different ecological settings of Burkina Faso in relation to malaria transmission
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA three-year longitudinal study was conducted in four sentinel sites from different ecological settings in Burkina Faso, between 2008 and 2010 to identify longitudinal changes in insecticide resistance within Anopheles gambiae complex species based on larval collection. During this study, adult mosquitoes were also collected indoor and outdoor using several methods of collection. The present study reports the diversity of malaria vectors and the 1014F-genotype from this adult collection and investigates the association between this 1014F-genotype and sporozoite rate.MethodsAdult mosquitoes were collected from July to August (corresponding to the start of rainy season) and October to November (corresponding to the end of rainy season) over 3years (2008-2010) at four sites across the country, using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), exit traps and pit shelters. Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes were identified to species and genotyped for the L1014F kdr mutation by PCR using genomic DNA. The circumsporozoite antigen of Plasmodium falciparum was detected in mosquitoes using sandwich ELISA.ResultsOverall 9212 anopheline mosquitoes were collected during the study period. Of those, 6767 mosquitoes were identified as Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.). Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae and or Anopheles funestus were incriminated as vectors of P. falciparum in the study area with an average sporozoite rate of 5%, (95% CI 4.14-5.99%). The kdr1014F-genotype frequencies were 11.44% (95% CI 2.5-39.85%), 19.2% (95% CI 4.53-53.73%) and 89.9 (95% CI 63.14-97.45%), respectively for An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The proportion of the 1014F-genotype varied between sporozoite-infected and uninfected An. gambiae s.l. group. There was no significant difference in the 1014F-genotype frequency between infected and uninfected mosquitoes.ConclusionThe current study shows the diversity of malaria vectors and significant interaction between species composition and kdr1014F-genotype in An. gambiae complex mosquitoes from Burkina Faso. In this study, no associations were found between the 1014F-genotype and P. falciparum infection in the major malaria vector An. gambiae s.l.

TI  - Distinct roles for MDA5 and TLR3 in the acute response to inhaled double-stranded RNA
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The airway epithelial barrier is critical for preventing pathogen invasion and translocation of inhaled particles into the lung. Epithelial cells also serve an important sentinel role after infection and release various pro-inflammatory mediators that recruit and activate immune cells. Airway epithelial barrier disruption has been implicated in a growing number of respiratory diseases including viral infections. It is thought that when a pathogen breaks the barrier and gains access to the host tissue, pro-inflammatory mediators increase, which further disrupts the barrier and initiates a vicious cycle of leak. However, it is difficult to study airway barrier integrity in vivo, and little is known about relationship between epithelial barrier function and airway inflammation. Current assays of pulmonary barrier integrity quantify the leak of macromolecules from the vasculature into the airspaces (or "inside/out" leak). However, it is also important to measure the ease with which inhaled particles, allergens, or pathogens can enter the subepithelial tissues (or "outside/in" leak). We challenged mice with inhaled double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and explored the relationship between inside/out and out-side/in barrier function and airway inflammation. Using wild-type and gene-targeted mice, we studied the roles of the dsRNA sensors Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5). Here we report that after acute challenge with inhaled dsRNA, airway barrier dysfunction occurs in a TLR3-dependent manner, whereas leukocyte accumulation is largely MDA5-dependent. We conclude that airway barrier dysfunction and inflammation are regulated by different mechanisms at early time points after exposure to inhaled dsRNA.

TI  - The 2010 expansion of activity-based hospital payment in Israel: an evaluation of effects at the ward level
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2010, Israel intensified its adoption of Procedure-Related Group (PRG) basedhospital payments, a local version of DRG(Diagnosis-related group). PRGs were created for certain procedures by clinical fields such as urology, orthopedics, and ophthalmology. Non-procedural hospitalizations and other specific procedures continued to be paid for as per-diems (PD). Whether this payment reform affected inpatient activities, measured by the number of discharges and average length of stay (ALoS), is unclear.MethodsWe analyzed inpatient data provided by the Ministry of Health from all 29 public hospitals in Israel. Our observations were hospital wards for the years 2008-2015, as proxies to clinical fields. We investigated the impact of this reform at the ward level using difference-in-differences analyses among procedural wards. Those for which PRG codes were created were treatment wards, other procedural wards served as controls. We further refined the analysis of effects on each ward separately.ResultsDischarges increased more in the wards that were part of the control group than in the treatment wards as a group. However, a refined analysis of each treated ward separately reveals that discharges increased in some, but decreased in other wards. ALoS decreased more in treatment wards. Difference-in-differences results could not suggest causality between the PRG payment reform and changes in inpatient activity.ConclusionsFactors that may have hampered the effects of the reform are inadequate pricing of procedures, conflicting incentives created by other co-existing hospital-payment components, such as caps and retrospective subsidies, and the lack of resources to increase productivity. Payment reforms for health providers such as hospitals need to take into consideration the entire provider market, available resources, other - potentially conflicting - payment components, and the various parties involved and their interests.

TI  - Is surgical axillary staging necessary in women with T1 breast cancer who are treated with breast-conserving therapy?
T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the post-Z0011 trial era, the need to perform surgical axillary staging for early-stage breast cancer patients, who are treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT), is being questioned. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the safety of waiving surgical axillary staging in patients with T1 breast cancer treated with BCT.Methods: A total of 166,615 eligible patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2012 were divided into staging (sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection) and non-staging (no lymph node examined or only needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes) groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance disparities between the two groups. Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess factors related to breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).Results: Although the tumor size at time of presentation was decreasing over years, the rate of surgical axillary staging increased from 93.3% to 96.9%. The 5-year BCSS rates of the whole cohort (before PSM) and matched cohort (after PSM) were 98.0% and 97.5%. Within the matched cohort, the BCSS was significantly longer in the staging group than in the non-staging group (P < 0.001). However, surgical axillary staging did not benefit patients who were 50-79 years old, had tumor size < 1cm, histological grade I disease, or favorable histological types (tubular/mucinous/papillary) in stratified analyses (P > 0.05). Race, marital status, hormone receptors, and chemotherapy were not associated with the favorable impact of surgical axillary staging on BCSS (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Although surgical axillary staging remains important for T1 breast cancer patients treated with BCT, it might be unnecessary for patients with old age, small tumor, grade I disease, or favorable histological types.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation with a remotely sensed dry edge determination based on the land surface temperature-vegetation index method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches, which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources, and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale. However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots, which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping by using a geographic information system (GIS) along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (Karakoram Highway), Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram Highway (KKH) is an important route, which connects northern Pakistan with Western China. Presence of steep slopes, active faults and seismic zones, sheared rock mass, and torrential rainfall make the study area a unique geohazards laboratory. Since its construction, landslides constitute an appreciable threat, having blocked the KKH several times. Therefore, landslide susceptibility mapping was carried out in this study to support highway authorities in maintaining smooth and hazard-free travelling. Geological and geomorphological data were collected and processed using a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Different conditioning and triggering factors for landslide occurrences were considered for preparation of the susceptibility map. These factors include lithology, seismicity, rainfall intensity, faults, elevation, slope angle, aspect, curvature, land cover and hydrology. According to spatial and statistical analyses, active faults, seismicity and slope angle mainly control the spatial distribution of landslides. Each controlling parameter was assigned a numerical weight by utilizing the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Additionally, the weighted overlay method (WOL) was employed to determine landslide susceptibility indices. As a result, the landslide susceptibility map was produced. In the map, the KKH was subdivided into four different susceptibility zones. Some sections of the highway fall into high to very high susceptibility zones. According to results, active faults, slope gradient, seismicity and lithology have a strong influence on landslide events. Credibility of the map was validated by landslide density analysis (LDA) and receiver operator characteristics (ROC), yielding a predictive accuracy of 72 %, which is rated as satisfactory by previous researchers.

TI  - A segmentation algorithm for characterizing rise and fall segments in seasonal cycles: an application to XCO<sub>2</sub> to estimate benchmarks and assess model bias
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is more useful information in the time series of satellite-derived column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO2) than is typically characterized. Often, the entire time series is treated at once without considering detailed features at shorter timescales, such as nonstationary changes in signal characteristics - amplitude, period and phase. In many instances, signals are visually and analytically differentiable from other portions in a time series. Each rise (increasing) and fall (decreasing) segment in the seasonal cycle is visually discernable in a graph of the time series. The rise and fall segments largely result from seasonal differences in terrestrial ecosystem production, which means that the segment's signal characteristics can be used to establish observational benchmarks because the signal characteristics are driven by similar underlying processes. We developed an analytical segmentation algorithm to characterize the rise and fall segments in XCO2 seasonal cycles. We present the algorithm for general application of the segmentation analysis and emphasize here that the segmentation analysis is more generally applicable to cyclic time series.We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm with specific results related to the comparison between satellite-and model-derived XCO2 seasonal cycles (2009-2012) for large bioregions across the globe. We found a seasonal amplitude gradient of 0.74-0.77 ppm for every 10 degrees of latitude in the satellite data, with similar gradients for rise and fall segments. This translates to a south-north seasonal amplitude gradient of 8 ppm for XCO2, about half the gradient in seasonal amplitude based on surface site in situ CO2 data (similar to 19 ppm). The latitudinal gradients in the period of the satellite-derived seasonal cycles were of opposing sign and magnitude (-9 d per 10 degrees latitude for fall segments and 10 d per 10 degrees latitude for rise segments) and suggest that a specific latitude (similar to 2 degrees N) exists that defines an inversion point for the period asymmetry. Before (after) the point of asymmetry inversion, the periods of rise segments are lesser (greater) than the periods of fall segments; only a single model could reproduce this emergent pattern. The asymmetry in amplitude and the period between rise and fall segments introduces a novel pattern in seasonal cycle analyses, but, while we show these emergent patterns exist in the data, we are still breaking ground in applying the information for science applications. Maybe the most useful application is that the segmentation analysis allowed us to decompose the model biases into their correlated parts of biases in amplitude, period and phase independently for rise and fall segments. We offer an extended discussion on how such information about model biases and the emergent patterns in satellite-derived seasonal cycles can be used to guide future inquiry and model development.

TI  - Determinants of consistently high HIV prevalence in Indian Districts: A multi-level analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFactors associated with persistently high Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence levels in several districts of India are not well understood. This study was undertaken to determine the association of socio-demographic characteristics, economic factors, awareness about HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), and condom use with consistently high HIV prevalence in the Indian districts and to ascertain whether these associations differed across various regions of India.MethodsThis study was carried out including all 640 districts of India. Secondary analysis of data obtained from the Census of India-2011, HIV Sentinel Surveillance in India and District Level Household Survey-III was done. Population profile, socio-economic characteristics, levels of HIV/STI/condom awareness and condom use, were compared between the districts with and without consistently high HIV prevalence. Due to the presence of collinearity among predictor variables, we used principal component analysis and the principal component scores were included as covariates for further analysis. Considering the districts at level 1 and the regions at level 2, multi-level analysis was done by generalised linear mixed models. Variance partition coefficient and median odds ratio were also calculated.ResultsSixty-three districts with consistently high HIV prevalence were found clustered in the South and the North-east regions of India. Population size, density and urbanisation were found to be positively associated with consistently high HIV prevalence in these districts. Higher levels of literacy, better socio-economic status, higher proportion of population in reproductive age group and late marriages were positively associated with consistently high HIV prevalence in all regions of India except in the Southern region. Higher levels of knowledge about the role of condoms in HIV prevention and condom use were associated with low HIV prevalence at the district level.ConclusionsConsiderable heterogeneity among factors associated with consistently high HIV prevalence at the district level in different regions of India necessitates special region-specific strategies for HIV control. Increasing awareness about HIV alone is not sufficient for controlling the HIV epidemic and there is a need to raise knowledge levels about preventive measures against HIV and promote the use of condoms amongst population.

TI  - Forty-six years of Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance from 1972 to 2018
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We reconstruct the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet using a comprehensive survey of thickness, surface elevation, velocity, and surface mass balance (SMB) of 260 glaciers from 1972 to 2018. We calculate mass discharge, D, into the ocean directly for 107 glaciers (85% of D) and indirectly for 110 glaciers (15%) using velocity-scaled reference fluxes. The decadal mass balance switched from a mass gain of +47 +/- 21 Gt/y in 1972-1980 to a loss of 51 +/- 17 Gt/y in 1980-1990. The mass loss increased from 41 +/- 17 Gt/y in 1990-2000, to 187 +/- 17 Gt/y in 2000-2010, to 286 +/- 20 Gt/y in 2010-2018, or sixfold since the 1980s, or 80 +/- 6 Gt/y per decade, on average. The acceleration in mass loss switched from positive in 2000-2010 to negative in 2010-2018 due to a series of cold summers, which illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating short records into longer-term trends. Cumulated since 1972, the largest contributions to global sea level rise are from northwest (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm), southeast (3.0 +/- 0.3 mm), and central west (2.0 +/- 0.2 mm) Greenland, with a total 13.7 +/- 1.1 mm for the ice sheet. The mass loss is controlled at 66 +/- 8% by glacier dynamics (9.1 mm) and 34 +/- 8% by SMB (4.6 mm). Even in years of high SMB, enhanced glacier discharge has remained sufficiently high above equilibrium to maintain an annual mass loss every year since 1998.

TI  - Inverse Molecular Sentinel-Integrated Fiberoptic Sensor for Direct and <i>in Situ</i> Detection of miRNA Targets
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Molecular advances have been made in analysis systems for a wide variety of applications ranging from biodiagnostics, biosafety, bioengineering, and biofuel research applications. There are, however, limited practical tools necessary for in situ and accurate detection of nucleic acid targets during field work. New technology is needed to translate these molecular advances from laboratory settings into the real-life practical monitoring realm. The exquisite characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and adaptability) of plasmonic nanosensors have made them attractive candidates for field-ready sensing applications. Herein, we have developed a fiber-based plasmonic sensor capable of direct detection (i.e., no washing steps required) of nucleic acid targets, which can be detected simply by immerging the sensor in the sample solution. This sensor is composed of an optical fiber that is decorated with plasmonic nanoprobes based on silver-coated gold nanostars (AuNS@Ag) to detect target nucleic acids using referred to as inverse molecular sentinels (iMS). These fiber-optrodes can be reused for several detection-regeneration cycles (>6). The usefulness and applicability of the iMS fiber-sensors was tested by detecting target miRNA in extracts from leaves of plants that were induced to have different expression levels of miRNA targets. These fiber-optrodes enable direct detection of miRNA in plant tissue extract without the need for complex assays by simply immersing the fiber in the sample solution. The results indicate the fiber-based sensors developed herein have the potential to be a powerful tool for field and in situ analysis of nucleic acid samples.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explain the discipline of political economy in terms of the theory of conflict and conflict resolution on social matters. Such a theory arises substantively from the generalized and unique methodological worldview of unity of knowledge found in the Islamic epistemological case. Design/methodology/approach This paper simply uses this epistemic background without dwelling in details of the Islamic methodological worldview of unity of knowledge. Among the central social issues examined in this paper is that of preservation of peace in terms of pressing issues that complement with the concept of well-being. Findings The imminent study of political economy of socioeconomic development and United Nations Declaration of Human Rights is explained as a broader concept of peace as organic relational balance between the good and true pursuits of life in terms of common global well-being. Within this purview, analytical examination is made of various theoretical precepts. Within the same goal of peaceful coexistence and global conflict resolution, the official stand of Malaysia in global peace is enunciated. Originality/value The paper conveys a critical conceptual idea to debate the scope and approach of political economy of peace, development and law matters. The results of the approach used in this study constitute a major contribution of this paper to scholarship in general and acts as a critique of developmental thought of political economy of peace and law.

TI  - Immature dendritic cells navigate microscopic mazes to find tumor cells
T2  - LAB ON A CHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells with high sentinel ability to scan their neighborhood and to initiate an adaptive immune response. Whereas chemotactic migration of mature DCs (mDCs) towards lymph nodes is relatively well documented, the migratory behavior of immature DCs (imDCs) in tumor microenvironments is still poorly understood. Here, microfluidic systems of various geometries, including mazes, are used to investigate how the physical and chemical microenvironment influences the migration pattern of imDCs. Under proper degree of confinement, the imDCs are preferentially recruited towards cancer vs. normal cells, accompanied by increased cell speed and persistence. Furthermore, a systematic screen of cytokines, reveals that Gas6 is a major chemokine responsible for the chemotactic preference. These results and the accompanying theoretical model suggest that imDC migration in complex tissue environments is tuned by a proper balance between the strength of the chemical gradients and the degree of spatial confinement.

TI  - Scattering-mediated absorption from heterogeneous nanoparticle assemblies in diblock copolymer micelles for SERS enhancement
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasmonic superstructures composed of multiple metal nanoparticles (NPs) may represent an elegant example for hot-spot mediated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement. For sufficient SERS activity in the superstructures, the gap distance between adjacent NPs has to be engineered to be as small as possible, and often a sub-5 nm gap distance is necessary to create intensive hot spots. However, despite the recent advances in synthesis, the preparation of such plasmonic superstructures still requires laborious assembly, purification, and separation steps. In addition, the resulting plasmonic assemblies often undergo agglomeration and conformational change, which deteriorates the uniformity of the gap distance as well as SERS reproducibility. To overcome these issues, we utilized the self-segregating behavior of block copolymer micelles, and concomitantly functionalized the core and corona of micelles with different kinds of metal NPs. The prepared micellar NP assemblies structurally resembled colloidal core-satellite NP assemblies and exhibited strong SERS activity. However, unlike the initial expectation, the plasmonic coupling between dissimilar NPs was blocked in the micellar structure. Alternatively, we discovered that the local field inside the micellar NP assembly could be enormously amplified by multiple scattering processes, which significantly increased the path length of incident photons for SERS enhancement.

TI  - Load Stress Controls on Directional Lava Dome Growth at Volcan de Colima, Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During eruptive activity of andesitic stratovolcanoes, the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse and intermittent explosions are common volcanic hazards. Many lava domes grow in a preferred direction, in turn affecting the direction of lava flows and pyroclastic density currents. Access to active lava domes is difficult and hazardous, so detailed data characterizing lava dome growth are typically limited, keeping the processes controlling the directionality of extrusions unclear. Here we combine TerraSAR-X satellite radar observations with high-resolution airborne photogrammetry to assess morphological changes, and perform finite element modeling to investigate the impact of loading stress on shallow magma ascent directions associated with lava dome extrusion and crater formation at Volcan de Colima, Mexico. The TerraSAR-X data, acquired in similar to 1-m resolution spotlight mode, enable us to derive a chronology of the eruptive processes from intensity-based time-lapse observations of the general crater and dome evolution. The satellite images are complemented by close-range airborne photos, processed by the Structure-from-Motion workflow. This allows the derivation of high-resolution digital elevation models, providing insight into detailed loading and unloading features. During the observation period from Jan-2013 to Feb-2016, we identify a dominantly W-directed dome growth and lava flow production until Jan-2015. In Feb-2015, following the removal of the active summit dome, the surface crater widened and elongated along a NE-SW axis. Later in May-2015, a new dome grew toward the SW of the crater while a separate vent developed in the NE of the crater, reflecting a change in the direction of magma ascent and possible conduit bifurcation. Finite element models show a significant stress change in agreement with the observed magma ascent direction changes in response to the changing surface loads, both for loading (dome growth) and unloading (crater forming excavation) cases. These results allow insight into shallow dome growth dynamics and the migration of magma ascent in response to changing volcano summit morphology. They further highlight the importance of detailed volcano summit morphology surveillance, as changes in direction or location of dome extrusion may have major implications regarding the directions of potential volcanic hazards, such as pyroclastic density currents generated by dome collapse.

TI  - Exploring English speaking Muslim women's first-time maternity experiences: a qualitative longitudinal interview study
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMuslim women of child-bearing age make up a fair part of the UK society, however, literature addressing their health needs or experiences of health services have not been extensively researched. The term Muslim' is often combined with ethnic group identity, rather than used to refer to people distinguished by beliefs or affiliations. Muslim women commonly observe certain religious and cultural practices during their maternity journey. The little research there is in this area suggests that more could be done from a service provision perspective to support Muslim women through this significant life event. The aim of this study was to investigate Muslim women's perceived needs and the factors that influence their health seeking decisions when engaging with maternity services located in North-West of England.MethodsThe study used longitudinal semi-structured interviews with seven English-speaking first-time pregnant Muslim women receiving maternity care in North-West of England. Total of 21 interview; each woman was interviewed during the antenatal (29 to 40weeks of pregnancy), immediate postnatal (within the first 2 months after birth) and later postnatal (4 months after birth) period. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using Braun & Clark (2006) as a guide to forming a systematic approach to handling raw data.ResultsMuslim women associated most aspects of the maternity journey with their religious beliefs. Religion was not the primary reason for them becoming pregnant, yet it was an aspiration for them becoming mothers. Emerging themes include: 1) a spiritual perspective; 2) expression of religious requirements; 3) perceptions of healthcare professionals. Religious values and practices provided a positive resource for women during their maternity journey. They described how healthcare professionals approached their needs, while highlighting their concerns of the negative presentation of Muslims in Western media.ConclusionMuslim women need to feel confident to express their needs within a maternity setting. Lack of awareness amongst healthcare professionals around religious values and how Muslim women may feel when expressing their needs can inhibit them getting optimal care that acknowledges their needs. The study concludes that educating healthcare professionals about Muslim women's worldview would enhance the quality of maternity care for Muslim women.

M3  - Article
AB  - Although major reductions in maternal and child mortality were achieved in the Millennium Development Goals era, progress must be accelerated to meet Sustainable Development Goals health targets by 2030. An estimated 2.7 million neonatal deaths and 2.6 million stillbirths still occur annually. Over the past several years there has been renewed global interest in innovative approaches to maternal immunization to potentially decrease mortality and severe morbidity in neonates, and in the pregnant woman and her fetus. Several new vaccines are in clinical development for indications in pregnant women, e.g., vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, and group B streptococcus. Achieving near-concurrent introduction of new maternal vaccines in high-, middle-, and low-income countries requires that mechanisms are in place for appropriate safety monitoring worldwide.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation convened a global expert meeting in Amsterdam on May 1-2, 2018, to discuss a framework for appropriate pharmacovigilance for vaccines used during pregnancy based on integrated maternal interventions vigilance (MIV) systems and collection of appropriate data to inform timely decision-making by and for pregnant women. Planning for MIV requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach that fully leverages and builds upon existing resources, and builds new capabilities and capacity where needed. Meeting participants identified priority actions including (1) establishing background rates to better evaluate emerging safety signals and vaccine effectiveness, (2) identifying potential sentinel vaccine surveillance sites, (3) developing data sharing capabilities, (4) creating guidance documents and protocols, and (5) the advanced preparation of culturally-appropriate communication plans and risk management plans.Integrating MIV across the routine obstetric and neonatal health care delivery continuum and all relevant programs and data systems could result in fundamental improvements in maternal, neonatal and child health. Improved pregnancy pharmacovigilance platforms may strengthen other vaccine and drug product safety systems and improve maternal and child research capabilities in LMICs.

TI  - Randomized comparison between indocyanine green fluorescence plus <SUP>99</SUP><SUP>m</SUP>technetium and <SUP>99</SUP><SUP>m</SUP>technetium alone methods for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Use of both patent blue and a radioisotope to locate, and reduce the risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection failure in breast cancer is recommended, but drawbacks commonly lead to using only a radioisotope. An alternative method would therefore be valuable. This randomized, controlled study in 99 patients compared SLN detection using (99m)technetium (Tc) alone versus Tc combined with indocyanine green (ICG). The primary endpoint was the SLN identification rate. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients with <2 SLN detected. One SLN was detected in 44.0% of patients in the dual detection group and 40.8% in the Tc-99(m) alone group (RR = 1.08 (95% CI 0.68; 1.72), p = 0.84). A mean (+/- SD) of 2.14 +/- 1.23 SLN were identified in the dual detection group vs. 1.77 +/- 0.85 using Tc alone (p = 0.09). Eight-five (78.7%) SLN were both ICG+ and TC+, 15 (13.9%) ICG+ and Tc-, and 7 (6.5%) ICG- and Tc+. SLN detected were ICG-positive in 92.6% of patients and Tc-99m-positive in 85.2% with. No adverse event related to ICG injection was recorded. Dual detection of SLN using ICG and radioisotope is reliable and sensitive but was not superior to isotope alone in successfully locating SLN in our pilot randomized trial.

TI  - Afterslip evolution on the crustal ramp of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault following the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current afterslip models of the Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake contradict with the depth ranges of relocated aftershock distribution and inter-seismic locked-creeping transition zone. We use both GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to image the afterslip evolution in the first 189 post-seismic days, i.e., from 25 April to 1 November 2015. In the study region, 51 GPS stations are divided into three categories based on their observation time: (1) 25 stations with both pre- and post-seismic observations, (2) 16 stations with only post-seismic observations, and (3) 10 stations with only pre-seismic observations. The secular tectonic motion and seasonal variations are corrected carefully and directly using the fitted functions from the pre-seismic position time series. During the inversions, we adopt the widely accepted flat-ramp-flat geometrical model of the Main Frontal Thrust fault (MFT)-Main Himalayan Thrust fault (MHT). The preferred weight ratios between GPS and InSAR observations are elaborately determined through comprehensive analysis of model resolution and fitting residuals. In contrast to previous afterslip models, our preferred afterslip distributes on the crustal ramp of the MHT from depths of 11 to 29 km, which is verified by further inversions using only GPS data and check-erboard resolution tests. The seismic moment released by the afterslip in the first six months is 3.42 x 10(19) N m, only approximately 4% of the mainshock moment. The rupture gap between the mainshock and the 12 May aftershock is filled up with post-seismic aseismic slip.

TI  - Short-time near-the-money skew in rough fractional volatility models
T2  - QUANTITATIVE FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider rough stochastic volatility models where the driving noise of volatility has fractional scaling, in the 'rough' regime of Hurst parameter . This regime recently attracted a lot of attention both from the statistical and option pricing point of view. With focus on the latter, we sharpen the large deviation results of Forde-Zhang [Asymptotics for rough stochastic volatility models. SIAM J. Financ. Math., 2017, 8(1), 114-145] in a way that allows us to zoom-in around the money while maintaining full analytical tractability. More precisely, this amounts to proving higher order moderate deviation estimates, only recently introduced in the option pricing context. This in turn allows us to push the applicability range of known at-the-money skew approximation formulae from CLT type log-moneyness deviations of order (works of Alos, Leon & Vives and Fukasawa) to the wider moderate deviations regime.

TI  - Bicycle model on climate change education: presenting and evaluating a model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents and evaluates a model made for climate change education - the bicycle model. The model was created based on an extensive literature review, from which, essential aspects of climate change education were drawn out. The bicycle model is a representation of holistic climate change education and emphasizes the importance of the following aspects: knowledge, thinking skills, values, identity, worldview, action, motivation, participation, future orientation, hope and other emotions, and operational barriers. In this study, the model is also evaluated by climate education researchers and educators. The evaluation was done through documented group discussions and an electronic questionnaire. The findings suggest that the model is useful in developing climate change education policy, research and practice. The findings also give insight into expert's perceptions on climate education. Finally, the article discusses how this model could be developed further.

TI  - <i>Actinin</i>-<i>4</i> as a Diagnostic Biomarker in Serum of Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: a-actinin-4 (Actinin-4 or ACTN4), originally identified as an actin-binding protein associated with the biological function of cancer cells, appears to be highly expressed in numerous human epithelial carcinomas, including breast cancer (BC). In the present study we assessed the role of serum ACTN4 as a biomarker for BC diagnosis, as well as the association between ACTN4 levels and clinicopathological features.Material/Methods: ACTN4 expression level was measured with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis in serum specimens of 128 BC patients and 96 healthy volunteers chi(2) testing was conducted to explore the association of ACTN4 levels with clinicopathologic factors. Moreover, the diagnostic value of ACTN4 was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Results: Serum ACTN4 level was obviously upregulated in patients with BC compared with healthy controls (P< 0.05). High ACTN4 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage (P= 0.000), tumor grade (P= 0.004), and lymph node status (P= 0.024). However, no association was found between ACTN4 expression and age, tumor size, ER status, PR status, or HER-2 status (all P> 0.05). The ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of ACTN4 was 0.887 (95% CI: 0.843-0.931), with sensitivity of 80.5% and specificity of 84.4%, and the cutoff value was 1.050.Conclusions: ACTN4 in serum can serve as a clinical predictor in the diagnosis or prediction of clinical outcomes of patients with BC.

TI  - Laboratory and field tests of predation on the cereal leaf beetle, <i>Oulema melanopus</i> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cereal leaf beetle (CLB), Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an invasive pest in North America recently reported in the Canadian Prairies. We performed a series of laboratory assays to identify potential predators and a field study to quantify predation of CLB eggs. In no-choice Petri dish assays, ground beetles (Carabidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and several common lady beetle species (Coccinellidae) were the most consistent predators of eggs and larvae. Nabis spp. (Hemiptera: Nabidae) and wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) consumed many larvae, but did not consume eggs. Hippodamia spp., Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera: Carabidae) also fed on CLB eggs on potted plants when an alternative food source was available, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). In our field study, we found an average of 24.5% of sentinel eggs disappeared over a 24 h period, likely due to predation. Our results suggest that generalist predators can play an important role in the biological control of CLB, and warrant further study.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids to mitigate relapse in children assessed and treated for acute asthma: A network meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTHMA
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effectiveness of various systemic corticosteroid (SCS) regimens to mitigate relapse in children with asthma discharged from an acute care setting. Data Sources: Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMB ALL, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS were searched using controlled vocabulary and key words. Additional citations were searched via clinical trial registries, Google Scholar, bibliographies, a SCOPUS forward search of a sentinel paper, and hand searching conference abstracts. Study Selection: No limitations based on language, publication status, or year of publication were applied. Two independent reviewers searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of SCS regimens to prevent relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma. Results: Fifteen studies were included. In 3 studies comparing SCS to placebo, asthma relapse was significantly reduced (RR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.77; I-2 = 0%). A network analysis identified a significant reduction in relapse in children treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (OR = 0.038; 95% CrI: 0.001, 0.397), short-course oral prednisone (OR = 0.054; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.451), and oral dexamethasone (OR = 0.071; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.733) compared to placebo. Conclusion: This review found evidence that SCS reduces relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma, albeit based on a limited number of studies. Additional studies are required to assess the differential effect of SCS doses and treatment duration to prevent relapse in children following discharge for acute asthma.

TI  - Cultural cognition and climate change education in the US: why consensus is not enough
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating climate change into environmental education programs and formal science classrooms can be difficult, as the issue remains controversial and highly politicized among the American public. This study proposes that the same cultural values that shape worldview differences and divide public opinion on anthropogenic climate change will influence if and how science educators support education on the topic. An online survey with quantitative and qualitative measures was distributed among science educators in the southeastern United States to test what, if any, impact cultural cognition has on their opinions about climate change education. The results suggest that respondents' cultural values have a significant influence on their intentions to support climate change education and preferences for curricula content. The findings also suggest potential avenues for the field of environmental education to develop climate change materials that may help decrease unintentional biases among science educators and more effectively engage their support in teaching its causes and potential solutions regardless of worldview differences.

TI  - Parasitism of frozen <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> eggs by <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i>: applications for rearing and experimentation
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), has become a well-known pest to growers and homeowners since its 1996 introduction to the United States. A classical biocontrol programme is under development using the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus. Widespread implementation of biocontrol requires efficient mass rearing, which is constrained by the availability of fresh H. halys eggs. In this study, parasitism rate, developmental time, sex ratio and size were compared between wasps reared on fresh versus frozen, newly laid (<1 d old) versus variably aged (0-3 d old), and frozen egg masses stored <= 4 y. Frozen eggs yielded 56-65% fewer wasps, with parasitism rate decreasing 1-3% per month stored. Parasitism rate, sex ratio and developmental time were comparable between newly laid and variably aged eggs. Freezing eggs for any duration did not affect sex ratio or weight of emerged wasps, but delayed emergence 5-6 d. To simulate deployment of sentinel eggs in the field, we incubated frozen eggs at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C for 1-9 d before exposing them to T. japonicus, then evaluated parasitism trends. Trissolcus japonicus parasitism rate decreased 5-8% per day incubated, unhatched wasps increased 9% per day incubated and sex ratio was not impacted. Variably aged, frozen and longer stored eggs can be used for T. japonicus rearing and experimentation without affecting emerged wasp sex ratio or size within one generation, but have lower parasitism and slower development. Frozen sentinel eggs are effective <3-5 d, especially in hot conditions.

TI  - Mangrove cover and cover change analysis in the transboundary area of Kenya and Tanzania during 1986-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Some of these forests traverse national boundaries complicating their management due to differences in governance structures between countries. To improve the management of transboundary species regular monitoring is essential. Remotely sensed data were used to estimate forest cover and analyze conditions of mangroves in the proposed transboundary conservation area (TBCA) between Kenya and Tanzania. Image analysis was performed using unsupervised and supervised classification methods. The transboundary mangroves cover an estimated 11,906 ha; 55% being in Kenya, 45% in Tanzania. Ceriops tagal, Avicennia marina, and Rhizophora mucronata species co-dominate the mangroves of the transboundary area. The hotspot for loss and degradation of mangrove in the TBCA is Vanga in Kenya with a loss of 27 ha/yr. Harvesting of mangrove wood products have contributed to the loss of mangroves in the transboundary area. TBCA formation could play a critical role in ensuring sustainable mangrove resources utilization.

TI  - A suite of macrophyte species distribution models for investigating hydrology-driven spatial changes in a large flood-pulsed tropical wetland
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial ecological models of wetland systems are important tools for evaluating system response to changes in hydrological inputs, arising from anthropogenic manipulation or climate change. We present an approach using multiple species distribution models (SDMs) for floodplain macrophytes, based on empirical relationships with flood duration. 27 indicator species were identified for four floodplain classes in a seasonally pulsed distributary of the Okavango Delta, based on data from a field survey of 30 floodplain sites. Spatial hydrological history was constructed using a combination of Landsat and MODIS imagery, and ground-truthing. Relationships between duration and occurrence were used to construct general linear probability models (GLMs) of species along the hydroperiod gradient. The GLM parameters were then used to construct SDMs driven by a spatial hydrological model, which generates annual assessments of inundation duration in months in each 1km(2) cell across the Delta. The modelled distribution fits were mostly robust (18 GLMs had p < 0.05). Tests of model performance against a validation set of five floodplain sites showed an average of 87% correct predictions of presence. The strong performance of the models and the ability to produce map-based and quantitative output indicate good potential for use in assessment of basin development scenarios.

TI  - Progress in rainfall-runoff modelling - contribution of remote sensing
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface runoff modelling is crucial, particularly in regions with inadequate hydrometric networks such as southern Africa. In southern Africa, rainfall patterns are erratic with frequent droughts being common. Yet due to population growth, water consumption has increased, posing significant challenges to water resources management to meet demand. It is also anticipated that climate change will increase rainfall variability and drought and this is likely to create challenges for water resources management. In this regard, understanding different water balance components is thus critical to conserve and improve water management strategies. In this paper we present progress and challenges in the modelling of surface runoff, which is one of the key components of water balance, affecting surface water availability. For decades, ground-based measurements and hydrological models have been used to understand surface runoff. Nevertheless, the emergences and advances in remote sensing provide a new horizon to model different water balance components. Specifically, the aim of this work is to provide a detailed overview of the different approaches for modelling surface runoff, which include the use of empirical models and remotely sensed data, in southern Africa. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the highlighted approaches in understanding the variations in surface runoff are also discussed. The paper also recommends possible directions in which future studies may fill existing gaps in rainfall-runoff literature.

TI  - Quantifying local fire regimes using the Landsat data-archive: a conceptual framework to derive detailed fire pattern metrics from pixel-level information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Free and open access to the Landsat archive has enabled the detection and delineation of an unprecedented number of fire events across the globe. Despite the availability and potential of these data, few studies have analysed residual vegetation patterns and/or partial mortality of fire across the Canadian boreal forest, and those available, are either incomplete or inaccurate. Further, they all differ in the methods and spatial language, which makes it difficult for managers to interpret fire patterns over large areas. There is an urgent need for methods to help unify fire pattern observations across the Canadian boreal forest. This study explores the capacity of the Landsat data archive when coupled with a recently developed fire mapping approach and a robust spatial language to characterize and compare tree mortality patterns across the boreal plains ecozone, Canada. With 507 fires 2.5 Mha mapped, this study represents the most comprehensive analysis of mortality patterns for study area. Summaries from this demonstration generated an accurate characterization of the fire patterns the various ecoregions based on seven key fire metrics. The comparison between ecoregions revealed differences in the amount of residual vegetation, which in turn suggested various climate, topography and/or vegetation ecosystem drivers.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to develop a method to retrieve the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) simultaneously from Landsat-8 satellite images. LST and LSE can be retrieved from Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) but estimating LST and LSE from RTE is an undetermined problem. In this study, in order to solve this problem, an approach is proposed which include an equation set of RTE for band10 of Landsat-8 and two additional equations based on the regression relation between the Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) bands with mean and difference between LSEs of Landsat-8 thermal bands and then solving the equation set using the iterative weighted least squares approach. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested using simulated and satellite dataset. For satellite dataset, results show that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of LST is 1.72 K and RMSEs of LSEs for bands10 and 11 are 0.0057 and 0.0071, respectively. Also for simulated data, RMSE of LST is 1.16 K and RMSEs of LSEs for bands10 and 11 are 0.0063 and 0.0066, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of urban surface thermal environment using MODIS with a population-weighted method: a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, taking the Hefei City in China as an example, a population-weighted urbansurface thermalenvironment index (I-PWUSTE) is constructed with the MODIS-based land surface temperature (LST) and the spatial population retrieved from night-time light satellite observations. The results show that the spatial distribution of I-PWUSTE corresponds well with the actual distribution of the urbanland covers with their surface thermalenvironments (STEs). Firstly, I-PWUSTE can consider and reliably reflect the anthropogenic effects on the urban surface, because spatial I-PWUSTE matches well with spatial population and city size. Secondly, I-PWUSTE is also useful to understand and reveal the population exposure to high temperature. Thirdly, comparing with the 1-km grid MODIS-based LST, I-PWUSTE has a higher resolution of 0.5-km and improves the spatial description of STEs. Over all, I-PWUSTE can be effectively applied to reveal the heat exposure of a population and to alleviateheatwave impacts in urban areas in the summer.

TI  - Vertical accuracy evaluation of freely available latest high-resolution (30 m) global digital elevation models over Cameroon (Central Africa) with GPS/leveling ground control points.
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contain topographic relief data that are vital for many geoscience applications. This study relies on the vertical accuracy of publicly available latest high-resolution (30 m) global DEMs over Cameroon. These models are (1) the ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D30), (2) the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 1 Arc-Second C-Band Global DEM (SRTM 1) and (3) the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Global DEM Version 2 (ASTER GDEM 2). After matching their coordinate systems and datums, the horizontal positional accuracy evaluation was carried out and it shows that geolocation errors significantly influence the vertical accuracy of global DEMs. After this, the three models are compared among them, in order to access random and systematic effects in the elevation data each of them contains. Further, heights from 555 GPS/leveling points distributed all over Cameroon are compared to each DEM, for their vertical accuracy determination. Traditional and robust statistical measures, normality test, outlier detection and removal were used to describe the vertical quality of the DEMs. The test of the normality rejected the hypothesis of normal distribution for all tested global DEMs. Overall vertical accuracies obtained for the three models after georeferencing and gross error removal in terms of Root Mean Square (RMS) and Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) are: AW3D30 (13.06 m and 7.75 m), SRTM 1 (13.25 m and 7.41 m) and ASTER GDEM 2 (18.87 m and 13.30 m). Other accuracy measures (MED, 68.3% quantile, 95% quantile) supply some evidence of the good quality of AW3D30 over Cameroon. Further, the effect of land cover and slope on DEM vertical accuracy was also analyzed. All models have proved to be worse in the areas dominated by forests and shrubs areas. SRTM 1 and AW3D30 are more resilient to the effects of the scattering objects respectively in forests and cultivated areas. The dependency of DEMs accuracy on the terrain roughness is evident. In all slope intervals, AW3D30 is performing better than SRTM 1 and ASTER GDEM 2 over Cameroon. AW3D30 is more representative of the external topography over Cameroon in comparison with two others datasets and SRTM 1 can be a serious alternative to AW3D30 for a range of DEM applications in Cameroon.

TI  - Amery Ice Shelf surface snowmelt detected by ASCAT and Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread movement of meltwater has been found on the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS). Intensive surface snowmelt could accelerate ice loss and endanger the ice shelves under climate warming. In this study, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) was used to study the detailed melt patterns on the AIS, which was confirmed by the wet snow mapped by Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with a much higher spatial resolution. Melt seasons were longer than 50 days in the eastern part of AIS. Conversely, a large proportion of the western AIS only melted occasionally for several days with the exception of blue ice areas. Two obvious snowmelt patterns are found on the AIS. First, the opposing summer katabatic wind directions on the eastern and western sides of the AIS result in a warmer eastern AIS compared with the western side, which leads to the expansion of snowmelt from east to west on the AIS. Second, intense snowmelt was found in the grounding zone with low-albedo blue ice and rock outcrops. However, ASCAT fails to detect snowmelt in these places due to the dominated surface radar scattering. AIS melt patterns are determined by both meteorological conditions and the underlying surface.

TI  - Effect of meteorological factors on influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2015 in Huludao, a northeastern city in China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. This study aims to describe the epidemiological patterns of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Huludao, China and seek scientific evidence on the link of ILI activity with weather factors.Methods. Surveillance data of ILI cases between January 2012 and December 2015 was collected in Huludao Central Hospital, meteorological data was obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center. Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to seek the relationship between the number of ILI cases and the meteorological factors. Multiple Smoothing parameter estimation was made on the basis of Poisson distribution, where the number of weekly ILI cases was treated as response, and the smoothness of weather was treated as covariates. Lag time was determined by the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC). Smoothing coefficients were estimated for the prediction of the number of ILI cases.Results. A total of 29, 622 ILI cases were observed during the study period, with children ILI cases constituted 86.77%. The association between ILI activity and meteorological factors varied across different lag periods. The lag time for average air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, vapor pressure and relative humidity were 2, 2, 1, 1 and 0 weeks, respectively. Average air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, vapor pressure and relative humidity could explain 16.5%, 9.5%, 18.0%, 15.9% and 7.7% of the deviance, respectively. Among the temperature indexes, the minimum temperature played the most important role. The number of ILI cases peaked when minimum temperature was around -13 degrees C in winter and 18 degrees C in summer. The number of cases peaked when the relative humidity was equal to 43% and then began to decrease with the increase of relative humidity. When the humidity exceeded 76%, the number of ILI cases began to rise.Conclusions. The present study first analyzed the relationship between meteorological factors and ILI cases with special consideration of the length of lag period in Huludao, China. Low air temperature and low relative humidity (cold and dry weather condition) played a considerable role in the epidemic pattern of ILI cases. The trend of ILI activity could be possibly predicted by the variation of meteorological factors.

TI  - Reducing the impacts of intra-class spectral variability on the accuracy of soft classification and super-resolution mapping of shoreline
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to assess the impact of intra-class spectral variation on the accuracy of soft classification and super-resolution mapping. The accuracy of both analyses was negatively related to the degree of intra-class spectral variation, but the effect could be reduced through the use of spectral sub-classes. The latter is illustrated in mapping the shoreline at a sub-pixel scale from Landsat ETM+ data. Reducing the degree of intra-class spectral variation increased the accuracy of soft classification, with the correlation between predicted and actual class coverage rising from 0.87 to 0.94, and super-resolution mapping, with the RMSE in shoreline location decreasing from 41.13 m to 35.22 m.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of coastal reclamation activities on seagrass meadows in Sungai Pulai estuary, Malaysia, using Landsat data (1994-2017)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows play a critical role in supporting coastal biodiversity and in providing food and habitats for other marine organisms but are continuously threatened by human activities, such as coastal reclamation in the maritime countries. The Sungai Pulai estuary harbours mangroves, mudflats, and shoals with one of the Malaysia's largest seagrass meadow (Merambong, Tanjung Adang, and Tanjung Laut) in Johor, Malaysia. This study assessed the environmental impact of coastal reclamation activities based on Landsat imagery (1994-2017) through mapping cover and distribution changes of those seagrass meadows by using a previously developed image enhancement technique with further improvement in the classification scheme (87% overall accuracy). The image-difference maps showed changes in seagrass meadows and mudflat cover with the extension of reclaimed land. Some seagrass meadows experienced large-scale changes, and coastal reclamation activities have been suggested as main factors responsible for habitat degradation, reduction in coverage, and total loss due to physical damage and excessive sedimentation. Sufficient protection of on-site construction materials is essential if coastal areas are to conserve seagrass meadows. This Landsat-based image classification approach should help the coastal manager to map seagrass meadows and to monitor the environmental impact of reclamation activities with a large spatio-temporal scale.

TI  - Satellite-based analysis of regional evapotranspiration trends in a semi-arid area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A regional framework for a spatial and temporal distributed assessment of time series trends in the hydrological variable and its related ecological factors of an arid area was presented in this research. To achieve this, we tested the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithm for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) in regional scale and the result was further validated by water budget. The ET assessment was applied for the Yinchuan and Weining (YW) Plains (China), the upstream areas of the Yellow River. Moreover, we analysed the recent trends (from year 2001 to 2014) in actual ET, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), farmland and wetland using a combination of remote sensing and ground observations. The results illustrated that the yearly ET of 78% areas has no change during the study period and the areas with decreasing ET are larger than the areas with increasing trend. The highest decreasing rate is observed in urban areas and the value is -20 mm year(-1), while the rate of increasing trend is especially higher in the wetlands reaching around 60 mm year(-1). This phenomenon can be explained by changes in NDVI, farmland and wetland. The distribution and magnitude of NDVI trends shows that the higher NDVI (NDVI > 0.4) area is occupied 56% and the farmland (NDVI > 0.55) covered about 35% of the YW Plains. The increasing trends of mean NDVI is mostly observed in farmland and shrub covers, while the decreasing NDVI areas are mainly wetlands and urban area. The emerging image showed that the greening trend of vegetation and variation of evapotranspiration in the YW Plains are related to land-cover changes and to the adjustment of crop pattern for agriculture. The increasing of wetland area is also believed as a cause related to evapotranspiration change. Such spatiotemporally distributed analysis in regional level is important for water management at this scale, which can be also applied to other similar areas.

TI  - An Object-Based Assessment of Multi-Wavelength SAR, Optical Imagery and Topographical Datasets for Operational Wetland Mapping in Boreal Yukon, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors evaluated multiple remotely sensed datasets for their contributions to operational wetland mapping in a subarctic, boreal cordillera study site in Yukon, Canada. They assessed Sentinel-2 optical imagery, Sentinel-1 C-band and ALOS PALSAR L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and topographical data from the territorial digital elevation model (DEM) using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. Three machine-learning algorithms were tested, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), using various data combinations (11 model scenarios). RF produced the most accurate results when incorporating all optical, SAR and DEM data (86.5%, kappa 0.84), with open water (100% producer accuracy, PA), marsh (75% PA) and swamps (85.7% PA) being detected most accurately. When assessed in isolation, Sentinel-2 optical data consistently generated more accurate classifications than either SAR platform or DEM data. RF variable importance metrics provided further explanation to these results, indicating the 8 most powerful variables to be optical. Variable reduction tests also produced comparable accuracies, indicating that an optimal RF model can be built based on predictive power rankings. The results can be used to inform resource managers on the efficacy of current datasets and their applications to wetland mapping in northern, subarctic environments.

TI  - On the analysis of a time series of X-band TerraSAR-X SAR imagery over oil seepages
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A large time series of 42 dual-polarimetric co-polarized TerraSAR-X (TSX) StripMap Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements are exploited to monitor a well-known oil seep area, i.e., the Taylor Energy site in the Gulf of Mexico. A comprehensive scattering analysis is undertaken to assess the impact of SAR imaging parameters (polarization, angle of incidence - AOI, noise floor) and environmental conditions (wind speed - WS, oil properties) on single-polarization SAR-based sea oil seep observation. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the scattering-based information derived from the time series of TSX SAR imagery. A two-scale backscattering model is considered to give a physical framework that supports a better understanding of the effects of the above-mentioned factors. Experimental results showed that the high TSX noise floor significantly limits a reliable interpretation of the slick-free sea surface and oil seep backscattering at AOIs larger than 34 and 26, respectively, since they are contaminated by noise. Hence, it is shown that, at larger AOIs, the joint contribution of noisy SAR measurements and low oil backscattering does not result in a larger oil/sea separability. The latter is not remarkably influenced by polarization and WS, under low-to-moderate conditions. Experiments also demonstrate that, when reliable SAR measurements are available, sea oil seep backscattering is affected by the oil's damping properties more than its concentration in the water column. The time variability of the polluted area is also estimated using the time series of TSX imagery and the obtained results agree with independent analysis undertaken on the same test site.

TI  - An evaluation of efficacy of the auto-dissemination technique as a tool for Aedes aegypti control in Madeira, Portugal
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe frequency and intensity of arboviral epidemics is steadily increasing and posing an intractable public health burden. Current vector control methods are proving ineffectual and despite progress in the development of high technology approaches, there is an urgent need for the development of tools for immediate implementation. Several studies suggest that theauto-dissemination of pyriproxyfen (PPF) is a promising new approach to larviciding although there is little detail on the conditions under which it is optimally effective. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of the approach in urban and rural sites in Madeira, Portugal.ResultsAuto-dissemination of PPF through adapted Biogents Sentinel traps (BGSTs) resulted in a modest but consistent impact on both juvenile and adult mosquito populations, but with considerable spatial heterogeneity. This heterogeneity was related to the distance from the BGST dissemination station as well as the local density of adult mosquitoes. There was evidence that the impact of PPF was cumulative over time both locally and with gradual spatial expansion.ConclusionsThe density of adult mosquitoes and the spatial distribution of dissemination devices are key factors in mediating efficacy. In addition, urban topography may affect the efficiency of auto-dissemination by impeding adult mosquito dispersal. Further studies in a range of urban landscapes are necessary to guide optimal strategies for the implementation of this potentially efficacious and cost-effective approach to larviciding.

TI  - Long-Term Evolution of Morphology at Loc An Estuary, Vung Tau, Vietnam
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the downdrift coast of the Loc An river mouth, Vung Tau province, Vietnam was subject to severe erosion. This was mainly due to the downdrift migration of the river mouth which had reached in total several kilometers over the past 30 years. This study presents the migration of the Loc An river mouth and the related consequences using long-term satellite images and field data. According to wave data analysis, the waves were separated in two different monsoon seasons, northeast and southwest and the characteristics of these waves in the two seasons are noticeably different. This led to contrary dominant directions of the longshore sediment transport between the two monsoon seasons. The river mouth migrated in the southwest direction around 3000 m in the period from 1979 to 2017 (80 m/year). This migration caused the erosion and the collapsing of the geotextile jetties on the right side of the river mouth. The change rate of the surface area of the updrift sand spit is utilized to estimate the longshore sediment rate which equals the order of 2.0 x 10(5) m(3)/year. It was noted that a re-occurrence of the breaching would be very difficult in the future due to the strengthening of the back side of updrift sand spit and the operation of the Song Ray reservoir. The migration caused the two jetties to become obsolete, which were constructed to stabilize the river mouth and ensure a smooth passage for the fishing boats. The primary action would be to remove the jetties, however, if this action proves too difficult to be actualized, immediate action like dredging deposited sediment and closing the gap would need to be taken in order for the jetties to become functional again. Additionally, this study illustrates the usefulness of using satellite images to investigate the long-term evolution of the morphology which is still active and where there is still a large amount of change such as in the river mouth area. This is very useful for the research carried out at this specific place or in the country which has limitations in the field and observed data.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Current development of landscape geochemistry with support of geospatial technologies: A review
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As a cross-disciplinary scientific domain, a great deal of research on landscape geochemistry has been conducted since its establishment. However, the used methods lack the ability of revealing the relationships of landscape geochemistry with other sciences, and the obtained knowledge is thus fragmented and isolated. In this study, the state-of-the-art regarding the applications of relatively new geospatial technologies including fractal theory, geographic information system and remote sensing to landscape geochemistry was reviewed and analyzed to provide deep insights of current research and a roadmap for furthering the development of landscape geochemistry as a cross-disciplinary discipline. The results showed that substantial research on the applications of fractal theory, GIS and RS technologies for analyzing the processes and data of landscape geochemistry has been conducted by using the advantages of the geospatial technologies. However, the great challenges still exist when the geospatial technologies were individually utilized due to the limitations of the technologies themselves and the complexity of landscape geochemistry. In the end, opportunities and challenges for advancing the further studies of landscape geochemistry were discussed in detail and new directions of studying landscape geochemistry using multidisciplinary or integrated approaches to enhance understanding the relationships among the relevant disciplines were suggested.

TI  - Analysis of remotely-sensed ecological indexes' influence on urban thermal environment dynamic using an integrated ecological index: a case study of Xi'an, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal pattern of surface ecological status affects urban thermal environment distribution significantly. Urban thermal pattern, however, is a complicated physical phenomenon involving a series of terrestrial environmental parameters. Thus, it is insufficient to employ only one ecological parameter for depicting the variation of land surface temperature (LST). This paper begins with the analysis of four ecological parameters' influence on LST using regression analysis, based on 24 Landsat images which cover Xi'an of China from 1992 to 2014. These four parameters include greenness degree (i.e. the soil adjusted vegetation index, SAVI), soil moisture degree (i.e. the normalized difference moisture index, NDMI), dryness degree (i.e. the normalized difference soil index, NDSI) and resident aggregation degree (i.e. the normalized difference build-up index, NDBI). Besides, contribution intensity index was introduced to investigate the contribution effect of four ecological parameters on LST, and a new ecological index, integrated ecological index (IEI), was founded using the principal component analysis technique to integratedly represent its spatial and mathematical correlations with LST. Results indicate that four ecological parameters all possessed pronounced performance in impacting LST pattern in all dates: SAVI and NDMI were found to be correlated negatively with LST, whereas NDBI and NDSI correlated positively with LST. Additionally, SAVI had a profound impact on LST distribution compared with the other three parameters, and there was the biggest heating contribution in the lowest SAVI category. Further finding suggests that IEI as a new ecological index can be used to integratedly estimate the spatio-temporal change of LST, manifesting a negative correlation with LST. Our study thinks that the comprehensive characterization of surface ecological status is conducive to benefit us to better understand the spatio-temporal mechanism of thermal environment and ecosystem and to help urban decision-makers to execute effective conservation policies for the ecosystem.

TI  - Comparison of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Derived from Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR for the Mesopotamian Marshes Between 2002 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mesopotamian marshes are a group of water bodies located in southern Iraq, in the shape of a triangle, with the cities Amarah, Nasiriyah, and Basra located at its corners. The marshes are appropriate habitats for a variety of birds and most of the commercial fisheries in the region. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been derived using observations from various satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and Landsat over the Mesopotamian marshlands for the 17-year period between 2002 and 2018. We have chosen this time series (2002-2018) to monitor the change in vegetation of the study area since it is considered as a period of rehabilitation for the marshes (following a period when there was little to no water flowing into the marshes). Statistical analyses were performed to monitor the variability of the maximum biomass time (month of June). The results illustrated a strong positive correlation between the NDVI derived from Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR. The statistical correlations were 0.79, 0.77, and 0.96 between Landsat and AVHRR, MODIS and AVHRR, and Landsat and MODIS, respectively. The linear slope of NDVI (Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR) for each pixel over the period 2002-2018 displays a long-term trend of green biomass (NDVI) change in the study area, and the slope is slightly negative over most of the area. Slope values (-0.002 to -0.05) denote a slight decrease in the observed vegetation index over 17 years. The green biomass of the marshlands increased by 33.2% of the total area over 17 years. The areas of negative and positive slopes correspond to the same areas in slope map when calculated from Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR, although they are different in spatial resolution (30 m, 1 km, and 5 km, respectively). The time series of the average NDVI (2002-2018) for three different sensors shows the highest and lowest NDVI values during the same years (for the month of June each year). The highest values were 0.19, 0.22, and 0.22 for Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR, respectively, in 2006, and the lowest values were 0.09, 0.14, and 0.09 for Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR, respectively, in 2003.

TI  - Revisiting Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) Over Sand Deserts for Vicarious Calibration of Optical Imagers at 20 km and 100 km Scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In-flight assessment of the radiometric performances of space-borne instruments can be achieved by means of vicarious calibration over Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS). PICS are chosen for the high temporal stability of their surface optical properties combined with a high spatial homogeneity. A first list of the main desert PIC sites was identified 20 years ago for the calibration of medium/coarse spatial resolution instruments in the solar spectral range (400-2500 nm). They are located in the Saharan desert and in the Arabian Peninsula. Six of them have since been endorsed by the CEOS/WGCV/IVOS as reference Calibration/Validation test sites. In this study, we have revisited the list of desert PIC sites at the global scale with the aim of (1) assessing if these twenty PICS are still optimal, in terms of temporal stability and spatial uniformity, and using up-to-date multi-spectral remote sensing data, and (2) identifying new calibration sites distributed over other areas of the world. We verified that the original sites remain very relevant, although alternate locations in their close vicinity have slightly better characteristics. We proposed four additional targets with similar characteristics, some of which may offer easier logistical access. In order to support radiative transfer simulations of satellite sensor measurements over the sites, we assessed the abilities of several semi-empirical models to reproduce the spectro-directional signatures of six IVOS sites and the four new candidate sites, and we derived climatologies of the main atmospheric properties (trace gas column load and aerosol optical depth).

TI  - Do soil-adjusted or standard vegetation indices better predict above ground biomass of semi-arid, saline rangelands in North-East Iran?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has greatly facilitated the assessment of aboveground biomass in rangelands. Soil-adjusted vegetation indices have been developed to provide better predictions of aboveground biomass, especially for dryland regions. Semi-arid rangelands often complicate a remote sensing based assessment of aboveground biomass due to bright reflecting soils combined with sparse vegetation cover. We aim at evaluating whether soil-adjusted vegetation indices perform better than standard, i.e. unadjusted, vegetation indices in predicting dry aboveground biomass of a saline and semi-arid rangeland in NE-Iran. 672 biomass plots of 2 x 2 m were gathered and aggregated into 13 sites. Generalized Linear Regression Models (GLM) were compared for six different vegetation indices, three standard and three soil-adjusted vegetation indices. Vegetation indices were calculated from the MODIS MCD43A4 product. Model comparison was done using Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Akaike weights and pseudo R-2. Model fits for dry biomass showed that transformed NDVI and NDVI fitted best with R-2 = 0.47 and R-2 = 0.33, respectively. The optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) behaved similar to NDVI but less precise. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) performed worse than a null model. Hence, soil-adjusted indices based on the soil-line concept performed worse than a simple square root transformation of the NDVI. However, more studies that compare MODIS based vegetation indices for rangeland biomass estimation are required to support our findings. We suggest applying a similar model comparison approach as performed in this study instead of relying on single vegetation indices in order to find optimal relationships with aboveground biomass estimation in rangelands.

T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) aims to determine the burden of severe influenza disease and Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (IVE). This is a prospective, active surveillance and hospital-based epidemiological study to collect epidemiological data in the GIHSN. In the 2016-2017 influenza season, 15 sites in 14 countries participated in the GIHSN, although the analyses could not be performed in 2 sites. A common core protocol was used in order to make results comparable. Here we present the results of the GIHSN 2016-2017 influenza season.MethodsA RT-PCR test was performed to all patients that accomplished the requirements detailed on a common core protocol. Patients admitted were included in the study after signing the informed consent, if they were residents, not institutionalised, not discharged in the previous 30days from other hospitalisation with symptoms onset within the 7days prior to admission. Patients 5years old or more must also complied the Influenza-Like Illness definition. A test negative-design was implemented to perform IVE analysis. IVE was estimated using a logistic regression model, with the formula IVE=(1-aOR)x100, where aOR is the adjusted Odds Ratio comparing cases and controls.ResultsAmong 21,967 screened patients, 10,140 (46.16%) were included, as they accomplished the inclusion criteria, and tested, and therefore 11,827 (53.84%) patients were excluded. Around 60% of all patients included with laboratory results were recruited at 3 sites. The predominant strain was A(H3N2), detected in 63.6% of the cases (1840 patients), followed by B/Victoria, in 21.3% of the cases (618 patients). There were 2895 influenza positive patients (28.6% of the included patients). A(H1N1)pdm09 strain was mainly found in Mexico. IVE could only be performed in 6 sites separately. Overall IVE was 27.24 (95% CI 15.62-37.27. Vaccination seemed to confer better protection against influenza B and in people 2-4years, or 85years old or older. The aOR for hospitalized and testing positive for influenza was 3.02 (95% CI 1.59-5.76) comparing pregnant with non-pregnant women.ConclusionsVaccination prevented around 1 in 4 hospitalisations with influenza. Sparse numbers didn't allow estimating IVE in all sites separately. Pregnancy was found a risk factor for influenza, having 3 times more risk of being admitted with influenza for pregnant women.

TI  - Ship Detection for Optical Remote Sensing Images Based on Visual Attention Enhanced Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection plays a significant role in military and civil fields. Although some state-of-the-art detection methods, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have certain advantages, they still cannot solve the challenge well, including the large size of images, complex scene structure, a large amount of false alarm interference, and inshore ships. This paper proposes a ship detection method from optical remote sensing images, based on visual attention enhanced network. To effectively reduce false alarm in non-ship area and improve the detection efficiency from remote sensing images, we developed a light-weight local candidate scene network(CSN) to extract the local candidate scenes with ships. Then, for the selected local candidate scenes, we propose a ship detection method, based on the visual attention DSOD(VA-DSOD). Here, to enhance the detection performance and positioning accuracy of inshore ships, we both extract semantic features, based on DSOD and embed a visual attention enhanced network in DSOD to extract the visual features. We test the detection method on a large number of typical remote sensing datasets, which consist of Google Earth images and GaoFen-2 images. We regard the state-of-the-art method [sliding window DSOD (SW+DSOD)] as a baseline, which achieves the average precision (AP) of 82.33%. The AP of the proposed method increases by 7.53%. The detection and location performance of our proposed method outperforms the baseline in complex remote sensing scenes.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Residue Coverage Using Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the farmland ecosystem, crop residues provide a barrier against water erosion, and improve soil quality. Timely and accurate estimation of crop residue coverage (CRC) on a regional scale is essential for understanding the condition of ecosystems and the interactions with the surrounding environment. Satellite remote sensing is an effective way of regional CRC estimation. Both optical remote sensing and microwave remote sensing are common means of CRC estimation. However, CRC estimation based on optical imagery has the shortcomings of signal saturation in high coverage areas and susceptibility to weather conditions, while CRC estimation using microwave imagery is easily influenced by soil moisture and crop types. Synergistic use of optical and microwave remote sensing information may have the potential to improve estimation accuracy. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (i) Analyze the correlation between field measured CRC and satellite derived variables based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, (ii) investigate the relationship of CRC with new indices (OCRI-RPs) which combine optical crop residues indices (OCRIs) and radar parameters (RPs), and (iii) to estimate CRC in Yucheng County based on OCRI-RPs by optimal subset regression. The correlations between field measured CRC and satellite derived variables were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and radar indices 2 (RI2) had relatively higher correlations with field measured CRC in OCRIs and RPs (R-2 = 0.570, RMSE = 6.560% and R-2 = 0.430, RMSE = 7.052%, respectively). Combining OCRIs with RPs by multiplying each OCRI with each RP could significantly improve the ability of indices to estimate CRC, as NDTI x RI2 had the highest R-2 value of 0.738 and lowest RMSE value of 5.140%. The optimal model for CRC estimation by optimal subset regression was constructed by NDI71 x <mml:semantics>sigma VV0</mml:semantics> and NDTI x <mml:semantics>sigma VH0</mml:semantics>, with a R-2 value of 0.770 and a RMSE value of 4.846%, which had a great improvement when compared with the best results in OCRIs and RPs. The results demonstrated that the combination of optical remote sensing information and microwave remote sensing information could improve the accuracy of CRC estimation.

TI  - Object-Based Time-Constrained Dynamic Time Warping Classification of Crops Using Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing volume of remote sensing data with improved spatial and temporal resolutions generates unique opportunities for monitoring and mapping of crops. We compared multiple single-band and multi-band object-based time-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) classifications for crop mapping based on Sentinel-2 time series of vegetation indices. We tested it on two complex and intensively managed agricultural areas in California and Texas. DTW is a time-flexible method for comparing two temporal patterns by considering their temporal distortions in their alignment. For crop mapping, using time constraints in computing DTW is recommended in order to consider the seasonality of crops. We tested different time constraints in DTW (15, 30, 45, and 60 days) and compared the results with those obtained by using Euclidean distance or a DTW without time constraint. Best classification results were for time delays of both 30 and 45 days in California: 79.5% for single-band DTWs and 85.6% for multi-band DTWs. In Texas, 45 days was best for single-band DTW (89.1%), while 30 days yielded best results for multi-band DTW (87.6%). Using temporal information from five vegetation indices instead of one increased the overall accuracy in California with 6.1%. We discuss the implications of DTW dissimilarity values in understanding the classification errors. Considering the possible sources of errors and their propagation throughout our analysis, we had combined errors of 22.2% and 16.8% for California and 24.6% and 25.4% for Texas study areas. The proposed workflow is the first implementation of DTW in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) environment and represents a promising step towards generating fast, accurate, and ready-to-use agricultural data products.

TI  - Wheat planted area detection from the MODIS NDVI time series classification using the nearest neighbour method calculated by the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity measures
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to detect the wheat crop in the Northwest region of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) using MODIS NDVI time series. Detection of wheat crops presents two difficulties: (a) high variation of wheat phenological curves due to climatic fluctuations during the crop cycle and (b) the plantations are in an environment with different types of rural and urban targets. In solving these problems, we propose a classification based on the nearest neighbour (a specific case of the k-NN method) from the similarity and distance metrics combined with the determination of the best threshold value to individualize the wheat mask. The nearest neighbour classification using minimum distance (Kappa of 0.75) obtained a result equivalent to that of cosine similarity (Kappa of 0.74) as attested by the McNemar test. The planted area result was comparable to official statistics from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics obtained through direct interviews.

TI  - Chronology of the 2014-2016 Eruptive Phase of Volcan de Colima and Volume Estimation of Associated Lava Flows and Pyroclastic Flows Based on Optical Multi-Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eruption at Volcan de Colima (Mexico) on 10-11 July 2015 represents the most violent eruption that has occurred at this volcano since the 1913 Plinian eruption. The extraordinary runout of the associated pyroclastic flows was never observed during the past dome collapse events in 1991 or 2004-2005. Based on Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) ALI (Advanced Land Imager), the chronology of the different eruptive phases from September 2014 to September 2016 is reconstructed here. A digital image segmentation procedure allowed for the mapping of the trajectory of the lava flows emplaced on the main cone as well as the pyroclastic flow deposits that inundated the Montegrande ravine on the southern flank of the volcano. Digital surface models (DSMs) obtained from SPOT/6 dual-stereoscopic and tri-stereopair images were used to estimate the volumes of some lava flows and the main pyroclastic flow deposits. We estimated that the total volume of the magma that erupted during the 2014-2016 event was approximately 40 x 10(7) m(3), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the 1913 Plinian eruption. These data are fundamental for improving hazard assessment because the July 2015 eruption represents a unique scenario that has never before been observed at Volcan de Colima. Volume estimation provides complementary data to better understand eruptive processes, and detailed maps of the distributions of lava flows and pyroclastic flows represent fundamental tools for calibrating numerical modeling for hazard assessment. The stereo capabilities of the SPOT6/7 satellites for the detection of topographic changes and the and the availability of EO-1 ALI imagery are useful tools for reconstructing multitemporal eruptive events, even in areas that are not accessible due to ongoing eruptive activity.

TI  - A Methodology to Monitor Urban Expansion and Green Space Change Using a Time Series of Multi-Sensor SPOT and Sentinel-2A Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban expansion and greenspace change is an urgent need for planning and decision-making. This paper presents a methodology integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hybrid classifier to undertake this kind of work using a sequence of multi-sensor SPOT images (SPOT-2,3,5) and Sentinel-2A data from 1996 to 2016 in Hangzhou City, which is the central metropolis of the Yangtze River Delta in China. In this study, orthorectification was first applied on the SPOT and Sentinel-2A images to guarantee precise geometric correction which outperformed the conventional polynomial transformation method. After pre-processing, PCA and hybrid classifier were used together to enhance and extract change information. Accuracy assessment combining stratified random and user-defined plots sampling strategies was performed with 930 reference points. The results indicate reasonable high accuracies for four periods. It was further revealed that the proposed method yielded higher accuracy than that of the traditional post-classification comparison approach. On the whole, the developed methodology provides the effectiveness of monitoring urban expansion and green space change in this study, despite the existence of obvious confusions that resulted from compound factors.

TI  - The Radiance Differences between Wavelength and Wavenumber Spaces in Convolving Hyperspectral Infrared Sounder Spectrum to Broadband for Intercomparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Converting the hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounder radiance spectrum to broadband is a common approach for intercomparison/calibration. Usually the convolution is performed in wavenumber space. However, numerical experiments presented here indicate that there are brightness temperature (BT) differences between wavelength and wavenumber spaces in convolving hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum to broadband. The magnitudes of differences are related to the spectral region and the width of the spectral response functions (SRFs). In addition, the central wavelength and central wavenumber should be determined separately in wavelength and wavenumber spaces, respectively; they cannot be converted to each other directly for broadband BT calculations. There exist BT differences (BTDs) between interpolating the resolution of SRF to hyperspectral IR sounder spectrum, and vice versa, for convolution. This study provides clarity on convolution, central wavelength/wavenumber determination, and spectral resolution matching between broadband SRFs and hyperspectral IR sounder radiances for intercomparison/calibration.

TI  - Combined Effects of the Surface Urban Heat Island with Landscape Composition and Configuration Based on Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Shanghai, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization leads to changes in surface coverage and landscape patterns. This results in urban heat island (UHI) effects and a series of negative ecological consequences. Considering this concern and taking Shanghai as an example, this paper concentrates on the effects of surface coverage and landscape patterns on urban land surface temperature (LST). The research is based on quantitative retrieval of remote sensing data with consideration of methods in multiple disciplines, including landscape ecology, geographic information systems, and statistical analysis. It concludes that, over time, the thermal environment of Shanghai is becoming critical. The average LST ranking of different surface coverage is as follows: Construction land (CL) > bare land (BL) > green land (GL) > agricultural land (AL) > water body (WB). LST varies significantly with the type of surface coverage. CL contributes the most to the UHI, while WB and GL have obvious mitigation effects on the UHI. The large area, low degree of landscape fragmentation, and complex outlines lead to low LST rankings for GL, WB, and AL and a high LST ranking for CL. The conclusions indicate that CL should be broken down by GL and WB into discrete pieces to effectively mitigate UHI effects. The research reveals UHI features and changes in Shanghai over the years and provides practical advice that can be used by urban planning authorities to mitigate UHI.

TI  - Challenges and Future Perspectives of Multi-/Hyperspectral Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing for Crop Water-Stress Detection: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) multi-/hyperspectral and sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) approaches together with classic solar-reflective (visible, near-, and shortwave infrared reflectance (VNIR)/SWIR) hyperspectral remote sensing form the latest state-of-the-art techniques for the detection of crop water stress. Each of these three domains requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g., HySPIRI/SBG (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject to satellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the SIF). Identification of plant water stress or drought is of utmost importance to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water status over large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. As plant responses to water stress are numerous and complex, their physiological consequences affect the electromagnetic signal in different spectral domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of water stress-related applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise review of water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without neglecting the comparison to other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF) and multi-sensor approaches. Current and planned sensors at ground, airborne, and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly used indices and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges are discussed that occur when using spectral emissivity, temperature-based indices, and physically-based approaches for water-stress detection in the TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing and the perspectives for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion, information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and SIF sensors within a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to actual plant (water) status and the rationale of physiological and biochemical changes. Synergistic sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems.

TI  - Forest Stand Species Mapping Using the Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information regarding forest tree species composition is useful for a wide range of applications, both for forest management and scientific research. Remote sensing is an efficient tool for collecting spatially explicit information on forest attributes. With the launch of the Sentinel-2 mission, new opportunities have arisen for mapping tree species owing to its spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The short revisit cycle (five days) is crucial in vegetation mapping because of the reflectance changes caused by phenological phases. In our study, we evaluated the utility of the Sentinel-2 time series for mapping tree species in the complex, mixed forests of the Polish Carpathian Mountains. We mapped the following nine tree species: common beech, silver birch, common hornbeam, silver fir, sycamore maple, European larch, grey alder, Scots pine, and Norway spruce. We used the Sentinel-2 time series from 2018, with 18 images included in the study. Different combinations of Sentinel-2 imagery were selected based on mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and mean decrease Gini (MDG) measures, in addition to temporal phonological pattern analysis. Tree species discrimination was performed using the Random Forest classification algorithm. Our results showed that the use of the Sentinel-2 time series instead of single date imagery significantly improved forest tree species mapping, by approximately 5-10% of overall accuracy. In particular, combining images from spring and autumn resulted in better species discrimination.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Variation in Land Subsidence on the Beijing Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1970s, land subsidence has been rapidly developing on the Beijing Plain, and the systematic study of the evolutionary mechanism of this subsidence is of great significance in the sustainable development of the regional economy. On the basis of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results, this study employed the Mann-Kendall method for the first time to determine the mutation information of land subsidence on the Beijing Plain from 2004 to 2015. By combining the hydrogeological conditions, southern water project, and other data, we attempted to analyse the reasons for land subsidence mutations. First, on the basis of ENVISAT ASAR and RADARSAT-2 data, the land subsidence of the Beijing Plain was determined while using small baseline interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) and Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI). Second, on the basis of the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, vector data of displacement under different scales were obtained. Through a series of tests, a scale of 960 metres was selected as the research unit and the displacement rate from 2004 to 2015 was obtained. Finally, a trend analysis of land subsidence was carried out on the basis of the Mann-Kendall mutation test. The results showed that single-year mutations were mainly distributed in the middle and lower parts of the Yongding River alluvial fan and the Chaobai River alluvial fan. Among these mutations, the greatest numbers occurred in 2015 and 2005, being 1344 and 915, respectively. The upper and middle alluvial fan of the Chaobai River, the vicinity of the emergency water sources, and the edge of the groundwater funnel have undergone several mutations. Combining hydrogeological data of the study area and the impact of the south-to-north water transfer project, we analysed the causes of these mutations. The experimental results can quantitatively verify the mutation information of land subsidence in conjunction with time series to further elucidate the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of land subsidence in the study area.

TI  - Change Detection and Impact of Climate Changes to Iraqi Southern Marshes Using Landsat 2 MSS, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 MSI Data and GIS Applications
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Marshes represent a unique ecosystem covering a large area of southern Iraq. In a major environmental disaster, the marshes of Iraq were drained, especially during the 1990s. Since then, droughts and the decrease in water imports from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers from Turkey and Iran have prevented them from regaining their former extent. The aim of this research is to extract the values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the period 1977-2017 from Landsat 2 MSS (multispectral scanner), Landsat 8 OLI (operational land imager) and Sentinel 2 MSI (multi-spectral imaging mission) satellite images and use supervised classification to quantify land and water cover change. The results from the two satellites (Landsat 2 and Landsat 8) are compared with Sentinel 2 to determine the best tool for detecting changes in land and water cover. We also assess the potential impacts of climate change through the study of the annual average maximum temperature and precipitation in different areas in the marshes for the period 1981-2016. The NDVI analysis and image classification showed the degradation of vegetation and water bodies in the marshes, as vast areas of natural vegetation and agricultural lands disappeared and were replaced with barren areas. The marshes were influenced by climatic change, including rising temperature and the diminishing amount of precipitation during 1981-2016.

TI  - Explorative Study on Mapping Surface Facies of Selected Glaciers from Chandra Basin, Himalaya Using WorldView-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of surface glacier facies has been a part of several glaciological applications. The study of glacier facies in the Himalayas has gained momentum in the last decade owing to the implications imposed by these facies on the melt characteristics of the glaciers. Some of the most commonly reported surface facies in the Himalayas are snow, ice, ice mixed debris, and debris. The precision of the techniques used to extract glacier facies is of high importance, as the result of many cryospheric studies and economic reforms rely on it. An assessment of a customized semi-automated protocol against conventional and advanced mapping algorithms for mapping glacier surface facies is presented in this study. Customized spectral index ratios (SIRs) are developed for effective extraction of surface facies using thresholding in an object-based environment. This method was then tested on conventional and advanced classification algorithms for an evaluation of the mapping accuracy for five glaciers located in the Himalayas, using very high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery. The results indicate that the object-based image analysis (OBIA) based semi-automated SIR approach achieved a higher average overall accuracy of 87.33% (kappa = 0.85) than the pixel-based image analysis (PBIA) approach. Among the conventional methods, the Maximum Likelihood performed the best, with an overall accuracy of 78.71% (kappa = 0.75). The Constrained Energy Minimization, with an overall accuracy of 68.76% (kappa = 0.63), was the best performer of the advanced algorithms. The advanced methods greatly underperformed in this study. The proposed SIRs show a promise in the mapping of minor features such as crevasses and in the discrimination between ice-mixed debris and debris. We have efficiently mapped surface glacier facies independently of short-wave infrared bands (SWIR). There is a scope for the transferability of the proposed SIRs and their performance in varying scenarios.

TI  - Correcting Swath-Dependent Bias of MODIS FRP Observations With Quantile Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active fire observations with satellite instruments exhibit a well-documented increase of the detection threshold with increasing pixel footprint size, i.e., distance from the sub-satellite point. This results in a viewing angle-dependent, negative bias in gridded representations of the observed Fire Radiative Power (FRP), which in turn is frequently being used for climate monitoring of biomass burning and for pyrogenic emission inventories. We present a method based on quantile mapping to alleviate this bias and apply it to the gridded-FRP from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instruments. The gridded-FRP observations are corrected with a correction function that depends on the satellite viewing angle and the magnitude of FRP in each grid cell. Assuming the fire observations at nadir to be the best representation of the truth, we derive a correction function by mapping cumulative distribution function (CDF) of off-nadir gridded-FRP to the CDF of near-nadir gridded-FRP. The method can be directly applied to correct the negative bias in gridded-FRP observations at a grid resolution of 1 degrees or more. The performance of the correction methodology is confirmed through comparisons with co-located Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite observations: After bias correction, the gridded-FRP observations from both satellites agree better than before, particularly over savanna, tropical forests, and extra-tropical forests. Experiments with the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) show that the impacts of the bias-corrected MODIS/Aqua gridded-FRP observations and VIIRS/Suomi-NPP gridded-FRP observations on regional FRP analyses are comparable, which confirms the potential for improving fire emission inventories and climate monitoring based on FRP.

TI  - Machine Learning Approaches for Detecting Tropical Cyclone Formation Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compared detection skill for tropical cyclone (TC) formation using models based on three different machine learning (ML) algorithms-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM)-and a model based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Eight predictors were derived from WindSat satellite measurements of ocean surface wind and precipitation over the western North Pacific for 2005-2009. All of the ML approaches performed better with significantly higher hit rates ranging from 94 to 96% compared with LDA performance (77%), although false alarm rate by MLs is slightly higher (21-28%) than that by LDA (13%). Besides, MLs could detect TC formation at the time as early as 26-30 h before the first time diagnosed as tropical depression by the JTWC best track, which was also 5 to 9 h earlier than that by LDA. The skill differences across MLs were relatively smaller than difference between MLs and LDA. Large yearly variation in forecast lead time was common in all models due to the limitation in sampling from orbiting satellite. This study highlights that ML approaches provide an improved skill for detecting TC formation compared with conventional linear approaches.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of LULC and to explore the impact of climate variability and LULC change on regional NPP in Jianghan Plain from 2000 to 2010 based on the CASA model, remote sensing data sets, meteorological data and LULC data. The results are summarized as follows: (1) the significant geographical variations are characterized mainly by the transformation from farmland to wetlands and constructive land. (2) The highest yield of NPP was 557.37 gC/m(2) in 2007, and the lowest yield was 483.45 gC/m(2) in 2009. (3) NPP spatial distribution has obvious uneven characteristics on the regional scale. (4) The correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficient between annual total NPP and the annual precipitation and annual temperature was -0.4471 and 0.6296, respectively. Finally, the results may provide scientific information for investigating the influence of climate variability and LULC change on regional NPP in China.

TI  - Net Cloud Thinning, Low-Level Cloud Diminishment, and Hadley Circulation Weakening of Precipitating Clouds with Tropical West Pacific SST Using MISR and Other Satellite and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily gridded Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) satellite data are used in conjunction with CERES, TRMM, and ERA-Interim reanalysis data to investigate horizontal and vertical high cloud structure, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net cloud forcing and albedo, and dynamics relationships against local SST and precipitation as a function of the mean Tropical West Pacific (TWP; 120 degrees E to 155 degrees W; 30 degrees S-30 degrees N) SST. As the TWP warms, the SST mode (similar to 29.5 degrees C) is constant, but the area of the mode grows, indicating increased kurtosis of SSTs and decreased SST gradients overall. This is associated with weaker low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric ascent (omega(500)) over the highest SSTs as the TWP warms, but also a broader area of weak ascent away from the deepest convection, albeit stronger when compared to when the mean TWP is cooler. These associated dynamics changes are collocated with less anvil and thick cloud cover over the highest SSTs and similar thin cold cloud fraction when the TWP is warmer, but broadly more anvil and cirrus clouds over lower local SSTs (SST < 27 degrees C). For all TWP SST quintiles, anvil cloud fraction, defined as clouds with tops > 9 km and TOA albedos between 0.3-0.6, is closely associated with rain rate, making it an excellent proxy for precipitation; but for a given heavier rain rate, cirrus clouds are more abundant with increasing domain-mean TWP SST. Clouds locally over SSTs between 29-30 degrees C have a much less negative net cloud forcing, up to 25 W m(-2) greater, when the TWP is warm versus cool. When the local rain rate increases, while the net cloud fraction with tops < 9 km decreases, mid-level clouds (4 km < Z(top) < 9 km) modestly increase. In contrast, combined low-level and mid-level clouds decrease as the domain-wide SST increases (-10% deg(-1)). More cirrus clouds for heavily precipitating systems exert a stronger positive TOA effect when the TWP is warmer, and anvil clouds over a higher TWP SST are less reflective and have a weaker cooling effect. For all precipitating systems, total high cloud cover increases modestly with higher TWP SST quintiles, and anvil + cirrus clouds are more expansive, suggesting more detrainment when TWP SSTs are higher. Total-domain anvil cloud fraction scales mostly with domain-mean omega(500), but cirrus clouds mostly increase with domain-mean SST, invoking an explanation other than circulation. The overall thinning and greater top-heaviness of clouds over the TWP with warming are possible TWP positive feedbacks not previously identified.

TI  - The Comparison of Different Methods of Texture Analysis for Their Efficacy for Land Use Classification in Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents a comparison of the efficacy of several texture analysis methods as tools for improving land use/cover classification in satellite imagery. The tested methods were: gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, Laplace filters and granulometric analysis, based on mathematical morphology. The performed tests included an assessment of the classification accuracy performed based on spectro-textural datasets: spectral images with the addition of images generated using different texture analysis methods. The class nomenclature was based on spectral and textural differences and included the following classes: water, low vegetation, bare soil, urban, and two (coniferous and deciduous) forest classes. The classification accuracy was assessed using the overall accuracy and kappa index of agreement, based on the reference data generated using visual interpretation of the images. The analysis was performed using very high-resolution imagery (Pleiades, WorldView-2) and high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-2). The results show the efficacy of selected GLCM features and granulometric analysis as tools for providing textural data, which could be used in the process of land use/cover classification. It is also clear that texture analysis is generally a more important and effective component of classification for images of higher resolution. In addition, for classification using GLCM results, the Random Forest variable importance analysis was performed.

TI  - Space- and Ground-Based Geophysical Data Tracking of Magma Migration in Shallow Feeding System of Mount Etna Volcano
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After a month-long increase in activity at the summit craters, on 24 December 2018, the Etna volcano experienced a short-lived lateral effusive event followed by a rapid resumption of low-level explosive and degassing activity at the summit vents. By combining space (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS and SENTINEL-2 images) and ground-based geophysical data, we track, in near real-time, the thermal, seismic and infrasonic changes associated with Etna's activity during the September-December 2018 period. Satellite thermal data reveal that the fissural eruption was preceded by a persistent increase of summit activity, as reflected by overflow episodes in New SouthEast Crater (NSE) sector. This behavior is supported by infrasonic data, which recorded a constant increase both in the occurrence and in the energy of the strombolian activity at the same crater sectors mapped by satellite. The explosive activity trend is poorly constrained by the seismic tremor, which shows instead a sudden increase only since the 08:24 GMT on the 24 December 2018, almost concurrently with the end of the infrasonic detections occurred at 06:00 GMT. The arrays detected the resumption of infrasonic activity at 11:13 GMT of 24 December, when tremors almost reached the maximum amplitude. Infrasound indicates that the explosive activity was shifting from the summit crater along the flank of the Etna volcano, reflecting, with the seismic tremor, the intrusion of a gas-rich magma batch along a similar to 2.0 km long dyke, which reached the surface generating an intense explosive phase. The dyke propagation lasted for almost 3 h, during which magma migrated from the central conduit system to the lateral vent, at a mean speed of 0.15-0.20 m s(-1). Based on MODIS and SENTINEL 2 images, we estimated that the summit outflows erupted a volume of lava of 1.4 Mm(3) (+/- 0.5 Mm(3)), and that the lateral effusive episode erupted a minimum volume of 0.85 Mm(3) (+/- 0.3 Mm(3)). The results presented here outline the support of satellite data on tracking the evolution of volcanic activity and the importance to integrate satellite with ground-based geophysical data in improving assessments of volcanic hazard during eruptive crises.

TI  - Estimating Dynamics of Terminal Lakes in the Second Largest Endorheic River Basin of Northwestern China from 2000 to 2017 with Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying terminal-lake dynamics is crucial for understanding water-ecosystem-economy relationship across endorheic river basins in arid environments. In this study, the spatio-temporal variations in terminal lakes of the lower Heihe River Basin were investigated for the first time since the Ecological Water Diversion Project commenced in 2000. The lake area and corresponding water consumption were determined with 248 Landsat images. Vital recovery of lakes occurred two years after the implementation of the project, and the total lake area increased by 382.6%, from 30.7 to 148.2 km(2), during 2002-2017. East Juyan Lake (EJL) was first restored as a project target and subsequently reached a maximum area of 70.1 km(2). Water dispersion was initiated in 2003, with the East river prioritized for restoration. Swan Lake in the East river enlarged to 67.7 km(2) by 2017, while the other four lakes temporarily existed or maintained an area < 7 km(2), such as West Juyan Lake. Water consumed by lakes increased synchronously with lake area. The average water consumption of the six lakes was 1.03 x 10(8) m(3)/year, with 63% from EJL. The increasing terminal lakes; however, highlight the seasonal competition for water use between riparian vegetation and lake ecosystems in water-limited areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wetland Flooding at a Sub-Pixel Scale Based on Random Forests and Spatial Attraction Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland flooding is significant for the flora and fauna of wetlands. High temporal resolution remote sensing images are widely used for the timely mapping of wetland flooding but have a limitation of their relatively low spatial resolutions. In this study, a novel method based on random forests and spatial attraction models (RFSAM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of sub-pixel mapping of wetland flooding (SMWF) using remote sensing images. A random forests-based SMWF algorithm (RM-SMWF) was developed firstly, and a comprehensive complexity index of a mixed pixel was formulated. Then the RFSAM-SMWF method was developed. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of two wetlands of international importance included in the Ramsar List were used to evaluate RFSAM-SMWF against three other SMWF methods, and it consistently achieved more accurate sub-pixel mapping results in terms of visual and quantitative assessments in the two wetlands. The effects of the number of trees in random forests and the complexity threshold on the mapping accuracy of RFSAM-SMWF were also discussed. The results of this study improve the mapping accuracy of wetland flooding from medium-low spatial resolution remote sensing images and therefore benefit the environmental studies of wetlands.

TI  - Water Body Extraction from Very High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data Based on Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the use of the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) model in the extraction of water bodies from Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) optical images in the case of limited training samples. Two different seasonal GaoFen-2 images with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m in the south of the Beijing metropolitan area were used to extensively validate the FCN model. Four key factors including input features, training data, transfer learning, and data augmentation related to the performance of the FCN model were empirically analyzed by using 36 combinations of various parameter settings. Our findings indicate that the FCN-based method can work as a robust and cost-effective tool in the extraction of water bodies from VHR images. The FCN-based method trained on a small amount of labeled L1A data can also significantly outperform the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) based method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method, and the Sparsity Model (SM) based method, even when radiometric normalization and spatial contexts are introduced to preprocess the input data for the latter three methods. The advantages of the FCN-based method are mainly due to its capability to exploit spatial contexts in the image, especially in urban areas with mixed water and shadows. Though the settings of four key factors significantly affect the performance of the FCN based method, choosing a qualified setting for the FCN model is not difficult. Our lessons learned from the successful use of the FCN model for the extraction of water from VHR images can be extended to extract other land covers.

TI  - Remote Sensing in Urban Forestry: Recent Applications and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Increasing recognition of the importance of urban forest ecosystem services calls for the sustainable management of urban forests, which requires timely and accurate information on the status, trends and interactions between socioeconomic and ecological processes pertaining to urban forests. In this regard, remote sensing, especially with its recent advances in sensors and data processing methods, has emerged as a premier and useful observational and analytical tool. This study summarises recent remote sensing applications in urban forestry from the perspective of three distinctive themes: multi-source, multi-temporal and multi-scale inputs. It reviews how different sources of remotely sensed data offer a fast, replicable and scalable way to quantify urban forest dynamics at varying spatiotemporal scales on a case-by-case basis. Combined optical imagery and LiDAR data results as the most promising among multi-source inputs; in addition, future efforts should focus on enhancing data processing efficiency. For long-term multi-temporal inputs, in the event satellite imagery is the only available data source, future work should improve haze-/cloud-removal techniques for enhancing image quality. Current attention given to multi-scale inputs remains limited; hence, future studies should be more aware of scale effects and cautiously draw conclusions.

TI  - A long-term dataset of lake surface water temperature over the Tibetan Plateau derived from AVHRR 1981-2015
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is of vital importance for hydrological and meteorological studies. The LSWT ground measurements in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were quite scarce because of its harsh environment. Thermal infrared remote sensing is a reliable way to calculate historical LSWT. In this study, we present the first and longest 35-year (1981-2015) daytime lake-averaged LSWT data of 97 large lakes (>80 km(2) each) in the TP using the 4-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data. The LSWT dataset, taking advantage of observations from NOAA's afternoon satellites, includes three time scales, i.e., daily, 8-day-averaged, and monthly-averaged. The AVHRR-derived LSWT has a similar accuracy (RMSE = 1.7 degrees C) to that from other data products such as MODIS (RMSE = 1.7 degrees C) and ARC-Lake (RMSE = 2.0 degrees C). An inter-comparison of different sensors indicates that for studies such as those considering long-term climate change, the relative bias of different AVHRR sensors cannot be ignored. The proposed dataset should be, to some extent, a valuable asset for better understanding the hydrologic/climatic property and its changes over the TP.

TI  - Transition Characteristics of the Dry-Wet Regime and Vegetation Dynamic Responses over the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin, Southeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry-wet transition is of great importance for vegetation dynamics, however the response mechanism of vegetation variations is still unclear due to the complicated effects of climate change. As a critical ecologically fragile area located in the southeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin, which was selected as the typical area in this study, is significantly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the GLDAS-NOAH products and the GIMMS-NDVI remote sensing data from 1982 to 2015 were employed to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of the dry-wet regime and the vegetation dynamic responses. The results showed that: (1) The spatio-temporal patterns of the precipitation and temperature simulated by the GLDAS-NOAH fitted well with those of the in-situ data. (2) During the period of 1982-2015, the whole YZR basin exhibited an overall wetting tendency. However, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the dry-wet regime exhibited a reversal phenomenon before and after 2000, which was jointly identified by the SPEI and runoff. That is, the YZR basin showed a wetting trend before 2000 and a drying trend after 2000; the arid areas in the basin showed a tendency of wetting whereas the humid areas exhibited a trend of drying. (3) The region where NDVI was positively correlated with SPEI accounted for approximately 70% of the basin area, demonstrating a similar spatio-temporal reversal phenomenon of the vegetation around 2000, indicating that the dry-wet condition is of great importance for the evolution of vegetation. (4) The SPEI showed a much more significant positive correlation with the soil water content which accounted for more than 95% of the basin area, implying that the soil water content was an important indicator to identify the dry-wet transition in the YZR basin.

TI  - Evaluating the Potential of Multi-Seasonal CBERS-04 Imagery for Mapping the Quasi-Circular Vegetation Patches in the Yellow River Delta Using Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite imagery enables decametric-scale quasi-circular vegetation patch (QVP) mapping, which greatly aids the monitoring of vegetation restoration projects and the development of theories in pattern evolution and maintenance research. This study analyzed the potential of employing five seasonal fused 5 m spatial resolution CBERS-04 satellite images to map QVPs in the Yellow River Delta, China, using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The classification accuracies corresponding to individual and multi-season combined images were compared to understand the seasonal effect and the importance of optimal image timing and acquisition frequency for QVP mapping. For classification based on single season imagery, the early spring March imagery, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.1%, was proven to be more adequate than the other four individual seasonal images. The early spring (March) and winter (December) combined dataset produced the most accurate QVP detection results, with a precision rate of 66.3%, a recall rate of 43.9%, and an F measure of 0.528. For larger study areas, the gain in accuracy should be balanced against the increase in processing time and space when including the derived spectral indices in the RF classification model. Future research should focus on applying higher resolution imagery to QVP mapping.

TI  - Mapping Urban Extent at Large Spatial Scales Using Machine Learning Methods with VIIRS Nighttime Light and MODIS Daytime NDVI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization poses significant challenges on sustainable development, disaster resilience, climate change mitigation, and environmental and resource management. Accurate urban extent datasets at large spatial scales are essential for researchers and policymakers to better understand urbanization dynamics and its socioeconomic drivers and impacts. While high-resolution urban extent data products - including the Global Human Settlements Layer (GHSL), the Global Man-Made Impervious Surface (GMIS), the Global Human Built-Up and Settlement Extent (HBASE), and the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) - have recently become available, intermediate-resolution urban extent data products including the 1 km SEDAC's Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), MODIS 1km, and MODIS 500 m still have many users and have been demonstrated in a recent study to be more appropriate in urbanization process analysis (around 500 m resolution) than those at higher resolutions (30 m). The objective of this study is to improve large-scale urban extent mapping at an intermediate resolution (500 m) using machine learning methods through combining the complementary nighttime Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and daytime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, taking the conterminous United States (CONUS) as the study area. The effectiveness of commonly-used machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), neural network (NN), and their ensemble (ESB), has been explored. Our results show that these machine learning methods can achieve similar high accuracies across all accuracy metrics (>95% overall accuracy, >98% producer's accuracy, and >92% user's accuracy) with Kappa coefficients greater than 0.90, which have not been achieved in the existing data products or by previous studies; the ESB is not able to produce significantly better accuracies than individual machine learning methods; the total misclassifications generated by GBM are more than those generated by RF, NN, and ESB by 14%, 16%, and 11%, respectively, with NN having the least total misclassifications. This indicates that using these machine learning methods, especially NN and RF, with the combination of VIIRS nighttime light and MODIS daytime normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, high accuracy intermediate-resolution urban extent data products at large spatial scales can be achieved. The methodology has the potential to be applied to annual continental-to-global scale urban extent mapping at intermediate resolutions.

TI  - Assessment of Small-Scale Ecosystem Conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: A Study from Rio Canoas State Park, Southern Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficiency of the environmental management of a territory largely depends on previous surveys and systematic studies on the main elements and conditions of the physical environment. We applied remote sensing and digital image processing techniques (Principal Component Analysis and supervised classification) to Landsat imagery for analyzing the spatiotemporal land cover changes occurred in the Rio Canoas State Park in Brazil and its surrounding area from 1990 to 2016. Reforested areas around the park with exotic species is a part of the region's economy and a number of industries depend on it for raw materials. However, it is a matter of concern to avoid contamination with such invasive species, due to the proximity of the Park. From 1990 to 2004, more than 95% of the study area was unchanged and showed minimal distinction in land cover over the 14 years. This was mainly due to the continuous presence of agricultural monocultures around the Park without significant increases (only 3.1% of land cover change during this period). Regarding the interior of the Rio Canoas State Park, from 1990 to 2004, there was no increase in the area of exposed soil. The analysis of the surrounding areas of the park from 2004 to 2016 showed that 5663.78 ha (12.2% of the area) of the land cover has been changed, in most areas, due to reforestation by Pinus sp. Notable changes occurred within the park (established in 2004) between 2004 and 2016there was a partial regeneration of natural species diversity, a small number of invasive species (Pinus sp.) and removal of agricultural activities within the park, which contributed a 6.6% (75.45 ha) change in its land cover. We verified that 92.51% (1048.40 ha) of the areas inside the park were unchanged. The results demonstrated that actions were conducted to preserve the natural vegetation cover within the park and to reduce the impacts of anthropogenic activities, including the invasion of exotic species from the surrounding reforested areas into the natural habitat of the park. Given this, our study can aid the environmental management of the Park and its surrounding areas, enabling the monitoring of environmental legislation, the creation of a management plan, and can guide new action plans for the present study area and can be applied to other similar regions.

TI  - Rapid Invasion of Spartina Alterniflora in the Coastal Zone of Mainland China: Spatiotemporal Patterns and Human Prevention
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the extensive spread and ecological consequences of exotic Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) over the coast of mainland China, monitoring its spatiotemporal invasion patterns is important for the sake of coastal ecosystem management and ecological security. In this study, Landsat series images from 1990 to 2015 were used to establish multi-temporal datasets for documenting the temporal dynamics of S. alterniflora invasion. Our observations revealed that S. alterniflora had a continuous expansion with the area increasing by 50,204 ha during the considered 25 years. The largest expansion was identified in Jiangsu Province during the period of 1990-2000, and in Zhejiang Province during the periods 2000-2010 and 2010-2015. Three noticeable hotspots for S. alterniflora invasion were Yancheng of Jiangsu, Chongming of Shanghai, and Ningbo of Zhejiang, and each had a net area increase larger than 5000 ha. Moreover, an obvious shrinkage of S. alterniflora was identified in three coastal cities including the city of Cangzhou of Hebei, Dongguan, and Jiangmen of Guangdong. S. alterniflora invaded mostly into mudflats (>93%) and shrank primarily due to aquaculture (55.5%). This study sheds light on the historical spatial patterns in S. alterniflora distribution and thus is helpful for understanding its invasion mechanism and invasive species management.

TI  - Spatial Evolution of Prosopis Invasion and its Effects on LULC and Livelihoods in Baringo, Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody alien plant species have been deliberately introduced globally in many arid and semi-arid regions, as they can provide services and goods to the rural poor. However, some of these alien trees and shrubs have become invasive over time, with important impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Prosopis was introduced in Baringo County, Kenya, in the 1980s, but since then, it has spread rapidly from the original plantations to new areas. To assess land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and dynamics in Baringo, we used a combination of dry and wet season Landsat satellite data acquired over a seven-year time interval between 1988-2016, and performed a supervised Random Forest classification. For each time interval, we calculated the extent of Prosopis invasion, rates of spread, gains and losses of specific LULC classes, and the relative importance of Prosopis invasion on LULC changes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of the LULC classifications ranged between 98.1-98.5% and 0.93-0.96, respectively. We found that Prosopis coverage increased from 882 ha in 1988 to 18,792 ha in 2016. The highest negative changes in LULC classes were found for grasslands (-6252 ha; -86%), irrigated cropland (-849 ha; -57%), Vachellia tortilis-dominated vegetation (-3602 ha; -42%), and rainfed cropland (-1432 ha; -37%). Prosopis invasion alone directly accounted for over 30% of these negative changes, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is a key driver of the observed LULC changes in Baringo County. Although the management of Prosopis by utilization has been promoted in Baringo for 10-15 years, the spread of Prosopis has not stopped or slowed down. This suggests that Prosopis management in Baringo and other invaded areas in East Africa needs to be based on a more integrated approach.

TI  - Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Synergism for Mapping Vegetation Types in the Endangered Cerrado/Amazon Ecotone of Nova Mutum-Mato Grosso
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping vegetation types through remote sensing images has proved to be effective, especially in large biomes, such as the Brazilian Cerrado, which plays an important role in the context of management and conservation at the agricultural frontier of the Amazon. We tested several combinations of optical and radar images to identify the four dominant vegetation types that are prevalent in the Cerrado area (i.e., cerrado denso, cerradAo, gallery forest, and secondary forest). We extracted features from both sources of data such as intensity, grey level co-occurrence matrix, coherence, and polarimetric decompositions using Sentinel 2A, Sentinel 1A, ALOS-PALSAR 2 dual/full polarimetric, and TanDEM-X images during the dry and rainy season of 2017. In order to normalize the analysis of these features, we used principal component analysis and subsequently applied the Random Forest algorithm to evaluate the classification of vegetation types. During the dry season, the overall accuracy ranged from 48 to 83%, and during the dry and rainy seasons it ranged from 41 up to 82%. The classification using Sentinel 2A images during the dry season resulted in the highest overall accuracy and kappa values, followed by the classification that used images from all sensors during the dry and rainy season. Optical images during the dry season were sufficient to map the different types of vegetation in our study area.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data for Estimation of Leaf Area Index in Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Sentinel-2 satellites, a European capacity has been created to ensure continuity of Landsat and SPOT observations. In contrast to previous sensors, Sentinel-2 ' s multispectral imager (MSI) incorporates three additional spectral bands in the red-edge (RE) region, which are expected to improve the mapping of vegetation traits. The objective of this study was to compare Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data for the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) in temperate, deciduous broadleaf forests. We used hemispherical photography to estimate effective LAI at 36 field plots. We then built and compared simple and multiple linear regression models between field-based LAI and spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Our main findings are that Sentinel-2 predicts LAI with comparable accuracy to Landsat-8. The best Landsat-8 models predicted LAI with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.877, and the best Sentinel-2 model achieved an RMSE of 0.879. In addition, Sentinel-2 ' s RE bands and RE-based indices did not improve LAI prediction. Thirdly, LAI models showed a high sensitivity to understory vegetation when tree cover was sparse. According to our findings, Sentinel-2 is capable of delivering data continuity at high temporal resolution.

TI  - Regional Models for High-Resolution Retrieval of Chlorophyll a and TSM Concentrations in the Gorky Reservoir by Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibilities of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total suspended matter (TSM) retrieval using Sentinel-2/MSI imagery and in situ measurements in the Gorky Reservoir are investigated. This water body is an inland freshwater ecosystem within the territory of the Russian Federation. During the algal bloom period, the optical properties of water are extremely heterogeneous and vary on scales of tens of meters. Additionally, they vary in time under the influence of currents and wind forcing. In this case, the usage of the traditional station-based sampling to describe the state of the reservoir may be uninformative and not rational. Therefore, we proposed an original approach based on simultaneous in situ measurements of the remote sensing reflectance by a single radiometer and the concentration of water constituents by an ultraviolet fluorescence LiDAR from a high-speed gliding motorboat. This approach provided fast data collection including 4087 synchronized LiDAR and radiometric measurements with high spatial resolutions of 8 m for two hours. A part of the dataset was coincided with Sentinel-2 overpass and used for the development of regional algorithms for the retrieval of Chl a and TSM concentrations. For inland waters of the Russian Federation, such research was performed for the first time. The proposed algorithms can be used for regular environmental monitoring of the Gorky Reservoir using ship measurements or Sentinel-2 images. Additionally, they can be adapted for neighboring reservoirs, for example, for other seven reservoirs on the Volga River. Moreover, the proposed ship measurement approach can be useful in the practice of limnological monitoring of inland freshwater ecosystems with high spatiotemporal variability of the optical properties.

TI  - SenDiT: The Sentinel-2 Displacement Toolbox with Application to Glacier Surface Velocities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery represents a unique opportunity to quantify the spatial and temporal changes of glaciers world-wide. Glacier velocity has been measured from repeat satellite scenes for decades now, yet a range of satellite missions, feature tracking programs, and user approaches have made it a laborious task. To date, there has been no tool developed that would allow a user to obtain displacement maps of any specified glacier simply by establishing the key temporal, spatial and feature tracking parameters. This work presents the application and development of a unique, semi-automatic, open-source, flexible processing toolbox for the retrieval of displacement maps with a focus on obtaining glacier surface velocities. SenDiT combines the download, pre-processing, feature tracking, and postprocessing of the highest resolution Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellite images into a semi-automatic toolbox, leaving a user with a set of rasterized and georeferenced glacier flow magnitude and direction maps for their further analyses. The solution is freely available and is tailored so that non-glaciologists and people with limited geographic information system (GIS) knowledge can also benefit from it. The system can be used to provide both regional and global sets of ice velocities. The system was tested and applied on a range of glaciers in mainland Norway, Iceland, Greenland and New Zealand. It was also tested on areas of stable terrain in Libya and Australia, where sources of error involved in the feature tracking using Sentinel-2 imagery are thoroughly described and quantified.

TI  - Satellite Derived Bathymetry Using Machine Learning and Multi-Temporal Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow water bathymetry is important for nautical navigation to avoid stranding, as well as for the scientific simulation of high tide and high waves in coastal areas. Although many studies have been conducted on satellite derived bathymetry (SDB), previously used methods basically require supervised data for analysis, and cannot be used to analyze areas that are unreachable by boat or airplane. In this study, a mapping method for shallow water bathymetry was developed, using random forest machine learning and multi-temporal satellite images to create a generalized depth estimation model. A total of 135 Landsat-8 images, and a large amount of training bathymetry data for five areas were analyzed with the Google Earth Engine. The accuracy of SDB was evaluated by comparison with reference bathymetry data. The root mean square error in the final estimated water depth in the five test areas was 1.41 m for depths of 0 to 20 m. The SDB creation system developed in this study is expected to be applicable in various shallow water regions under highly transparent conditions.

AB  - The enhanced spectral and spatial resolutions of the remote sensors have increased the need for highly performing preprocessing procedures. In this paper, a comprehensive approach, which simultaneously performs atmospheric and topographic corrections and includes second order corrections such as adjacency effects, was presented. The method, developed under the assumption of Lambertian surfaces, is physically based and uses MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer model. The use of MODTRAN 4 for the estimates of the radiative quantities was widely discussed in the paper and the impact on remote sensing applications was shown through a series of test cases.

TI  - A 5-year study (2014-2018) of the relationship between coastal phytoplankton abundance and intertidal barnacle size along the Atlantic Canadian coast
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic-pelagic coupling refers to the ecological relationships between benthic and pelagic environments. Studying such links is particularly useful to understand biological variation in intertidal organisms along marine coasts. Filter-feeding invertebrates are ecologically important on marine rocky shores, so they have often been used to investigate benthic-pelagic coupling. Most studies, however, have been conducted on eastern ocean boundaries. To evaluate benthic-pelagic coupling on a western ocean boundary, we conducted a 5-year study spanning 415 km of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia (Canada). We hypothesized that the summer size of intertidal barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides) recruited in the preceding spring would be positively related to the nearshore abundance (biomass) of phytoplankton, as phytoplankton constitutes food for the nauplius larvae and benthic stages of barnacles. Every year between 2014 and 2018, we measured summer barnacle size in clearings created before spring recruitment on the rocky substrate at eight wave-exposed locations along this coast. We then examined the annual relationships between barnacle size and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. For every year and location, we used satellite data to calculate Chl-a averages for a period ranging from the early spring (when most barnacle larvae were in the water) to the summer (when barnacle size was measured after weeks of growth following spring benthic recruitment). The relationships were always positive, Chl-a explaining nearly half, or more, of the variation in barnacle size in four of the five studied years. These are remarkable results because they were based on a relatively limited number of locations (which often curtails statistical power) and point to the relevance of pelagic food supply to explain variation in intertidal barnacle size along this western ocean boundary coast.

TI  - Assessment of the Accuracy of Recent Empirical and Assimilated Tidal Models for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, Using Satellite and Coastal Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest satellite and in situ data are a fundamental source for tidal model evaluations. In this work, the satellite missions TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2 and Sentinel-3A, together with tide gauge data, were used to investigate the performance of recent regional and global tidal models over the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Ten models, namely, TPXO8, TPXO9, EOT11a, HAMTIDE, FES2012, FES2014, OSUNA, OSU12, GOT 4.10 and DTU10, were considered. The accuracy of eight major tidal constituents (i.e., K-1, O-1, P-1, Q(1), M-2, S-2, N-2 and K-2) and one shallow water constituent (M-4) were assessed based on the analysis of sea-level observations from coastal tide gauges and altimetry data (TOPEX series). The outcome was compared for four different subregions, namely, the coastline, coastal, shelf and deep ocean zones. Sea-level anomaly data from the Sentinel-3A mission were corrected using the tidal heights predicted by each model. The root mean square values of the sea level anomalies were then compared. According to the results, FES2012 compares more favorably to other models with root mean square (RMS) values of 10.9 cm and 7.7 cm over the coastal and shelf zones, respectively. In the deeper sections, the FES2014 model compares favorably at 7.5 cm. In addition, the impact of sudden fluctuations in bottom topography on model performances suggest that a combination of bathymetric variations and proximity to the coast or islands contributes to tidal height prediction accuracies of the models.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Mapping and Monitoring of Whiting in the Semi-Enclosed Gulf Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Time Series Images and a Generic Ensemble Tree-Based Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Whiting events in seas and lakes are a natural phenomenon caused by suspended calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles. The Arabian Gulf, which is a semi-enclosed sea, is prone to extensive whiting that covers tens of thousands of square kilometres. Despite the extent and frequency of whiting events in the Gulf, studies documenting the whiting phenomenon are lacking. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to detect, map and document the spatial and temporal distributions of whiting events in the Gulf using daily images acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites from 2002 to 2018. A method integrating a geographic object-based image analysis, the correlation-based feature selection technique (CFS), the adaptive boosting decision tree (AdaBoost DT) and the rule-based classification were used in the study to detect, quantify and assess whiting events in the Gulf from the MODIS data. Firstly, a multiresolution segmentation was optimised using unsupervised quality measures. Secondly, a set of spectral bands and indices were investigated using the CFS to select the most relevant feature(s). Thirdly, a generic AdaBoost DT model and a rule-based classification were adopted to classify the MODIS time series data. Finally, the developed classification model was compared with various tree-based classifiers such as random forest, a single DT and gradient boosted DT. Results showed that both the combination of the mean of the green spectral band and the normalised difference index between the green and blue bands (NDGB), or the combination of the NDGB and the colour index for estimating the concentrations of calcium carbonates (CI) of the image objects, were the most significant features for detecting whiting. Moreover, the generic AdaBoost DT classification model outperformed the other tested tree-based classifiers with an overall accuracy of 97.86% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. The whiting events during the study period (2002-2018) occurred exclusively during the winter season (November to March) and mostly in February. Geographically, the whiting events covered areas ranging from 12,000 km(2) to 60,000 km(2) and were mainly located along the southwest coast of the Gulf. The duration of most whiting events was 2 to 6 days, with some events extending as long as 8 to 11 days. The study documented the spatiotemporal distribution of whiting events in the Gulf from 2002 to 2018 and presented an effective tool for detecting and motoring whiting events.

TI  - Moving Target Detection with Modified Logarithm Background Subtraction and Its Application to the GF-3 Spotlight Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne spotlight SAR mode has drawn attention due to its high-resolution capability, however, the studies about moving target detection with this mode are less. The paper proposes an image sequence-based method entitled modified logarithm background subtraction to detect ground moving targets with Gaofen-3 Single Look Complex (SLC) spotlight SAR images. The original logarithm background subtraction method is designed by our team for airborne SAR. It uses the subaperture image sequence to generate a background image, then detects moving targets by using image sequence to subtract background. When we apply the original algorithm to the spaceborne spotlight SAR data, a high false alarm problem occurs. To tackle the high false alarm problem due to the target's low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in spaceborne cases, several improvements are made. First, to preserve most of the moving target signatures, a low threshold CFAR (constant false alarm rate) detector is used to get the coarse detection. Second, because the moving target signatures have higher density than false detections in the coarse detection, a modified DBSCAN (density-based spatial-clustering-of-applications-with-noise) clustering method is then adopted to reduce false alarms. Third, the Kalman tracker is used to exclude the residual false detections, due to the real moving target signature having dynamic behavior. The proposed method is validated by real data, the shown results also prove the feasibility of the proposed method for both Gaofen-3 and other spaceborne systems.

TI  - Identifying Dry-Season Rice-Planting Patterns in Bangladesh Using the Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries, in situ agricultural data is not available and cost-prohibitive to obtain. While remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to map agricultural areas and management characteristics, major efforts are needed to expand our understanding of cropping patterns and the potential for remotely monitoring crop production because this could support predictions of food shortages and improve resource allocation. In this study, we demonstrate a new method to map paddy rice using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the Landsat archive in Bangladesh during the dry (boro) season. Using GEE and Landsat, dry-season rice areas were mapped at 30 m resolution for approximately 90,000 km(2) annually between 2014 and 2018. The method first reconstructs spectral vegetation indices (VIs) for individual pixels using a harmonic time series (HTS) model to minimize the effect of any sensor inconsistencies and atmospheric noise, and then combines the time series indices with a rule-based algorithm to identify characteristics of rice phenology to classify rice pixels. To our knowledge, this is the first time an annual pixel-based time series model has been applied to Landsat at the national level in a multiyear analysis of rice. Findings suggest that the harmonic-time-series-based vegetation indices (HTS-VIs) model has the potential to map rice production across fragmented landscapes and heterogeneous production practices with comparable results to other estimates, but without local management or in situ information as inputs. The HTS-VIs model identified 4.285, 4.425, 4.645, 4.117, and 4.407 million rice-producing hectares for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, which correlates well with national and district estimates from official sources at an average R-squared of 0.8. Moreover, accuracy assessment with independent validation locations resulted in an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa coefficient of 0.83 for the boro/non-boro stable rice map from 2014 to 2018. We conclude with a discussion of potential improvements and future research pathways for this approach to spatiotemporal mapping of rice in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Post-Disaster Recovery Assessment with Machine Learning-Derived Land Cover and Land Use Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-disaster recovery (PDR) is a complex, long-lasting, resource intensive, and poorly understood process. PDR goes beyond physical reconstruction (physical recovery) and includes relevant processes such as economic and social (functional recovery) processes. Knowing the size and location of the places that positively or negatively recovered is important to effectively support policymakers to help readjust planning and resource allocation to rebuild better. Disasters and the subsequent recovery are mainly expressed through unique land cover and land use changes (LCLUCs). Although LCLUCs have been widely studied in remote sensing, their value for recovery assessment has not yet been explored, which is the focus of this paper. An RS-based methodology was created for PDR assessment based on multi-temporal, very high-resolution satellite images. Different trajectories of change were analyzed and evaluated, i.e., transition patterns (TPs) that signal positive or negative recovery. Experimental analysis was carried out on three WorldView-2 images acquired over Tacloban city, Philippines, which was heavily affected by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Support vector machine, a robust machine learning algorithm, was employed with texture features extracted from the grey level co-occurrence matrix and local binary patterns. Although classification results for the images before and four years after the typhoon show high accuracy, substantial uncertainties mark the results for the immediate post-event image. All land cover (LC) and land use (LU) classified maps were stacked, and only changes related to TPs were extracted. The final products are LC and LU recovery maps that quantify the PDR process at the pixel level. It was found that physical and functional recovery can be mainly explained through the LCLUC information. In addition, LC and LU-based recovery maps support a general and a detailed recovery understanding, respectively. It is therefore suggested to use the LC and LU-based recovery maps to monitor and support the short and the long-term recovery, respectively.

TI  - Parcel-Based Crop Classification Using Multi-Temporal TerraSAR-X Dual Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland maps are useful for the management of agricultural fields and the estimation of harvest yield. Some local governments have documented field properties, including crop type and location, based on site investigations. This process, which is generally done manually, is labor-intensive, and remote-sensing techniques can be used as alternatives. In this study, eight crop types (beans, beetroot, grass, maize, potatoes, squash, winter wheat, and yams) were identified using gamma naught values and polarimetric parameters calculated from TerraSAR-X (or TanDEM-X) dual-polarimetric (HH/VV) data. Three indices (difference (D-type), simple ratio (SR), and normalized difference (ND)) were calculated using gamma naught values and m-chi decomposition parameters and were evaluated in terms of crop classification. We also evaluated the classification accuracy of four widely used machine-learning algorithms (kernel-based extreme learning machine, support vector machine, multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN), and random forest) and two multiple-kernel methods (multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) and multiple kernel learning (MKL)). MKL performed best, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.1%, and proved useful for the identification of crops with small sample sizes. The difference (raw or normalized) between double-bounce scattering and odd-bounce scattering helped to improve the identification of squash and yams fields.

TI  - Coupled Spatiotemporal Characterization of Monsoon Cloud Cover and Vegetation Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In monsoonal ecosystems, vegetation phenology is generally modulated by the timing and intensity of seasonal precipitation. Seasonal precipitation is often characterized by substantial interannual variability in both space and time. A rigorous quantitative understanding of the ecology of the landscape requires spatially explicit information regarding the strength of the relationship between seasonal precipitation and vegetation phenology, as well as the interannual variability of the system. For this information to be accurately estimated, it must be based on spatially and temporally consistent measurements. The optical satellite image archive can provide these measurements. Satellite imagery offers observations of both a) atmospheric parameters such as the timing and spatial extent of monsoon cloud cover; and, b) phenological parameters, such as the timing and spatial extent of vegetation green-up and senescence. This work presents a method to capture both atmospheric and phenological parameters from an optical image time series. The method uses Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of a single spectral index for unified characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of both monsoon cloud cover and vegetation phenology. This is made possible by leveraging well-understood differences in the visible and near infrared reflectance of green vegetation, soil, and clouds. Image time series are transformed into a temporal feature space (TFS) that is comprised of low-order Principal Components. The structure of the temporal feature space reveals spatiotemporally distinct annual cycles of both cloud cover and vegetation phenology. In order to illustrate this technique, we apply it to the retrospective analysis of a seasonal cloud forest in the Dhofar Mountains of the southern Arabian Peninsula. Our results quantify known (but previously unmapped) local gradients in monsoon duration and vegetation community response. Individual ecological subsystems are also clearly distinguishable from each other, and consistent elevation gradients emerge within each subsystem. Novel observations also emerge, such as regreening/early greening events and spatial patterns in cloud duration. The method is conceptually straightforward and could be applied to characterize other monsoon environments anywhere on Earth.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Scenarios for Optimum Water Yield and Sediment Retention Ecosystem Services in Klong U-Tapao Watershed, Songkhla, Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Klong U-Tapao watershed is the main source of water supply for agriculture, industry, and household consumption of the Songkhla province and it frequently contributes serious problems to lowland areas, particularly flood and soil erosion. Therefore, land use and land cover (LULC) scenario identification for optimum water yield and sediment retention ecosystem services are necessary. In this study, LULC data in 2010 and 2017 were firstly classified from Landsat data using random forests classifiers, and they were then used to predict LULC change during 2018 -2024 under three different scenarios by CLUE-S model. Later, actual LULC data in 2017 and predictive LULC data of three scenarios were further used to estimate water yield and sediment retention services under the InVEST and LULC scenario for optimum water yield and sediment retention ecosystem services were finally identified using the ecosystem service change index (ESCI). The result of the study showed the major increasing areas of LULC types during 2010-2017 were rubber plantation and urban and built-up area while the major decreasing areas of LULC classes were evergreen forest and miscellaneous land. In addition, the derived LULC prediction of three different scenarios could provide realistic results as expected. Likewise, water yield and sediment retention estimation of three different scenarios could also provide expected results according to characteristics of scenarios' definitions and climates, soil and terrain, and LULC factors. Finally, LULC of Scenario II was chosen for optimum water yield and sediment retention ecosystem services. In conclusion, the integration of remote sensing technology with advanced classification methods and geospatial models can be used as proficient tools to provide geospatial data on water yield and sediment retention ecosystem services from different scenarios.

TI  - Using of Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data Improves Crop-Type Mapping in the Subtropical Agriculture Region
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-type identification is very important in agricultural regions. Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91). The RF method had the best performance in terms of identity classification. In addition, the indices feature dominated the classification results. The combination of phenological period information with multi-source remote sensing data can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season. The results of crop classification can be used to analyze the density and distribution of crops. This study can also allow to determine crop growth status, improve crop yield estimation accuracy, and provide a basis for crop management.

TI  - Recalibration of over 35 Years of Infrared and Water Vapor Channel Radiances of the JMA Geostationary Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared sounding measurements of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder/2 (HIRS/2) instruments are used to recalibrate infrared (IR; similar to 11 mu m) channels and water vapor (WV; similar to 6 mu m) channels of the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR), Japanese Advanced Meteorological Imager (JAMI), and IMAGER instruments onboard the historical geostationary satellites of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The recalibration was performed using a common recalibration method developed by European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), which can be applied to the historical geostationary satellites to produce Fundamental Climate Data Records (FCDR). Pseudo geostationary imager radiances were computed from the infrared sounding measurements and regressed against the radiances from the geostationary satellites. Recalibration factors were computed from these pseudo imager radiance pairs. This paper presents and evaluates the result of recalibration of longtime-series of IR (1978-2016) and WV (1995-2016) measurements from JMA's historical geostationary satellites. For the IR data of the earlier satellites (Geostationary Metrological Satellite (GMS) to GMS-4) significant seasonal variations in radiometric biases were observed. This suggests that the sensors on GMS to GMS-4 were strongly affected by seasonal variations in solar illumination. The amplitudes of these seasonal variations range from 3 K for the earlier satellites to <0.4 K for the recent satellites (GMS-5, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-9 (GOES-9), Multi-functional Transport Satellite-1R (MTSAT-1R) and MTSAT-2). For the WV data of GOES-9, MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2, no seasonal variations in radiometric biases were observed. However, for GMS-5, the amplitude of seasonal variation in bias was about 0.5 K. Overall, the magnitude of the biases for GMS-5, MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 were smaller than 0.3 K. Finally, our analysis confirms the existence of errors due to atmospheric absorption contamination in the operational Spectral Response Function (SRF) of the WV channel of GMS-5. The method used in this study is based on the principles developed within Global Space-based Inter-calibration System (GSICS). Moreover, presented results contribute to the Inter-calibration of imager observations from time-series of geostationary satellites (IOGEO) project under the umbrella of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) initiative Sustained and Coordinated Processing of Environmental Satellite data for Climate Monitoring (SCOPE-CM).

TI  - Variability of the Suspended Particle Cross-Sectional Area in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A cross-sectional area (CSA) is a key element in the optical properties of suspended particles. The seasonal evolution of CSA has great potential for use in mapping total suspended particles, and such mapping plays an important role in water quality monitoring. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations in CSA in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea were studied using temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a data collected by four cruises. The CSA field data covered a wide range of spatiotemporal variabilities in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea. The results revealed that the largest CSA (>2 m(-1)) was found in the coastal area, while the CSA (<= 1 m(-1)) on the outer shelf was much smaller. Large values of CSA (>15 m(-1)) were observed in winter, whereas the smallest values of CSA (0 similar to 2 m(-1)) were observed in summer. These results suggest that vertical mixing and ocean stratification might be important physical mechanisms that influences the CSA seasonal distribution in the surface layer. The results also showed that phytoplankton played an important role in the CSA, with an R-2 value of 0.601. The seasonal patterns of CSA documented in this study provide a fundamental theory for research on optical properties, mapping transparency, and photosynthetically active radiation.

TI  - Urban Expansion in Ethiopia from 1987 to 2017: Characteristics, Spatial Patterns, and Driving Forces
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban growth in major cities of a country poses challenges for sustainable development. Particularly in Africa, the process of rapid urbanization is little understood and research is mostly limited to single cities. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the growth and spatial patterns of urban development in the three major cities of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa, Adama, and Hawassa) from 1987 to 2017. Also, the applicability of diffusion and coalescence theory on the evolution of these cities has been tested. Remote sensing and GIS technologies were combined with spatial metrics and morphological analysis was employed to undertake this study. The result revealed that all the studied cities experienced accelerated growth in the urbanized areas, but the cities with a larger initial urbanized size were associated with lower expansion rates. Differences in extent and direction of expansion in each city were mostly related to physical features, urban master plans, and policies, with an increase in the irregularity and dispersion of urban growth, representing strong evidence of urban sprawl. The spatiotemporal analysis confirmed that the urbanization processes of Addis Ababa and Adama were consistent and Hawassa city diverged from expectations based on diffusion and coalescence theory. In general, large cities with strong economic growth in a country fail to effectively control the scattered nature of urban growth, thus requiring aggressive policy intervention. The approach used in this study permits a deeper exploration of urban development patterns and the identification of priority areas for effective urban planning and management.

TI  - Ground Deformation Analysis Using InSAR and Backpropagation Prediction with Influencing Factors in Erhai Region, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long continuity of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide high space and resolution data for ground deformation investigations. The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city's development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is different from a water-deficient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four influencing factorsincluding the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai regionwere used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.

TI  - Investigating Surface Urban Heat Islands in South America Based on MODIS Data from 2003-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have been investigated in many regions around the world, but little attention has been given with regard to SUHIs in South America. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data was used to investigate the diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations in the SUHI intensity (SUHII, the urban LST minus the rural LST) in 44 South American cities in different climate zones and types of rural land. To examine the effects of factors that may influence the SUHII, correlations between the SUHII and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), urban area, population, altitude, and anthropogenic heat emissions were performed. The results showed that the SUHI effect was obvious in South America. The mean daytime SUHII was higher than the mean night-time SUHII in all areas except for the arid climate zone. In the daytime, the summer displayed a stronger SUHII in the warm temperate climate zone than the other seasons. The night-time SUHII showed less obvious seasonal variations. In addition, the surrounding land cover influenced the SUHII. During the day, the SUHII was therefore stronger in rural areas that were covered by forests than in other types of rural land. Interannually, most cities showed an insignificant temporal trend in the SUHII from 2003 to 2016. The daytime SUHII was significantly and negatively correlated with the EVI (the urban EVI minus the rural EVI) across the 44 cities, but a poor relationship was observed at night. In addition, anthropogenic heat emissions were positively correlated with the night-time SUHII. Urban area, population, and altitude were weakly correlated with the SUHII, which suggested that these factors may not have a significant impact on the spatial variations in the SUHII in South America.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Mapping Smallholder Agriculture Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Image
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In classification of satellite images acquired over smallholder agricultural landscape with complex spectral profiles of various crop types, exploring image spatial information is important. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN), originally designed for natural image recognition in the computer vision field, can automatically explore high level spatial information and thus is promising for such tasks. This study tried to evaluate different CNN structures for classification of four smallholder agricultural landscapes in Heilongjiang, China using pan-sharpened 2 m GaoFen-1 (meaning high resolution in Chinese) satellite images. CNN with three pooling strategies: without pooling, with max pooling and with average pooling, were evaluated and compared with random forest. Two different numbers (70,000 and 290,000) of CNN learnable parameters were examined for each pooling strategy. The training and testing samples were systematically sampled from reference land cover maps to ensure sample distribution proportional to the reference land cover occurrence and included 60,000-400,000 pixels to ensure effective training. Testing sample classification results in the four study areas showed that the best pooling strategy was the average pooling CNN and that the CNN significantly outperformed random forest (2.4-3.3% higher overall accuracy and 0.05-0.24 higher kappa coefficient). Visual examination of CNN classification maps showed that CNN can discriminate better the spectrally similar crop types by effectively exploring spatial information. CNN was still significantly outperformed random forest using training samples that were evenly distributed among classes. Furthermore, future research to improve CNN performance was discussed.

TI  - Analysis of Vegetation Red Edge with Different Illuminated/Shaded Canopy Proportions and to Construct Normalized Difference Canopy Shadow Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadows exist universally in sunlight-source remotely sensed images, and can interfere with the spectral morphological features of green vegetations, resulting in imprecise mathematical algorithms for vegetation monitoring and physiological diagnoses; therefore, research on shadows resulting from forest canopy internal composition is very important. Red edge is an ideal indicator for green vegetation's photosynthesis and biomass because of its strong connection with physicochemical parameters. In this study, red edge parameters (curve slope and reflectance) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of two species of coniferous trees in Inner Mongolia, China, were studied using an unmanned aerial vehicle's hyperspectral visible-to-near-infrared images. Positive correlations between vegetation red edge slope and reflectance with different illuminated/shaded canopy proportions were obtained, with all R(2)s beyond 0.850 (p < 0.01). NDVI values performed steadily under changes of canopy shadow proportions. Therefore, we devised a new vegetation index named normalized difference canopy shadow index (NDCSI) using red edge's reflectance and the NDVI. Positive correlations (R-2 = 0.886, p < 0.01) between measured brightness values and NDCSI of validation samples indicated that NDCSI could differentiate illumination/shadow circumstances of a vegetation canopy quantitatively. Combined with the bare soil index (BSI), NDCSI was applied for linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) using Sentinel-2 multispectral imaging. Positive correlations (R-2 = 0.827, p < 0.01) between measured brightness values and fractional illuminated vegetation cover (FIVC) demonstrate the capacity of NDCSI to accurately calculate the fractional cover of illuminated/shaded vegetation, which can be utilized to calculate and extract the illuminated vegetation canopy from satellite images.

TI  - An Improved Approach Considering Intraclass Variability for Mapping Winter Wheat Using Multitemporal MODIS EVI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the major cereal crops in the world. Monitoring and mapping its spatial distribution has significant implications for agriculture management, water resources utilization, and food security. Generally, winter wheat has distinguished phenological stages during the growing season, which form a unique EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series curve and differ considerably from other crop types and natural vegetation. Since early 2000, the MODIS EVI product has become the primary dataset for satellite-based crop monitoring at large scales due to its high temporal resolution, huge observation scope, and timely availability. However, the intraclass variability of winter wheat caused by field conditions and agricultural practices might lower the mapping accuracy, which has received little attention in previous studies. Here, we present a winter wheat mapping approach that integrates the variables derived from the MODIS EVI time series taking into account intraclass variability. We applied this approach to two winter wheat concentration areas, the state of Kansas in the U.S. and the North China Plain region (NCP). The results were evaluated against crop-specific maps or statistical data at the state/regional level, county level, and site level. Compared with statistical data, the accuracies in Kansas and the NCP were 95.1% and 92.9% at the state/regional level with R-2 (Coefficient of Determination) values of 0.96 and 0.71 at the county level, respectively. Overall accuracies in confusion matrix were evaluated by validation samples in both Kansas (90.3%) and the NCP (85.0%) at the site level. Comparisons with methods without considering intraclass variability demonstrated that winter wheat mapping accuracies were improved by 17% in Kansas and 15% in the NCP using the improved approach. Further analysis indicated that our approach performed better in areas with lower landscape fragmentation, which may partly explain the relatively higher accuracy of winter wheat mapping in Kansas. This study provides a new perspective for generating multiple subclasses as training inputs to decrease the intraclass differences for crop type detection based on the MODIS EVI time series. This approach provides a flexible framework with few variables and fewer training samples that could facilitate its application to multiple-crop-type mapping at large scales.

TI  - Seismic Surface Deformation Risks in Industrial Hubs: A Case Study from Ulsan, Korea, Using DInSAR Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedentedly strong 2016 Gyeongju and 2017 Pohang earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula aroused public concern regarding seismic hazards previously considered improbable. In this study, we investigated the effects of recent seismic activity close to the epicenters of both earthquakes in the heavy industrial complex of Ulsan. This was performed using Sentinel-1 InSAR time series data combined with on-site GPS observations and background GIS data. The interpretations revealed ongoing topographic deformation of a fault line and surrounding geological units of up to 15 mm/year. Postseismic migrations through the fault line, coupled with the two earthquakes, were not significant enough to pose an immediate threat to the industrial facilities or the residential area. However, according to InSAR time series analyses and geophysical modelling, strain from the independent migration trend of a fault line and eventual/temporal topographic changes caused by potential seismic friction could threaten precisely aligned industrial facilities, especially chemical pipelines. Therefore, we conducted probabilistic seismic hazard and stress change analyses over surrounding areas of industrial facilities employing modelled fault parameters based on InSAR observations. These demonstrate the potential of precise geodetic survey techniques for constant monitoring and risk assessment of heavy industrial complexes against seismic hazards by ongoing fault activities.

TI  - High-Speed Ship Detection in SAR Images Based on a Grid Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an active microwave sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the characteristic of all-day and all-weather earth observation, which has become one of the most important means for high-resolution earth observation and global resource management. Ship detection in SAR images is also playing an increasingly important role in ocean observation and disaster relief. Nowadays, both traditional feature extraction methods and deep learning (DL) methods almost focus on improving ship detection accuracy, and the detection speed is neglected. However, the speed of SAR ship detection is extraordinarily significant, especially in real-time maritime rescue and emergency military decision-making. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach for high-speed ship detection in SAR images based on a grid convolutional neural network (G-CNN). This method improves the detection speed by meshing the input image, inspired by the basic thought of you only look once (YOLO), and using depthwise separable convolution. G-CNN is a brand new network structure proposed by us and it is mainly composed of a backbone convolutional neural network (B-CNN) and a detection convolutional neural network (D-CNN). First, SAR images to be detected are divided into grid cells and each grid cell is responsible for detection of specific ships. Then, the whole image is input into B-CNN to extract features. Finally, ship detection is completed in D-CNN under three scales. We experimented on an open SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) used by many other scholars and then validated the migration ability of G-CNN on two SAR images from RadarSat-1 and Gaofen-3. The experimental results show that the detection speed of our proposed method is faster than the existing other methods, such as faster-regions convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), single shot multi-box detector (SSD), and YOLO, under the same hardware environment with NVIDIA GTX1080 graphics processing unit (GPU) and the detection accuracy is kept within an acceptable range. Our proposed G-CNN ship detection system has great application values in real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military strategy formulation.

TI  - Identification of Natural and Anthropogenic Drivers of Vegetation Change in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Megacity Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the natural and anthropogenic mechanisms of vegetation changes is the basis for adapting to climate change and optimizing human activities. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megacity region, which is characterized by significant geomorphic gradients, was chosen as the case study area. The ordinary least squares (OLS) method was used to calculate the NDVI trends and related factors from 2000 to 2015. A geographic weighted regression (GWR) model of NDVI trends was constructed using 14 elements of seven categories. Combined with the GWR calculation results, the mechanisms of the effects of explanatory variables on NDVI changes were analyzed. The findings suggest that the overall vegetation displayed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015, with an NDVI increase of ca. 0.005/year. Additionally, the NDVI fluctuations in individual years were closely related to precipitation and temperature anomalies. The spatial pattern of the NDVI change was highly consistent with the gradients of geomorphology, climate, and human activities, which have a tendency to gradually change from northwest to southeast. The dominant climate-driven area accounted for only 5.98% of the total study area. The vegetation improvement areas were regionally concentrated and had various driving factors, and vegetation degradation exhibited strong spatial heterogeneity. The vegetation degradation was mainly caused by human activities. Natural vegetation was improved because of natural factors and reductions in human activities. Moreover, cropland vegetation as well as urban and built-up area improvements were related to increased human actions and decreased natural effects. This study can assist in ecological restoration planning and ecological engineering implementation in the study area.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring of Cropland Change near Dongting Lake, China, Using the LandTrendr Algorithm with Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking cropland change and its spatiotemporal characteristics can provide a scientific basis for assessments of ecological restoration in reclamation areas. In 1998, an ecological restoration project (Converting Farmland to Lake) was launched in Dongting Lake, China, in which original lake areas reclaimed for cropland were converted back to lake or to poplar cultivation areas. This study characterized the resulting long-term (1998-2018) change patterns using the LandTrendr algorithm with Landsat time-series data derived from the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Of the total cropland affected, similar to 447.48 km(2) was converted to lake and 499.9 km(2) was converted to poplar cultivation, with overall accuracies of 87.0% and 83.8%, respectively. The former covered a wider range, mainly distributed in the area surrounding Datong Lake, while the latter was more clustered in North and West Dongting Lake. Our methods based on GEE captured cropland change information efficiently, providing data (raster maps, yearly data, and change attributes) that can assist researchers and managers in gaining a better understanding of environmental influences related to the ongoing conversion efforts in this region.

TI  - Ground Subsidence Investigation in Fuoshan, China, Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology with TerraSAR-X Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Highways built on soft clay subgrade are more prone to subsidence due to the geotechnical characteristics of soft clay. Monitoring ground movements in this area is significant for understanding the deformation dynamics and reducing maintenance cost as well. In this paper, small baseline subset synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) technique is exploited to obtain and investigate the time series ground surface deformation after the construction of a road embankment over soft clay settlement. Considering the important effect of temporal deformation models on the final accuracy of estimated deformation, both the linear velocity model and seasonal deformation model are utilized to conduct the comparative investigation of deformation time series. Two highways in Fuoshan, China-G1501 Guangzhou Belt Highway and Lungui Highway-were selected as the test area. Thirteen TerraSAR-X images acquired from October 2014 to November 2015 were analyzed. Comparative study based on two groups of analyses generated from the two models for both highways were conducted. Consequently, several feature points distributed near the two highways were analyzed in detail to understand the temporal evolution of the settlement. In order to evaluate the reliability of our measurements, the residual phase was analyzed to assess the modelling accuracy of the two models. In addition, leveling data were also used to validate the experimental results. Our measurements suggest that the seasonal model is more suitable for the test highways, with an accuracy of +/- 3 mm with respect to the leveling results.

TI  - Landsat data to estimate a model of water quality parameters in Tigris and Euphrates rivers - Iraq
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tigris and Euphrates are the two main rivers that supply the water demanded by all the cities in Iraq. However, due to contentious deterioration, monitoring the water quality of these two rivers has become a necessity. Hence, there is need for a study concerning water quality modelling using satellite data for the rivers of Iraq. The main objective of this study is to create a new simple and accurate algorithm for the extraction of water quality parameters for the rivers of Iraq using Landsat 5 satellite data as a cheap and effective method for the monitoring of polluted rivers in Iraq. The area of study is located in the central region of Iraq. The water quality data archive was acquired in August 2007, and it represents the daily values for six physical and chemical water parameters: Dissolved Oxygen DO2, Total dissolved solids TDS, pH value, Orthophosphate PO4, Electrical conductivity E.C and Water temperature T. The parameter data were compared with the reflectance values of Landsat 5 bands using different band combinations of empirical algorithms. The results of the analysis showed a significant correlation between these models and water quality parameters with R-2 > 0.83. The results of comparison between the predicted water quality parameters and those in the archive displayed more reliability for the models used, R-2 = (0.73 - 0.97). The results of spatial analysis demonstrated the possibility of using the Landsat's spectrum bands for the evaluation of the water quality for rivers in Iraq. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by IASE.

TI  - Alternative tree-cover states of the boreal ecosystem: A conceptual model
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Previous analyses of remotely sensed data detected the multimodality of the tree-cover distribution of the boreal forest, and identified areas with potentially alternative tree-cover states. This paper aims at investigating the causes of multimodality and multistability of the boreal forest, their influence on the asymmetric tree species distribution between Eurasia and North America, and whether multistability could be associated with recent greening trends in leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Location Eurasian and North American boreal forests. Time period 2000-2010. Major taxa studied Boreal forest plant functional types. Methods We employ a conceptual model based on tree species competition to simulate the sensitivity of tree cover to stochastic disturbances and to changes in environmental factors. We include different plant functional types based on survival adaptations, and force the model with remotely sensed environmental data. We analyse the model as a dynamical system. We use metrics from statistics and information theory to compare the detection of alternative tree-cover states and greening trends in LAI and NDVI. Results We find that multimodality and multistability can emerge through competition between different plant functional types. Additionally, our model is able to reproduce the asymmetry in tree species distribution between Eurasia and North America. Moreover, changes in permafrost distribution can be associated with phenomenological bifurcation points of the model. Finally, we find that the detection of multistable areas is not affected by recent vegetation trends, whereas shifts between alternative states could have affected the greening trends. Main conclusions Tree-cover multistability in the boreal region can emerge through competition between species subject to periodic disturbances. Changes in permafrost thaw and distribution could be responsible for the asymmetry in tree species distribution between North America and Eurasia. Climate change and permafrost degradation could cause shifts in tree-cover states and dominant species. Recent vegetation greening trends in multistable areas could have been affected by shifts between alternative states.
