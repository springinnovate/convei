TI  - Systematic Review of Surgical Treatment and Outcomes After Local Surgery of Primary Cutaneous Melanomas of the Penis and Scrotum
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND Few data exist to guide surgical management and counseling about local recurrence after surgery of primary melanoma of male genitalia.OBJECTIVE To compile all available data on local recurrence rates after surgery of primary cutaneous melanoma of the penis and scrotum.MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review of PubMed, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Web of Science identified all surgically treated penile and scrotal melanomas that reported local recurrence status and follow-up time.RESULTS One hundred twenty-seven melanomas from 74 manuscripts were included. Eighty-six percent of melanomas were located on the penis, and 14% were located on the scrotum. Average follow-up time was 35.7 months. Scrotal melanomas were predominantly treated with organ-sparing surgeries (16/18, 88.9%), whereas penile melanomas were treated more often with amputation (61/109, 56.0%). Overall, local recurrence rate was 15.7% (20/127). Local recurrence rates for penile cases were 18.8% (9/48) after organ-sparing surgery versus 13.1% (8/61) for amputative surgery. Local recurrence rates were 66.7% (4/6) after positive surgical margins versus 10.2% (5/49) after negative surgical margins.CONCLUSION Local recurrence rates are high after both organ-sparing and amputative surgery of primary cutaneous melanoma of the penis and scrotum. There is a need to standardize reporting for this rare tumor, as more complete data are necessary to develop consensus guidelines for surgical management of male genital melanoma.

TI  - Standing sentinel during human sleep: Continued evaluation of environmental stimuli in the absence of consciousness
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - While it is a well-established finding that subjects' own names (SON) and familiar voices are salient during wakefulness, we here investigated processing of environmental stimuli during sleep including deep N3 and REM sleep. Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N - 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.

TI  - Modelling Hydrological Components of the Rio Maipo of Chile, and Their Prospective Evolution under Climate Change
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the Poly-Hydro model to assess the main hydrological components of the snow-ice melt driven Maipo River in Chile, and glaciers' retreat under climate change therein until 2100. We used field data of ice ablation, ice thickness, weather and hydrological data, and precipitation from TRMM. Snow cover and temperature were taken from MODIS. We forced the model using weather projections until 2100 from three GCMs from the IPCC AR5, under three different radiative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5). We investigated trends of precipitation, temperature, and hydrology until 2100 in the projection period (PR, 2014-2100) and the whole period (CM 1980-2100, composite), against historical trends in control period (CP, 1980-2013). We found potentially increasing temperature until 2100, except for Spring (OND). In the PR period, yearly flow decreases significantly under RCP85, on average -0.25 m(3)s(-1)year(-1), and down to -0.48 m(3)s(-1)year(-1), i.e., -0.4% year(-1) against CP yearly average (120 m(3) s(-1)). In the long run (CM) significant flow decrease would, occur under almost all scenarios, confirming persistence of a historical decrease, down to -0.39 m(3)s(-1)year(-1) during CM. Large flow decreases are expected under all scenarios in Summer (JFM) during PR, down to -1.6 m(3)s(-1)year(-1), or -1% year(-1) against CP for RCP8.5, due to increase of evapotranspiration in response to higher temperatures. Fall (AMJ) flows would be mostly unchanged, while Winter (JAS) flows would be projected to increase significantly, up to 0.7 m(3)s(-1)year(-1) during 2014-2100, i.e., +0.9% year(-1) vs. CP under RCP8.5, due to large melting therein. Spring (OND) flows would decrease largely under RCP8.5, down to -0.67 m(3) s(-1)year(-1), or -0.4% year(-1) vs. CP, again due to evapotranspiration. Glacier down wasting is projected to speed up, and increasingly so with RCPs. Until 2100 ice loss would range from -13% to -49% (-9%, and -39% at 2050) of the estimated volume at 2012, which changed by -24% to -56% (-21%, and -39% at 2050) vs. ice volume in 1982, thus with rapider depletion in the first half of the century. Policy makers will have to cope with modified hydrological cycle in the Maipo River, and greatly decreasing ice cover in the area.

TI  - Development of an empirical model for chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and Secchi Disk Depth estimation for a Pampean shallow lake (Argentina)
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow Pampean lakes are located in the most productive plain of Argentina. They are highly variable in salinity, turbidity and surface area. Laguna Chascomus has been monitored as a representative example of them. We developed a linear model based on satellite images validated against field measurements (2001-2011 period). A vegetation index and Landsat Surface Reflectance (Band 4) produced the best correlations with chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), respectively. In a second instance, a retrospective analysis (1986-2013) was performed. As a result, significant positive trends were observed for SDD and Chl-a. In addition, both variables displayed trends related to rainfall and site depth. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature and Urban Density: Multiyear Modeling and Relationship Analysis Using MODIS and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to model and relate the urban density and land surface temperature (LST) by a straightforward and efficient approach. Although the urban density-LST relation is widely addressed in literature, this study allows for its modeling and parameterization in an accurate way, providing a further scientific support for the city planning policy. The urban density and the LST analysis is carried out in the Bangkok area for the years 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016; in this time interval, the city exhibited an evident urban expansion. Firstly, by using land cover maps obtained from Landsat reflective observations, the urban land density growth across the years studied is evaluated by applying a ring-based approach, a method employed in urban theory, providing urban density curves as a function of the distance from the city center. For each year, the urban density curve is well modeled by an inverse S-shape function, the parameters of which highlight an urban sprawl over the years studied and an outskirt growth in recent years. Then, employing 237 MODIS LST images, the night-time and daytime mean LST patterns for each year were processed applying the same ring-based analysis, obtaining LST trends versus distance. Albeit the mean LST decreases away from the city core, the daytime and night-time trends are different in both shape and values. The daytime LST exhibits a trend also modeled by an inverse S-shape function, whereas the night-time one is modeled by a quadratic function. Finally, the urban density-LST relationship is inferred across the years: For daytime, the relation is quadratic with a coefficient of determination r(2) around 0.98-0.99, whereas for night-time the relation is linear with r(2) of the order of 0.95-0.96. The proposed approach allows for reliable modeling and to straightforwardly infer a very accurate urban density-LST relationship.

TI  - COMPARISON OF HYPERSPECTRAL AND MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERY TO BUILDING A SPECTRAL LIBRARY AND LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of this research work is to compare k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) supervised classification with migrating means clustering unsupervised classification (MMC) method on the performance of hyperspectral and multispectral data for spectral land cover classes and develop their spectral library in Samara, Russia. Accuracy assessment of the derived thematic maps was based on the analysis of the classification confusion matrix statistics computed for each classified map, using for consistency the same set of validation points. We were analyzed and compared Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral data to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Advance Land Imager (ALI) multispectral data. Hyperspectral imagers, currently available on airborne platforms, provide increased spectral resolution over existing space based sensors that can document detailed information on the distribution of land cover classes, sometimes species level. Results indicate that KNN (95, 94, 88 overall accuracy and .91, .89, .85 kappa coefficient for Hyp, ALI, OLI respectively) shows better results than unsupervised classification (93, 90, 84 overall accuracy and .89, .87, .81 kappa coefficient for Hyp, ALI, OLI respectively). Development of spectral library for land cover classes is a key component needed to facilitate advance analytical techniques to monitor land cover changes. Different land cover classes in Samara were sampled to create a common spectral library for mapping landscape from remotely sensed data. The development of these libraries provides a physical basis for interpretation that is less subject to conditions of specific data sets, to facilitate a global approach to the application of hyperspectral imagers to mapping landscape. In addition, it is demonstrated that the hyperspectral satellite image provides more accurate classification results than those extracted from the multispectral satellite image. The higher classification accuracy by KNN supervised was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify optimal separating classes with low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes' separation.

TI  - Flood inundation mapping and monitoring in Kaziranga National Park, Assam using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based flood assessment for extent and severity is very crucial input before, during, and after a flood event has occurred. Though optical remote sensing data has been widely used for flood hazard mapping, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is preferred for detecting inundated areas and providing reliable information during a flood event due to its capability to operate in all weather and day/night time. Availability of cloud-free optical images during monsoon over north eastern India is a rarity. SAR data also has the advantage of detecting inundation under vegetated areas due to its penetration capabilities and sensitivity to soil moisture. The present study is an attempt to use SAR data for flood monitoring of the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) during monsoon, 2017. Every year, animals are washed away by floods and most of them migrate to higher grounds in order to escape from the rising water levels. Flooding events are common in the study area during the monsoon season due to high rainfall and its close proximity to the Brahmaputra River. Dual polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 SAR images obtained for the entire monsoon period in 2017 were used to create inundation maps of the KNP. Two flood waves were observed in July and August, the second of which is considered to be one of the worst flooding events inundating most areas of the park. The use of SAR data for monitoring of flood events can be very crucial for identifying locations for building animal shelters and finding routes for rescue and relief operations during the disaster.

TI  - Design and Synthesis of <SUP>99m</SUP>TcN-Labeled Dextran-Mannose Derivatives for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: New approaches based on the receptor-targeted molecular interaction have been recently developed with the aim to investigate specific probes for sentinel lymph nodes. In particular, the mannose receptors expressed by lymph node macrophages became an attractive target and different multifunctional mannose derivate ligands for the labeling with Tc-99m have been developed. In this study, we report the synthesis of a specific class of dextran-based, macromolecular, multifunctional ligands specially designed for labeling with the highly stable [Tc-99m  N](2+) core. Methods: The ligands have been obtained by appending to a macromolecular dextran scaffold pendant arms bearing a chelating moiety for the metallic group and a mannosyl residue for allowing the interaction of the resulting macromolecular Tc-99m conjugate with specific receptors on the external membrane of macrophages. Two different chelating systems have been selected, S-methyl dithiocarbazate [H2NNHC(=S)SCH3=HDTCZ] and a sequence of two cysteine residues, that in combination with a monophosphine coligand, are able to bind the [Tc-99m  N](2+) core. Conclusions: High-specific-activity labeling has been obtained by simple mixing and heating of the [Tc-99m  N](2+) group with the new mannose-dextran derivatives.

TI  - Theoretical and Experimental Analyses of the Impact of High-Temperature Surroundings on the Temperature Estimated by an Optical Pyrometry Technique
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The light-water one-rod equipment for loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) experimental investigation (LORELEI) device, one of the experiments of the future experimental nuclear reactor Jules Horowitz of Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, will be dedicated to the study of the LOCA. For a better understanding of the temperature conditions during a LOCA, the surface temperature of the fuel cladding has to be monitored. For this purpose, we are designing a noncontact temperature measurement device based on multispectral pyrometry, adapted to the extreme conditions of LORELEI. In this paper, we present a radiative transfer model, taking into account the direct flux from the measured surface and contributions from the surroundings, to simulate the impact of high-temperature surroundings on the temperature estimated using the multispectral radiation thermometry (MRT) method. The hypothesis of a constant emissivity profile in the spectral ranges of calculation is used to estimate the surface temperature. Experimental pyrometry measurements are performed on Zircaloy-4 and Inconel surfaces in high-temperature surroundings to validate the model. As in LORELEI, an optical fiber is used to carry the infrared thermal flux from the cladding to the spectrometer. Thermocouples are used to give a reference temperature and to provide a complete temperature monitoring of the device. A temperature difference is observed between the "true" cladding temperature and the MRT temperature estimation, when the temperature of the surroundings is between 50 degrees C and 150 degrees C below the cladding temperature, and this difference increases with the cladding temperature. This provides a correction value to apply on the temperature estimation to approach the real cladding temperature.

TI  - A spatial vulnerability assessment of monsoonal wetland habitats to para grass invasion in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Kakadu National Park and its wetlands are World Heritage and Ramsar listed and are at risk from invasive grasses. However, it appears that not all habitats and native vegetation are equally at risk. We conduct a spatial risk assessment for pars grass (Urochloa mutica) invasion across seasonally inundated habitats of the 258 km(2) Magela Creek floodplain within Kakadu National Park using Landsat 5 TM time-series imagery. Two maps, representing water depth and fire history, were derived from the imagery using object-based image analyses. Depth was modelled using a linear regression relationship established between 254 known water depth locations and the multi-date spectral index values of segmented image objects at corresponding locations (R-2 = 0.67; p < 0.0001). Binary fire-scar maps were then produced for each year of a 10-year period using visual interpretation and nearest neighbour classification. A map of the incidence of annual fire over this period was then calculated from the sum of the maps, overlaid. The maps were integrated in a GIS with an existing Landsat vegetation map to measure spatial inter-relationships between pars grass, native vegetation, depth and fire. With a highly clustered distribution pattern, para grass occupied 1388 ha or 6% of the total floodplain area. However, its optimal depth habitat, estimated to be from 1.1 to 1.4 m, occurred over a much larger area (7180 ha) or 30% of the floodplain. Only 2% of this optimal area was actually occupied by para grass. Together the low occupancy of 'optimal-depth' habitat and a highly clustered distribution of para grass strongly suggested that, if left uncontrolled, it has capacity to spread further and eventually occupy much larger areas of this floodplain at high density. Landsat provided spatial information of suitable scale and accuracy to understand the landscape ecology of para grass; and from which to design and conduct further research, or trial management interventions to protect wetland vegetation at risk to weed invasion.

TI  - Restoration increases bee abundance and richness but not pollination in remnant and post-agricultural woodlands
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human land use, including agriculture, is a leading contributor to declining biodiversity world-wide and can leave long- lasting legacies on ecosystems after cessation. Ecological restoration is an approach to mitigate these impacts. However, little is known about how animal communities and plant-animal interactions respond to the combined effects of land-use legacies and restoration. We investigated how restoration and agricultural history affect bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) communities and pollination function. In 27 paired remnant (no history of agriculture) and post-agricultural longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) woodlands, we established 4-10 1-ha plots (126 total) and experimentally restored half of them, while the other half were left as unrestored controls. Restoration was accomplished through canopy thinning which reinstates open savanna-like conditions. We collected bees in each plot using a combination of bowl trapping and standardized netting transects. Thinning increased bee abundance by 169% and bee richness by 110%, but agricultural land use had no effect on these variables. Bee community composition was affected by restoration and was marginally affected by agricultural history. To measure pollination function, we conducted a sentinel plant experiment in which potted black mustard (Brassica nigra L.) plants were placed out in a subset of these sites (n = 10) and either bagged to exclude pollinators or left open for pollinator access. Then, we measured fruit and seed set of sentinel plants to compare pollination function among the restoration and land-use history treatments. Seed set and fruit set of sentinel plants were higher in open than bagged plants, indicating that this model system effectively measured pollination, but we found no differences in pollination based on restoration or agricultural history. These results indicate that although pollinator communities may show clear responses to restoration that are largely independent of prior land-use impacts, this does not necessarily translate into differences in pollination function after restoration.

TI  - Using remote sensing indicators to investigate the association of landings with fronts: Application to the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea)
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined links between the variability of coastal front features and composition of fishery landings. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data allowed the detection of thermal fronts and calculation of front metrics that account for gradient, persistency, and vicinity. Landings data were clustered by functional group (according to habitat use, size, morphology), and trophic level (TL). Three independent time series analyses, based on two different classes of statistical methodologies, were carried out: (i) correlation analysis performed on species aggregated by functional groups, and (ii) compositional analysis performed on the top five species landed and on species aggregated by trophic level. Analyses were carried out for the Moroccan coast of the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea). Results of the proposed type of application were discussed with respect to their potential for improving scientific knowledge and management of fisheries in data-poor areas. Pelagic landings were associated with front indicators in two-thirds of tested cases. The results demonstrated a markedly different association between landings and front features in the Nador fishing zone, relative to M'diq and Al Hoceima. Improved performance of the front gradient and persistence indicator was detected, with respect to the front gradient only for flatfish and demersal landings. Compositional data regression outlined a different role for Sardina pilchardus and Trachurus trachurus in the Al Hoceima and M'diq landings, and in the latter case the dominance of these two species in the landings seemed to respond to the front density indicator. A decreasing trend in TL>3.5 landings was detected with increasing front distance.

TI  - OBSERVATIONS FOR REANALYSES
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global dynamical reanalyses of the atmosphere and ocean fundamentally rely on observations, not just for the assimilation (i.e., for the definition of the state of the Earth system components) but also in many other steps along the production chain. Observations are used to constrain the model boundary conditions, for the calibration or uncertainty determination of other observations, and for the evaluation of data products. This requires major efforts, including data rescue (for historical observations), data management (including metadatabases), compilation and quality control, and error estimation. The work on observations ideally occurs one cycle ahead of the generation cycle of reanalyses, allowing the reanalyses to make full use of it. In this paper we describe the activities within ERA-CLIM2, which range from surface, upper-air, and Southern Ocean data rescue to satellite data recalibration and from the generation of snow-cover products to the development of a global station data metadatabase. The project has not produced new data collections. Rather, the data generated has fed into global repositories and will serve future reanalysis projects. The continuation of this effort is first contingent upon the organization of data rescue and also upon a series of targeted research activities to address newly identified in situ and satellite records.

CP  - 4th Spatial Ecology and Conservation (SEC) Conference
CL  - Univ Bristol, Bristol, ENGLAND
AB  - Remote sensing data analysis to infer land cover and the subsequent modelling of land use change are subject to uncertainties, which may have an impact on the accuracy of future land-use predictions. Part of these uncertainties come from the visual interpretation of remote sensing data as during this phase a specific knowledge and expertise are crucial. Visual interpretation includes the meaning of the image content but also goes beyond what can be seen on the image to recognize spatial and landscape patterns. The quality of recognition depends on the expertise in image interpretation and visual perception. Based on this statement, it is necessary to visualize also the information about uncertainty. This paper describes different perspectives of uncertainty visualization on the example of visually interpreted aerial photographs in a mining area. The study is focused on visualization techniques for uncertainty awareness analysis of land cover data. This approach should contribute to better understanding, assessment and potential spreading of visual information of uncertainty and help to appraise the data critically. The goal of this paper is to raise uncertainty awareness among practitioners who deal with land cover data and stress the visualizations techniques as a more reliable means to assess the quality, and hence the uncertainty, of these data.

TI  - Evidence of Possible Recharge Zones for Lake Salda (Turkey)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the evidence of recharge locations using hydrogeochemical and physicochemical measurements in an alkaline lake, Lake Salda, in Burdur, Turkey. In-situ measurements have been performed using a conductivity-temperature-depth device to map the physicochemical dynamic of the lake. Water and sediment samples were collected on the surface and floor of the lake. A seismic study was also carried out in order to observe the geometry of the lake floor. In addition, thermal distribution was mapped using the thermal band of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 satellite images. Temperature and specific conductance measurements were mapped using a new technique, Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK), from the lake's surface to the floor. According to interpolation maps obtained from the EBK, possible water inputs were observed close to a fault at the south-eastern part of the lake. The results of thermal band imaging also reveal the probability of a fault effecting the recharge on the surface. The results of water and sediment samples present a richness in Mg2+ and Fe2+ elements respectively on the floor of the lake. Finally, seismic results show some possible recharge zones on the floor of the lake, and sediment results indicate that there should be peridotite occurrence below the alluvium unit.

TI  - Evolving Epidemiology of Japanese Encephalitis: Implications for Vaccination
T2  - CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review We examine the present global burden of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in endemic populations, summarize published cases in travelers since 2009, examine current guidelines for vaccination for international travelers, and consider challenges in prevention of this vector-borne disease.Recent Findings We identified 11 JE cases in travelers that were published in peer-reviewed literature since 2009. JE incidence in endemic countries appears to be declining but the number of JE cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) varied from estimates derived from other published reports based on serosurveys or sentinel surveillance. Current JE vaccines appear to be safe and are not associated with delayed hypersensitivity in contrast to the older mouse brain vaccine.Summary Given differences between WHO-reported cases and local surveillance data, future research on true incidence is needed. Regular assessment will inform JE risk in travelers. National and international guidelines on JE vaccination varied; we suggest areas for improvement.

TI  - Examining the Influence of Tidal Stage on Salt Marsh Mapping Using High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing and Topobathymetric LiDAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh vegetation extent and zonation are often controlled by bottom up factors determined in part by the frequency and duration of tidal inundation. Tidal inundation during remote-sensing mapping of salt marsh resources can alter the resulting image classification. The degree of this impact on mapping with very high resolution (VHR) imagery has yet to be determined. This paper utilizes topobathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and bathtub models of a tidal stage at 5 cm intervals from mean low water (MLW) to mean high water (MHW) and determines the impact of tidal variation in salt marsh mapping within Jamaica Bay, NY, USA. Tidal inundation models were compared with the Worldview-2 and Quickbird-2 imageries acquired at a range of tidal stages. The modeled inundation of normalized difference vegetation index and smooth cordgrass (S. alterniflora) maps was compared from MLW to MHW. This paper finds that at 0.6 m above MLW, only 3.5% of S. alterniflora is inundated. This paper demonstrates a modeling approach integrating VHR satellite remote-sensing data and topobathymetric LiDAR data to address tidal variation in salt marsh mapping. The incremental modeling of the tidal stage is important for understanding areas most at risk from sea level rise and informs management decisions in accordance with this.

TI  - Risk of Neoplastic Progression in Individuals at High Risk for Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Long-term Surveillance
T2  - GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening of individuals who have a high risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), because of genetic factors, frequently leads to identification of pancreatic lesions. We investigated the incidence of PDAC and risk factors for neoplastic progression in individuals at high risk for PDAC enrolled in a long-term screening study. METHODS: We analyzed data from 354 individuals at high risk for PDAC (based on genetic factors of family history), enrolled in Cancer of the Pancreas Screening cohort studies at tertiary care academic centers from 1998 through 2014 (median follow-up time, 5.6 years). All subjects were evaluated at study entry (baseline) by endoscopic ultrasonography and underwent surveillance with endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of PDAC, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, or intraductal papillary mutinous neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) after baseline. We performed multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, pancreatic lesions with worrisome features (solid mass, multiple cysts, cyst size > 3 cm, thickened/enhancing walls, mural nodule, dilated main pancreatic duct > 5 mm, or abrupt change in duct caliber) or rapid cyst growth (>4 mm/year) were detected in 68 patients (19%). Overall, 24 of 354 patients (7%) had neoplastic progression (14 PDACs and 10 HGDs) over a 16-year period; the rate of progression was 1.6%/year, and 93% had detectable lesions with worrisome features before diagnosis of the PDAC or HGD. Nine of the 10 PDACs detected during routine surveillance were resectable; a significantly higher proportion of patients with resectable PDACs survived 3 years (85%) compared with the 4 subjects with symptomatic, unresectable PDACs (25%), which developed outside surveillance (log rank P <.0001). Neoplastic progression occurred at a median age of 67 years; the median time from baseline screening until PDAC diagnosis was 4.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6-6.9 years). CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term (16-year) follow-up study of individuals at high-risk for PDAC, we found most PDACs detected during surveillance (9/10) to be resectable, and 85% of these patients survived for 3 years. We identified radiologic features associated with neoplastic progression.

TI  - Experimental study on the residual stresses of 800 MPa high strength steel welded box sections
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the residual stresses magnitude and distribution of 800 MPa high strength steel welded box sections. The value of residual stresses is investigated using a method of sectioning, and the effect of width to thickness ratio on the magnitude of stresses is considered in the analysis. From the results of experiment, the influence of width to thickness ratio on the tensile residual stresses in welded zone is small, while the effect of width to thickness ratio on the compressive residual stresses located in the center of plates is large. The maximum tensile residual stresses values change from 0.30 f(y) to 0.56 f(y), and the constant compressive stresses ranges from 0.06 f(y) to 0.26 f(y). The residual stresses distributed in all cross-section satisfies the self-balancing requirement. Comparison of distribution and magnitude of residual stresses between test data and existing models are made. A simplified model is suggested to estimate the residual stresses distribution of steel welded box section made of 800 MPa high strength steel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of the sensitivity of China's next-generation ocean satellite sensor MWI onboard the Tiangong-2 space lab over inland waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate-resolution Wide-wavelengths Imager (MWI) is the next-generation ocean-color sensor independently designed by China and was successfully launched on September 15, 2016 onboard the Tiangong-2 (TG-2) Space Lab. It is currently urgent to assess the capability and data quality of the MWI sensor to determine its future applications. In this study, we first assessed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the radiometric sensitivity of the MWI. With this goal, we chose the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu, as our test area and assessed the capability of the MWI to monitor the turbid inland waters by comparing its consistency with that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data. Our results show that (1) the SNR values of the MWI are greater than 400 in the visible band and are sufficient to effectively avoid ocean-color data errors caused by the sensor noise; however, the SNR values of the MWI are below 200 in the near-infrared (NIR) band and are lower than the theoretical expectation for the design of ocean-color sensors; (2) on the one hand, the MWI-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs)data have large errors in the blue band (R-2 < 0.20, MAPE < 50%) but reduced errors in the red and NIR bands with a high correlation (R-2 > (190, MAPE < 10%) compared with in situ R-rs; on the other hand, the MWI-derived R-rs data are generally consistent with the MODIS- and GOCI-derived R-rs data (R-2 > 0.90, MAPE < 10%); and (3) the MWI-derived concentration distributions of cyanobacterial algal blooms and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Taihu exhibit high spatial resolutions and good accuracies and are in good agreement with the corresponding distributions yielded by the MODIS and GOCI satellites (R-2 > 0.90, MAPE < 10%). However, the MWI cannot detect signals at the important 700-710 bands and consequently has a relatively weak capability to detect chlorophyll-a (Chia) concentrations in inland waters. In summary, as the Chinese next-generation ocean-color sensor, the overall performance metrics of the MWI approach the present international level. Meanwhile, we suggest that the band of the MWI can be further optimized to improve the derived SNR values in the near-infrared band in order to satisfy the requirements of satellite observations over inland waters.

TI  - Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Analysis of the 3 December 2013 Montescaglioso Landslide (Basilicata, Southern Italy): Results from a Multi-Dataset Investigation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image correlation remote sensing monitoring techniques are becoming key tools for providing effective qualitative and quantitative information suitable for natural hazard assessments, specifically for landslide investigation and monitoring. In recent years, these techniques have been successfully integrated and shown to be complementary and competitive with more standard remote sensing techniques, such as satellite or terrestrial Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry. The objective of this article is to apply the proposed in-depth calibration and validation analysis, referred to as the Digital Image Correlation technique, to measure landslide displacement. The availability of a multi-dataset for the 3 December 2013 Montescaglioso landslide, characterized by different types of imagery, such as LANDSAT 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor), high-resolution airborne optical orthophotos, Digital Terrain Models and COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar, allows for the retrieval of the actual landslide displacement field at values ranging from a few meters (2-3 m in the north-eastern sector of the landslide) to 20-21 m (local peaks on the central body of the landslide). Furthermore, comprehensive sensitivity analyses and statistics-based processing approaches are used to identify the role of the background noise that affects the whole dataset. This noise has a directly proportional relationship to the different geometric and temporal resolutions of the processed imagery. Moreover, the accuracy of the environmental-instrumental background noise evaluation allowed the actual displacement measurements to be correctly calibrated and validated, thereby leading to a better definition of the threshold values of the maximum Digital Image Correlation sub-pixel accuracy and reliability (ranging from 1/10 to 8/10 pixel) for each processed dataset.

TI  - Objective Regolith-Landform Mapping in a Regolith Dominated Terrain to Inform Mineral Exploration
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An objective method for generating statistically sound objective regolith-landform maps using widely accessible digital topographic and geophysical data without requiring specific regional knowledge is demonstrated and has application as a first pass tool for mineral exploration in regolith dominated terrains. This method differs from traditional regolith-landform mapping methods in that it is not subject to interpretation and bias of the mapper. This study was undertaken in a location where mineral exploration has occurred for over 20 years and traditional regolith mapping had recently been completed using a standardized subjective methodology. An unsupervised classification was performed using a Digital Elevation Model, Topographic Position Index, and airborne gamma-ray radiometrics as data inputs resulting in 30 classes that were clustered to eight groups representing regolith types. The association between objective and traditional mapping classes was tested using the Mapcurves' algorithm to determine the Goodness-of-Fit', resulting in a mean score of 26.4% between methods. This Goodness-of-Fit indicates that this objective map may be used for initial mineral exploration in regolith dominated terrains.

TI  - Critical review of axillary recurrence in early breast cancer
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Around 2% of early breast cancer cases treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) underwent axillary recurrence (AR) and it has a deleterious effect in prognosis. Different scenarios have incorporated Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy (SLNB) instead of ALND as part of the standard treatment and more effective systemic treatment has also been incorporated in routine management after first curative surgery and after regional recurrence. However, there is concern about the effect of SLNB alone over AR risk and how to predict and treat AR. SLN biopsy (SLNB) has been largely accepted as a valid option for SLN-negative cases, and recent prospective studies have demonstrated that it is also safe for some SLN-positive cases and both scenarios carry low AR rates. Different studies have identified clinicopathological factors related to aggressiveness as well as high risk molecular signatures can predict the development of locoregional recurrence. Other publications have evaluated factors affecting prognosis after AR and find that time between initial treatment and AR as well as tumor aggressive behavior influence patient survival. Retrospective and prospective studies indicate that treatment of AR should include local and systemic treatment for a limited time.

TI  - Adherence to Extended Release Naltrexone: Patient and Treatment Characteristics
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Despite the promise of extended release naltrexone in the treatment of the opioid and alcohol use disorders, challenges with initiation and subsequent adherence have limited its potential. The purpose of this study is to identify the patient and treatment characteristics associated with adherence to extended release naltrexone.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 155 veterans who initiated the medication in FY 2014 and FY2015. Medical records were abstracted for patient and treatment data including preferred drug and utilization of substance use treatment in the year before and after medication initiation.Results: Sample characteristics include 94% male, 70% domiciled, 60% without current legal problems, 30% employed, and preferred drug being opioids for 55% and alcohol for 45%. The mean of five extended release naltrexone injections did not differ by preferred drug. Treatment variables associated with medication adherence included concurrent substance use residential, individual, group, and psychiatric therapies (all p < .05) with inpatient detoxification admissions halved afterward (p < .0001) .Discussion and Conclusions: Whereas most studies of extended release naltrexone have focused on patients with either alcohol or opioid use disorders for 6 months, this study allowed for a direct comparison of adherence in both groups over a year. The average treatment persistence in this veteran sample is greater than described in other public sector studies and may illustrate the importance of concurrent psychosocial therapies.Scientific Significance: Results extend the findings of other studies and add to an emerging appreciation of the factors associated with treatment retention for extended release naltrexone.

TI  - Using remote sensing to model tree species distribution in Peruvian lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models for Amazonian trees have mostly been produced at scales and resolutions that are too broad and coarse for practical use in either conservation or forestry. On the other hand, several studies have shown that elevation and the medium-resolution remote sensing data available via Landsat imagery can be successfully used to detect differences in plant species composition in Amazonia. Therefore, it seems likely that the same data can also be used to predict geographical distributions of individual taxa. Here we use remotely sensed data and a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to generate landscape-scale distribution models at 30-m-resolution for five economically important timber tree genera (Apuleia, Amburana, Crepidospermum, Dipteryx, and Manilkara). Individual Landsat Thematic Mapper bands and normalized difference vegetation index yielded acceptable model performance, and the use of averaging filters (3 x 3 and 5 x 5 pixel low-pass filters) improved model performance further. Including elevation as a predictor also improved model performance for all the genera. Our results suggest that it is possible to use Landsat bands and elevation as predictors for modeling the potential distribution of tree species in lowland Amazonia at a fine enough resolution to facilitate the practical management of forest resources.

TI  - Assessing reliability of precipitation data over the Mekong River Basin: A comparison of ground-based, satellite, and reanalysis datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate precipitation data are the basis for hydro-climatological studies. As a highly populated river basin, with the biggest inland fishery in Southeast Asia, freshwater dynamics is extremely important for the Mekong River Basin (MB). This study focuses on evaluating the reliability of existing gridded precipitation datasets both from satellite and reanalysis, with a ground observations-based gridded precipitation dataset as the reference. Two satellite products (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission [TRMM] and the Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensing Information using an Artificial Neural NetworkClimate Data Record [PERSIANN-CDR]), as well as three reanalysis products (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications [MERRA2], the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis [ERA-Interim], and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis [CFSR]) were compared with the Asian PrecipitationHighly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) over the MB. The APHRODITE was chosen as the reference for the comparison because it was developed based on ground observations and has also been selected as reference data in previous studies. Results show that most of the assessed datasets are able to capture the major climatological characteristics of precipitation in the MB for the 10-year study period (1998-2007). Generally, both satellite data (TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR) show higher reliability than reanalysis products at both spatial and temporal scales across the MB, with the TRMM outperforming when compared to the PERSIANN-CDR. For the reanalysis products, MERRA2 is more reliable in terms of temporal variability, but with some underestimation of precipitation. The other two reanalysis products CFSR and ERA-Interim are relatively unreliable due to large overestimations. CFSR is better positioned to capture the spatial variability of precipitation, while ERA-Interim shows inconsistent spatial patterns but more realistically resembles the daily precipitation probability. These findings have practical implications for future hydro-climatological studies.

TI  - Mapping wheat rust based on high spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate disease incidence monitoring and estimation using satellite imagery is critical for the effective control of wheat rust disease. Though studies have been conducted using different spectral and sensing technologies to detect and monitor the wheat rust disease, few studies have been conducted in the application of high resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery in the monitoring of wheat rust to facilitate an operational monitoring over large areas. Since there are not many options for the multispectral data than the hyperspectral data, it is more important to select appropriate vegetation indices for the classification model. However, there have been few literatures about the comparison of these feature selection methods on the application of wheat disease. We proposed a wheat rust disease mapping protocol including removing the non-vegetated and lodged area, calculating and filtering the vegetation indices and mapping the wheat rust. In the process of filtering the proper features, we applied wrapper feature selection instead of traditional filter feature selection combined with the classification methods (support vector machine and random forests). The experiment data was a scene of ZY-3 satellite image of the wheat field in Changge County in Henan Province with a certain portion of rust disease. The classification results can achieve overall accuracy of higher than 90%, ranging from 90.80% to 95.10%. The wrapper feature selection method with the overall accuracy of 93.60% is better than filters feature selection method with the overall accuracy of 92.65%. The random forests method with the overall accuracy of 94.80% is better than support vector machine method with the overall accuracy of 91.45%. The high accuracies thus justified the feasibility of using high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images for mapping wheat rust disease, which is promising for this technology to be applied in the practical wheat production management.

TI  - Analysis of Stray Light Influence to Modulation on Fourier Transform Spectrometer
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing application, the interferometer, especially Fourier Transform Spectrometer, is required to be of high spectral resolution and high signal to noise (SNR). Therefore, the modulation reduction caused by stray light, which is introduced by multiple reflections of beam splitter and compensator, has been analyzed in detail in this paper. Based on theoretical analysis, the wedge angle and inclination angle are respectively introduced in beam splitter and compensator, which can reduce or even eliminate the influence of stray light by spot separation. The relationships among spot separation angle, wedge angle and inclination angle are given by theoretical formula, which can be used to optimize wedge angle and inclination angle. For the connection of structural parameters, the angle of incidence need to be adjusted with the wedge angle and inclination angle to keep the symmetry of reflected light and transmission light about splitting surface and eliminate the effect on spectral resolution. And then, the thickness of compensator also need to be adjusted, for eliminating the effect of optical path difference changing of regular optical light. The influence of the multiple reflections stray light can be eliminated by following these steps. Therefore, an optimization design method is obtained, which is suitable for the Fourier transform spectrometer using the beam splitter and compensator scheme.

TI  - Land cover mapping in urban environments using hyperspectral APEX data: A study case in Baden, Switzerland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery has shown considerable potential for deriving accurate land cover maps in urban areas. In this paper, a new classification framework for mapping land cover in urban environments using high spatial resolution hyperspectral data was proposed. The proposed classification scheme was applied to map urban land cover using APEX data in the city of Baden, Switzerland. We first used the NDWI and NDVI indices to separate the land cover in the scene into three main classes: water, vegetation and non-vegetated surface. Then we partitioned the scene into many superpixels and applied classification using a SVM separately on the vegetation and non-vegetated surfaces. Soil was classified both in vegetation and non-vegetated surface, and these two soil results were merged in the final classification map. Shadows were initially classified in shaded vegetation surfaces and shaded non-vegetated surfaces, and then they were further classified into meaningful land cover categories. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed classification framework is well suited for mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution hyperspectral data. Although the proposed method performs better than traditional methods in terms of soil classification accuracy, our findings emphasize that the soil class should be interpreted with caution in urban land cover maps derived from remote sensing data, even when high spatial resolution hyperspectral data are used. Results from this study also demonstrate that although shaded surfaces are generally classified as a single category in urban environments, in high resolution hyperspectral data, the shadows can be further classified into meaningful land cover classes with an acceptable accuracy.

TI  - A new downscaling-integration framework for high-resolution monthly precipitation estimates: Combining rain gauge observations, satellite-derived precipitation data and geographical ancillary data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving high quality precipitation estimates at high spatial resolution is of prime importance for many hydrological, meteorological, and environmental investigations. Rain gauge observations and satellite-derived precipitation data are two main sources of precipitation estimates. Gauge observations are accurate and reliable, but are heavily point-based and sparse in areas of rugged or complex terrains. Satellite-derived precipitation products can cover large areas, but they are generally characterized by inherent bias. To optimize the use of both datasets, we propose in this paper, a downscaling-integration framework to generate high quality monthly precipitation datasets at 1 km spatial resolution by merging rain gauge observations and TRMM 3B43 products. Firstly, an area-to-point kriging (ATPK) approach is used to downscale the original TRMM product to 1 km, so as to ensure a fair comparison with rain gauge data. Then, the downscaled TRMM precipitation datasets are integrated with the gauge observations using geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK). The geographical factors (i.e. longitude, latitude and elevation) are also used as auxiliary variables in the GWRK model. Applying this approach to an experiment conducted at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China from 2001 to 2014 shows that: (1) the downscaled monthly TRMM precipitation data by ATPK are more accurate than the original TRMM estimates; (2) the GWRK model employing the downscaled TRMM precipitation data and geographical factors provides better monthly precipitation estimates than the conventional ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation and the commonly used merging methods (i.e. geographical difference analysis, GDA and kriging with extemal drift, KED); (3) the GWRK method reduces the influence of the inaccuracy (bias) of satellite-derived precipitation data on the precipitation estimates compared to GDA. The approach presented in this study has provided an efficient alternative for solving the scale mismatch problem between point-based gauge data and low resolution satellite data, and producing improved precipitation data at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Natural History and Outcomes of Cytologically Benign Thyroid Nodules in Children
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Most pediatric thyroid nodules are cytologically benign, but few data exist to guide treatment.Objective: To describe the natural history and outcomes of cytologically benign, pediatric thyroid nodules.Design: Cohort study.Setting: Multidisciplinary thyroid clinic at an academic medical center.Patients: Consecutive pediatric patients (<18 years old) with cytologically benign thyroid nodules evaluated between 1998 and 2016.Results: Cytologically benign nodules (N = 237) in 181 patients were followed by ultrasound (median follow-up, 3.4 years; range, 0.5 to 13.9 years) or to resection. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in six nodules (2.5%), and all six patients were disease free after median follow-up of 4.9 years. Malignancy was more common in nodules >4 cm (15.4%; P = 0.037) or that grew during follow-up (6.0%; P = 0.048). The likelihood of nodule growth (+/- SE) was 15% +/- 3%, 24% +/- 4%, and 49% +/- 10% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Among nodules >2 cm, those with.25% cystic content grew more slowly than nodules <25% cystic; nodules <2 cm grew similarly regardless of cystic content.Conclusion: Benign cytology in pediatric thyroid nodules has a low false-negative rate similar to that in adults, and prognosis is excellent in the rare cases of malignancy. Resection of nodules >4 cm, combined with surveillance of smaller nodules and repeated aspiration for growth, detects most false-negative results. Follow-up ultrasound in 12 months is appropriate for most cytologically benign pediatric nodules, but delaying surveillance up to 24 months may be reasonable in large, predominantly cystic nodules.

TI  - A deep look into thin melanomas: What's new for the clinician and the impact on the patient.
T2  - International journal of women's dermatology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma incidence and mortality are on the rise and although most new cases of melanoma are thin, a significant percentage of these patients still experience disease progression. The American Joint Committee on Cancer publishes staging criteria for melanoma, which were recently updated to the 8th edition. The most significant revision from the 7th edition affects the T1b classification, which now includes melanomas with a Breslow depth of 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm. The second major revision eliminates mitoses as a criterion to upstage a thin melanoma to T1b. Although mitotic figures have been established as an independent prognostic factor, they do not have a significant correlation with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy positivity. SLN status remains the most important independent prognostic factor in thin melanomas. Nonetheless, the identification of patients who are at the highest risk for having a positive SLN test result remains difficult. Importantly, a positive SLN test result has high positive predictive value, but a negative one has very low negative predictive value. Since there is no proven survival benefit in performing an SLN biopsy in T1 disease, dermatologists need to have a personalized discussion with patients with thin melanomas to review expected risks and benefits before undertaking this procedure.

TI  - Improved Induction of Anti-Melanoma T Cells by Adenovirus-5/3 Fiber Modification to Target Human DCs
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - To mount a strong anti-tumor immune response, non T cell inflamed (cold) tumors may require combination treatment encompassing vaccine strategies preceding checkpoint inhibition. In vivo targeted delivery of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) to dendritic cells (DCs), relying on the natural functions of primary DCs in situ, represents an attractive vaccination strategy. In this study we made use of a full-length MART-1 expressing C/B-chimeric adenoviral vector, consisting of the Ad5 capsid and the Ad3 knob (Ad5/3), which we previously showed to selectively transduce DCs in human skin and lymph nodes. Our data demonstrate that chimeric Ad5/3 vectors encoding TAA, and able to target human DCs in situ, can be used to efficiently induce expansion of functional tumor-specific CD8(+) effector T cells, either from a naive T cell pool or from previously primed T cells residing in the melanoma-draining sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). These data support the use of Ad3-knob containing viruses as vaccine vehicles for in vivo delivery. "Off-the-shelf" DC-targeted Ad vaccines encoding TAA could clearly benefit future immunotherapeutic approaches.

TI  - Remote-sensed Forest fire activity across Mexico and its sensitivity to drought
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires in Mexico are natural regulators in the dynamics of forest ecosystems. However, their mismanagement can cause catastrophic consequences, affecting critical elements of the ecosystems where they occur. In recent years, official sources have reported an increase in forest fires and affected area. It is very well known that forest fires are widely linked to climatic phenomena. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between drought and fire occurrence in Mexico during the period 2005-2016. The fire data were obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) while the source of drought data is from a Standardized Index of Precipitation and Evapotranspiration (SPEI). Through the G statistic of Getis-Ord it was geospatially determined where the highest incidence of fires occur and where the largest affected area is located. Results indicated that fires are clustered in the center of the country along the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Eje Neovolcanico. It is also concluded that the drought is related to the occurrence of forest fires and their affected surface by 32% and 38% respectively. This study contributes to recent research linking the influence of climate phenomena with fire.

TI  - Label-free determination and multiplex analysis of DNA and RNA in tumor tissues
T2  - APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of the total content of nucleic acids constitutes an important part of medicinal diagnosis. This determination is typically performed using a combination of spectrophotometry and polymerase chain reaction, where multi-step and complex sample pretreatment is generally required. To simplify the analysis, we present a nanosensor for the multiplex determination of DNA and RNA. This nanosensor consists of a magnetic Fe3O4@Ag nanocomposite functionalized by a low molecular selector from the family of alkylating agents, chlorambucil. The sensor allows selective isolation of nucleic acids based on the magnetic properties of integrated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and consecutive determination of their content via magnetically assisted surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MA-SERS). Limits of detection of 3.0 ngL(-1) and 3.8 ngL(-1) are achieved for DNA and RNA, respectively. The enhanced selectivity of the developed sensor, owing to the presence of the alkylating agent, allows multiplexed analysis of DNA and RNA with low relative errors (<10%) of determination.

TI  - Is previous azithromycin treatment associated with azithromycin resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae? A cross-sectional study using national surveillance data in England
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives I t has been suggested that treatment of STI s with azithromycin may facilitate development of azithromycin resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) by exposing the organism to suboptimal doses. We investigated whether treatment history for non-rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), non-gonococcal urethritis (NG U) or NG (proxies for azithromycin exposure) in sexual health (GUM) services was associated with susceptibility of NG to azithromycin.Methods A zithromycin susceptibility data from the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRA SP 2013-2015, n= 4606) and additional high-level azithromycin-resistant isolates (HL-AziR) identified by the Public Health England reference laboratory (2013-2016, n= 54) were matched to electronic patient records in the national GUMCA D STI surveillance dataset (2012-2016). Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between history of previous CT /NG U/NG and subsequent susceptibility of NG to azithromycin.Results Modal azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.25 mg/L (one dilution below the resistance breakpoint) in those with and without history of previous CT /NG U/NG (previous 1 month/6 months). There were no differences in MIC distribution by history of CT / NG U (P= 0.98) or NG (P= 0.85) in the previous 1 month/6 months or in the odds of having an elevated azithromycin MIC (> 0.25 mg/L) (Adjusted OR for CT /NG U 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.25); adjusted OR for NG 0.82 (95% CI : 0.65 to 1.04)) compared with those with no CT /NG U/NG in the previous 6 months. Among patients with HL-AziR NG, 3 (4%) were treated for CT /NG U and 2 (3%) for NG in the previous 6 months, compared with 6% and 8%, respectively for all GRA SP patients.Conclusions We found no evidence of an association between previous treatment for CT /NG U or NG in GUM services and subsequent presentation with an azithromycinresistant strain. As many CT diagnoses occur in non-GUM settings, further research is needed to determine whether azithromycin-resistant NG is associated with azithromycin exposure in other settings and for other conditions.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Simultaneously Involving the Breast and Epithelial Inclusions in an Ipsilateral Axillary Lymph Node
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Benign cystic epithelial inclusions with squamous, glandular, or Mullerian phenotypes are known to occur in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with benign and malignant breast disease. Careful evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and correlation with the histologic findings in the ipsilateral breast are paramount in evaluation of suspected benign inclusions. In this case of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast in a 73-year-old woman, DCIS also involved epithelial inclusions in an ipsilateral axillary lymph node. The recognition of these benign epithelial elements, and awareness that they can be involved by DCIS, is crucial to avoid the overdiagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.

TI  - Let's get connected: A new graph theory-based approach and toolbox for understanding braided river morphodynamics
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Our understanding of braided river morphodynamics has improved significantly in recent years, however, there are still large knowledge gaps relating to both long-term and event-based change in braided river morphologies. Furthermore, we still lack methods that can take full advantage of the increasing availability of remotely sensed datasets that are well suited to braided river research. Network analysis based on graph theory, the mathematics of networks, offers a largely unexplored toolbox that can be applied to remotely sensed data to quantify the structure and function of braided rivers across nearly the full range of spatiotemporal scales relevant to braided river evolution. In this article, important commonalities between braided rivers and other types of complex network are described, providing a compelling argument for the wider uptake of complex network analysis methods in the study of braided rivers. We provide an overview of the extraction of graph representations of braided river networks from remotely sensed data and detail a suite of metrics for quantitative analysis of these networks. Application of these metrics as new tools for multiscale characterization of braided river planforms that improve upon traditional, spatially averaged approaches is discussed and potential approaches to network-based analysis of braided river dynamics are proposed, drawing on a range of different concepts from braided river research and other network sciences. Finally, the potential for using graph theory metrics to validate numerical models of braided rivers is discussed. This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Methods

TI  - Zombies! "They're Us!"
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND POPULAR CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is a "subversive-fulfilment" shaped, theological cultural analysis of George A. Romero's zombie and its progeny. First, it demonstrates that these memetic artefacts intentionally and unintentionally transmit a critique of human nature through metaphor, cinematic devices, and by stimulating and exposing an apocalyptic fantasy. Then, it brings Christian theology into conversation with the worldview of these artefacts and apocalypticism, construing them using Christian categories. It finds that the Christian worldview construes the artefacts as a product of common "grace" and general revelation and of distorting the truth, particularly with respect to the cause of human aberration and the genre's asoteriology; thus, the Christian worldview interacts in an affirming, confronting, and fulfilling manner. It construes the apocalyptic fantasy as a concurrent desire to realize an idolatrous autonomy and to escape its consequences. Therefore, it construes indulgence in apocalyptic fantasy as an act of false worship if these yearnings grasp apocalypse as pseudo-salvation.

TI  - Estimation of monthly rainfall missing data through rain gauge and satellite data assimilation in a tropical Andean river basin
T2  - Idesia
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrometeomlogical data sets usually present missing or erroneous data due to lack of continuity in the records or instrumental errors, which imply the need to develop numerical methods for calculating a reliable estimation, which contributes to improving the consistency in studies of water resources management. The objective of the research is to compare four methods to estimate missing monthly rainfall data and to evaluate the estimation errors in four scenarios (from 10% to 40% of missing data). As a case study. the rainfall gauge stations of the Coello river basin were analyzed during the period from 1998 to 2005. We applied the traditional method of the normal ratio, the ordinary kriging technique and cokriging using elevation and rainfall data estimated by satellite as auxiliary information. The performance of the four methods was evaluated by applying four indices (Root Mean Square Error; Mean Absolute Error; Mean Bias Error; and Pearson correlation coefficient), which were calculated for the four scenarios of missing data. According to results, cokriging with elevation as auxiliary information was the best method to minimize the estimation error (RMSE = 15.54, MAE = 7.21, MBE = -0.23 and R = 0.97). The research concludes that methods that consider spatial dependence provide better estimates of rainfall in the monthly scale.

TI  - Land-Use Carbon Emissions Estimation for the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Using 1994-2016 Landsat Image Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount and growth rate of carbon emissions have been accelerated on a global scale since the industrial revolution (1800), especially in recent decades. This has resulted in a significant influence on the natural environment and human societies. Therefore, carbon emission reduction receives continuously increasing public attention and has long been under debate. In this study, we made use of the land-use specific carbon emission coefficients from previous studies and estimated the land-use carbon emissions and carbon intensities of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA)-which consists of 26 eastern Chinese cities-from Landsat image data and socio-economic statistics in 1995, 2005, and 2015. In addition, spatial autocorrelation models including both global and local Moran's I were used to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of carbon emissions and carbon intensities. It was found that (1) the YRDUA witnessed a rapidly increasing trend for net carbon emissions and a decreasing trend for carbon intensity over the two decades; (2) the spatial differences in carbon intensity had gradually narrowed, but were large in carbon emissions and had gradually increased; and (3) the carbon emissions in 2005 and 2015 had significant spatial autocorrelations. We concluded that (1) from 1995 to 2015 in the YRDUA, carbon emissions were large for the cities along the Yangtze River and carbon intensities were high for Anhui province's resource-based cities, while both carbon emissions and carbon intensities were small for Zhejiang province's cities; (2) over two decades, the increase in carbon emissions from urban land was approximately twice the increase in urban land area. Our study can provide useful insights into the assignment of carbon reduction tasks within the YRDUA.

TI  - Potential of Red Edge Spectral Bands in Future Landsat Satellites on Agroecosystem Canopy Green Leaf Area Index Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation biophysical parameter retrieval is an important earth remote sensing system application. In this paper, we studied the potential impact of the addition of new spectral bands in the red edge region in future Landsat satellites on agroecosystem canopy green leaf area index (LAI) retrieval. The test data were simulated from SPARC '03 field campaign HyMap hyperspectral data. Three retrieval approaches were tested: empirical regression based on vegetation index, physical model-based look-up-table (LUT) inversion, and machine learning. The results of all three approaches showed that a potential new spectral band located between the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) red and NIR bands slightly improved the agroecosystem green LAI retrieval accuracy (R-2 of 0.787 vs. 0.810 for vegetation index approach, 0.806 vs. 0.828 for LUT inversion approach, and 0.925 vs. 0.933 for machine learning approach). The results of this work are consistent with the conclusions from previous research on the value of Sentinel-2 red edge bands for agricultural green LAI retrieval.

TI  - Mississippi River Plume Variability in the Gulf of Mexico From SMAP and MODIS-Aqua Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plain Language Summary The Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System (MARS) is an important source of freshwater and terrigenous material to the Gulf of Mexico. We used sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to describe the MARS plume seasonality and interaction with the Gulf circulation. Our analyses revealed good agreement between SMAP and in situ salinity for S>31, and that satellite-derived tDOC can serve as a useful tracer for the river plume. A boundary detection algorithm was used to quantify the frequency of plume occurrence in the Gulf for the last 15years. The MARS plume has its maximum offshore extension during summer, retracting to closer to shore during fall/winter. Variability at monthly time scales is controlled by river discharge and alongshore winds, which explain up to 60% of the local variance in the frequency of plume occurrence near the shelfbreak. Maximum variability in plume extension is found to the east of the Mississippi River Delta due to wind reversals that generally occur during summer. The combined use of SMAP salinity and MODIS-tDOC allowed for a detailed view of anomalous events in 2015 and 2016, when the MARS plume was transported for 350km from the coast due to interactions with the Loop Current and with dipole eddies. While SMAP observations allow for tracking the river plume even in cloudy conditions, high-resolution MODIS data allow for a more accurate characterization of sharp fronts and of the width of river-influenced filaments.The Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System (MARS) is an important source of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and sediments to the Gulf of Mexico. Here we use satellite observations of surface salinity and of dissolved organic carbon of terrigenous origin to describe the behavior of the MARS plume and its interaction with the Gulf circulation for the last 15years. We show that the MARS plume is transported offshore during summer and toward the coast during fall/winter and that this seasonal variability is controlled by the interaction between river discharge and winds. In 2015 and 2016, the MARS plume was transported for 350km from the coast due to interactions with the large-scale circulation in the Gulf. While salinity from satellite observations allows us to track the river plume even in cloudy conditions, tDOC provides a more accurate characterization of sharp fronts and of the width of river-influenced filaments.

TI  - Characterization of a Novel 4.0-kb Y-type HMW-GS from <i>Eremopyrum distans </i>
T2  - CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel 4.0-kb Fy was sequenced and bacterially expressed. This gene, the largest y-type HMW-GS currently reported, is 4,032-bp long and encodes a mature protein with 1,321 amino acid (AA) residues. The 4.0-kb Fy shows novel modifications in all domains. In the N-terminal, it contains only 67 AA residues, as three short peptides are absent. In the repetitive domain, the undecapeptide RYYPSVTSPQQ is completely lost and the dodecapeptide GSYYPGQTSPQQ is partially absent. A novel motif unit, PGQQ, is present in addition to the two standard motif units PGQGQQ and GYYPTSPQQ. Besides, an extra cysteine residue also occurs in the middle of this domain. The large molecular mass of the 4.0-kb Fy is mainly due to the presence of an extra-long repetitive domain with 1,279 AA residues. The novel 4.0-kb Fy gene is of interest in HMW-GS gene evolution as well as to wheat quality improvement with regard to its longest repetitive domain length and extra cysteines residues.

TI  - A Long-Term, Consistent Land Cover History o the Southeastern United States
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-Cover/Land-Use (Lay) change is a critical aspect of global environmental change, with profound social and ecological consequences. The southeastern U.S. in particular is changing rapidly, but a long-term, consistent LCLU history at fine spatial resolution does not exist for the region. Here, we present a new LCLU history of the southeastern U.S. based on temporal extension of the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) back to 1986. We used Automatic Adaptive Signature Generalization (AASG) to generate this product from Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery and ancillary topographic information. AASG identifies stable sites between two images and uses these stable sites to generate a new training dataset for updating a classification from one date to the next. Our long-term LCLU classifications are broadly consistent with the NLCD while providing a much longer historical record for characterizing recent changes in the southeastern U.S. and contextualizing their consequences for ecosystem services in the region.

T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We synthesize the empirical contributions from the existing applied economics literature examining the influence of institutions and governance on environmental policy, environmental performance, and green investment. The literature on the influence of populism and public opinion on environmental policy adoption is also reviewed in line with the special issue. First, the paper describes how the relationship between institutions, environmental performance and environmental policy have been conceptualized and operationalized in the literature and summarizes the main findings. The second part of the paper outlines avenues for future research with specific attention to the energy transition and climate change literature. With respect to the positivist worldview adopted by this paper, we highlight various opportunities for empirical work that have recently emerged with the growing availability of data in the field of green investments, climate, and energy policy. Expanding the current empirical literature towards these research topics is of both scientific and policy relevance and can provide important insights on the broader field of sustainability transition and sustainable development. Regarding the alternative, non-positivist worldviews, future research could explore ways to connect the richer approaches such as complex adaptive systems and socio-technical transition studies with applied econometric methods, as well as future-oriented studies.

TI  - Foreign Aid and HIV/AIDS in Latin America and the Caribbean: Should We Adjust the Degree of Response?
T2  - ATLANTIC ECONOMIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper estimates the effects of foreign aid on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence in a sample of 27 Latin American and Caribbean countries during 1995-2013 and advocates for stronger sentinel surveillance to monitor the stability of the epidemic in the region. Surges in global HIV funding have improved access to health care and antiretroviral therapy, leading to gains in life expectancy. HIV is a prime cause of death and disability in resource-poor settings. It declines with more global funding for health, yet its pathway is random. The net impact of foreign aid on health is unknown due to poor surveillance. HIV's unsystematic nature requires better metrics arising from global aid data to calibrate the degree of response in the region. A dynamic panel-data model with robust standard errors was used to determine if changes in HIV were associated with changes in foreign aid for health in the sample but the positive association was not statistically significant. Better data from local epidemics is needed to reveal population- and group-specific trends.

TI  - Single-Class Data Descriptors for Mapping <i>Panax notoginseng</i> through P-Learning
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning-based remote-sensing techniques have been widely used for the production of specific land cover maps at a fine scale. P-learning is a collection of machine learning techniques for training the class descriptors on the positive samples only. Panax notoginseng is a rare medicinal plant, which also has been a highly regarded traditional Chinese medicine resource in China for hundreds of years. Until now, Panax notoginseng has scarcely been observed and monitored from space. Remote sensing of natural resources provides us new insights into the resource inventory of Chinese materia medica resources, particularly of Panax notoginseng. Generally, land-cover mapping involves focusing on a number of landscape classes. However, sometimes a subset or one of the classes will be the only part of interest. In term of this study, the Panax notoginseng field is the right unit class. Such a situation makes single-class data descriptors (SCDDs) especially significant for specific land-cover interpretation. In this paper, we delineated the application such that a stack of SCDDs were trained for remote-sensing mapping of Panax notoginseng fields through P-learning. We employed and compared SCDDs, i.e., the simple Gaussian target distribution, the robust Gaussian target distribution, the minimum covariance determinant Gaussian, the mixture of Gaussian, the auto-encoder neural network, the k-means clustering, the self-organizing map, the minimum spanning tree, the k-nearest neighbor, the incremental support vector data description, the Parzen density estimator, and the principal component analysis; as well as three ensemble classifiers, i.e., the mean, median, and voting combiners. Experiments demonstrate that most SCDDs could achieve promising classification performance. Furthermore, this work utilized a set of the elaborate samples manually collected at a pixel-level by experts, which was intended to be a benchmark dataset for the future work. The measuring performance of SCDDs gives us challenging insights to define the selection criteria and scoring proof for choosing a fine SCDD in mapping a specific landscape class. With the increment of remotely sensed satellite data of the study area, the spatial distribution of Panax notoginseng could be continuously derived in the local area on the basis of SCDDs.

TI  - Insights into Macrophage Heterogeneity and Cytokine-Induced Neuroinflammation in Major Depressive Disorder
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Over 350 million individuals suffer from depression, a psychiatric illness classified as major depressive disorder (MDD) with symptoms that include a loss of interest or pleasure in life accompanied by depressed mood. The present understanding of major depressive disorder does not encompass a systematic characterization of the neurobiological processes that drive the behavioral physiology in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Psychiatric illness is a complex intersection between genetics, physiology, immunology and environmental stress. The increased attention to the relevance of depression has led to new discoveries that highlight the biological significance of 'neuroinflammation' and immunity underlying a spectrum of psychiatric illnesses. The process of neuroinflammation involves sentinel immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The activation and polarization of microglia, CNS-resident macrophages, modulates the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder, and this phenomenon has been aptly titled the 'macrophage theory of depression'. Of particular interest are three hallmark cytokines, IL-6, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta, which have been studied extensively in basic research, cell-receptor signaling and drug development. The field of inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation is an emerging area of MDD research that is providing new cellular insight into how macrophages mechanistically support cytokine-associated neuropathology, particularly in the case of IL-1 beta-associated inflammation in MDD. With the increasing number of individuals identified with depression, a comprehensive understanding of macrophage-cytokine signaling pathways in the CNS in depression is necessary for developing effective anti-depressant therapeutics.

TI  - Study of aerosol types and seasonal sources using wavelength dependent Angstrom exponent over North-East India: Ground-based measurement and satellite remote sensing
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral estimates of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD, tau) were made by operating a Microtops-II sun photometer in the spectral range 0.380-0.870 mu m over Tripura in north-eastern India and analyzed to infer the aerosol types and source characteristics in different seasons. The Angstrom exponent (alpha) derived from spectral AOD in different wavelength (lambda) range and subsequent second order derivative of Angstrom exponent (i.e., alpha') and their curvature analysis in the In tau versus In lambda relationship has revealed the crucial information related to the dominance of different aerosol types and their characteristics in different seasons. The average AOD (mean +/- standard deviation) at 0.5 mu m in winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons are observed to be 0.70 +/- 0.28, 0.74 +/- 0.18, 0.55 +/- 0.20, 0.44 +/- 0.19 respectively; while the corresponding seasonal mean values of alpha (over 0.380-0.870 mu m spectral range) are found to be 1.09 +/- 0.17, 0.92 +/- 0.24, 0.51 +/- 0.27, 0.89 +/- 0.38 respectively. Examination of the Angstrom exponents derived from satellite retrieved AOD by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument operating onboard Terra satellite, along with MODIS fine mode aerosol fraction and aerosol types indicates broad seasonal features of aerosol size spectrum over the study region similar to those observed from ground-based measurements. The estimation of the values of alpha at different spectral ranges indicate that winter season is mainly influenced by the fine-mode aerosols having fine-mode fraction (FMF) similar to 0.7; whereas coarse-mode aerosols dominate in the monsoon season having FMF similar to 0.3. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons exhibit the presence of mixed type of aerosols, with slightly greater fraction of fine-mode aerosol in pre-monsoon. Curvature analyses of Angstrom exponent put insight into the consistency of observed features of seasonal aerosol types. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability and covariability of land properties (soil, vegetation and subsurface geology) and remotely sensed soil moisture over the southeast and south-central U.S. are assessed. The goal is to determine whether satellite soil moisture memory contains information regarding land properties, especially the distribution karst formations below the active soil column that have a bearing on land-atmosphere feedbacks. Local (within a few tens of km) statistics of land states and soil moisture are considered to minimize the impact of climatic variations, and the local statistics are then correlated across the domain to illuminate significant relationships. There is a clear correspondence between soil moisture memory and many land properties including karst distribution. This has implications for distributed land surface modeling, which has not considered preferential water flows through geologic formations. All correspondences are found to be strongest during spring and fall, and weak during summer, when atmospheric moisture demand appears to dominate soil moisture variability. While there are significant relationships between remotely-sensed soil moisture variability and land properties, it will be a challenge to use satellite data for terrestrial parameter estimation as there is often a great deal of correlation among soil, vegetation and karst property distributions.

T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The opioid epidemic is currently a major public health problem in Canada. As such, knowledge of upstream risk factors associated with opioid use is needed to inform injury prevention, health promotion and harm reduction efforts.Methods: We analyzed data extracted from 11 pediatric and 6 general hospital emergency departments (EDs) as part of the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) from March 2011 to June 2017. We identified suspected opioid-related injuries using search strings and manually verified them. We computed age-adjusted and sex-stratified proportionate injury ratios (PIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare opioid-related injuries to all injuries in eCHIRPP. Negative binomial regression was used to determine trends over time. We conducted qualitative analyses of narratives to identify common themes across life stages.Results: Between March 2011 and June 2017, 583 suspected opioid-related poisoning/injury cases were identified from eCHIRPP. Most of the cases were females (55%). Many of the injuries occurred in patients' own homes (51%). Forty-five percent of the injuries were intentional self-harm. Among children (aged 1-9 years), most injuries were caused by inadvertent consumption of opioids left unattended. Among youth (aged 10-19 years) and adults (aged 20-49 years), opioid use was associated with underlying mental illness. Overall, the average annual percent change (AAPC) in the rate of injuries (per 100 000 eCHIRPP cases) has been increasing since 2012 (AAPC = 11.9%, p < .05). The increase is particularly evident for males (AAPC = 16.3%, p < .05). Compared to other injuries, people with suspected opioid-related injuries were more likely to be admitted to hospital (PIR = 5.3, 95% CI: 4.6-6.2).Conclusion: The upstream determinants of opioid-related injuries are complex and likely vary by subpopulations. Therefore, continued monitoring of risk factors is important in providing the evidence necessary to prevent future overdoses and deaths.

AB  - Million tons of dust are transported every year primarily from the Sahara Desert, Syria and Arabian Peninsula, which are close to Turkey. In this study, Sanliurfa, was selected as an observation station to investigate the extent of long range transport of dust influencing Southeastern Anatolia Region for the first time. Hence, PM10 and PM2.5 types of dust were collected into filters through dust collection device during 2012 year and the amount was determined. The source of the dust at 500, 1000 and 1500 meters, also, was analyzed using the model of HYSPLIT. MODIS aerosol product was used for satellite images of dusty days. The source of these dusts carried over long distances was found, with HYSPLIT, to be Sahara Desert in particular, Syrian desert and deserts in the Arabian Peninsula. Dust collected daily through dust collection device into PM10 and PM2.5 filters was found to come more frequently in transition seasons of as PM10 of 550 mu g m(-3), PM2.5 of 213 mu g m(-3) in spring; as PM10 of 620 mu g m(-3), PM2.5 of 240 mu g m(-3) in autumn which are all above the minimum standard levels (50 mu g m(-3)) accepted by the WHO.

TI  - <i>In Utramque Partem</i>: Arguing Both Sides of the Question in <i>Othello</i>
T2  - ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of arguing on both sides of any question was essential to early modern rhetorical education, to Renaissance drama, and especially to Shakespeare's Othello. This essay explores two different conceptions of rhetoric and rhetorical ability in Othello. Although Othello understands the ornaments of rhetoric, he has not, like Iago, mastered its habits of mind, particularly the cultivation of ambiguity required by rhetorical study. The difference between Othello's and Iago's rhetorical worldviews is exemplified by their differing abilities in arguing both sides of a question. This practice, which requires holding two contradictory arguments in mind, is one of Iago's main strengths. Since they are Othello's primary weaknesses, Iago's skepticism and ability to argue from multiple perspectives ultimately prove to be Othello's undoing. But these same abilities and habits of mind are also the only means by which Othello may have been able to refute Iago's rhetoric and prevent his own destruction. In Othello Shakespeare argues both sides of the question about arguing both sides of the question, outlining both the advantages and disadvantages of this essential rhetorical practice and the worldview it encourages.

TI  - Estimation of total phosphorus concentration using a water classification method in inland water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Total phosphorus (TP) is an important factor of eutrophication. The accurate monitoring of TP concentration is conducive to the management of water environments. To improve the accuracy of TP remote sensing inversion, this paper improved and studied the following three aspects. First, a new optical classification method was constructed to classify water into two different types. Compared with other classification methods, the proposed method can be more effective for improving the accuracy of TP inversion. Second, data regression analysis and fitting (DRF), back propagation neural network (BP) and random forest (RF) were used to build TP inversion models based on the different water type. The validation results indicated that the DRF performed best, with the highest precision for all water types, and was suitable for TP inversion. Finally, the performance of the classification and inversion algorithms on Sentinel-3 data was evaluated and one image was acquired for mapping the TP concentration in Taihu Lake. All in all, this study improves the accuracy of TP inversion by combining the new classification algorithm with DRF. This is significant for the development of class-based water quality parameter inversion algorithms for water color remote sensing, and this approach can be applied in the effective management and control of the eutrophication of lake environments.

TI  - PCR Testing of Filter Material from IVC Lids for Microbial Monitoring of Mouse Colonies
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing sentinel animals exposed to soiled bedding from colony animals is the most common method used for health monitoring in rodent facilities. Although environmental sampling is being explored-and, in many cases, has been implemented-as an alternative, exhaust plenum sampling is not effective for all ventilated rack designs. This study evaluated PCR testing of filter paper from sentinel cages on ventilated racks. We hypothesized that testing filter paper from cages containing soiled bedding would be as effective as testing sentinel mice and that periodic shaking of cages would generate sufficient particulate movement to substitute for the presence of live animals. Three cages containing soiled bedding were maintained in each of 8 rooms; one cage contained 2 Cr:NIH(S) mice, one had no mice and was shaken twice weekly, and the remaining one had no mice and was left undisturbed. For 3 consecutive months, a piece of filter paper from the undersurface of the cage lid was tested monthly for adventitial agents and then replaced. A second piece remained on the cage undersurface for 3 mo. Fecal pellets and oral and fur swabs were collected from sentinel mice at months 1 and 3 and tested for the same agents. At month 3, serology was performed on the sentinel mice; feces and oral and fur swabs from colony animals were tested concurrently for comparison. Filter paper from cages without mice and shaken were at least as effective than all other methods in detecting the presence of endemic agents, including mouse norovirus, Helicobacter spp., Pasteurella pneumotropica, Entamoeba muris, and Spironucleus muris. For IVC systems where exhaust plenum testing is ineffective, PCR testing of IVC filter tops should be considered as an alternative to soiled bedding sentinels. Environmental sampling may provide increased reliability and reduce the number of rodents used for routine health surveillance.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study examines long-term land use/land cover change (LUCC) at a finer scale in a semi-arid region of India. The objectives were to study and quantify the spatiotemporal LUCC and uncover the major drivers causing the change in the Mula Pravara river basin, which is located in a semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 3g data for the years 1982-2015 were used to identify the 'hotspot' with significant positive and negative LUCC. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was used to produce finer scale land use maps. From 1991 to 2016, the agricultural land area increased by approximately 98% due to the conversion of uncultivable and fallow lands to agriculture. The built-up area increased by 195%, and in recent years, an urban expansion has occurred in agricultural lands close to the urban fringe areas. There has been a shift from food crops to commercial crops, as observed from the steep increase in the amount of land under horticultural plantations, by 1601% from 2001 to 2016. In addition, the area under forest canopy was reduced in the protected regions. Institutional factors that improved access to water resources were the major drivers of change in hotspots, especially in the context of agriculture. Technological and economic factors were the other supporting factors that contributed to the change. This study demonstrates the advantages of using satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor the LUCC, which is useful for predicting future land changes and aids in planning adaptation strategies.

TI  - Application of SWAT model for predicting soil erosion and sediment yield
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hirakud, the longest earthen dam in Asia on the river Mahanadi, has been affected by sedimentation problems which affect reservoir storage capacities and different reservoir operations. This article presents the hydrological modeling of the Mahanadi catchment up to Hirakud, located in the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha in India, using the modified version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with an interface of ArcView Geographic Information System software to predict soil erosion and sediment transport to the reservoir for improving its useful life. The data sources used in the study were: terrain data 90 m resolution of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Land Use and Land Cover derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, soil map published by National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, India and meteorological data collected from India Meteorological Department, India. The study involves the analysis of sensitive parameters of the simulated data (discharge 15, sediment load 6); 5-year calibration and 3-year validation on daily basis to predict the discharge and sediment load. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Latin Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time. The results also show that the prediction of sediment yield is highly sensitive to the sizes of different sub-basins due to the sensitivity of topographic factors used in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. The graphical as well as statistical results achieved in this study indicate that the model is capable to identify critical erosion-prone areas within the watershed on the scale of sub-watershed which helps the hydrologists to introduce effective management practices at the lowest cost. The study shows that about 34% area of total catchment falls under high or above soil erosion zones with combination of coarse loamy type of soil and agricultural type of land use and land cover condition. The results of this study also identify regions of high sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio. To enhance the SWAT model performance, it is recommended to use sub-daily data and to prioritize soil erosion at the Hydrological Response Units level for improvement of watershed management.

TI  - Sand Spit Elongation and Sediment Balance at Cua Lo Inlet in Central Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion is significant on the downdrift beach of Cua Lo Inlet, which is located in Central Vietnam. The elongation of Cua Lo Inlet's updrift sand spit together with severe erosion of the downdrift bank is raising numerous social problems such as flood safety and land loss. In this study, a series of Landsat and Google Earth images were used to analyze and investigate the inlet recent morphological changes and evolution. Since 1970 the inlet has constantly migrated towards the sediment transport pathway, and its traveling distance has reached 1700 m. In order to quantitatively investigate such characteristics, the tip coordinates and the area of the sand spit updrift of the inlet were calculated. In particular, the area of the sand spit has increased remarkably, and the increasing rate is almost constant. Using this value, the rate of sand volume transported along the updrift sand spit by the waves was estimated and it is in good agreement with the longshore sediment transport rate of the surrounding beach.

TI  - Contextual identity experiencing facilitates resilience in Native American academics
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the socio-cultural dynamics that interact with ethno-racial identity experiencing in a previously under-researched group. A qualitative interdisciplinary study with 40 Native American academics from 28 mainstream universities across the U.S. served as a case example with findings that contrasted with historically influential theoretical frameworks postulating identity confusion and conflicts at the intersection of one's mainstream education and profession versus one's ethno-racial community grounding. Instead of feeling pressure to identify with only one worldview, the contextual, dynamic identities associated with the inclusive and flexible self-concept of tribal participants allowed them to in turn take advantage of two divergent cultural meaning systems pertaining to their distinct socio-cultural contexts. These shifts were experienced as not endogenous but rather exogenous variables, which did not cause the historically theorized issues. Participants felt their tribal identities instead facilitated meaningful integration of the existing incongruences, which resulted in unexpectedly resilient subjective experiencing.

TI  - Analysis Ready Data: Enabling Analysis of the Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data that have been processed to allow analysis with a minimum of additional user effort are often referred to as Analysis Ready Data (ARD). The ability to perform large scale Landsat analysis relies on the ability to access observations that are geometrically and radiometrically consistent, and have had non-target features (clouds) and poor quality observations flagged so that they can be excluded. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has processed all of the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) archive over the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii, into Landsat ARD. The ARD are available to significantly reduce the burden of pre-processing on users of Landsat data. Provision of pre-prepared ARD is intended to make it easier for users to produce Landsat-based maps of land cover and land-cover change and other derived geophysical and biophysical products. The ARD are provided as tiled, georegistered, top of atmosphere and atmospherically corrected products defined in a common equal area projection, accompanied by spatially explicit quality assessment information, and appropriate metadata to enable further processing while retaining traceability of data provenance.

TI  - Remote Sensing Derived Built-Up Area and Population Density to Quantify Global Exposure to Five Natural Hazards over Time
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure is reported to be the biggest determinant of disaster risk, it is continuously growing and by monitoring and understanding its variations over time it is possible to address disaster risk reduction, also at the global level. This work uses Earth observation image archives to derive information on human settlements that are used to quantify exposure to five natural hazards. This paper first summarizes the procedure used within the global human settlement layer (GHSL) project to extract global built-up area from 40 year deep Landsat image archive and the procedure to derive global population density by disaggregating population census data over built-up area. Then it combines the global built-up area and the global population density data with five global hazard maps to produce global layers of built-up area and population exposure to each single hazard for the epochs 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015 to assess changes in exposure to each hazard over 40 years. Results show that more than 35% of the global population in 2015 was potentially exposed to earthquakes (with a return period of 475 years); one billion people are potentially exposed to floods (with a return period of 100 years). In light of the expansion of settlements over time and the changing nature of meteorological and climatological hazards, a repeated acquisition of human settlement information through remote sensing and other data sources is required to update exposure and risk maps, and to better understand disaster risk and define appropriate disaster risk reduction strategies as well as risk management practices. Regular updates and refined spatial information on human settlements are foreseen in the near future with the Copernicus Sentinel Earth observation constellation that will measure the evolving nature of exposure to hazards. These improvements will contribute to more detailed and data-driven understanding of disaster risk as advocated by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

TI  - Applications of Open-Access Remotely Sensed Data for Flood Modelling and Mapping in Developing Regions
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Flood modelling and mapping typically entail flood frequency estimation, hydrodynamic modelling and inundation mapping, which require specific datasets that are often unavailable in developing regions due to financial, logistical, technical and organizational challenges. This review discusses fluvial (river) flood modelling and mapping processes and outlines the data requirements of these techniques. This paper explores how open-access remotely sensed and other geospatial datasets can supplement ground-based data and high-resolution commercial satellite imagery in data sparse regions of developing countries. The merits, demerits and uncertainties associated with the application of these datasets, including radar altimetry, digital elevation models, optical and radar images, are discussed. Nigeria, located within the Niger river basin of West Africa is a typical data-sparse country, and it is used as a case study in this review to evaluate the significance of open-access datasets for local and transboundary flood analysis. Hence, this review highlights the vital contribution that open access remotely sensed data can make to flood modelling and mapping and to support flood management strategies in developing regions.

TI  - Management of waste water discharge within the Nile Valley of Egypt: The collapse of Al Ballanah waste water's lake in Aswan in September 2013
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the management strategies of waste water being conveyed into the hinterland of the Nile Valley areas in south Egypt. The inappropriate planning for sanitation drainage and treatment localities and consequent waste water use has developed an environmental disaster. The surplus accumulation of waste water into the evaporation lake led to its collapse in September 2013, and the flows contaminated the agricultural areas and the Nile River. Remote sensing data, digital elevation models (DEM) and soil maps were integrated into geographic information system (GIS) to ensure the full consumption of waste water via evaporation and cultivation of appropriate non-edible crops. The annual produced treated-water is approximately 10 million cubic meters, and the existing cultivated woodland covers 140 ha, which only consumes 1.1 million cubic meters of water. The oxidation and evaporation lakes and ponds annually consume 4 million cubic meters. The available soil suitable for reclamation is distributed within higher topography areas that require pumping via pressure lines. These soils cover 554.6 h and would consume up to 10.5 million cubic meters, which is sufficient to consume the treated water. Given the current difficulties to cultivate the available soil, the surplus accumulation of waste water can further be consumed via increasing evaporation rates from the water bodies through the introduction of voracious water crops such as water hyacinth. Additionally, these water plants will enhance the quality of waste water and could be used as raw materials for other purposes. (C) 2016 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Implementation of total laboratory automation at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia: effect on turnaround time and cost efficiency
T2  - ANNALS OF SAUDI MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total laboratory automation (TLA) is a relatively new way of improving the management of high volume clinical laboratories. TLA may reduce staff, reduce operating costs, decrease testing time and provide enhanced process control.OBJECTIVES: Establish a cost efficient TLA that is less labor intensive, improves productivity and reduces turnaround time (TAT).DESIGN: Implementation of TLA for random glucose and troponin-T as sentinel tests to compare change in TAT.SETTING: Tertiary hospital with high volume of laboratory tests.METHODS: Routine patient samples for random glucose and troponin-T were used to capture TAT. Information on staff grades and schedules before and after implementing the TLA, and cost of contracts to deliver the service were collected.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TAT, cost efficiency, and reduction in labor.RESULTS: The consolidation of contracts resulted in a reduction of 28.8 million SAR in direct costs. Staffing cost was reduced by 1.14 million SAR with less senior staff required; there were reductions in staff at both senior and junior level. The overall TAT for all tests was reduced by 32% in 2016 (after TLA implementation) compared to 2012 (before TLA implementation). The median TAT for random glucose tests was reduced by 21% (to 55.7 minutes in 2016 from 70.1 minutes in 2012). Evidence of test optimization by exploring the impact of stat tests, auto-dilutions and reruns on the overall TAT of the TLA is shown by comparing troponin T TATs after reclassifying stat tests (in 2016) to routine (in 2017). At the 75th percentile, there was a 27% reduction in TAT when comparing August 2016 to March 2017 with a 19% reduction in median TAT.CONCLUSION: By moving from stat to routine assays, the TAT was reduced, which is counter-intuitive. The use of stat assays slowed down the performance of the TLA. A careful review of the mix of assays should be conducted to maximize performance and to ensure that the system delivers what is required.LIMITATIONS: Room for improvement by systematically analyzing and reviewing the impact of making minor changes that could have significant impact on TAT.

TI  - Implementation of a transformational plan of care at a Veterans Affairs medical center
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. A quality of care-focused process improvement initiative undertaken by the pharmacy service at a Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center is described.Summary. In September 2016, near the end of VA's 2016 fiscal year (FY), pharmacy leaders at the medical center held a strategic planning retreat to develop goals and objectives for FY 2017. The retreat was facilitated through use of principles of lean methodology, including "A3 problem solving," and resulted in development of a transformational plan of care (TPOC). After identifying process improvement projects with the highest value-adding potential, retreat participants prioritized those projects in accordance with targeted value streams encompassing 5 areas of pharmacy operations: United States Pharmacopeia chapter 800 compliance, standard work, physical space, technology, and people. Upon retreat completion, tasks were assigned to pharmacy service managers according to their respective areas of expertise. The status of each project and the projects' impact on both pharmacy and facility outcome measures were continually assessed throughout FY 2017. Continuous reevaluation of projects within each value stream allowed for accurate outcome tracking and creation of a pharmacy dashboard. In the months after implementation of the pharmacy service TPOC, improvements in a number of performance metrics were documented.Conclusion. Use of lean process improvement methodology and the A3 problem-solving process resulted in more efficient generation and implementation of ideas, consistent follow-up, and the ability to continuously reevaluate pharmacy service operations to ensure progress throughout the year.

TI  - Access to Affordable Breast Cancer Care in Eastern Europe
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe majority of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries report inferior breast cancer survival rates compared with Western European countries. We review limitations in access to screening programs, surgery, radiotherapy, pathology, palliative care, and antineoplastic medicines as potential explanations for these disparities.Recent FindingsMost CEE countries do not have the quality and quantity of radiotherapy needed to adequately service the population. Surgical services are widely accessible, but sentinel node biopsy is not universally available. There are important limitations for CEE patients in accessing high-quality pathology. Many patients living with advanced cancer are in dire need of palliation services. Important inequalities exist in availability and patient costs, especially for newer, more expensive drugs, across Europe, while drug shortages affect several essential, old, and inexpensive drugs.SummaryImprovements in radiotherapy, surgery, and pathology and access to medicines are needed, together with the provision of trained health care professionals.

TI  - Two-step sentinel lymph node mapping strategy in endometrial cancer staging using fluorescent imaging: A novel sentinel lymph node tracer injection procedure
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The current sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracer injection procedure for endometrial cancer commonly uses cervical injection, which can detect SLNs of the uterine cervix but not the uterine body. This study describes an SLN tracer injection procedure, titled two-step SLN mapping, which can identify SLNs of the uterine body and cervix using fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) and results of SLN biopsy.Methods: In 50 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer, two-step SLN mapping was performed during laparoscopic surgical staging with the PINPOINT real-time fluorescence imaging system. The first step was to identify SLNs of the uterine body. In total, 4-6 mL of ICG was injected into the bilateral uterine cornual areas, and lymphatic channels were traced, followed by identification and removal of paraaortic SLNs. The second step was to identify SLNs of the uterine cervix by injecting 4 mL of ICG into the cervix. After harvesting the mapped pelvic SLNs, complete pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy was performed to validate the two-step SLN mapping strategy.Results: Our two-step SLN mapping strategy produced excellent SLN detection rates: 100% (50/50) overall for SLNs; 98.0% (49/50) for pelvic SLNs; 94.0% (47/50) for bilateral SLNs; and 86.0% (43/50) for paraaortic SLNs. We detected microscopic metastasis in harvested SLNs of 4 patients (8.0%). The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of SLN detection were all 100%. There was no false negative case.Conclusion: The two-step SLN mapping strategy to identify lymph nodes from the uterine fundus and cervix was feasible. This strategy could be more accurate in identifying paraaortic lymph node metastasis than the cervical injection method.

TI  - EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL OF EO DATA AND GIS FOR ECOSYSTEM HEALTH MODELING IN RESPONSE TO WILDFIRE: A CASE STUDY IN CENTRAL GREECE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the development of a suitable methodology for establishing and monitoring indicators of Ecosystem Health (EH) and its responses to wildfire using Earth Observation (EO) data synergistically with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is investigated. The proposed methodology combined GIS and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data to assess ecosystem characteristics, including its vigor, organization and resilience, for a case study in Central Greece. These parameters were quantified primarily by utilizing EO-based techniques focusing on the analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Topographic features, including slope, aspect and a Compound Topographic Index (CTI) were also derived from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), and integrated in a modeling scheme to assess EH. The developed modeling scheme illustrates the effect of wildfires on EH accurately, demonstrating correlations between areas of past wildfires and their associated recovery. Our findings thus provide useful information to land managers and policy makers of fire affected regions alike, and could provide important contributions to the potential development of an operational estimation of EH recovery after wildfire.

TI  - Method Combining Probability Integration Model and a Small Baseline Subset for Time Series Monitoring of Mining Subsidence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) has high accuracy for monitoring slow surface subsidence. However, in the case of a large-scale mining subsidence areas, the monitoring capabilities of TS-InSAR are poor, owing to temporal and spatial decorrelation. To monitor mining subsidence effectively, a method known as Probability Integration Model Small Baseline Set (PIM-SBAS) was applied. In this method, mining subsidence with a large deformation gradient was simulated by a PIM. After simulated deformation was transformed into a wrapped phase, the residual wrapped phase was obtained by subtracting the simulated wrapped phase from the actual wrapped phase. SBAS was used to calculate the residual subsidence. Finally, the mining subsidence was determined by adding the simulated deformation to the residual subsidence. The time series subsidence of the Nantun mining area was derived from 10 TerraSAR-X (TSX) images for the period 25 December 2011 to 2 April 2012. The Zouji highway above the 9308 workface was the target for study. The calculated maximum mining subsidence was 860 mm. The maximum subsidence for the Zouji highway was about 145 mm. Compared with the SBAS method, PIM-SBAS alleviates the difficulty of phase unwrapping, and may be used to monitor large-scale mining subsidence.

TI  - Comparison of C-Band Quad-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Wind Retrieval Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work discusses the accuracy of C-2PO (C-band cross-polarized ocean backscatter) and CMOD4 (C-band model) geophysical model functions (GMF) for sea surface wind speed retrieval from satellite-born Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images over in the Northwest Pacific off the coast of China. In situ observations are used for comparison of the retrieved wind speed using two established wind retrieval models: C-2P0 model and CMOD4 GMF. Using 439 samples from 92 RADARSAT-2 fine quad-polarization SAR images and corresponding reference winds, we created two subset wind speed databases: the training and testing subsets. From the training data subset, we retrieve ocean surface wind speeds (OSWSs) from different models at each polarization and compare with reference wind speeds. The RMSEs of SAR-retrieved wind speeds are: 2.5 m/s: 2.11 m/s (VH-polarized), 2.13 m/s (HV-polarized), 1.86 m/s (VV-polarized) and 2.26 m/s (HH-polarized) and the correlation coefficients are 0.86 (VH-polarized), 0.85(HV-polarized), 0.87(VV-polarized) and 0.83 (HH-polarized), which are statistically significant at the 99.9% significance level. Moreover, we found that OSWSs retrieved using C-2P0 model at VH-polarized are most suitable for moderate-to-high winds while CMOD4 GMF at VV-polarized tend to be best for low-to-moderate winds. A hybrid wind retrieval model is put forward composed of the two models, C-2PO and CMOD4 and sets of SAR test data are used in order to establish an appropriate wind speed threshold, to differentiate the wind speed range appropriate for one model from that of the other. The results show that the OSWSs retrieved using our hybrid method has RMSE of 1.66 m/s and the correlation coefficient are 0.9, thereby significantly outperforming both the C-2PO and CMOD4 models.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the number of dust events has increased significantly in the west and southwest of Iran. In this research, a survey on the dust events during the period 1990-2013 is carried out using historical dust data collected from seven synoptic stations scattered across the west and southwest of Iran. Using statistical analysis of the observational data, two of the most severe dust storm events that occurred in the region on July 4-7, 2009 and June 17-20, 2012 were selected and analyzed synoptically. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset was used to obtain the required fields including sea level pressure, surface wind field, geopotential height at 500 hPa, and wind and vertical motion at the 850 hPa level. Moreover, weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) with two aerosol schemes, GOCART and MADE/SORGAM, were used to simulate the amount of particulate matter (PM10) and its transportation over the studied region. The initial and lateral boundary conditions of the model simulations are provided by Global Forecast System (GFS) data with the horizontal resolution of 0.5 degrees. The calculations demonstrated that the MADE/SORGAM scheme predicted the values and trends of PM10 better than GOCART. Dust plums are formed over Iraq and Syria and then transported to the west and southwest of Iran. Comparing the MODIS satellite images for July 4, 2009 and June 18, 2012 with the corresponding model output showed the good performance of WRF-Chem in simulating the spatial distribution of dust.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the accurate time and use changes in land involves a better understanding of the human interactions and impacts on land resources. Detecting the changes is a process that allows observing and recognizing the differences and time series differences of phenomena, complications, and patterns of the earth's surface. The purpose of this study is to investigate the land use change trends in Yazd-Ardakan plain using remote sensing method from 1986 to 2016 and Landsat satellite images and emphasizing the object-oriented classification method. In this research, Landsat satellite images (MSS) for 1986, Landsat (TM) for 1999 and 2010, and Landsat 8 (OLI Sensor) for 2016 were used. To illustrate the classification outcomes well, some indicators such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Crosstab monitoring were used. The results of classification using the object-oriented method in 1999, had the highest accuracy in classifying land users with the total accuracy and kappa coefficients of 86 and 94, in Yazd-Ardakan plain, respectively. The results showed that during the period of 1986-2016, the area of agriculture lands and poor pasture area were decreased by 5696 and 579888 ha (-1.18% and 12.01%) respectively, while the barren, residential and the sand dunes were exposed to an increasing trend of 2419, 35454 and 457 ha (5.16, 7.34 and 0.09) respectively. In other words, it can be stated that in this period of 30 years, the most changes were related to poor pasture and residential lands. The trend of utilization changes indicates the general trend of destruction in the region through the replacement of agriculture land and poor pasture by land utilizations and residential areas as well as sand dunes. Reducing the extent of poor rangeland coverage and increasing trend of other uses indicate a general deterioration in the region and the replacement of weaker uses in the area, which show an increase in population and an increase in human pressure in the studied area.

TI  - Choosing the best algorithm for event detection based on the intended application: A conceptual framework for syndromic surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an extensive list of methods available for the early detection of an epidemic signal in syndromic surveillance data. However, there is no commonly accepted classification system for the statistical methods used for event detection in syndromic surveillance. Comparing and choosing appropriate event detection algorithms is an increasingly challenging task. Although lists of selection criteria, and statistical methods used for signal detection have been reported, selection criteria are rarely linked to a specific set of appropriate statistical methods. The paper presents a practical approach for guiding surveillance practitioners to make an informed choice from among the most popular event detection algorithms based on the intended application of the algorithm. We developed selection criteria by mapping the assumptions and performance characteristics of event detection algorithms directly to important characteristics of the time series used in syndromic surveillance. We also considered types of epidemics that may be expected and other characteristics of the surveillance system. These guidelines will provide decisions makers, data analysts, public health practitioners, and researchers with a comprehensive but practical overview of the domain, which may reduce the technical barriers to the development and implementation of syndromic surveillance systems in animal and human health. The classification scheme was restricted to univariate and temporal methods because they are the most commonly used algorithms in syndromic surveillance.

Until today, surgeons rely on visual inspection and palpation to define the tumoural margins during surgery and, unfortunately, for various cancer types, the local recurrence rate thus remains unacceptably high. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is an optical imaging technique that can provide real-time preoperative and intraoperative information after administration of a fluorescent probe that emits NIR light once exposed to a NIR light source. This technique is safe, cost-effective and technically easy. Several NIR fluorescent probes are currently studied for their ability to highlight neoplastic cells. In addition, NIR fluorescence imaging holds great promise for sentinel lymph node mapping. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a literature review of the current organic NIR fluorescent probes tested in the light of human oncology and to introduce fluorescence imaging as a valuable asset in veterinary oncology.

TI  - Remote-sensing data-based Archaeological Predictive Model (APM) for archaeological site mapping in desert area, South Morocco
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Morocco hosts numerous archaeological sites, some of which are part of the UNESCO world heritage. Many of these sites, especially funerary mounds also called tumuli, or rock engravings and ceramics, are located in remote areas with limited access, particularly in the Saharan Morocco desert. We developed a remote sensing and GIS model to identify areas with high potential for hosting archaeological sites in the Awserd region of southern Morocco. A field campaign in a "reference site'' zone of 21 km(2) has revealed 233 archaeological sites. Here we use satellite images and Digital Elevation Models to examine with various techniques (spatial analysis, statistical techniques, and fuzzy logic functions) the relations between the distribution of the archaeological sites and geo-environmental variables such as ground geology, topographic elevation and slope, orientation (aspect), and distance to water sources. We derive empirical relations that reveal that the distribution of archaeological sites depends on the above geo-environmental variables. We then use the empirical relations to anticipate the potential locations of archaeological sites in a region of 980 km2 enclosing the reference site area. The model proves capable of predicting 582 sites in the larger region. Subsequent field observations there confirmed that about 80% of the model anticipations were correct. Our Archaeological Predictive Model (APM) can be scaled to larger areas and varied geographic settings, and hence can be a useful guide for archeological studies in desert regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of landscape pattern using impervious surface in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface is a key indicator for urbanization degree and the quality of urban environment. It is of great ecological significance to study the evolution of urban landscape based on impervious surface. We explored the spatiotemporal changes of impervious surface landscape pattern in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 2006 to 2016 using multi-temporal Landsat images based on landscape pattern index. The results showed that the impervious surface area (ISA) significantly increased in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 12127.69 km(2) in 2006 to 20188.87 km(2) in 2016, with an annual growth rate of 806.12 km(2). High-density ISA was distributed in Guangzhou-Foshan and Shenzhen-Dongguan districts on the east and west of the Pearl River, respectively. In general, patch numbers, patch density, and edge density, as well as shape complexity and its fragmentation kept increasing during the past decade. The landscape pattern tended to be disordered, fragmented, and irregular. Moreover, the difference of impervious surface landscape pattern is obvious between cities. The areas with highest connectivity, stability and regularization were distributed in Hong Kong and Macao, while the landscape pattern in Huizhou and hangmen trended to be fragmentized and complex.

TI  - How physiological and physical processes contribute to the phenology of cyanobacterial blooms in large shallow lakes: A new Euler-Lagrangian coupled model
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms have emerged as one of the most severe ecological problems affecting large and shallow freshwater lakes. To improve our understanding of the factors that influence, and could be used to predict, surface blooms, this study developed a novel Euler-Lagrangian coupled approach combining the Eulerian model with agent-based modelling (ABM). The approach was subsequently verified based on monitoring datasets and MODIS data in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu, China). The Eulerian model solves the Eulerian variables and physiological parameters, whereas ABM generates the complete life cycle and transport processes of cyanobacterial colonies. This model ensemble performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial biomass, bloom distribution, and area. Based on the calculated physical and physiological characteristics of surface blooms, principal component analysis (PCA) captured the major processes influencing surface bloom formation at different stages (two bloom clusters). Early bloom outbreaks were influenced by physical processes (horizontal transport and vertical turbulence-induced mixing), whereas buoyancy-controlling strategies were essential for mature bloom outbreaks. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed the combined actions of multiple environment variables on different bloom clusters. The effects of buoyancy-controlling strategies (ISP), vertical turbulence-induced mixing velocity of colony (VMT) and horizontal drift velocity of colony (HDT) were quantitatively compared using scenario simulations in the coupled model. VMT accounted for 52.9% of bloom formations and maintained blooms over long periods, thus demonstrating the importance of wind-induced turbulence in shallow lakes. In comparison, HDT and buoyancy controlling strategies influenced blooms at different stages. In conclusion, the approach developed here presents a promising tool for understanding the processes of onshore/offshore algal blooms formation and subsequent predicting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A KALLAWAYA MASTER IN MADRID'S GRAN VIA: FIELD NOTES ON MADRID
T2  - AIBR-REVISTA DE ANTROPOLOGIA IBEROAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - One's own -and other people's- estrangement is a valuable topic in Anthropology when we explore new habits and scenarios: this article raises awareness of the critical abilities of those people who, being unfamiliar with their cultural surroundings, plainly criticize what they observe. In November 1996 the Casa de America in Madrid held a seminar on indigenous medicine together with a Kallawaya master, my friend German. His accurate analysis of the situations he experienced, not as much at the seminar as on the streets, is a valuable cognitive testimony of the expectations that a sage like him has when doing their trips and consultations in Bolivia. His observations are close to what would be expected from a "redneck", villager or parochial person in Madrid, Spain's capital, but I argue that this is just a reflection of how uncomfortable those ones entrenched in their "urban" values can feel before German's deep comments: in this situation the "redneck" is not the person expressing their surprise and discrepancies with their own -supposedly rural-worldview, but the one who cannot provide convincing arguments on the things being discussed and apparently misinterpreted by the "other".

TI  - Forest Adaptation to Climate Change along Steep Ecological Gradients: The Case of the Mediterranean-Temperate Transition in South-Western Europe
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Impacts of climate change are likely to be marked in areas with steep climatic transitions. Species turnover, spread of invasive species, altered productivity, and modified processes such as fire regimes can all spread rapidly along ecotones, which challenge the current paradigms of ecosystem management. We conducted a literature review at a continental-wide scale of South-Western European forests, where the drier and warmer conditions of the Mediterranean have been widely used as examples of what is expected in more temperate areas. Results from the literature point to: (a) an expansion of slow-growing evergreen hardwood trees; (b) increased dieback and mortality episodes in forests (both natural and planted) mostly related to competition and droughts, and mainly affecting conifers; and (c) an increase in emergent diseases and pests of keystone-trees used in agroforestry zones. There is no consensus in the literature that fire regimes are directly increasing due to climate change, but available satellite data of fire intensity in the last 17 years has been lower in zones where agroforestry practices are dominant compared to unmanaged forests. In contrast, there is agreement in the literature that the current spread of fire events is probably related to land abandonment patterns. The practice of agroforestry, common in all Mediterranean countries, emerges as a frequent recommendation in the literature to cope with drought, reduce fire risk, and maintain biodiverse landscapes and rural jobs. However, it is unknown the extent to which the open vegetation resulting from agroforestry is of interest to forest managers in temperate areas used to exploiting closed forest vegetation. Hence, many transitional areas surrounding the Mediterranean Basin may be left unmanaged with potentially higher climate-change risks, which require active monitoring in order to understand and help ongoing natural adaptation processes.

AB  - The idea of Good Living according to the indigenous movements of Latin America (Abya Yala) is an ancestral worldview of life that has its origin in traditional knowledge and practices. It refers to living in harmony with human beings and nature, from a non-egocentric or anthropocentric view, which recognizes our interdependence and eco-dependence. This notion has re-emerged with force in the last decades as an alternative to the capitalist system, to the myth of development and economic growth, playing an important role in social movements and governmental initiatives of several Latin American States.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibility of applying remote sensing data to the identification and monitoring of desertification is demonstrated. The present study includes the investigation of desertification of the territory of Mongolia by the analysis of vegetation dynamics over the period from 1982 to 2016 and its interrelation with climatic, natural, and anthropogenic components. It is found that the main contribution to the vegetation degradation in Mongolia was made by precipitation decrease and air temperature rise. The indirect factors such as livestock, land cultivation, and wildfires increased the influence of climatic factors and gave impetus to the desertification in some arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - Recent Changes of Floods and Related Impacts in Niger Based on the ANADIA Niger Flood Database
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last two decades, the sub-Saharan region has experienced unusual floods that have differentially impacted the region. No official and precise data regarding flood damage and impacts on the population are available, and the magnitude of events are not easily evaluated. Most previous studies have investigated this new threat using data derived from local media sources or world disaster databases. The aim of this study was to provide the scientific community and policy makers with an updated and reliable referenced data source concerning floods in Niger between 1998 and 2015, at national, regional and sub-regional scales. Reliable information regarding floods was derived from the national official flood damage database (ANADIA DB) showing their impact on the country. During the investigated period, considerable numbers regarding flood impacts were found (about 4000 settlements and 1.7 million people were affected by floods). The analysis also indicates a sudden increase in flood impacts since 2010. Regions in the south-west (Tillabery, Dosso and Niamey district) are the most affected; however, this kind of risk involves the whole country, and some particularly vulnerable areas have been identified. A data modeling comprehensive framework based on remotely sensed rainfall (climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations (CHIRPS)) and vegetation index (moderate resolution imagery spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS NDVI)) datasets data along with census data were used to investigate which variables are most able to explain the recent and sudden Niger flood vulnerability detected at the departmental scale. Only a few statistically significant flood damage models were found (61 out of 297), due essentially to the non-linearity of the increase in damage time series compared to environmental and climatic trends. The population increase is the most significant variable at national level; however, at regional and sub-regional scales, different patterns provided evidence to identify local triggers for vulnerability.

T2  - MEMO-MAGAZINE OF EUROPEAN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This year there were three interesting oral presentations and several posters presenting important new data regarding local therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) as well as radiological aspects. This minireview is a personal view of the clinically most relevant data in this respect with the following conclusions: A micrometastasis is no indication for axillary dissection. The number of involved sentinel lymph nodes predicts non-sentinel lymph node metastasis and should be taken into account regarding omitting axillary dissection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis. A 2aEuromm margin shows an optimal rate of local recurrences after breast conservation. The question of the correct definition for an R0 resection after neoadjuvant therapy remains open. We should omit radiotherapy for women with low risk ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) below 2.5aEurocm in size and pT1a G1 after breast conservation. Risk of finding invasive cancer after having a B3 biopsy is very low depending on the type of lesion, thus, questioning the surgical approach of some of these entities. The use of magnetic resonance imaging is a standard procedure before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Data regarding correlation between complete radiologic response (rCR) with pathologic complete response (pCR) and real tumor size are rare. For women with micrometastases or isolated tumor cells in the sentinel node postmastectomy radiotherapy has little benefit. After neoadjuvant therapy only women with ypN2 had a significant benefit of postmastectomy radiotherapy for local, disease-free and overall survival.

TI  - TOPOGRAPHYC SHADOW INFLUENCE ON OPTICAL IMAGE ACQUIRED BY SATELLITE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - During image acquisition, is usually chosen scenes with a lesser cloud cover to avoid loss of spectral information. However, when training samples are collected for image classification, the user finds shadowed areas. Such situation is similar to the presence of clouds since spectral information of these classes is the same in all optical bands of the sensor. This fact becomes more pronounced in mountainous relief areas due to shadow projection on the terrain, which can vary among all seasons during the solar year. With the goal to obtain images with a lower presence of shadow, it was simulated, under the same relief conditions, shading variation in function of latitude (0 degrees to 40 degrees S). Solar radiation models were processed for the days and times passages of the Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite on the Southern Hemisphere. It was verified that over 30 degrees S and 40 degrees S latitudes, a loss of shading area varying between 27% to 91 % and that images should be preferentially taken between October and February. For latitudes comprising 0 degrees and 10 degrees S, the loss was considered negligible, when we set a 10% threshold of loss in the total valid area in an image. According to the amount of radiation in a terrain, South and West areas received less direct solar radiation over the year for all analyzed latitudes in the modeling.

TI  - Predation risk shaped by habitat and landscape complexity in urban environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes.2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods.3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10%-20%) at large spatial scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low (<10%) at small (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20%) at large spatial scales.4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure.5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.

TI  - Anatomical classification of breast sentinel lymph nodes using computed tomography-lymphography
T2  - ANATOMICAL SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the anatomical classification and location of breast sentinel lymph nodes, preoperative computed tomography-lymphography examinations were retrospectively reviewed for sentinel lymph nodes in 464 cases clinically diagnosed with node-negative breast cancer between July 2007 and June 2016. Anatomical classification was performed based on the numbers of lymphatic routes and sentinel lymph nodes, the flow direction of lymphatic routes, and the location of sentinel lymph nodes. Of the 464 cases reviewed, anatomical classification could be performed in 434 (93.5 %). The largest number of cases showed single route/single sentinel lymph node (n = 296, 68.2 %), followed by multiple routes/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (n = 59, 13.6 %), single route/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (n = 53, 12.2 %), and multiple routes/single sentinel lymph node (n = 26, 6.0 %). Classification based on the flow direction of lymphatic routes showed that 429 cases (98.8 %) had outward flow on the superficial fascia toward axillary lymph nodes, whereas classification based on the height of sentinel lymph nodes showed that 323 cases (74.4 %) belonged to the upper pectoral group of axillary lymph nodes. There was wide variation in the number of lymphatic routes and their branching patterns and in the number, location, and direction of flow of sentinel lymph nodes. It is clinically very important to preoperatively understand the anatomical morphology of lymphatic routes and sentinel lymph nodes for optimal treatment of breast cancer, and computed tomography-lymphography is suitable for this purpose.

TI  - Assessing the effect of band selection on accuracy of pansharpened imagery: application to young woody vegetation mapping
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of woody vegetation has adverse effects on ecosystem services, and thus it is desirable to contain the problem at the early developmental stages. This can be aided by using high spatial resolution remotely-sensed data. The study investigated the effect of band selection during pansharpening on the ability to discriminate young woody vegetation from coexisting land cover types. Red-green-blue (RGB) spectral bands (30 m) of Landsat 8 imagery was pansharpened using the panchromatic band (15 m) of the same image to improve spatial resolution. Near-infrared (NIR), shortwave-infrared 1 (SWIR1) and shortwave-infrared 2 (SWIR2), bands were used respectively as the fourth spectral band during pansharpening, resulting in three pansharpened images. Unsupervised classification was performed on each pansharpened image as well as non-pansharpened multispectral image. The overall accuracies of classification derived from the pansharpened image was higher (87% - 89%) than that derived from the non-pansharpened multispectral image (83%). The study shows that band selection did not affect the classification accuracy of woody vegetation significantly. In addition, the study shows the potential of pansharpened Landsat data in detecting woody vegetation encroachment at the early growth stage.

TI  - Using APAR to Predict Aboveground Plant Productivity in Semi-Arid Rangelands: Spatial and Temporal Relationships Differ
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is critical for effective management of rangeland ecosystems but is problematic due to the vast extent of rangelands globally, and the high costs of ground-based measurements. Remote sensing of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) can be used to predict ANPP, potentially offering an alternative means of quantifying ANPP at both high temporal and spatial resolution across broad spatial extents. The relationship between ANPP and APAR has often been quantified based on either spatial variation across a broad region or temporal variation at a location over time, but rarely both. Here we assess: (i) if the relationship between ANPP and APAR is consistent when evaluated across time and space; (ii) potential factors driving differences between temporal versus spatial models, and (iii) the magnitude of potential errors relating to space for time transformations in quantifying productivity. Using two complimentary ANPP datasets and remotely sensed data derived from MODIS and a Landsat/MODIS fusion data product, we find that slopes of spatial models are generally greater than slopes of temporal models. The abundance of plant species with different structural attributes, specifically the abundance of C4 shortgrasses with prostrate canopies versus taller, more productive C3 species with more vertically complex canopies, tended to vary more dramatically in space than over time. This difference in spatial versus temporal variation in these key plant functional groups appears to be the primary driver of differences in slopes among regression models. While the individual models revealed strong relationships between ANPP to APAR, the use of temporal models to predict variation in space (or vice versa) can increase error in remotely sensed predictions of ANPP.

TI  - Genetic Variation at Chromosome 2q13 and Its Potential Influence on Endometriosis Susceptibility Through Effects on the IL-1 Family
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometriosis is characterized by the growth of epithelial and stromal cells outside the uterine cavity. It has a complex etiology and affects approximate to 10% of reproductive age women. It is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory response with substantial evidence to indicate genetic susceptibility. The causal genes and their pathways leading to endometriosis, however, are still unknown. Recently, genomewide association studies on endometriosis identified 14 genomic risk loci in women of European and Japanese ancestry. It is becoming increasingly clear that these risk regions are intergenic and thus contribute to disease susceptibility through regulatory mechanisms, most likely mediated through regulation of genes within a restricted distance from the risk variants. One endometriosis risk locus has been detected at chromosome 2q13 within an inflammatory-rich region of gene transcripts and thus may play a role in the inflammation component of the disease. We carried out detailed analysis of the genomic region 250 kb on either side of sentinel SNP rs10167914 and identified 21 transcripts which contained 6 interleukin (IL)-1 family genes, 3 previously reported coding genes that have a relationship to inflammation, 4 novel coding, or pseudogenes, and 8 noncoding RNA transcripts. Through an extensive literature search, we examined the roles these genes and their resultant proteins play in endometriosis pathogenesis. The results suggest alteration in the expression the IL-1 family transcripts either alone or as a complex milieu could have a significant influence on endometriosis and should be prioritized for future study on the implications of inflammation on endometriotic lesions.

TI  - Structural controls of the Domuyo geothermal field, Southern Andes (36°38′S), Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal fields in subduction-related orogens are closely linked to areas characterized by young magmatic and tectonic activity, both in arc- and back-arc settings. The spatio-temporal interaction of Quaternary volcanic complexes with regional extensional and transtensional structures might favor a hydrothermal circuit between meteoric water and magmatic fluids. This study encompasses a kinematic analysis of fault structures from the high-enthalpy system located at the western flank of the Domuyo volcano in Argentina. An analysis of remote sensing data was applied to detect regional lineaments, lineament density, and to identify fracture patterns possibly associated with the different deformational stages documented in the area. These results were combined with detailed fracture analysis and kinematic study of mesoscale faults, as well as existing geological, structural, and geophysical data. The integration suggests that the fluid dynamics of the Domuyo geothermal field are directly conditioned by pre-existing basement structures that were reactivated as normal faults during Pliocene to-Quaternary times. Furthermore, the intensely fracture late Triassic - early Jurassic units are interpreted as the potential level for the reservoir. The fault reactivation was likely associated with the accommodation of regional extension along pre-existing fault structures, and locally enhanced by hydrothermal effects of the Domuyo geothermal field.

TI  - FVI-A Floating Vegetation Index Formed with Three Near-IR Channels in the 1.0-1.24 μm Spectral Range for the Detection of Vegetation Floating over Water Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the analysis of hyperspectral imaging data collected over water surfaces covered by floating vegetation, such as Sargassum and algae, we observed that the spectra commonly contain a reflectance peak centered near 1.07 mu m. This peak results from the competing effects between the well-known vegetation reflectance plateau in the 0.81-1.3 mu m spectral range and the absorption effects above 0.75 mu m by liquid water within the vegetation and in the surrounding water bodies. In this article, we propose a new index, namely the floating vegetation index (FVI), for the hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation over surface layers of oceans and inland lakes. In the formulation of the FVI, one channel centered near 1.0 mu m and another 1.24 mu m are used to form a linear baseline. The reflectance value of the third channel centered at the 1.07-mu m reflectance peak above the baseline is defined as the FYI. Hyperspectral imaging data acquired with the AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) instrument over the Gulf of Mexico and over salt ponds near Moffett Field in southern portions of the San Francisco Bay were used to demonstrate the success in detecting Sargassum and floating algae with this index. It is expected that the use of this index for the global detection of floating vegetation from hyperspectral imaging data to be acquired with future satellite sensors will result in improved detection and therefore enhanced capability in estimating primary production, a measure of how much carbon is fixed per unit area per day by oceans and inland lakes.

TI  - Assessing the Variability of Corn and Soybean Yields in Central Iowa Using High Spatiotemporal Resolution Multi-Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utility of remote sensing data in crop yield modeling has typically been evaluated at the regional or state level using coarse resolution (>250 m) data. The use of medium resolution data (10-100 m) for yield estimation at field scales has been limited due to the low temporal sampling frequency characteristics of these sensors. Temporal sampling at a medium resolution can be significantly improved, however, when multiple remote sensing data sources are used in combination. Furthermore, data fusion approaches have been developed to blend data from different spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper investigates the impacts of improved temporal sampling afforded by multi-source datasets on our ability to explain spatial and temporal variability in crop yields in central Iowa (part of the U.S. Corn Belt). Several metrics derived from vegetation index (VI) time-series were evaluated using Landsat-MODIS fused data from 2001 to 2015 and Landsat-Sentinel2-MODIS fused data from 2016 and 2017. The fused data explained the yield variability better, with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2 ) and a smaller relative mean absolute error than using a single data source alone. In this study area, the best period for the yield prediction for corn and soybean was during the middle of the growing season from day 192 to 236 (early July to late August, 1-3 months before harvest). These findings emphasize the importance of high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data in agricultural applications.

TI  - Ship Detection Using Compact Polarimetric SAR Based on the Notch Filter
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact polarimetric data exploitation, especially in hybrid-polarimetric (HP) mode, is currently attracting increasing interest due to the new generation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the notch filter is useful for ship detection in either full-or dual-polarization (DP)-mode SAR images. In this paper, the notch filter investigation is further extended to HP SAR architecture for ship detection on the ocean surface. First, a version of the notch filter that is suitable for HP SAR is proposed based on the definition of the corresponding feature partial scattering vector from the covariance matrix of the HP SAR. Subsequently, a novel model characterizing the statistics of the notch distance of sea clutter in the HP mode is developed. Based on the statistical model, the threshold of constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) ship detection is theoretically and analytically derived, which allows the automatic and adaptive implementation for ship detection in varying sea backgrounds in practical applications. Experiments on the HP SAR data emulated from full-polarization L-band Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased-Array type L-band SAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR measurements validate not only the soundness of the proposed CFAR detection but also the high accuracy of the presented model in fitting HP SAR data. Furthermore, the notch filter and its CFAR realization provide the same benchmark for the comparison of the detectability of HP and conventional linear DP SAR data. Preliminary findings suggest that the detection performance of HP SAR is superior to that of DP SAR in ship observation. Therefore, the proposed CFAR method based on the notch filter provides a promising technique for the detection of ships using HP SAR data.

TI  - Adaptive Ship Detection in Hybrid-Polarimetric SAR Images Based on the Power-Entropy Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on its advantages, compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered to be a good option for earth observations. This paper proposes an adaptive method of ship detection in CP SAR images operating in the hybrid-polarimetric (HP) mode. First, according to the analysis of scattering between ships and sea background, a novel decomposition approach, named power-entropy (PE) decomposition, is developed. Based on this approach, two components of the scattering power, the high-entropy scattering amplitude (HESA) and low-entropy scattering amplitude, are separated. We demonstrate that the HESA component is an effective physical quantity indicating the difference between the ship and its background and hence can potentially be used for ship detection using HP SAR data. The generalized Gamma distribution (G Gamma D) is found suitable for the characterization of HESA statistics of sea clutter with a wide range of homogeneity. As a result, the adaptive constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) technique based on the HESA detector is proposed. Experiments performed using HP measurements emulated from L-band ALOS-PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data validate the soundness and superiority of the proposed CFAR method based on the HESA detector. Both the theoretical proof and experimental results show that the HESA improves the ship-sea contrast (or the signal-clutter ratio) more than popular detectors, such as the entropy and SPAN. Moreover, the G Gamma D is a versatile model for the description of the statistical behavior of both the HESA and comparable detectors.

TI  - A Crop Classification Method Integrating GF-3 PolSAR and Sentinel-2A Optical Data in the Dongting Lake Basin
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing of satellite sensors, more available multi-source data can be used for large-scale high-precision crop classification. Both polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) and multi-spectral optical data have been widely used for classification. However, it is difficult to combine the covariance matrix of PolSAR data with the spectral bands of optical data. Using Hoekman's method, this study solves the above problems by transforming the covariance matrix to an intensity vector that includes multiple intensity values on different polarization basis. In order to reduce the features redundancy, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is adopted to select some useful polarimetric and optical features. In this study, the PolSAR data acquired by satellite Gaofen-3 (GF-3) on 19 July 2017 and the optical data acquired by Sentinel-2A on 17 July 2017 over the Dongting lake basin are selected for the validation experiment. The results show that the full feature integration method proposed in this study achieves an overall classification accuracy of 85.27%, higher than that of the single dataset method or some other feature integration modes.

TI  - Irrigation Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time Series at Field Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently launched Sentinel-1 satellite with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor onboard offers a powerful tool for irrigation monitoring under various weather conditions, with high spatial and temporal resolution. This research discusses the potential of different metrics calculated from the Sentinel-1 time series for mapping irrigated fields. A methodology for irrigation mapping using SAR data is proposed. The study is performed using VV (vertical-vertical) and VH (vertical-horizontal) polarizations over an agricultural site in Urgell, Catalunya (Spain). With field segmentation information from SIGPAC (the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels), the backscatter intensities are averaged within each field. From the Sentinel-1 time series for each field, the statistics and metrics, including the mean value, the variance of the signal, the correlation length, and the fractal dimension, are analyzed. With the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the classification of irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated fields is performed with the metrics vector. The results derived from the SVM are validated with ground truthing from SIGPAC over the whole study area, with a good overall accuracy of 81.08%. Random Forest (RF) machine classification is also tested in this study, which gives an accuracy of around 82.2% when setting the tree depth at three. The methodology is based only on SAR data, which makes it applicable to all areas, even with frequent cloud cover, but this method may be less robust when irrigation is less dominated to soil moisture change.

TI  - Towards elimination of lymphatic filariasis in southeastern Madagascar: Successes and challenges for interrupting transmission
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionA global strategy of mass drug administration (MDA) has greatly reduced the burden of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in endemic countries. In Madagascar, the National Programme to eliminate LF has scaled-up annual MDA of albendazole and diethylcarbamazine across the country in the last decade, but its impact on LF transmission has never been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate progress towards LF elimination in southeastern Madagascar.MethodsThree different surveys were carried out in parallel in four health districts of the Vatovavy Fitovinany region in 2016: i) a school-based transmission assessment survey (TAS) in the districts of Manakara Atsimo, Mananjary, and Vohipeno (following a successful pre-TAS in 2013); ii) a district-representative community prevalence survey in Ifanadiana district; and iii) a community prevalence survey in sentinel and spot-check sites of these four districts. LF infection was assessed using the Alere Filariasis Test Strips, which detect circulating filarial antigens (CFA) of adult worms. A brief knowledge, attitudes and practices questionnaire was included in the community surveys.Principal findingsNone of the 1,825 children sampled in the TAS, and only one in 1,306 children from sentinel and spot-check sites, tested positive to CFA. However, CFA prevalence rate in individuals older than 15 years was still high in two of these three districts, at 3.5 and 9.7% in Mananjary and Vohipeno, respectively. Overall CFA prevalence in sentinel and spot-check sites of these three districts was 2.80% (N = 2,707), but only two individuals had detectable levels of microfilaraemia (0.06%). Prevalence rate estimates for Ifanadiana were substantially higher in the district-representative survey (15.8%; N = 545) than in sentinel and spot-check sites (0.8%; N = 618). Only 51.2% of individuals surveyed in these four districts reported taking MDA in the last year, and 42.2% reported knowing about LF.ConclusionsAlthough TAS results suggest that MDA can be stopped in three districts of southeastern Madagascar, the adult population still presents high CFA prevalence levels. This discordance raises important questions about the TAS procedures and the interpretation of their results.

TI  - Comparison of Three Methods for Estimating Land Surface Temperature from Landsat 8-TIRS Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After Landsat 8 was launched in 2013, it was observed that for Thermal Infrared sensor (TIRS) bands, radiance from outside of an instrument's field-of-view produced a non-uniform ghost signal across the focal plane that varied depending on the out-of-scene content (i.e., the stray light effect). A new stray light correction algorithm (SLCA) is currently operational and has been implemented into the United States Geological Survey (USGS) ground system since February 2017. The SLCA has also been applied to reprocess historical Landsat 8 scenes. After approximately two years of SLCA implementation, more land surface temperature (LST) validation studies are required to check the effect of correction in the estimation of LST from different retrieval algorithms. For this purpose, three different LST estimation method algorithms (i.e., the radiative transfer equation (RTE), single-channel algorithm (SCA), and split-window algorithm (SWA)) have been assessed. The study site is located on the campus of the University of Balearic Islands on the island of Mallorca (Spain) in the western Mediterranean Sea. The site is considered a heterogeneous area that is composed of different types of surfaces, such as buildings, asphalt roads, farming areas, sloped terrains, orange fields, almond trees, lawns, and some natural vegetation regions. Data from 21 scenes, which were acquired by the Landsat 8-TIRS sensor and extracted from a 100 x 100 m(2) pixel, were used to retrieve the LST with different algorithms; then, they were compared with in situ LST measurements from a broadband thermal infrared radiometer located on the same Landsat 8 pixel. The results show good performances of the three methods, with the SWA showing the lowest observed RMSE (within 1.6-2 K), whereas the SCA applied to the TIRS band 10 (10 mu m) was also appropriate, with a RMSE ranging within 2.0-2.3 K. The LST estimates using the RTE algorithm display the highest observed RMSE values (within 2.0-3.6 K) of all of the compared methods, but with an almost unbiased value of -0.1 K for the case of techniques applied to band 10 data. The SWAs are the preferred method to estimate the LST in our study area. However, further validation studies around the world are required.

AB  - We examine the role of judicial policy preferences in influencing whether judges in Nazi Germany sentenced defendants charged with serious political offences to death. We find that judicial policy preferences, measured by the depth of the ideological commitment of the judge to the Nazi Party worldview, were an important determinant of whether judges imposed the death sentence. Judges more committed to the Nazi Party were more likely to impose the death sentence on defendants belonging to organised political opposition groups, those accused of violent resistance and those with characteristics to which Nazism was intolerant.

TI  - Scale Matters: Spatially Partitioned Unsupervised Segmentation Parameter Optimization for Large and Heterogeneous Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To classify Very-High-Resolution (VHR) imagery, Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is the most popular method used to produce high quality Land-Use/Land-Cover maps. A crucial step in GEOBIA is the appropriate parametrization of the segmentation algorithm prior to the classification. However, little effort has been made to automatically optimize GEOBIA algorithms in an unsupervised and spatially meaningful manner. So far, most Unsupervised Segmentation Parameter Optimization (USPO) techniques, assume spatial stationarity for the whole study area extent. This can be questionable, particularly for applications in geographically large and heterogeneous urban areas. In this study, we employed a novel framework named Spatially Partitioned Unsupervised Segmentation Parameter Optimization (SPUSPO), which optimizes segmentation parameters locally rather than globally, for the Sub-Saharan African city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, using World View-3 imagery (607 km(2)). The results showed that there exists significant spatial variation in the optimal segmentation parameters suggested by USPO across the whole scene, which follows landscape patterns-mainly of the various built-up and vegetation types. The most appropriate automatic spatial partitioning method from the investigated techniques, was an edge-detection cutline algorithm, which achieved higher classification accuracy than a global optimization, better predicted built-up regions, and did not suffer from edge effects. The overall classification accuracy using SPUSPO was 90.5%, whilst the accuracy from undertaking a traditional USPO approach was 89.5%. The differences between them were statistically significant (p < 0.05) based on a McNemar's test of similarity. Our methods were validated further by employing a segmentation goodness metric, Area Fit Index (AFI) on building objects across Ouagadougou, which suggested that a global USPO was more over-segmented than our local approach. The mean AFI values for SPUSPO and USPO were 0.28 and 0.36, respectively. Finally, the processing was carried out using the open-source software GRASS GIS, due to its efficiency in raster-based applications.

TI  - Groundwater potentiality of the Kumari River Basin in drought-prone Purulia upland, Eastern India: a combined approach using quantitative geomorphology and GIS
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Being the world's most precious natural and valuable resource, groundwater remains largely unexploited for agricultural development in drought-prone western region of West Bengal, India. In drought-prone areas, micro-watershed-based development strategy may be considered as the best practice for integrated development. Keeping in view the above perspective, we select the micro-watersheds of Kumari River Basin of Purulia District, the westernmost and semi-arid region of West Bengal, for better water resource management. Supply of sufficient water resource in this region may offer more food security alternative to rain-fed subsistence farming. That is why the present study has been carried out to evaluate the potential zones for groundwater targeting in the Kumari River Basin with the help of morphometric analysis using an integrated remote sensing data, Survey of India topographical sheets and field verification. The study area was divided into seven watersheds for the purpose of micro-level morphometric analysis. Based on these morphometric (linear, areal and relief) parameters of the watersheds, the groundwater potential zones were identified and the results substantiated with bore well or tube well data available for the terrain. The elongated shape, favorable drainage network, permeable geologic formation and low relief of Kumari (2A2A1) and Chaka (2A2A2) watershed makes them the promising groundwater potential zones of the Kumari River Basin. In addition, for better use and management of groundwater, we try to find artificial recharge structure and sites on the basis of groundwater potential map and groundwater fluctuation map.

TI  - Mapping Oolitic Iron Ore Deposits in the Ashumaysi Formation, Western Saudi Arabia, Using Different Remote Sensing Techniques Applied to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Data (ETM plus )
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the surficial extent of oolitic iron ore deposits hosted in the Oligo-Miocene sedimentary rocks of the Ashumaysi Formation, western Saudi Arabia, was carried out using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. Ore samples were collected from four various locations in the study area, and were studied in the laboratory using the GER 3700 Spectroradiometer (0.4-2.5 mu m) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and minimum distance classification were used and assessed to map mineralization zones in the study area. Good correspondences were observed between the results obtained from the above mentioned techniques, spectral reflectance analyses, and XRD. The confusion matrix results revealed that mapping of iron ores using MNF is better and more accurate than using PCA. Good matching was also observed between the spectral reflectance curves of the collected samples and the corresponding pixels from Landsat 7 ETM+. The results demonstrated the usefulness of the image processing and interpretation of Landsat 7 ETM+ data for the detection and delineation iron ore deposits in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - DEM Generation from Multi Satellite PlanetScope Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Planet Labs have recently launched a large constellation of small satellites (3U cubesats) capable of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday. These small satellites capture multiple images of an area on consecutive days or sometimes on the same day with a spatial resolution of 3-4 m. Planet Labs endeavors to operate the constellation in a nadir pointing mode, however, the view angle of these satellites currently varies within a few degrees from the nadir leading to varying B/H ratio for overlapping image pairs. Due to relatively small scene footprint and small off-nadir angle, the baseline to height ratio (B/H) of the overlapping PlanetScope images is often less than 1:10, which is not ideal for 3D reconstruction. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of Digital Elevation Model generation from this multi-date, multi-satellite PlanetScope imagery. The DEM generation from multiple PlanetScope images is achieved using a volumetric stereo reconstruction technique, which applies semi global matching in georeferenced object space. The results are evaluated using a LiDAR based DEM (5 m) over Mount Teide (3718 m) in Canary Islands and the ALOS (30 m) DEM on rugged terrain of the Nanga Parbat massif (8126 m) in the western Himalaya range. The proposed methodology is then applied on images from two PlanetScope satellites overpasses within a couple of minutes difference to compute the DEM of the Khurdopin glacier in the Karakoram range, known for its recent surge. The quantitative assessment of the generated elevation models is done by comparing statistics of the elevation differences between the reference LiDAR and ALOS DEM and the PlanetScope DEM. The Normalized Median of Absolute Deviation (NMAD) of the elevation differences between the computed PlanetScope DEM and LiDAR DEM is 4.1 m and the elevation differences for the ALOS DEM over stable terrain is 3.9 m. The results show that PlanetScope imagery can lead to sufficient quality DEM even with a small baseline to height ratio. Therefore, the daily PlanetScope imagery is a valuable data source and the DEM generated from this imagery can potentially be employed in numerous applications requiring multi temporal DEMs.

TI  - Establishing a land degradation neutrality national baseline through trend analysis of GIMMS NDVI Time-series
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land degradation-neutrality (LDN) national baseline for Kenya in 2015 was established in terms of the three LDN indicators (land cover, land productivity, and carbon stocks), and using trends in GIMMS NDVI and land cover datasets over the 24-year period from 1992 to 2015. Human-induced land degradation was separated from degradation driven by climate factors using soil moisture data and the residual trend method. On the basis of Kendall's tau of the NDVI residuals computed using annual mean data of the NDVI and soil moisture relationship, the country has experienced persistent negative trends (browning) over 21.6% of the country, and persistent positive trends (greening) in 8.9% of the country. The land cover change map for the period 1992-2015 showed that in 5.6% of the area there was a change from one land cover class to another. Pronounced changes in terms of land area were the increase in grasslands by 12,171 km(2), the decrease of bare land by 9,877 km(2), and the decrease in forests by 7,182 km(2). Browning and greening trends account for 13% and 12%, respectively, of the land cover change areas. By establishing the LDN national baseline, the LDN concept is now operational. As a first step, targeted field level assessments, alongside the collection of data for the computation of soil organic carbon stocks, should be undertaken in selected browning, greening, and land cover change sites. These field studies will provide decision makers with key information on how to plan for the implementation and monitoring of LDN interventions.

TI  - An expectation-maximization algorithm for the matrix normal distribution with an application in remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dramatic increases in the size and dimensionality of many modern datasets make crucial the need for sophisticated methods that can exploit inherent structure and handle missing values. In this article we derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the matrix normal distribution, a distribution well-suited for naturally structured data such as spatio-temporal data. We review previously established maximum likelihood matrix normal estimates, and then consider the situation involving missing data. We apply our EM method in a simulation study exploring errors across different dimensions and proportions of missing data. We compare these errors to those from three alternative methods and show that our proposed EM method outperforms them in all scenarios. Finally, we implement the proposed EM method in a novel way on a satellite image dataset to investigate land-cover classification separability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Epidemiology, aetiology and seasonality of infectious diarrhoea in adult outpatients through active surveillance in Shanghai, China, 2012-2016: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study aimed to identify the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, aetiology and seasonality of sporadic infectious diarrhoea in adults in Shanghai.Setting This study was based on a city-wide, active continuous hospital-based diarrhoea surveillance network established by Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 22 sentinel hospitals in all 16 districts (9 primary-level hospitals, 6 secondary-level hospitals and 7 tertiary-level hospitals) which were selected using probability proportionate to size sampling method.Participants From 1 May 2012 to 31 May 2016, 90713 patients were included in this study. Among 8797 patients whose stool samples were collected and detected, 4392 patients were male.Results The positive rate was 47.96%. Bacterial and viral infections accounted for 27.19% and 69.07% separately. Norovirus was the most common pathogen (43.10%), followed by rotavirus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) and Salmonella spp. Patients between 30-44 and 45-59 years were more likely to have infectious diarrhoea and viral diarrhoea. Those aged 30-44 years were the most likely to get infected with V. parahaemolyticus (adjusted OR, aOR vs 60+ years: 2.04, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.78) and norovirus (aOR vs 60+ years: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56). Bacterial (except V. parahaemolyticus) diarrhoea was characterised by fever, abdominal pain and loose stool; while viral diarrhoea was characterised by nausea, vomiting and watery stool. A seasonal distribution of infectious diarrhoea was observed with larger peaks in winter and smaller peaks in summer. Winter peaks were mainly due to norovirus and rotavirus, and summer peaks were due to bacterial infections. An emerging spring peak of norovirus around March was observed in the past 3 years.Conclusion Viral infections were predominant, and norovirus played a leading role. A seasonal distribution was observed and an emerging spring peak of norovirus was noted. Our findings highlight the necessity for conducting an active, comprehensive surveillance in adults, to monitor changing dynamics in the epidemiology and aetiology of infectious diarrhoea.

TI  - Surveillance for Antimicrobial Resistance in Gonorrhea: The Alberta Model, 2012-2016
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Alberta established a surveillance system in 2001 to monitor resistance to antibiotics used for the treatment of gonorrhea. A retrospective review of gonorrhea cases during the last five years was conducted. All cases of gonorrhea were reportable to public health by testing laboratories and clinicians. Specimens were primarily submitted for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT); three sentinel sites obtained specimens for culture and NAAT. The Provincial Laboratory for Public Health conducted E-tests on isolates for multiple antibiotics. A proportion of isolates and NAAT specimens were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory for sequence typing (ST). Data were combined and analyzed using SAS version 9.4. Between 2012 and 2016, 13,132 gonorrhea cases were reported; 22.0% (n = 2891) had isolates available for susceptibility testing. All culture positive isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Decreased susceptibility (0.5 ug/mL) to cefixime was reported in four cases in 2014. Resistance to azithromycin (2 ug/mL) ranged between 0.4% and 1.8%. Many (n = 509) unique STs were identified; the most prevalent sequence groups (SG) were SG-7638 (n = 367), SG-5985 (n = 145), and SG-11299 (n = 127). The Alberta model for maintaining surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhea employs culture and NAAT specimens, providing information crucial to informing provincial treatment guidelines.

TI  - A phase II trial to determine the cosmetic outcomes and toxicity of 27 Gy in five-fraction accelerated partial breast irradiation: the ACCEL trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been investigated in randomized controlled trials with the goals of reducing side effects and treatment burden. There is accumulating evidence that local control for multi-fraction APBI is not inferior to whole breast irradiation (WBI) but an external beam prescription that can be safely delivered in five consecutive days has not been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate an APBI prescription delivered once per day in 1 week.This is a single-arm, phase II, prospective cohort study. Two hundred seventy-four eligible women with newly diagnosed, early-stage, invasive, or in situ ductal carcinoma treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection who are candidates for whole breast radiation without a boost will be recruited. Twenty-seven Gray (Gy) in five fractions will be delivered once daily over five consecutive working days to the target volume. The primary outcome is the rate of global cosmetic deterioration from an excellent or good score at baseline (prior to radiation therapy) to a fair or poor score at 2 years after treatment. The study is powered to demonstrate non-inferiority compared to the use of WBI arm in the RAPID trial.The ACCEL trial aims to demonstrate the safe and effective delivery of a five-fraction APBI treatment using IMRT or 3D-conformal radiation. The study is designed to account for an updated alpha/beta ratio for breast tissue and compares cosmesis to the WBI arm of the RAPID trial. The ACCEL trial was registered in February 2016 and began accrual in the subsequent May.This trial will assess the cosmetic and normal tissue outcomes of external beam APBI delivered in 1 week for early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Radiation Therapy Field Design and Lymphedema Risk After Regional Nodal Irradiation for Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The occurrence of upper extremity lymphedema after regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for breast cancer treatment varies significantly based on patient and treatment factors. The relationship between the radiation therapy (RT) field design and lymphedema risk is not well-characterized. The present study sought to correlate the variations in RT field design with lymphedema outcomes.Methods and Materials: Women with stage II-IV breast cancer receiving RNI after breast surgery that included sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection were identified. Their arm circumference was measured before RT and at each follow-up visit to assess for lymphedema. Nodal RT fields were defined using a trifurcated system. Group 1 excluded the upper level I and II axilla, defined by the lateral border of the nodal field encompassing less than one-third of the humeral head. Group 2 included the upper level I and II axilla, defined by the lateral border of the nodal field encompassing more than one-third of the humoral head treated with an anterior oblique beam. Group 3 included the upper level I and II axilla the same as for group 2 but with parallel-opposed beams delivering a significant dose to the musculature posterior to the axilla.Results: From 1999 to 2013, 526 women received RNI. The median post-RT followup was 5.5 years. For the 492 women meeting the inclusion criteria, the cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 23.5% at 2 years and 31.8% at 5 years. On univariate analysis, the patients in group 1 had a lower 5-year lymphedema rate (7.7%) than those in group 2 (37.1%) and group 3 (36.7%; P <.0001). On multivariate analysis, inclusion of the upper level I and II axilla (groups 2 and 3) remained significantly associated with increased lymphedema risk.Conclusions: Variations in the RT field design significantly affect the development of lymphedema after RNI. In particular, the upper level I and II axilla appear to be important regions for lymphedema risk after axillary dissection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping Maize Evapotranspiration at Field Scale Using SEBAL: A Comparison with the FAO Method and Soil-Plant Model Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) has been successfully applied to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and yield at different spatial scales. However, ET and yield patterns have never been investigated under highly heterogeneous conditions. We applied SEBAL in a salt-affected and water-stressed maize field located at the margin of the Venice Lagoon, Italy, using Landsat images. SEBAL results were compared with estimates of evapotranspiration by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) method (ETc) and three-dimensional soil-plant simulations. The biomass production routine in SEBAL was then tested using spatially distributed crop yield measurements and the outcomes of a soil-plant numerical model. The results show good agreement between SEBAL evapotranspiration and ETc. Instantaneous ET simulated by SEBAL is also consistent with the soil-plant model results (R-2 = 0.7047 for 2011 and R-2 = 0.6689 for 2012). Conversely, yield predictions (6.4 t/ha in 2011 and 3.47 t/ha in 2012) are in good agreement with observations (8.64 t/ha and 3.86 t/ha, respectively) only in 2012 and the comparison with soil-plant simulations (8.69 t/ha and 5.49 t/ha) is poor. In general, SEBAL underestimates land productivity in contrast to the soil-plant model that overestimates yield in dry years. SEBAL provides accurate predictions under stress conditions due to the fact that it does not require knowledge of the soil/root characteristics.

TI  - Remote-sensing-derived fractures and shrub patterns to identify groundwater dependence
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th Biohydrology International Conference
CL  - Almeria, SPAIN
AB  - The identification and location of groundwater-dependent ecosystems are the first steps in protecting and managing them. Such identifications are challenging where the surface expressions of groundwater are not obvious. This work presents a remote-sensing-based approach to infer the groundwater dependence of semiarid shrubs from their association with fractures that facilitate root access to groundwater. As a case study, we used the Ziziphus lotus matorral in south-east Spain, a priority conservation habitat in the European Union (Habitat 5220*, Directive 92/43/EEC) that is highly threatened by agricultural and urban sprawl. The approach combines object-based image analysis of high-resolution orthoimages to map Ziziphus individuals, geomorphometric analysis of a lidar-derived terrain model to map bedrock fractures, and spatial statistics to assess the association between Ziziphus and fractures. Electrical resistivity tomography was used to validate the identified fractures, and the seasonal dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index was used to prove that Z. lotus maintained higher greenness during the summer drought and was less coupled with precipitation than the nearby nonphreatophytic vegetation. A majority (61%) of the Ziziphus patches, particularly the smallest ones, occurred within 50 m of faults. This spatial association between phreatophyte shrubs and fractures contributes to the identification of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. This approach offers several advantages because it is simple, low cost, and non-destructive. In addition, the differentiation of shrubs into size classes provided insights into the long-term environmental controls underlying the establishment of Ziziphus individuals. The evidence of groundwater dependence by Z. lotus in Habitat 5220* indicates the need for its urgent protection under the Water Framework Directive.

TI  - The Potential of Spectral Indices in Detecting Various Stages of Afforestation over the Loess Plateau Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has the greatest afforestation area in the world, mainly due to the implementation of various ecological restoration projects, which have taken place over several decades. However, the progress of these restoration projects has rarely been evaluated through sapling growth monitoring. In this research, we assessed the potential of eighteen spectral indices derived from time-series Landsat data to characterize the different stages of afforestation over the Loess Plateau region. First, we obtained data for the afforestation area from 1997 to 2010. Then we estimated the average year of afforestation that could be uniquely identified and the sensitivity to growth exhibited by each of the indices. The results show that the first shortwave infrared band (SWIR1) of the Landsat Thematic Mapper and the Brightness index from the tasseled cap transformation (TCB) had the fastest response to sapling growth. It takes 4.2 and 4.3 years on average for the saplings to be detected as forest by SWIR1 and TCB, respectively. However, these two indices saturate too soon to allow better distinction of the various stages of sapling growth but are better for monitoring the over-reporting situation. By contrast, the disturbance index (DI), and the normalized burnt ratio (NBR) and the normalized burnt ratio 2 (NBR2) respond slowly to sapling growth and can detect forest at 7.4 years on average. Unlike SWIR1 and TCB, these indices do not saturate early and can provide more detail on the level and structural condition of sapling growth.

TI  - Analysis of impervious land-cover expansion using remote sensing and GIS: A case study of Sylhet sadar upazila
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urbanization practice creates pressure on the natural functioning of land and resources. In this context, it is essential to monitor its expansion. This study seeks to analyze the pattern and process of urban expansion at Sylhet Sadar Upazila from 1981 to 2016 by extracting impervious land-cover from satellite images and using Shannon's entropy. To find out a comparatively accurate method of extracting impervious land-cover from satellite images, three classification methods viz., supervised maximum likelihood algorithms, index-based classification and neural classification are experimenting with a single Landsat images of 2016. A method is selected on the basis of accuracy measures. The study finds the neural classification can extract impervious landcover accurately (about 90% accuracy) than other classification. This classification method is adopted to classify the Landsat images of 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011 and the amount of impervious land-cover is estimated in ArcGIS platform. Finally, the entropy value is calculated using the amount of impervious land-cover for each union and city corporation. Up to 2011, the city expands mainly along north-south direction and this expansion occurs at northen and eastern direction after 2011. The urban expansion in Sylhet city and its vicinity is scattered in nature but the compactness increases slightly in 2016. Number of Population and elevation acted as the driving force of urban expansion in case of Sylhet city.

TI  - Twenty-five years of progress in physical geography: a personal view of its antecedents and trajectory
T2  - GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a very personal view of developments in physical geography up to the early 1990s and then in the last 25 years. In the latter period, four sub-areas (biogeography, climatology, geomorphology, and hydrology) have dominated the discipline, with glaciology and pedology also receiving significant attention. The advent of remotely sensed data sets, new sensors for proximate monitoring and analytical software have enabled research across many space scales with improving spatial and temporal resolution. Increasingly, new modelling approaches have been supported by field and laboratory experiments. Furthermore, investigations have become more applied and human-oriented. Three aspects of the last 25 years bear witness to the health, relevance and impact of the discipline: (i) increasingly collaborative, international and multi-disciplinary research; (ii) a trend towards application and professionalisation; and (iii) increasing engagement in 'citizen science' by developing and applying methods that involve volunteers in monitoring, analysing and interpreting vast geographical data sets.

TI  - Prediction of cotton lint yield from phenology of crop indices using artificial neural networks
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary utility of satellite remote sensing technology is monitoring and assessment of agricultural lands for determining the area, amount, type, and quality of crop production. Since the mid-1970s agricultural scientists have sought to advance this utility through development of precision agriculture (PA) methods and technologies. Consequently, PA has taken advantage of freely available medium-spatial resolution remote sensing technology and instrumented fields to monitor crop biomass, phenology, and yield of crops at the sub-field to larger scales. The main goal of this study was to determine cotton lint yield in a 73-ha irrigated field in western Tennessee using remote sensing technology. We used two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) of Landsat 8 transformed to 8 input predictors including Red, near infra-red (NIR), the simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), and the tasselled cap transformation's greenness, wetness, and soil brightness indices: GI, WI, and SBI, respectively, as proxies for cotton lint yield and crop phenology (in this study all input predictors are being referred to as crop indices, CIs). We used artificial neural network (ANN) approach to generate 61,200 models relating individual CIs and CI phenology to field estimates of lint yield to predict and map the field's cotton lint yield in two cropping seasons. The correlation between cotton lint yield and CIs ranged from -0.20 to 0.60 in 2013 and from -0.79 to 0.84 in 2014. The best ANN models were in 2013 (r = 0.68 and the normalized MAE = 11%) and 2014 (r = 0.86 and the normalized MAE = 8%) growing seasons. The WI and GI were the best CI predictors of cotton lint yield, and overall for the early to mid-season prediction, CI phenologies had better performance than single date CI models. Consequently, we recommend the use of Landsat 8 derived WI or GI phenology to predict crop yields.

TI  - Harnessing the Temporal Dimension to Improve Object-Based Image Analysis Classification of Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research related to object-based image analysis has typically relied on data inputs that provide information on the spectral and spatial characteristics of objects, but the temporal domain is far less explored. For some objects, which are spectrally similar to other landscape features, their temporal pattern may be their sole defining characteristic. When multiple images are used in object-based image analysis, it is often constrained to a specific number of images which are selected because they cover the perceived range of temporal variability of the features of interest. Here, we provide a method to identify wetlands using a time series of Landsat imagery by building a Random Forest model using each image observation as an explanatory variable. We tested our approach in Douglas County, Washington, USA. Our approach exploiting the temporal domain classified wetlands with a high level of accuracy and reduced the number of spectrally similar false positives. We explored how sampling design (i.e., random, stratified, purposive) and temporal resolution (i.e., number of image observations) affected classification accuracy. We found that sampling design introduced bias in different ways, but did not have a substantial impact on overall accuracy. We also found that a higher number of image observations up to a point improved classification accuracy dependent on the selection of images used in the model. While time series analysis has been part of pixel-based remote sensing for many decades, with improved computer processing and increased availability of time series datasets (e.g., Landsat archive), it is now much easier to incorporate time series into object-based image analysis classification.

TI  - Estimating Fire Background Temperature at a Geostationary Scale-An Evaluation of Contextual Methods for AHI-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An integral part of any remotely sensed fire detection and attribution method is an estimation of the target pixel's background temperature. This temperature cannot be measured directly independent of fire radiation, so indirect methods must be used to create an estimate of this background value. The most commonly used method of background temperature estimation is through derivation from the surrounding obscuration-free pixels available in the same image, in a contextual estimation process. This method of contextual estimation performs well in cloud-free conditions and in areas with homogeneous landscape characteristics, but increasingly complex sets of rules are required when contextual coverage is not optimal. The effects of alterations to the search radius and sample size on the accuracy of contextually derived brightness temperature are heretofore unexplored. This study makes use of imagery from the AHI-8 geostationary satellite to examine contextual estimators for deriving background temperature, at a range of contextual window sizes and percentages of valid contextual information. Results show that while contextual estimation provides accurate temperatures for pixels with no contextual obscuration, significant deterioration of results occurs when even a small portion of the target pixel's surroundings are obscured. To maintain the temperature estimation accuracy, the use of no less than 65% of a target pixel's total contextual coverage is recommended. The study also examines the use of expanding window sizes and their effect on temperature estimation. Results show that the accuracy of temperature estimation decreases significantly when expanding the examined window, with a 50% increase in temperature variability when using a larger window size than 5 x 5 pixels, whilst generally providing limited gains in the total number of temperature estimates (between 0.4 and 4.4 % of all pixels examined). The work also presents a number of case study regions taken from the AHI-8 disk in more depth, and examines the causes of excess temperature variation over a range of topographic and land cover conditions.

TI  - Large-Scale Environmental Conditions Related to Midsummer Extreme Rainfall Events around Japan in the TRMM Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The precipitation characteristics of extreme events in August determined from 13 years of satellite data around Japan in the TRMM observation region and their relationship with large-scale environmental conditions are examined. Two types of extreme events, extreme rainfall and extreme convective events, are defined in each analysis grid box using maximum near-surface rainfall and maximum 40-dBZ echo-top height in each event, respectively. There are clear differences in precipitation characteristics between the two types of extreme events. Extreme rainfall events are more organized precipitation systems than the extreme convective events, with relatively lower echo-top heights and very low lightning activity. There are also clear differences in the related environmental conditions, where the environments related to the extreme rainfall events are somewhat convectively stable and very humid in almost the entire troposphere. These facts are consistent with our previous studies and reinforce the importance of warm-rain processes in extremely intense precipitation productions. The environments related to the extreme rainfall events exhibit a zonally extended moist anomaly in the free troposphere from southern China to the east of Japan, indicating that the excessive moisture transported from the west by a large-scale flow may partially play a role in producing environmental conditions favorable for extreme rainfall. On the other hand, the environments related to extreme convective events are not associated with free-tropospheric moisture inflow. The relationships with the tropical cyclones and upper-tropospheric dynamical fields are also examined, and are found to be clearly different between the extreme rainfall events and extreme convective events.

TI  - Reappraisal of the kinematic history of Nugrus shear zone using PALSAR and microstructural data: implications for the tectonic evolution of the Eastern Desert tectonic terrane, northern Nubian Shield
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nugrus shear zone (NSZ) is a NW-trending semiductile-semibrittle high-strain zone exhibiting obvious sinistral sense of shear. It is regarded by some workers to represent the boundary between the Central Eastern Desert (CED) and South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt. A variety of Neoproterozoic lithologies are remarkably affected by the NSZ, encompassing high-grade gneisses, metavolcanics and metavolcaniclastics, gneissose granite, and ophiolitic melange. Visual interpretation and automated lineament extraction have been applied on the local sigma-filtered level 1.5 PALSAR data. Results of directional filtering and line algorithm techniques support the dominance of NW and NE structural trends in the study area. Microstructural and finite strain analyses have been done for the oriented samples of gneisses, metavolcanics, metavolcaniclastics, and gneissose granite using CSS, Fabric 8, and EllipseFit software. The R (f)/I center dot and Fry methods demonstrate that the strain ratios of the collected samples are closely compatible and consistent. The core of Hafafit culmination gave 1.5 strain ratio with top-to-the-NW sense of shear, whereas the two rims show 1.7 strain ratio with top-to-the-NE sense of shear. Samples collected along the flanks of Wadi Nugrus show the two types of shear but the NW is dominant with 1.8 strain ratio and sinistral sense of shear, whereas those collected from Wadi Abu Rashid and Wadi Sikiat display 1.4 strain ratio with dextral sense of movement. Finite strain results along with field relations and observations prove that the NSZ and environs experienced a prolonged tectonic history involving at least three deformations (D-l, D-2, and D-3). D-1 phase involves NE-SW shortening and is documented by large-scale NW-trending, NE-dipping, imbricate thrust sheets with NE plunging stretching lineation. D-2 was a transpressional phase (660-645 Ma), coeval with the Najd Shear System (NSS), and expressed by the NW- to NNW-trending, steeply dipping, strike-slip shear zones with frequent subvertical foliation and subhorizontal lineation. Exhumation of gneissic domes in Hafafit area was related to this phase. The D-3 phase (645-540 Ma) was responsible for the formation of NE-oriented shear with dextral sense of movement. Whether the NW and NE shears are conjugate pairs or not will be a matter of much discussion.

TI  - Tumor Size in Breast Carcinoma: Gross Measurement Is Important!
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The staging of breast carcinoma is mainly dependent on tumor size and lymph node status. Small increments in tumor size upstage the patient. An accurate determination of the tumor size is therefore critically important. Although the final staging is based on microscopic size, pathologists rely on gross measurements in a considerable number of cases. Methods. We investigated the concordance between gross and microscopic measurements of breast carcinoma as well as factors affecting this concordance. This study is a retrospective review of surgical pathology reports of invasive breast carcinomas. Data were collected for 411 cases. Concordance was defined as a size difference within +/- 2 mm. Results. Gross and microscopic sizes were identical in 33.1% of cases. Gross and microscopic size difference was within +/- 2 mm in 56% of cases. Despite the size difference, stage classification ended up being the same in 68.6% of cases. Tumor stage was over estimated by gross measurement in 17.0% of cases and underestimated in 14.4% of cases. The concordance was significantly higher for those tumors in which final pathologic tumor (pT) size was greater than 2 cm (pT2) as compared with those less than or equal to 2 cm (pT1; P < .0001). A higher proportion of mastectomy specimens (61.4%) were concordant as compared with lumpectomy specimens (52.1%). Conclusion. Gross and microscopic tumor sizes were concordant in 56% of cases. Stage classification based on gross and microscopic tumor size was different in nearly one third (31.4%) of cases. Gross tumor size is critically important in accurate staging at least in cases where tumor size cannot be confirmed microscopically.

TI  - Anticoagulation therapy in patients with stroke and atrial fibrillation: a registry-based study of acute stroke care in Surrey, UK
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Because of their high risk of stroke, anticoagulation therapy is recommended for most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The present study evaluated the use of anticoagulants in the community and in a hospital setting for patients with AF and its associations with stroke.Methods Patients admitted with stroke to four major hospitals in County of Surrey, England were surveyed in the 2014-2016 Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise subject characteristics and (2) test to assess differences between categorical variables.Results A total of 3309 patients, 1656 men (mean age: 73.1 years +/- SD 13.2) and 1653 women (79.3 years +/- 13.0) were admitted with stroke (83.3% with ischaemic, 15.7% haemorrhagic stroke and 1% unspecified). AF occurred more frequently (chi(2)=62.4; p<0.001) among patients admitted with recurrent (30.2%) rather than with first stroke (17.1%). There were 666 (20.1%) patients admitted with a history of AF, among whom 304 (45.3%) were anticoagulated, 279 (41.9%) were untreated and 85 (12.8%) deemed unsuitable for anticoagulation. Of the 453 patients with history of AF admitted with a first ischaemic stroke, 138 (37.2%) were on anticoagulation and 41 (49.6%) were not (chi(2)=6.3; p<0.043) and thrombolysis was given more frequently for those without prior anticoagulation treatment (16.1%) or unsuitable for anticoagulation (23.6%) compared with those already on anticoagulation treatment (8.3%; chi(2)=10.0; p=0.007). Of 2643 patients without a previous history of AF, 171 (6.5%) were identified with AF during hospitalisation. Of patients with AF who presented with ischaemic stroke who were not anticoagulated or deemed unsuitable for anticoagulation prior to admission, 91.8% and 75.0%, respectively, were anticoagulated on discharge.Conclusions The study highlights an existing burden for patients with stroke and reflects inadequate treatment of AF which results in an increased stroke burden. There is significant scope to improve the rates of anticoagulation.

TI  - Remote sensing study of wetlands in the Pearl River Delta during 1995-2015 with the support vector machine method
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Pearl River Delta has experienced rapid economic growth which may create a substantial burden to its ecology. In this study, the wetlands of the Pearl River Delta are investigated. Through the use of remote sensing methods, we analyze spatial and temporal variations of wetlands in this area over the past twenty years. The support vector machine (SVM) method is proven to be an effective approach for classifying the wetlands of the Pearl River Delta, and the total classification resolution reaches 94.94% with a Kappa coefficient exceeding 0.94, higher than other comparable analysis methods. Our results show that wetland areas were reduced by 36.9% during the past twenty years. The change detection analysis method shows that there was a 95.58% intertidal zone change to other land-use types, most of which (57.12%) was converted to construction land. In addition, farmland was reduced by 54.89% during the past twenty years, 47.19% of which was changed to construction land use. The inland water area increased 19.02%, but most of this growth (18.77%) was converted from the intertidal zone.

AB  - Visualisation of subscapularis lesions is difficult during open surgery. Introduction of arthroscopic procedures for rotator cuff surgery improved the diagnosis of subscapularis tears, but it still can be more challenging than for other rotator cuff tendon tears. The SFA classification of subscapularis tears is reproducible and correlates well with the arthroscopic findings. The arthroscopic diagnosis of subscapularis tear is made easier by: shoulder internal rotation, biceps tenodesis, dissection of the rotator interval, recognition of the sentinel and comma signs.

TI  - Wire localization of clip-marked axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients treated with primary systemic therapy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Clipping and selective removal of initially suspicious axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients who have been sonographically down-staged by primary systemic therapy improves the accuracy of surgical staging and provides the opportunity for more conservative axillary surgery. This study evaluated whether preoperative ultrasound-guided wire localization of the clipped node is useful for routine clinical practice.Material and methods: This prospective, single-center feasibility trial included patients with invasive breast cancer (cT1-3N1-3M0) treated by primary systemic therapy. They underwent ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and clip placement into the most suspicious axillary lymph node prior to chemotherapy. After primary systemic therapy the clipped lymph node was localized by a wire. All patients underwent target lymph node biopsy, completion axillary lymph node dissection and, if yiNO, axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy. The primary study endpoint was the identification rate of the target lymph node.Results: All patients (n = 30) underwent successful clip insertion into the lymph node. After chemotherapy, the clipped target lymph node was visible by ultrasound in 83.3% (25/30). Wire localization was possible in 24 cases (80%), and the clipped node identification rate was 70.8% (17/24 cases). In 9/30 patients (30%) clipped node removal was not confirmed by intraoperative radiography.Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided wire localization of the target lymph node is not suitable for clinical practice because of limitations regarding clip visibility and selective surgical preparation of the target lymph node. Further prospective evaluation of alternative techniques is needed. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Improved Detection of Tiny Macroalgae Patches in Korea Bay and Gyeonggi Bay by Modification of Floating Algae Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the detection of tiny macroalgae patches in the eastern parts of the Yellow Sea (YS) using high-resolution Landsat-8 images from 2014 to 2017. In the comparison between floating algae index (FAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) better detection by FAI was observed, but many tiny patches still remained undetected. By applying a modification on the FAI around 12% to 27% increased and correct detection of macroalgae is achieved from 35 images compared to the original. Through this method many scattered tiny patches were detected in June or July in Korea Bay and Gyeonggi Bay. Though it was a small-scale phenomenon they occurred in the similar period of macroalgal bloom occurrence in the YS. Thus, by using this modified method we could detect macroalgae in the study areas around one month earlier than the previously used Geostationary Ocean Color Imager NDVI-based detection. Later, more macroalgae patches including smaller ones occupying increased areas were detected. Thus, it seems that those macroalgae started growing locally from tiny patches rather than being transported from the western parts of the YS. Therefore, this modified FAI could be used for the precise detection of macroalgae.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of riparian restoration projects using Landsat and precipitation data from the cloud-computing application ClimateEngine.org
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian vegetation along streams provides a suite of ecosystem services in rangelands and thus is the target of restoration when degraded by over-grazing, erosion, incision, or other disturbances. Assessments of restoration effectiveness depend on defensible monitoring data, which can be both expensive and difficult to collect. We present a method and case study to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration of riparian vegetation using a web-based cloud-computing and visualization tool (ClimateEngine.org) to access and process remote sensing and climate data. Restoration efforts on an Eastern Oregon ranch were assessed by analyzing the riparian areas of four creeks that had in-stream restoration structures constructed between 2008 and 2011. Within each study area, we retrieved spatially and temporally aggregated values of summer (June, July, August) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and total precipitation for each water year (October-September) from 1984 to 2017. We established a pre-restoration (1984-2007) linear regression between total water year precipitation and summer NDVI for each study area, and then compared the post-restoration (2012-2017) data to this pre-restoration relationship. In each study area, the post-restoration NDVI-precipitation relationship was statistically distinct from the pre-restoration relationship, suggesting a change in the fundamental relationship between precipitation and NDVI resulting from stream restoration. We infer that the in-stream structures, which raised the water table in the adjacent riparian areas, provided additional water to the streamside vegetation that was not available before restoration and reduced the dependence of riparian vegetation on precipitation. This approach provides a cost-effective, quantitative method for assessing the effects of stream restoration projects on riparian vegetation.

TI  - Space-time PM<sub>2.5</sub> mapping in the severe haze region of Jing-Jin-Ji (China) using a synthetic approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Long- and short-term exposure to PM2.5 is of great concern in China due to its adverse population health effects. Characteristic of the severity of the situation in China is that in the Jing-Jin-Ji region considered in this work a total of 2725 excess deaths have been attributed to short-term PM2.5 exposure during the period January 10-31, 2013. Technically, the processing of large space-time PM2.5 datasets and the mapping of the space-time distribution of PM2.5 concentrations often constitute high-cost projects. To address this situation, we propose a synthetic modeling framework based on the integration of (a) the Bayesian maximum entropy method that assimilates auxiliary information from land-use regression and artificial neural network (ANN) model outputs based on PM2.5 monitoring, satellite remote sensing data, land use and geographical records, with (b) a space-time projection technique that transforms the PM2.5 concentration values from the original spatiotemporal domain onto a spatial domain that moves along the direction of the PM2.5 velocity spread. An interesting methodological feature of the synthetic approach is that its components (methods or models) are complementary, i.e., one component can compensate for the occasional limitations of another component. Insight is gained in terms of a PM2.5 case study covering the severe haze Jing-Jin-Ji region during October 1-31, 2015. The proposed synthetic approach explicitly accounted for physical space-time dependencies of the PM2.5 distribution. Moreover, the assimilation of auxiliary information and the dimensionality reduction achieved by the synthetic approach produced rather impressive results: It generated PM2.5 concentration maps with low estimation uncertainty (even at counties and villages far away from the monitoring stations, whereas during the haze periods the uncertainty reduction was over 50% compared to standard PM2.5 mapping techniques); and it also proved to be computationally very efficient (the reduction in computational time was over 20% compared to standard mapping techniques).

TI  - Epidemiology and ARIMA model of positive-rate of influenza viruses among children in Wuhan, China: A nine-year retrospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Influenza is a common childhood disease andprotecting children by predicting the positive rate of influenza virus is important as vaccines are not routinely administered in China. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of influenza viruses among children in Wuhan, China during the past nine influenza seasons (2007-2015) and to predict the positive rate of different types of influenza virus in the future.Methods: During the last nine influenza seasons (2007-2015), a total of 10,232 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pediatric outpatients (age < 15 years) with influenza-like illness (ILI) infections in two sentinel children's hospitals were examined for influenza A and B by real-time one step RT-PCR. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to fit the time series and to predict the future (first half of 2016) positive rates of different types of influenza virus.Results: A total of 1,341 specimens were positive for influenza A and 490 for influenza B. The majority of infected patients were 1-11 years old (87.7%). The ARIMA model could effectively predict the positive rate of influenza virus in a short time. ARIMA(0,0,11), SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)(12), ARIMA(0,0,1) and SARIMA(0,0,1) (1,0,1)(12) were suitable for B(Victoria), B(Yamagata), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2), respectively.Conclusion: Additional policies must be formulated to prevent and control influenza. The wide use of influenza vaccines, especially for influenza B, especially for influenza B(Yamagata) and B(Victoria), can potentially reduce the effects of influenza on children of China.

TI  - Observations and Recommendations for the Calibration of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 MSI for Improved Data Interoperability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining data from multiple sensors into a single seamless time series, also known as data interoperability, has the potential for unlocking new understanding of how the Earth functions as a system. However, our ability to produce these advanced data sets is hampered by the differences in design and function of the various optical remote-sensing satellite systems. A key factor is the impact that calibration of these instruments has on data interoperability. To address this issue, a workshop with a panel of experts was convened in conjunction with the Pecora 20 conference to focus on data interoperability between Landsat and the Sentinel 2 sensors. Four major areas of recommendation were the outcome of the workshop. The first was to improve communications between satellite agencies and the remote-sensing community. The second was to adopt a collections-based approach to processing the data. As expected, a third recommendation was to improve calibration methodologies in several specific areas. Lastly, and the most ambitious of the four, was to develop a comprehensive process for validating surface reflectance products produced from the data sets. Collectively, these recommendations have significant potential for improving satellite sensor calibration in a focused manner that can directly catalyze efforts to develop data that are closer to being seamlessly interoperable.

TI  - The effect of forest disturbance on landscape temperature
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, the territory of the Sumava National Park (Czech Republic) has faced significant changes in land cover, especially deforestation, in conjunction with several bark beetle disturbances and hurricane Kyrill in 2007. The aim of the study is to review the hydrological and climatic function of the forest and deforestation impacts on the landscape temperature. As a case study, surface temperature changes of the selected area of Sumava National Park from the satellite Landsat thermal data is presented from 1991 to 2016. At the sites with decayed forest, the surface temperature increased by 2-4 degrees C. Images from ground temperature measurements illustrate extreme temperature differences (similar to 35 degrees C) at locations where dead wood has not been removed; in the live forest, they are around 5 degrees C. Further, we show the increase in air temperature is associated with the decay of forest stands, including snow melting. The duration of the permanent snow cover on the mountaintops with the growing forest in the last four years is, on average, 11 days longer than the areas with decayed forest. The results show that the increase in surface temperature in the large area causes changes in the local climate and hydrological regime. These changes may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystems, including the Sumava wetlands and peat bogs belonging to the Ramsar sites.

TI  - National practice patterns of completion lymph node dissection for sentinel node-positive melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesClose observation may be an appropriate alternative to completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for selected patient populations, especially those with minimal tumor burden in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). In this study, we examined the practice patterns of CLND utilization.MethodsUsing the National Cancer Database, we examined CLND utilization in SLN-positive patients diagnosed with clinically node-negative Stage III melanoma from 2012 to 2015. Hierarchical logistic regression models were constructed to assess the factors associated with observation after positive SLN biopsy (SLNB).ResultsOf the 131171 patients identified, 55688 (42.5%) underwent SLNB and 7200 (12.9%) had an SLN with a metastatic disease. CLND was performed in 57.0% of the patients with a positive SLNB. Patients were more likely to forgo CLND if the primary tumor was located on the lower extremity (odds ratio [OR], 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.94), were older (P<0.001), had multiple comorbidities (OR, 1.61, 95% CI, 1.19-2.20), or were diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 (OR, 1.33, 95% CI, 1.13-1.56 vs 2012).ConclusionsCLND utilization varied based on patient factors and decreased over time. As evidence supports close observation in selected patient populations with low SLN tumor burden, monitoring is needed to ensure that CLND is performed in the appropriate patient populations. However, this will require improvements in the data collected by cancer registries.

TI  - Applications of DINEOF to Satellite-Derived Chlorophyll-a from a Productive Coastal Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A major limitation for remote sensing analyses of oceanographic variables is loss of spatial data. The Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) method has demonstrated effectiveness for filling spatial gaps in remote sensing datasets, making them more easily implemented in further applications. However, the spatial and temporal coverage of the input image dataset can heavily impact the outcomes of using this method and, thus, further metrics derived from these datasets, such as phytoplankton bloom phenology. In this study, we used a three-year time series of MODIS-Aqua chlorophyll-a to evaluate the DINEOF reconstruction output accuracy corresponding to variation in the form of the input data used (i.e., daily or week composite scenes) and time series length (annual or three consecutive years) for a dynamic region, the Salish Sea, Canada. The accuracy of the output data was assessed considering the original chla pixels. Daily input time series produced higher accuracy reconstructing chla (95.08-97.08% explained variance, RMSE(xval )1.49-1.65 mg m(-3)) than did all week composite counterparts (68.99-76.88% explained variance, RMSExval 1.87-2.07 mg m(-3)), with longer time series producing better relationships to original chla pixel concentrations. Daily images were assessed relative to extracted in situ chla measurements, with original satellite chla achieving a better relationship to in situ matchups than DINEOF gap-filled chla, and with annual DINEOF-processed data performing better than the multiyear. These results contribute to the ongoing body of work encouraging production of ocean color datasets with consistent processing for global purposes such as climate change studies.

TI  - Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node in oral squamous cell carcinoma: analysis of error in 100 consecutive cases
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - UK national guidelines in 2016 recommended that sentinel lymph node biopsy should be offered to patients with early oral cancer (T1-T2 NO) in which the primary site can be reconstructed directly. This study describes the pitfalls that can be avoided in the technique of biopsy to improve outcomes. We retrospectively analysed the data from 100 consecutive patients and recorded any adverse events. Lymphatic drainage of tracer failed in two patients as a result of procedural errors. Two patients with invaded nodes developed recurrence after total neck dissection, one after micrometastases had been diagnosed, and the other as a result of extranodal spread that had led to understaging and therefore undertreatment. Two results would not have been mistakenly classified as clear if all the harvested nodes had been analysed histologically according to the protocol. The disease-specific (96%) and disease-free (92%) survival were better than expected for a group of whom a third had stage 3 disease. If all harvested nodes had been analysed by the correct protocol then two of the three nodes wrongly designated clear would have been detected, two deaths potentially avoided, and the false-negative rate would have fallen from 8.3% to 2.7%. We conclude that minor deviations from protocol can result in a detrimental outcome for the patient.

TI  - Statistical Machine Learning Methods and Remote Sensing for Sustainable Development Goals: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Interest in statistical analysis of remote sensing data to produce measurements of environment, agriculture, and sustainable development is established and continues to increase, and this is leading to a growing interaction between the earth science and statistical domains. With this in mind, we reviewed the literature on statistical machine learning methods commonly applied to remote sensing data. We focus particularly on applications related to the United Nations World Bank Sustainable Development Goals, including agriculture (food security), forests (life on land), and water (water quality). We provide a review of useful statistical machine learning methods, how they work in a remote sensing context, and examples of their application to these types of data in the literature. Rather than prescribing particular methods for specific applications, we provide guidance, examples, and case studies from the literature for the remote sensing practitioner and applied statistician. In the supplementary material, we also describe the necessary steps pre and post analysis for remote sensing data; the pre-processing and evaluation steps.

TI  - SWCTI: Surface Water Content Temperature Index for Assessment of Surface Soil Moisture Status
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation supply water index (VSWI = NDVI/LST) is an effective metric estimating soil moisture in areas with moderate to dense vegetation cover. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibits a long water stress lag and the land surface temperature (LST), sensitive to water stress, does not contribute considerably to surface soil moisture monitoring due to the constraints of the mathematical characteristics of VSWI: LST influences VSWI less when LST value is sufficiently high. This paper mathematically analyzes the characteristics of VSWI and proposes a new operational dryness index (surface water content temperature index, SWCTI) for the assessment of surface soil moisture status. SWCTI uses the surface water content index (SWCI), which provides a more accurate estimation of surface soil moisture than that of NDVI, as the numerator and the modified surface temperature, which has a greater influence on SWCTI than that of LST, as the denominator. The validation work includes comparison of SWCTI with in situ soil moisture and other remote sensing indices. The results show SWCTI demonstrates the highest correlation with in situ soil moisture; the highest correlation R = 0.801 is found between SWCTI and the 0-5 cm soil moisture in a sandy loam. SWCTI is a functional and effective method that has a great potential in surface soil moisture monitoring.

TI  - Feature Extraction and Selection of Sentinel-1 Dual-Pol Data for Global-Scale Local Climate Zone Classification
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of the local climate zone (LCZ) has been recently proposed as a generic land-cover/land-use classification scheme. It divides urban regions into 17 categories based on compositions of man-made structures and natural landscapes. Although it was originally designed for temperature study, the morphological structure concealed in LCZs also reflects economic status and population distribution. To this end, global LCZ classification is of great value for worldwide studies on economy and population. Conventional classification approaches are usually successful for an individual city using optical remote sensing data. This paper, however, attempts for the first time to produce global LCZ classification maps using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Specifically, we first produce polarimetric features, local statistical features, texture features, and morphological features and compare them, with respect to their classification performance. Here, an ensemble classifier is investigated, which is trained and tested on already separated transcontinental cities. Considering the challenging global scope this work handles, we conclude the classification accuracy is not yet satisfactory. However, Sentinel-1 dual-Pol SAR data could contribute the classification for several LCZ classes. According to our feature studies, the combination of local statistical features and morphological features yields the best classification results with 61.8% overall accuracy (OA), which is 3% higher than the OA produced by the second best features combination. The 3% is considerably large for a global scale. Based on our feature importance analysis, features related to VH polarized data contributed the most to the eventual classification result.

TI  - An early forecasting method for the drift path of green tides: A case study in the Yellow Sea, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, green tides caused by massive blooms of Enteromorpha prolifera have occurred in the Yellow Sea during April and September every year. Generally, the macroalgae first gathered around the Jiangsu coastline and then moved northeastward toward the Shandong Peninsula, but the paths and distribution of green tides have featured obvious inter-annual variation. Here, we describe a new method to forecasting the drift path of green tides with some climate indices such as Nino3.4. This method may help policy makers to develop a strategy to prevent green tide disasters and mitigate the consequence more effectively.Initially, we ran a numerical ocean model to simulate the movement of hypothetical green tides for last 20 years. The model was driven by remote sensing data of sea surface winds, surface temperatures, and tracers representing macroalgae that were created on certain dates so that drift paths could be traced. Ocean color remote sensing data were employed to determine the drift parameters. Next, the relationship between the displacement of tracers, including directions and distances of movement during certain periods were then analyzed along with the corresponding values of a set of six climate indices. A forecasting algorithm based on an artificial neural network was then established and trained with these data. Using this algorithm, the drift path of green tides could be predicted from the values of certain climate indices of the previous year. The model assessment with satellite ocean color remote sensing images indicated the effectiveness and practicability of this method.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for global change investigation, which is significant to ecosystem and biogeochemical researches. However, studies on LST of complex terrain areas are limited. Guizhou Province is a typical karst landform with complex terrain and fragile ecosystems. Based on multi-year MODIS remote sensing data combined with meteorological data in Guizhou Province, the temporal and spatial changes of LST were studied by using correlation analysis, trend analysis, R/S analysis and geographic detector. The results showed that: (1) The MODIS LST displayed a linear correlation with near surface temperature; (2) LST showed a spatial distribution of the south-high and north-low; (3) The interannual fluetuation of LST was large with the maximum difference of 2.06 degrees C . a(-1), while the annual variation was mainly in unimodal distribution; (4) LST decreased with increasing elevation in the regains with > 800 m above sea level, and exhibited a nonlinear relationship with elevation in the regions with < 800 m above sea level; (5) There were significant differences in LST among different land-use types, with a maximum difference of 1.3 degrees C In summary, the spatial distributions of LST in the study area were relatively consistent with that of latitude, which was impacted by elevation and latitude and was related to land. use types.

TI  - Urban land-use mapping using a deep convolutional neural network with high spatial resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious "blocks". In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.

TI  - Spatial Clustering of Dengue Fever Incidence and Its Association with Surrounding Greenness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With more than 58,000 cases reported by the country's Centers for Disease Control, the dengue outbreaks from 2014 to 2015 seriously impacted the southern part of Taiwan. This study aims to assess the spatial autocorrelation of the dengue fever (DF) outbreak in southern Taiwan in 2014 and 2015, and to further understand the effects of green space (such as forests, farms, grass, and parks) allocation on DF. In this study, two different greenness indexes were used. The first green metric, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was provided by the long-term NASA MODIS satellite NDVI database, which quantifies and represents the overall vegetation greenness. The latest 2013 land use survey GIS database completed by the National Land Surveying and Mapping Center was obtained to access another green metric, green land use in Taiwan. We first used Spearman's rho to find out the relationship between DF and green space, and then three spatial autocorrelation methods, including Global Moran's I, high/low clustering, and Hot Spot were employed to assess the spatial autocorrelation of DF outbreak. In considering the impact of social and environmental factors in DF, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to further clarify the relationship between different types of green land use and dengue cases. Results of spatial autocorrelation analysis showed a high aggregation of dengue epidemic in southern Taiwan, and the metropolitan areas were the main hotspots. Results of correlation analysis and GLMM showed a positive correlation between parks and dengue fever, and the other five green space metrics and land types revealed a negative association with DF. Our findings may be an important asset for improving surveillance and control interventions for dengue.

TI  - Assessment of Forest above Ground Biomass Estimation Using Multi-Temporal C-band Sentinel-1 and Polarimetric L-band PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an active sensor transmitting long wavelengths, has the advantages of working day and night and without rain or cloud disturbance. It is further able to sense the geometric structure of forests more than passive optical sensors, making it a valuable tool for mapping forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB). This paper studies the ability of the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 and polarimetric L-band PALSAR-2 data to estimate live AGB based on ground truth data collected in New England, USA in 2017. Comparisons of results using the Simple Water Cloud Model (SWCM) on both VH and VV polarizations show that C-band reaches saturation much faster than the L-band due to its limited forest canopy penetration. The exhaustive search multiple linear regression model over the many polarimetric parameters from PALSAR-2 data shows that the combination of polarimetric parameters could slightly improve the AGB estimation, with an adjusted R-2 as high as 0.43 and RMSE of around 70 Mg/ha when decomposed Pv component and Alpha angle are used. Additionally, the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 data are compared, which demonstrates that the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 significantly improves the AGB estimation, but still has a much lower adjusted R-2 due to the limitations of the short wavelength. Finally, a site-level comparison between paired control and treatment sites shows that the L-band aligns better with the ground truth than the C-band, showing the high potential of the models to be applied to relative biomass change detection.

TI  - Agricultural remote sensing big data: Management and applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Big data with its vast volume and complexity is increasingly concerned, developed and used for all professions and trades. Remote sensing, as one of the sources for big data, is generating earth-observation data and analysis results daily from the platforms of satellites, manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based structures. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for precision agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. The key of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data and geographic information, to produce spatially-varied data for subsequent precision agricultural operations. Agricultural remote sensing data, as general remote sensing data, have all characteristics of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis and visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to the success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available remote sensing data resources, recent development of technologies for remote sensing big data management, and remote sensing data processing and management for precision agriculture. A five-layer-fifteen-level (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure is described and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level (FLTL) remote sensing data management structure for management and applications of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where the sensors are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based structures. The FLTL structure is the management and application framework of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture and local farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale.

TI  - Survey timing vs. ecosystem scheduling: Degree-days to underpin observed interannual variability in marine ecosystems
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fishery annual surveys are shifting towards integrated ecosystem surveys. However, monitoring the whole ecosystem once a year entails special attention to the interpretation of observations, because they only represent a snapshot in the seasonal dynamics of the environment, of a species, or any dynamic process of interest. The dependency of this snapshot to the timing, but also to the duration, of the survey with respect to this seasonal dynamics needs to be considered. Fish stock assessment is only little impacted by the observed timing within a given season, whereas warming, stratification, plankton bloom occurrence, or fish fecundity, are processes rapidly changing especially in spring. Firstly, from independent satellite data, we described the seasonal and interannual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability in the Bay of Biscay in spring around the annual PELGAS surveys. Our results revealed that the in-situ surface temperature snapshot from a given survey may be strongly misleading on the existing spatial pattern, blurring the latitudinal temperature gradient, with potential impact in e.g. species habitat modelling. Secondly, based on these survey-independent SST data, we proposed a methodology to position annual surveys in the environment spring schedule. Our temporal indicator is based on a degree-day metric, computed as the cumulated temperature from the previous winter date with minimum annual temperature. The annual degree-day is then compared to the climatology of the degree-day metric to correct the actual date of survey to an environment date. The methodology was spatialised to take into account both latitudinal shift in phasing of seasonality, and rapidly changing conditions in the environment during the survey itself. Finally, we tested the methodology to refine the description of anchovy and sardine spawning phenology, as well as spawning spatial distribution for particular years such as hot year 2003. More generally, this is an example of how synoptic, independent data from operational oceanography, as a background history of the environment dynamics, can be used to improve the interpretation of biological observations in marine ecosystems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal wetland changes and their threats in North Central Ethiopian Highlands
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important environmental resources for rural livelihoods in Ethiopia. The study investigated spatiotemporal change of wetlands, drivers and effects in North Central Ethiopian Highlands. Landsat satellite imageries of 1984, 1993, 2000, and 2013 were used to analyse wetland changes over the last three decades. Practical observations, interviews and discussions with local communities and officers were also conducted to address the main objective. Furthermore, secondary data on crop yields were collected to supplement the primary data. The study shows that wetlands have been converted into built-up areas and farmlands. Wetlands in the study area experienced annual loss across the entire study period. Consequently, the area size of wetlands decreased from 7.4 per cent in 1984 to 2.6 per cent in 2013. About 66 per cent of the total wetlands was lost within 30 years mainly due to farmland encroachment and urban expansions. The highest rate of wetland change was recorded between 2000 and 2013. Such wetland changes increased conflicts among land users. However, the converted wetlands increased short-term benefits due to wetland recession agriculture. To conclude, wetland resources are under enormous threats, and challenge the sustainability of livelihoods. Thus, integrated and adaptive wetland restoration policies could improve the degraded wetlands.

TI  - Crossing boundaries for cetacean conservation: Setting research priorities to guide management of harbour porpoises
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of natural resources involves a multidisciplinary perspective to address complex issues in data poor-environments. With mobile species that do not conform to human-defined borders a cross-boundary approach is essential. There is a continuing concern of ecological sustainability of marine environments, which demands monitoring of ecosystem indicators. Such indicators are increasingly derived from monitoring sentinel species. Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are included as indicator species in several national and international agreements. Increasing exposure to anthropogenic stressors may impact harbour porpoise populations. To investigate these risks, a better understanding of threats and their effect is required. This study aimed to identify current knowledge gaps, to predict future pressures or threats, and to define useful conservation indicators to facilitate future research on harbour porpoises in the North Sea, through expert elicitation gained in a two-round Delphi approach. The three most important knowledge gaps addressed were bycatch, population dynamics, and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors. Bycatch was predicted as the highest concern for porpoises in the next 20 years, followed by chemical and noise pollution, respectively. A list of essential indicators aiming to increase understanding of harbour porpoises' health status was established and studying causes of death, distribution, abundance, habitat use and diet composition were scored as most relevant. These results should guide research focus and management objectives of harbour porpoise populations and the study design could be translated to serve managers in other geographical areas aiming to identify knowledge gaps and defining research priorities for other wildlife species.

TI  - Anticipated learning outcomes for a biochemistry course-based undergraduate research experience aimed at predicting protein function from structure: Implications for assessment design
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been published in the literature. However, only limited attempts have been made to rigorously identify the discovery-type research abilities that students actually develop during such experiences. Instead, there has been a greater focus on technical or procedural-type knowledge or general CURE skills that are too comprehensive to effectively assess. Before the extent of discovery-type learning outcomes can be established in students (termed verified learning outcomes or VLOs), it is important to rigorously identify the anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) and to then develop student assessments that target each ALO to reveal the nature of such student learning. In this article we present a matrix of 43 ALOs, or course-based undergraduate research abilities (CURAs), that instructors anticipate students will develop during a recently-developed biochemistry CURE focusing on the prediction of protein function from structure. The CURAs were identified using the process for identifying course-based undergraduate research abilities (PICURA) and classified into seven distinct themes that enabled the characterization of the CURE and a comparison to other published inventories of research competencies and CURE aspects. These themes and the CURE protocols aligning to the CURAs were used to form the ALO matrix that was, in turn, used to inform the design of an assessment that revealed evidence that a student had developed some of the targeted CURAs. Future research will focus on further assessment development that targets other identified CURAs. This approach has potential applications to other CUREs both in biochemistry and other science disciplines. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):478-492, 2018.

TI  - Wildland fire-induced landscape changes in Madera, Chihuahua region
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a disturbance factor that influences the formation of forest ecosystems by modifying their structure. Wildland fires alter landscape characteristics that can be evaluated when compared to their pre-fire condition. In this study, wildland fire-induced landscape changes and their relationship with burned extent were analyzed in the region of Madera, Chihuahua during the period 2000-2010. Burned perimeters were delineated using spectral indices derived from Landsat TM5 and OLI8 imagery and the vegetation types within burned areas were classified. Landscape metrics of average patch size, number of patches, largest patch index and landscape division were computed within burned polygons and compared with pre-fire landscape metrics. Average patch size and the largest patch index decreased after wildland fires, whilst number of patches and landscape division increased in comparison with pre-fire conditions. Average patch size and the number of patches were correlated with burned area. The results show that landscapes are more heterogeneous and fragmented after the occurrence of wildland fires. Landscape characteristics related to burned area can be used to identify fire-prone landscapes.

TI  - Quantifying suspended solids in small rivers using satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of suspended solids and associated contaminants in rivers requires knowledge of sediment sources. In-situ sampling can only describe the integrated impact of the upstream sources. Empirical models that use surface reflectance from satellite images to estimate total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations can be used to supplement measurements and provide spatially continuous maps. However, there are few examples, especially in narrow, shallow and hydrologically dynamic rivers found in mountainous areas. A case study of the Didipio catchment in Philippines was used to address these issues. Four 5-m resolution RapidEye images, from between the years 2014 and 2016, and near-simultaneous ground measurements of TSS concentrations were used to develop a power law model that approximates the relationship between TSS and reflectance for each of four spectral bands. A second dataset using two 2-m resolution Pleiades-1A and a third using a 6-m resolution SPOT-6 image along with ground-based measurements, were consistent with the model when using the red band data. Using that model, encompassing data from all three datasets, gave an R-2 value of 65% and a root mean square error of 519 mg L-1. A linear relationship between reflectance and TSS exists from 1 mg L-1 to approximately 500 mg L-1. In contrast, for TSS measurements between 500 mg L-1 and 3580 mg L-1 reflectance increases at a generally lower and more variable rate. The results were not sensitive to changing the pixel location within the vicinity of the ground sampling location. The model was used to generate a continuous map of TSS concentration within the catchment. Further ground-based measurements including TSS concentrations that are higher than 3580 mg L-1 would allow the model to be developed and applied more confidently over the full relevant range of TSS.

TI  - Intestinal Carriage of Third-Generation Cephalosporin-Resistant and Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase-Producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in Healthy US Children
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae intestinal carriage in healthy US children has not been well characterized.Methods. Children between 14 days and 14 years of age were enrolled during well-child visits in Oakland, California, Kansas City, Kansas, and Nashville, Tennessee, between December 2013 and March 2015. Data on recent antibiotic use by the child and travel and hospitalization history of all members of each child's household were obtained with a risk-factor survey. Stool specimens collected from the subjects were screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL-P) bacteria using CHROMagar ESBL medium. Putative ESBL-P Escherichia coli and Klebsiella colonies underwent phenotypic confirmation by double-disk synergy testing; confirmed third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GCR) isolates underwent additional antibiotic-susceptibility testing.Results. In 519 subjects, the overall 3GCR Enterobacteriaceae carriage rate was 4.4% (n = 23) and ranged from 3.4% to 5.1% among the study sites. The ESBL-P Enterobacteriaceae carriage rate was 3.5% (n = 18). The rates of 3GCR Enterobacteriaceae carriage was highest in 1 to < 2 year olds at 6.5%, and was 5.2% in < 5 year-olds vs 1.7% in >= 5-year-olds (P =.11). 3GCR and ESBL-P Enterobacteriaceae carriage was associated with international travel within the previous year; 11.1% of ESBL-P Enterobacteriaceae carriers reported this history compared with 1.6% of noncarriers (P =.004). No other queried factor was found to increase risk. Of the 24 analyzed 3GCR isolates, 58% were multidrug resistant.Conclusions. The 3GCR Enterobacteriaceae carriage rate exceeds 5% in healthy US children < 5 years of age. International travel within the previous year increased the risk of 3GCR and ESBL-P Enterobacteriaceae carriage. In contrast, we found no differences in the rates of hospitalization or recent antibiotic exposure between carriers and noncarriers. Young children, who have the highest prevalence of colonization, might be a sentinel population to study to gain a better understanding of community sources of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

TI  - Assisting the least among us: Social work's historical response to unaccompanied immigrant and refugee youth
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Unaccompanied immigrant and refugee youth enter the U.S. daily to escape violence, political oppression, extreme poverty, and chronic instability in their native countries, or as victims of human trafficking. In FY 2016, nearly 60,000 UAC arrived from Central America and Mexico alone (ORR, 2017) and officials estimate that UAC will continue to enter the U.S. at a rapid pace in the years ahead. Yet, because these youth do not have the same legal status, the government treats them differently upon their arrival (Cebulko, 2013).Recent executive orders by the Trump Administration have exacerbated this problem and underscore the importance of providing comprehensive supportive services to this population. However, there is a dearth of scholarship on this issue, and scant evidence that current programs are effective in protecting vulnerable children (Bhabha, 2004).This challenge is not new. In different eras social workers have addressed the needs of this population through a combination of private and state-sponsored interventions. Several factors influenced these varied responses: (1) the changing demographic and national characteristics of UAC and the range of needs they exhibited; (2) prevailing attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, often influenced by the status of the U.S. economy; and (3) the distribution of responsibilities between the public and private sectors for the development, implementation, and funding of programs that addressed the needs of UAC.Based on primary and secondary source materials, this article traces the evolution of social works response to these needs during the past two centuries. It identifies some common and conflicting themes in the profession's assessment of the issues faced by UAC, and the purposes and outcomes of the interventions developed. It concludes by examining how the treatment of this population reflected the goals of assimilation, exclusion, or structural change, and how these goals continue to influence contemporary policy and practice.

TI  - Impact of shrimp aquaculture development on important ecosystems in India
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of aquaculture has raised the environmental concern about the conversion of ecologically important areas such as mangroves and agricultural lands. The study explored the impact of shrimp aquaculture on land use change in India's coastal wetlands using Landsat satellite data, geographical information system techniques and field verification. From 1988 to 2013, the area under aquaculture has grown by 879 %, which brought the tremendous changes in the coastal land use pattern. Mangrove and agriculture lands have been used for 5.04 % and 28.10 % of the aquaculture growth. Mudflats, scrublands, saltpan, and waterbodies have contributed to 51.65 %, 1.76 %, 1.73 % and 2.37 % of the aquaculture area expansion respectively. Mangrove areas have undergone severe changes due to gain and loss at different places. Environmental factors influenced the changes in mangroves, and the overall extent of mangrove has increased by 13.44 %. Construction activities and aquaculture have reduced the agricultural land by 3.52 % and 0.53 % respectively. The variation between the actual area under shrimp aquaculture and the Coastal Aquaculture Authority approved area indicate that the larger extent of shrimp farm operates without approval. Implementation of an intensive monitoring program for strict adherence to coastal aquaculture regulation laws will be helpful for the sustainability of coastal resources as well as aquaculture.

TI  - Immunochromatography in CSF improves data on surveillance of <i>S</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> meningitis in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant cause of childhood bacterial meningitis in India. The United States Food and Drug Administration has licensed an immunochromatographic (ICT) test, Binax (R) NOW (TM), to detect the C polysaccharide antigen of S. pneumoniae in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). Accurate etiological diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in India is essential for effective treatment strategies and preventive interventions.Materials and methods: CSF samples from 2081 children admitted, with clinically suspected bacterial meningitis at 11 sentinel sites of hospital based sentinel surveillance network for bacterial meningitis in India between September 2009 and December 2016 were tested with ICT. Concurrent CSF cultures were processed using standard procedures.Results and discussion: S. pneumoniae was detected thrice the number of times by ICT than by CSF culture, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95.3% respectively. This rapid ICT test proves to be of immense use as a diagnostic test for meningitis patients with/without prior antibiotic treatment, especially in facilities with limited laboratory infrastructure in resource limited settings.

TI  - Assessment of Bacterial Accumulation and Environmental Factors in Sentinel Oysters and Estuarine Water Quality from the Phang Nga Estuary Area in Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterized microbiological and chemical contamination of oyster meat and estuarine water in Phang Nga, Thailand. Pooled oyster meats (n = 144), estuarine waters (n = 96) and environmental parameters were collected from March, 2016 to February, 2017, and assessed for levels of total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli (EC), and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP), presence of Salmonella and Shigella and levels of heavy metals (Mn, Pb and Cd). The prevalence of TC, FC and EC were in 99.3%, 94.4% and 93.1% of oyster meat and 94.8%, 79.2%, and 78.1% of water, respectively. The average VP levels was 8.5 x 10(7) most probable number (MPN)/g oyster. Prevalence of Shigella and Salmonella in the pooled oysters were 7.6% and 30.6%, respectively. The dominant Salmonella serovars were Paratyphi B followed by Seremban, and Kentucky. In contrast, the prevalence of Shigella were 27.1%, but Salmonella was not detected in estuarine water. Factors statistically associated with EC accumulation in oyster were level of FC, 7-day average precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and presence of Salmonella in the sample. The optimal cutoff value of EC to predict Salmonella in oyster was 420 MPN/g. Results indicate this area has relatively safe levels of heavy metals, whereas bacterial contamination was very high for oysters.

TI  - Developing a Tribal Health Sovereignty Model for Obesity Prevention
T2  - PROGRESS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS-RESEARCH EDUCATION AND ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Few models for effective health interventions exist for stemming the tide of American Indian (AI) childhood obesity rates; they are among the highest in the United States and are increasing. Obesity-related chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes type II and cardiovascular disease) rates far exceed other U.S. racial groups. Some studies show success with health interventions that center within an AI worldview and approach, rather than those that center on an individualistic Western worldview. The Tribal Health Sovereignty (THS) model presented here defines health through an AI perspective and applicably to food and exercise intervention. The model discussed in this paper is grounded in a study, which used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) photovoice methodology and can be used to design effective health interventions.Methods: Development of the THS model was guided by Earp and Ennett's representation of concept model development for health education research and intervention.(1) Findings from a CBPR study that used photovoice methodology informed the model. Differences between AI and Western models of health are explored and illuminate how an interventions shaped by Indigenous culture and world- view can lead to better health outcomes among AI people.Results: A THS model was developed to guide future AI interventions embedded within tribal culture.Conclusions: By using a THS model, tribal communities can engage in identifying barriers and facilitators for health to lower childhood obesity.

TI  - Vegetation growth enhancement in urban environments of the Conterminous United States
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are natural laboratories for studying vegetation responses to global environmental changes because of their climate, atmospheric, and biogeochemical conditions. However, few holistic studies have been conducted on the impact of urbanization on vegetation growth. We decomposed the overall impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth into direct (replacement of original land surfaces by impervious built-up) and indirect (urban environments) components, using a conceptual framework and remotely sensed data for 377 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the conterminous United States (CONUS) in 2001, 2006, and 2011. Results showed that urban pixels are often greener than expected given the amount of paved surface they contain. The vegetation growth enhancement due to indirect effects occurred in 88.4%, 90.8%, and 92.9% of urban bins in 2001, 2006, and 2011, respectively. By defining offset value as the ratio of the absolute indirect and direct impact, we obtained that growth enhancement due to indirect effects compensated for about 29.2%, 29.5%, and 31.0% of the reduced productivity due to loss of vegetated surface area on average in 2001, 2006, and 2011, respectively. Vegetation growth responses to urbanization showed little temporal variation but large regional differences with higher offset value in the western CONUS than in the eastern CONUS. Our study highlights the prevalence of vegetation growth enhancement in urban environments and the necessity of differentiating various impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth, and calls for tailored field experiments to understand the relative contributions of various driving forces to vegetation growth and predict vegetation responses to future global change using cities as harbingers.

TI  - Enhanced IT2FCM algorithm using object-based triangular fuzzy set modeling for remote-sensing clustering
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based fuzzy clustering method has been widely used to remote-sensing clustering analysis. Mean and interval spectral signatures are typically used to describe an object's features. However, accurately distinguishing two objects with the same mean or interval values and different internal distributions is difficult. Focus on this problem, we developed triangular fuzzy set modeling to describe objects and designed an interval distance metric to measure the dissimilarities between triangular fuzzy sets. Furthermore, using the variation of fuzzifier (two fuzzifiers) to construct interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (IT2FCM) clustering methods, which are sensitive to the choice of fuzzifier, has uncertainty and subjectivity. Thus, an enhanced IT2FCM clustering algorithm that directly adopts the interval distance metric rather than the variation of fuzzifier is proposed for high-resolution remote-sensing clustering. We performed land-cover classification experiments for three study areas by utilizing remote-sensing images from the SPOT-5 and Gaofen-2 satellite sensor, which spatial resolution are approximately 10 m and 1 m, respectively. Visual and numerical results, including Kappa coefficients and the confusion matrix, were utilized to verify the classification results. The experimental results indicated that triangular fuzzy set modeling is appropriate for extracting features from ground objects; moreover, it limits the classification errors caused by same objects with different spectral features. Compared with the object-based interval-valued fuzzy c-means (IV-FCM) method reported in the literature, the proposed algorithm results in improved classification quality and accuracy.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and its impacts on protected areas in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change (LUCC) in tropical areas threatens biodiversity and protected area integrity and then affects global ecosystem functions and services. In this study, the spatiotemporal patterns and processes of LUCC in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna, which is located on the northern edge of tropical Asia, were examined using a modified post-classification change detection technique based on random forest classifiers and Landsat images acquired at a 5-year time interval (e.g., 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014) from 1994 to 2014, with a special focus on protected areas and their surroundings. The overall accuracies of land use/ land cover classification reached 90.13-97.90%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84-0.96. Massive but decelerating conversion from forests to artificial plantations has occurred in recent decades. From 1994 to 2014, the area of plantations increased by 1833.85 Km(2), whereas that of forests decreased by 1942.67 km(2). The expanded areas of artificial plantations decreased from 158.41 km(2) per year in 1994-1999 to 59.70 km(2) per year in 2009-2014. More considerable transformation from forests to artificial plantations occurred in lowland areas with elevations below 1000 m and at the edges of National Nature Reserves, which observed a forest loss rate of greater than 40% between 1994 and 2014. This poses serious challenges for sustaining both protected areas and surrounding human communities and to solve the increasingly escalating human-elephant conflicts. The complex food, biodiversity. and land use nexus in this region remain to be untangled in future study.

TI  - Satellite Detection Limitations of Sub-Canopy Smouldering Wildfires in the North American Boreal Forest
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a simulation model for prediction of forest canopy interception of upwelling fire radiated energy from sub-canopy smouldering vegetation fires. We apply this model spatially across the North American boreal forest in order to map minimum detectable sub-canopy smouldering fire size for three satellite fire detection systems (sensor and algorithm), broadly representative of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We evaluate our results according to fire management requirements for "early detection" of wildland fires. In comparison to the historic fire archive (Canadian National Fire Database, 1980-2017), satellite data with a 1000 m pixel size used with an algorithm having a minimum MWIR channel BT elevation threshold of 5 and 3 K above background (e.g., MODIS or SLSTR) proves incapable of providing a sub-0.2 ha smouldering fire detection 70% and 45% of the time respectively, even assuming that the sensor overpassed the relevant location within the correct time window. By contrast, reducing the pixel area by an order of magnitude (e.g., 375 m pixels of VIIRS) and using a 3.5 K active fire detection threshold offers the potential for successfully detecting all fires when they are still below 0.2 ha. Our results represent a 'theoretical best performance' of remote sensing systems to detect sub-canopy smoldering fires early in their lifetime.

TI  - Worldview Analysis in a Comparative Context: Fishing for Data in Muddy Waters
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on the five-fold revision of the concept of worldview offered by the issue editors, I investigate whether some nonreligious modes of cultural production might be profitably investigated using such a typology. In my comparative study of religious and secular sustainability-oriented social movements I offered skeletal definitions of the categories religion and sustainability, and suggested ways in which public deployments of such terms might offer fertile ground for collaboration between individuals and groups with different value sets. In more recent work among particular rock music and festival scenes, I have found it necessary to offer a dramatically different understanding of the category religion. In a sort of thought experiment, I imagine whether the revised concept of worldview might be applicable, and indeed whether it offers some advantage over the category religion. My conclusions are that in general, in some cases the category of worldview may have some advantages, but it may also gloss over or ignore important cultural contestations over terms such as religion, and at best underplay important affective activators of belonging and identity. The notion of ways of life, or lifeways may offer a term which avoids some ethnocentric impositions, but would require greater elaboration to be broadly useful to ethnographers.

TI  - Estimation of Terrestrial Global Gross Primary Production (GPP) with Satellite Data-Driven Models and Eddy Covariance Flux Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) based on models that use satellite data within a simplified light-use efficiency framework that does not rely upon other meteorological inputs. Satellite-based geometry-adjusted reflectances are from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and provide information about vegetation structure and chlorophyll content at both high temporal (daily to monthly) and spatial (similar to 1 km) resolution. We use satellite-derived solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) to identify regions of high productivity crops and also evaluate the use of downscaled SIF to estimate GPP. We calibrate a set of our satellite-based models with GPP estimates from a subset of distributed eddy covariance flux towers (FLUXNET 2015). The results of the trained models are evaluated using an independent subset of FLUXNET 2015 GPP data. We show that variations in light-use efficiency (LUE) with incident PAR are important and can be easily incorporated into the models. Unlike many LUE-based models, our satellite-based GPP estimates do not use an explicit parameterization of LUE that reduces its value from the potential maximum under limiting conditions such as temperature and water stress. Even without the parameterized downward regulation, our simplified models are shown to perform as well as or better than state-of-the-art satellite data-driven products that incorporate such parameterizations. A significant fraction of both spatial and temporal variability in GPP across plant functional types can be accounted for using our satellite-based models. Our results provide an annual GPP value of similar to 140 Pg C year(-1) for 2007 that is within the range of a compilation of observation-based, model, and hybrid results, but is higher than some previous satellite observation-based estimates.

TI  - Innovation in rangeland monitoring: annual, 30 m, plant functional type percent cover maps for US rangelands, 1984-2017
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Innovations in machine learning and cloud-based computing were merged with historical remote sensing and field data to provide the first moderate resolution, annual, percent cover maps of plant functional types across rangeland ecosystems to effectively and efficiently respond to pressing challenges facing conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We utilized the historical Landsat satellite record, gridded meteorology, abiotic land surface data, and over 30,000 field plots within a Random Forests model to predict per-pixel percent cover of annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, shrubs, and bare ground over the western United States from 1984 to 2017. Results were validated using three independent collections of plot-level measurements, and resulting maps display land cover variation in response to changes in climate, disturbance, and management. The maps, which will be updated annually at the end of each year, provide exciting opportunities to expand and improve rangeland conservation, monitoring, and management. The data open new doors for scientific investigation at an unprecedented blend of temporal fidelity, spatial resolution, and geographic scale.

M3  - Article
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit highly lineage-specific expression and act through diverse mechanisms to exert control over a wide range of cellular processes. lncRNAs can function as potent modulators of innate immune responses through control of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA expression and processing. Recent studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs participate in the regulation of antiviral responses and autoimmune disease. Despite their emerging role as immune mediators, the mechanisms that govern lncRNA expression and function have only begun to be characterized. In this study, we explore the role of lncRNAs in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are critical sentinel sensors of viral infection and contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. Using genome-wide sequencing approaches, we dissect the contributions of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and type I interferon (IFN-I) in the regulation of coding and noncoding RNA expression in CAL-1 pDCs treated with R848 or IFN. Functional enrichment analysis reveals both the unique and synergistic roles of TLR7 and IFN-I signaling in the orchestration of pDC function. These observations were consistent with primary cell immune responses elicited by detection of viral infection. We identified and characterized the conditional TLR7- and IFN-I-dependent regulation of 588 lncRNAs. Dysregulation of these lncRNAs could significantly alter pDC maturation, IFN-I and inflammatory cytokine production, antigen presentation, costimulation or tolerance cues, turnover, or localization, all consequential events during viral infection or IFN-I-driven autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings demonstrate the differential responsiveness of lncRNAs to unique immune stimuli, uncover regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA expression, and reveal a novel and tractable platform for the study of lncRNA expression and function.

TI  - Axillary Lymphadenectomy and Wound Complications in Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The most common method of breast reconstruction in the United States today is implant-based reconstruction. However, reported complication rates are high, from 30% to 50%. Thus, it is important for reconstructive surgeons to identify factors associated with or contributing to wound complications after breast reconstruction. This study sought to identify associations between axillary lymph node dissection and postoperative wound complications in implant-based breast reconstruction.Methods A retrospective chart review was performed of subjects undergoing breast oncologic and reconstructive surgery by a single breast surgeon and reconstructive surgeon, respectively, from 2013 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed of 273 subjects with 338 reconstructed breasts. Data were recorded on the extent of axillary node dissection and subsequent wound complications including seroma requiring percutaneous drainage, seroma requiring open drainage, wound dehiscence requiring local wound care, wound dehiscence requiring operative revision, implant exposure, and implant loss.Results Analysis of the data demonstrated an increase in complication rates with extent of axillary lymph node dissection; however, these rates did not reach statistical significance. Statistically significant associations, however, were identified between wound complication rates and other known risk factors including increasing age and body mass index, as well as smoking status.Conclusions Although an association between increasing complication rates and the extent of lymph node dissection has previously been reported, this study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant association with logistic regression analysis.

T2  - Insects
M3  - Article
AB  - The assumption that vector abundance differences might drive spatial and temporal heterogeneities in vector-borne disease transmission is common, though data supporting it is scarce. Here, we present data from two common mosquito species Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, biweekly sampled as adults, from March 2016 through December 2017, with BG-sentinel traps in two neighboring districts of Kaohsiung City (KC), Taiwan. One district has historically been a dengue transmission hotspot (Sanmin), and the other a coldspot (Nanzih). We collected a total 41,027 mosquitoes, and we found that average mosquito abundance (mean [plus or minus] S.D.) was higher in Sanmin (Ae. aegypti: 9.03 [plus or minus] 1.46; Cx. quinquefasciatus: 142.57 [plus or minus] 14.38) than Nanzih (Ae. aegypti: 6.21 [plus or minus] 0.47; Cx. quinquefasciatus: 63.37 [plus or minus] 8.71) during the study period. In both districts, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus population dynamics were sensitive to changes in temperature, the most platykurtic environmental variable at KC during the study period, a pattern predicted by Schmalhausen's law, which states that organisms are more sensitive to small changes in environmental variables whose average value is more uncertain than its extremes. Our results also suggest that differences in Ae. aegypti abundance might be responsible for spatial differences in dengue transmission at KC. Our comparative approach, where we also observed a significant increment in the abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus in the dengue transmission hotspot, suggests this area might be more likely to experience outbreaks of other vector borne diseases and should become a primary focus for vector surveillance and control.

TI  - Flood Detection in Gaofen-3 SAR Images via Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergency flood monitoring and rescue need to first detect flood areas. This paper provides a fast and novel flood detection method and applies it to Gaofen-3 SAR images. The fully convolutional network (FCN), a variant of VGG16, is utilized for flood mapping in this paper. Considering the requirement of flood detection, we fine-tune the model to get higher accuracy results with shorter training time and fewer training samples. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm not only gives robust and accurate detection results but also significantly reduces the detection time.

TI  - Confirmation of Zika virus infection through hospital-based sentinel surveillance of acute febrile illness in Uganda, 2014-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, was first isolated in Uganda in 1947. From February 2014 to October 2017, the Uganda Virus Research Institute, in collaboration with the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, conducted arbovirus surveillance in acute febrile illness (AFI) patients at St Francis hospital in Nkonkonjeru. Three hundred and eighty-four serum samples were collected and tested for IgM antibodies to yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and ZIKV. Of the 384 samples, 5 were positive for ZIKV IgM. Of these five, three were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to be ZIKV infections. Of the remaining two, one was determined to be a non-specific flavivirus infection and one was confirmed to be alphavirus-positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This study provides the first evidence of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection in Uganda in five decades, and emphasizes the need to enhance sentinel surveillance.

TI  - Mapping and Understanding the Dynamics of Landscape Changes on Heterogeneous Mediterranean Islands with the Use of OBIA: The Case of Ionian Region, Greece
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean islands contain heterogeneous landscapes, resulting from the complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic processes, and have significant ecological and conservation importance. They are vulnerable systems to global change and the monitoring of changes, induced by the interacting environmental drivers, is of particular importance for applying a sustainable management regime. The aim of this study was to detect and analyze the landscape dynamics and changes in landscape composition over a 30-year period on the Ionian Islands of Western Greece. State-of-the-art object-oriented image analysis on freely available remote sensing data such as Landsat images was employed achieving final mapping products with high spatial and thematic accuracy (over than 85%), and a transferable classification scheme. The main drivers of environmental change are tourism and associated activities, wildfires and livestock breeding which act in different ways and intensities within and between the islands. The repopulation of those islands, after a period of significant depopulation from the 1940s to the 1980s, and the boom of tourism since the mid-1970s prevented further land abandonment and the recultivation of abandoned land which indicates that tourism and agriculture can be complementary rather than competing economic sectors. Despite the significant increase of tourism, a general trend was observed towards increasing cover of high-density vegetation formations, such as shrublands and forests. At the same time, wildfires, which are in some cases associated with livestock breeding, continue to be an important vegetation degradation factor preventing further ecosystem recovery on the study islands.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of present study is identification of land use/land cover change (LULC) taxonomy and dynamics transformation analysis with the help of Landsat satellite-derived optical data. The population increase is a primary factor to change in land use along with economic and spatial development of a city. Therefore, there is a positive impact of LULC that should be noticed as a water resource in the desert land. A historical approach along with analytical and empirical evaluation of LULC-driven factors has been applied to fulfill the objectives. The datasets utilized in the present study includes MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI TIRS sensors of Landsat, ranging from 1972 to 2014. The results depict that urban sprawl is increasing very unexpectedly while the land area is decreasing conversely. This trend could be a useful indicator to cope up with the desertification problem. However, there is such growth in urbanization augmented with sustainability issues.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of formaldehyde columns over Rawalpindi-Islamabad, Pakistan using MAX-DOAS and satellite observation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The oxidation pathway of non-methane hydrocarbons, originated from biogenic emissions and anthropogenic sources, culminates in the production of formaldehyde (HCHO) as an intermediate product. HCHO is used to manufacture domestic products and medical preservatives. It is found naturally, and in trace amounts is also produced during metabolic process of many organism. Pakistan is lacking of regular monitoring system on a larger scale to monitor the trace gases present in the atmosphere. For this study, the ground-based data and satellite-based observations of HCHO were gathered during the time period of years 2014-2015. By using car MAX-DOAS instrument several field campaigns were carried out to explore the spatial distribution of HCHO within twin cities of Pakistan. The DOAS technique was used to retrieve level-2 satellite data product from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) which was then compared with ground-based observations. HCHO column densities distributed spatio-temporally are described in this study. Within twin cities of Islamabad-Rawalpindi, the highest HCHO concentrations of 108 ppbv was found which exceeded the permissible limit of 83 ppbv from World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, the maximum VCDs were around 1.0 x 10(16) to 8.5 x 10(16) molecules/cm(2), higher than those in Pir-Sohawa valley, which were within the WHO limit, due to less population and vehicular emissions. Similarly, higher amounts of HCHO concentrations were found in areas with higher population densities, increased industrial activity, and along the major highways.

TI  - Robot-assisted inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy in primary yolk sac tumor of the vulva
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Primary yolk sac tumor (YST) of the vulva is extremely rare and only introduced in case reports [1]. For those, routine inguinal lymph node dissection (LND) in absence of palpable inguinal lymph node is questionable. To avoid complications of inguinal LND, such as lymphedema, inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be considered [2,3]. Since recent studies reported feasibility of robot-assisted inguinal lymphadenectomy [4], we showed the surgical procedures of robot-assisted inguinal SLNB.Video: A 33-year-old woman with vulvar YST was referred. Two 2 cm sized masses were founded in right vulvar area, and lymph node enlargement was detected in only right external iliac area on imaging studies. Thus, we planned robot-assisted surgical treatment including inguinal SLNB using the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) during surgery for the vulvar YST. First, we performed intradermal and peri-tumoral injection of 1 ml solution including 1.25 mg of ICG at each 2, 5, 7, and 10 o'clock position for the two tumors. Fifteen minutes later, three-arm robotic surgical system was installed on right thigh. Dissecting the subcutaneous space under the Scarpa's fascia towards the inguinal ligament, one fluorescent inguinal sentinel lymph node was identified and excised, which showed no tumor on pathologic examination (Fig. 1).Results: The procedure time was 70 minutes, and she underwent subsequent robot-assisted pelvic and para- aortic lymphadenectomy and wide local excision of the vulva.Conclusion: Robot-assisted inguinal SLNB is feasible. It may be an alternative to inguinal LND for avoiding relevant complications in patients with vulvar malignancy.

TI  - Changes in the Spawning Ground Environment of the Common Squid, Todarodes pacificus due to Climate Change.
T2  - Ocean and Polar Research
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the influence of climate change on the spawning ground area of the common squid, Todarodes pacificus. To estimate long term changes in the area of the spawning ground of the common squid, water temperature at 50 m deep that can be inferred from sea surface temperature (SST) based on both NOAA/AVHRR (1981.07-2002.12) and MODIS/AQUA (2003.01-2009.12) ocean color data was analyzed. In addition, five climate indices, Arctic Oscillation Index (AO), Siberian High Index (SH), Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALP), East Asia Winter Monsoon Index (EAWM) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) which are the main indicators of climate changes in the northwestern Pacific were used to study the relationship between the magnitude of the estimated spawning ground and climate indices. The area of the estimated spawning ground was highly correlated with the total catch of common squid throughout four decades. The area of the estimated spawning ground was negatively correlated with SH and EAWM. Especially, PDO was negatively correlated with the area of the spawning ground in the northwestern Pacific (r = -0.39) and in the southern part of the East Sea (r = -0.38). There was a positive relationship between the AO and the area of the spawning ground in the northwestern Pacific (r = 0.46) as well as in the southern part of the East Sea (r = 0.32). Temporally, the area of the winter spawning ground in the southern part of the East Sea in the 1980s was smaller than those areas in the 1990s and 2000s, because the area was disconnected with the western coastal spawning ground of Japan in the 1980s, while the area had been made wider and more continuous from the Korea strait to the western coastal water of Honshu in the 1990s and 2000s.

TI  - Integration of Terrestrial and Drone-Borne Hyperspectral and Photogrammetric Sensing Methods for Exploration Mapping and Mining Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping lithology and geological structures accurately remains a challenge in difficult terrain or in active mining areas. We demonstrate that the integration of terrestrial and drone-borne multi-sensor remote sensing techniques significantly improves the reliability, safety, and efficiency of geological activities during exploration and mining monitoring. We describe an integrated workflow to produce a geometrically and spectrally accurate combination of a Structure-from-Motion Multi-View Stereo point cloud and hyperspectral data cubes in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR), as well as long-wave infrared (LWIR) ranges acquired by terrestrial and drone-borne imaging sensors. Vertical outcrops in a quarry in the Freiberg mining district, Saxony (Germany), featuring sulfide-rich hydrothermal zones in a granitoid host, are used to showcase the versatility of our approach. The image data are processed using spectroscopic and machine learning algorithms to generate meaningful 2.5D (i.e., surface) maps that are available to geologists on the ground just shortly after data acquisition. We validate the remote sensing data with thin section analysis and laboratory X-ray diffraction, as well as point spectroscopic data. The combination of ground- and drone-based photogrammetric and hyperspectral VNIR, SWIR, and LWIR imaging allows for safer and more efficient ground surveys, as well as a better, statistically sound sampling strategy for further structural, geochemical, and petrological investigations.

TI  - Managing Diversity To Eliminate Disparities: A Framework For Health
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - By 2044 there will be no single racial or ethnic majority group in the US, according to the Census Bureau. California experienced this shift in 2000, making the state a bellwether in its attempts to bring health equity to a highly diverse population. We used data from the California Health Interview Survey and the California Regional Health Care Cost and Quality Atlas to examine health, health care access, and quality of care by race/ethnicity, payer, and region. Evaluating insurance coverage and diabetes as a sentinel condition, we found that wealthy regions exhibited the widest disparities-with advantages among non-Latino whites and people with commercial coverage. Disparities were narrowest in rural and agricultural regions, but health and quality of care were lower overall in those regions. State initiatives to address health equity include requiring health plans to reduce disparities by language and race/ethnicity and investing carbon cap-and-trade revenues in disadvantaged communities. Prominent advocacy, community engagement, the systematic use of data, local flexibility, and mechanisms for stronger accountability are driving these initiatives. Evidence has yet to emerge on how effective these policies will be in reducing health disparities in the state.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of minimally invasive treatment for early gastric cancer in patients beyond the indications of endoscopic submucosal dissection
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection (ESN) and endoscopic full-thickness gastric resection with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection (Hybrid-natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, Hybrid-NOTES) are minimally invasive treatment options for early gastric cancer (EGC) beyond the indications of ESD. This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of ESN and Hybrid-NOTES.Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who had undergone ESN or Hybrid-NOTES for EGC from January 2009 to March 2013. A total of 48 patients, including 21 undergoing ESN and 27 undergoing Hybrid-NOTES, were enrolled. All patients had cancer stage T1N0M0, EGC less than 5 cm in size, and suspected submucosal invasion according to imaging or biopsy-proven diffuse-type histology.Results In ESN and Hybrid-NOTES, the curative resection rates were 76.5% and 90.9% of patients, respectively. In the ESN group, 5 patients underwent an additional gastrectomy (1 for lymph node metastasis (LNM), 3 for surgical complications, and 1 for noncurative resection). In the Hybrid-NOTES group, 6 patients underwent additional gastrectomy, (1 for LNM, 3 for surgical complications, and 2 for noncurative resection). Of the 37 patients who were followed up in the long-term (a median follow-up of 59.8 months), one was found to have liver metastasis after ESN and received palliative chemotherapy.Conclusions ESN and Hybrid-NOTES have shown favorable long-term outcomes despite their technical limitations. These methods may be utilized as a bridge between ESD and gastrectomy in cases of EGC with a high risk of LNM beyond the ESD indications.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based and Participatory Analysis of Forests, Agricultural Land Dynamics, and Potential Land Conservation Measures in Kloto District (Togo, West Africa)
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates proximate drivers of cropland and forest degradation in the Kloto district (Togo, West Africa) as a way of exploring integrated sustainable landscape approaches with respect to socioeconomic and environmental needs and requirements. Net change analysis of major cash and food crops based on Landsat data from three time steps (1985-2002, 2002-2017, and 1985-2017) and quantitative analysis from participatory survey data with farmers and landowners are used. The study underlines poor agricultural systems and cassava farming as major factors contributing to the alarming forest losses between 1985 and 2017. A significant net loss in forest cover of 23.6% and areas under maize and cocoa agroforestry farming of 12.99% and 10.1% between 1985 and 2017, respectively, was noted. These significant losses are due to intensive cassava cropping (38.78%) and settlement expansion (7.87%). Meanwhile, the loss of forest cover between 2002 and 2017 was marginal (8.36%) compared to the period 1985-2002, which had a considerable loss of 15.24%. Based on participatory surveys, the majority of agricultural lands are threatened by erosion or physical deterioration (67.5%), land degradation or salt deposits and loss of micro/macro fauna and flora (56.7%), declines in soil fertility (32.5%) and soil water holding capacity (11.7%), and changes in soil texture (3.3%). Most farmers adhere to the proposed climate smart practices, with an emphasis on cost-effective drip irrigation systems (45.83%), soil mulching (35%), and the adoption of drought-resilient varieties (29.17%) to anticipate adverse spells. We conclude that low adoption of improved soil conservation, integrated water management, and harvesting systems and the use of less productive and adaptive cultivars entail extreme degradation of cropland and a decline in crop productivity. Consequently, farmers are forced to clear more forest in search of stable and healthy soil to meet their food demands and improve their livelihood. Capacity building on integrated pathways of soil and land management practices is therefore needed to ensure sustainable and viable socio-ecological systems at a local scale.

TI  - Toward understanding the contribution of waterbodies to the methane emissions of a permafrost landscape on a regional scaleA case study from the Mackenzie Delta, Canada
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterbodies in the arctic permafrost zone are considered a major source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in addition to CH4 emissions from arctic wetlands. However, the spatio-temporal variability of CH4 fluxes from waterbodies complicates spatial extrapolation of CH4 measurements from single waterbodies. Therefore, their contribution to the CH4 budget of the arctic permafrost zone is not yet well understood. Using the example of two study areas of 1,000km(2) each in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada, we approach this issue (i) by analyzing correlations on the landscape scale between numerous waterbodies and CH4 fluxes and (ii) by analyzing the influence of the spatial resolution of CH4 flux data on the detected relationships. A CH4 flux map with a resolution of 100m was derived from two aircraft eddy-covariance campaigns in the summers of 2012 and 2013. We combined the CH4 flux map with high spatial resolution (2.5m) waterbody maps from the Permafrost Region Pond and Lake Database and classified the waterbody depth based on Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data. Subsequently, we reduced the resolution of the CH4 flux map to analyze if different spatial resolutions of CH4 flux data affected the detectability of relationships between waterbody coverage, number, depth, or size and the CH4 flux. We did not find consistent correlations between waterbody characteristics and the CH4 flux in the two study areas across the different resolutions. Our results indicate that waterbodies in permafrost landscapes, even if they seem to be emission hot spots on an individual basis or contain zones of above average emissions, do currently not necessarily translate into significant CH4 emission hot spots on a regional scale, but their role might change in a warmer climate.

TI  - Mathematical Modeling of Ice Dynamics as a Decision Support Tool in River Engineering
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of winter flooding is a complicated task since it is affected by many meteorological and hydraulic factors. Typically, information on river ice conditions is based on historical observations, which are usually incomplete. Recently, data have been supplemented by information extracted from satellite images. All the above mentioned factors provide a good background of the characteristics of ice processes, but are not sufficient for a detailed analysis of river ice, which is highly dynamic and has a local extent. The main aim of this paper is to show the possibility of the prediction of ice jams in a river using a mathematical model. The case of the Odra River was used here. Within the Lower and Middle Odra River, the most significant flood risk, in winter conditions, is posed by ice jams created when movable ice is stopped by existing obstacles such as shallow areas in the riverbed, the narrowing of the riverbed, and other obstacles caused as a result of sudden changes of the river current, backwater from sea waters, and north winds, which contribute to the creation of ice jams. This in turn causes the damming of water and flooding of adjacent areas. The DynaRICE model was implemented at two locations along the Odra River, previously selected as ice-prone areas. Also, a thermal simulation of ice cover formation on Lake Dbie was shown with variable discharge. The results of numerical simulations showed a high risk of ice jamming on the Odra River, created within one day of ice moving downstream. The prediction of the place and timing, as well as the extent, of the ice jam is impossible without the application of a robust mathematical model.

TI  - Reconstructing hierarchy as the key international relations concept and its implications for the study of Japanese national identity
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last few decades, the discipline of international relations has been littered with anarchy. Since Waltz's Theory of International Politics, it has been assumed that states are formally equal sovereign unitary actors operating in an anarchic world system and that their identities and interests are defined by the very existence of anarchy. This article shatters this conception. It offers a 'hierarchical worldview' in order to illustrate that the very concepts of state, sovereignty, and anarchy are discursive creations inherently tied to the practice of hierarchy. I use a case study of Japanese national identity to illustrate this practice. The narratives of Japan as an autonomous and sovereign state were inextricably linked to Japan's hierarchical relationship toward Asia and the West (pre-war) and the USA (post-war). Japan's sovereignty and autonomy were then formulated within the practice of hierarchy.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics and livelihoods transformation in Wa, Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how indigenous peri-urban households in Wa, one of the fastest growing towns in Ghana are adapting to the effects of physical transformation of their environment. By analysing Landsat satellite images and using social research methods, the paper discusses the nature and extent of urban growth, its impact on periurban livelihoods, and the coping strategies of peri-urban households. Findings show that urban land in Wa increased by 5.73 times-from 5.75 km(2) in 1986 to 32.93 km(2) in 2016 with an annual growth rate of 5.9%. This growth led to the conversion of agricultural lands into residential and other uses. As a result, many indigenous peri-urban households are abandoning agriculture in search for urban-based employment as a safety net. The study recommends partnership between local government and landowners to identify and protect high potential agricultural lands in Wa; modernisation of the land governance and management processes in view of the loss of cultural and spiritual values associated with land; prioritisation of physical and spatial planning at the district level; and equipping indigenous peri-urban households with skills to assist them create sustainable livelihoods to compensate for the loss of their agriculture lands.

TI  - Characterization of Soil Types and Subtypes in N-Dimensional Space of Multitemporal (Empirical) Soil Line
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A classical soil line (SL) in the RED-NIR spectral space is specified by two coefficients "a" and "b." In this form, it does not characterize soil types and subtypes. A multitemporal soil line (MSL) represents the major axis of the ellipse describing all possible pairs of RED-NIR values characterizing a bare soil surface for a given pixel of remote sensing images. The MSL in the RED-NIR spectral space is specified by several (N) coefficients. The resulting N-dimensional space of MSL coefficients makes it possible to give unique characteristics for each type and subtype of soils in the following zonal soil sequence: soddy-podzolic soils, light gray forest soils, gray forest soils, dark gray forest soils, podzolized chernozems, and leached chernozems. The analysis of variance allows us to state that the soils of this sequence significantly differ from one another in the characteristic sets of MSL coefficients. In other words, these coefficients characterize soil types and subtypes, and the MSL can be considered an empirical soil line (ESL) of the given type and subtype of soil. A classical SL is an integrity of ESLs of different soils within the given scene of remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to improve the economic situation of shepherds in the Western Eifel region by searching and characterising new pastures. Within the project the latest scientific methods of "artificial intelligence", such as machine learning, were combined with remote sensing data and geodata-based techniques. An artificial system learns to recognize patterns in training data and can transfer them to unknown data. Machine learning was used to classify grassland sites and similar types of use in terms of their efficiency. For grazing, particularly valuable extensive locations could be detected and evaluated with high resolution. In addition, GIS-based simulations were carried out to improve sheep trail conditions. The objectives were to optimise the logistics of existing sheep trails, search for alternative routes and the identification of routes to new pastures.

TI  - Predicting the cover and richness of intertidal macroalgae in remote areas: a case study in the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica is an iconic region for scientific explorations as it is remote and a critical component of the global climate system. Recent climate change causes a dramatic retreat of ice in Antarctica with associated impacts to its coastal ecosystem. These anthropogenic impacts have a potential to increase habitat availability for Antarctic intertidal assemblages. Assessing the extent and ecological consequences of these changes requires us to develop accurate biotic baselines and quantitative predictive tools. In this study, we demonstrated that satellite-based remote sensing, when used jointly with in situ ground-truthing and machine learning algorithms, provides a powerful tool to predict the cover and richness of intertidal macroalgae. The salient finding was that the Sentinel-based remote sensing described a significant proportion of variability in the cover and richness of Antarctic macroalgae. The highest performing models were for macroalgal richness and the cover of green algae as opposed to the model of brown and red algal cover. When expanding the geographical range of the ground-truthing, even involving only a few sample points, it becomes possible to potentially map other Antarctic intertidal macroalgal habitats and monitor their dynamics. This is a significant milestone as logistical constraints are an integral part of the Antarctic expeditions. The method has also a potential in other remote coastal areas where extensive in situ mapping is not feasible.

TI  - Surveillance of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in Southern Iowa, 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mosquito fauna of Iowa has been extensively investigated over several decades, providing a wealth of information regarding species distributions, relative abundance, temporal activity patterns, and identifying vectors of medical importance. However, these investigations have had unequal coverage, leaving the mosquito fauna in some parts of the state, including southern Iowa, largely uncharacterized. With the heightened public health threat of Zika virus in the summer of 2016, greater emphasis was placed on surveying for two potential Zika virus vectors: Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus). Southern Iowa became an area of interest due to the range of Ae. Albopictus, potentially extending into this part of the state. Employing CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps and BG-Sentinel traps, our targeted trapping efforts in southern Iowa did not yield either Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti. However, the geographical expansion of our trapping efforts did lend valuable insights into the mosquito fauna of southern Iowa. Mosquito species such as Aedes atropalpus (Coquillett), Culex erraticus (Dyar and Knab), and several Psorophora species once presumed rare or uncommon in the state were found to be more prevalent in this ecologically diverse region, augmenting our understanding of mosquito distributions in the state. Moreover, these surveillance efforts established baseline data for continued monitoring of the potential introduction and spread of invasive mosquito species in Iowa as part of an integrated mosquito management program

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The turn of the XIX-XX centuries in the history of Russian culture is a discontinuous transitional era which is first and foremost characterized according to G. Florovsky, a contemporary, by the "pass of consciousness". The culture of this period was not unified or holistic; it reached the peaks in the phenomenon of the spiritual (cultural) Renaissance. The extraordinary creativity in different areas of culture and the intense interpenetration of the areas became a peculiarity of the epoch. The center of the cultural creativity was philosophy distinguished by its close connection with religion and interaction with the world of art.The culture of the transitional era was pervaded by the search for a holistic worldview and a synthetic world outlook. The integrating principle for the culture of the transitional era was the doctrine of V.Soloviev which can be regarded as an expression of the transitional consciousness of the epoch. It was a kind of "program of thought" for the followers, both in the field of philosophical reflection and in the artistic sphere. At the heart of Solovyov's doctrine of unity is the idea of synthesis, which is understood as a methodological principle and as a principle of the worldview - the search for universal grounds for the creative transformation of the world overcoming destructive principles.Synthesis of the arts, the combination of science and religion, bridging the gap between heaven and earth, the transformation of the world - this whole "program" of the transitional era's creators could only arise in the specific context of the world-feeling, the context of the transitional, "eve" culture. However, synthesis claimed by Solovyov generated a number of contradictions. The pursuit of universal synthesis capable of solving all social, cultural, philosophical, religious and aesthetic problems reflected the dream of the era, but this aspiration was utopian. Solovyov's idea of synthesis professed by religious philosophy, by the supporters of the " new religious consciousness" and by the aesthetics of symbolism did not become a reality. Bringing the synthesis to life was problematic due to the fact that it was seen as an immense and all-inclusive one, connecting the unconnected things.The aspiration to synthesis and the real conformity of culture to the principle of syncretism constitute the fundamental contradiction of the "eve" epoch. The "plurality" did not become a unity, and this situation contained the danger of separation-disintegration. The great synthesis turned out to be a utopia. The cultural creation of the epoch remained within the boundaries of syncretism; the culture appeared as a "crossroads of contradictions" in the heterogeneity and discrepancy of the individual elements, which corresponded to the transitional, "discontinuous" period.

TI  - Childhood exposure to green space - A novel risk-decreasing mechanism for schizophrenia?
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Schizophrenia risk has been linked to urbanization, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Green space is hypothesized to positively influence mental health and might mediate risk of schizophrenia by mitigating noise and particle pollution exposure, stress relief, or other unknown mechanisms. The objectives for this study were to determine if green space are associated with schizophrenia risk, and if different measures of green space associate differently with risk. We used satellite data from the Landsat program to quantify green space in a new data set for Denmark at 30 x 30 m resolution for the years 1985-2013. The effect of green space at different ages and within different distances from each person's place of residence on schizophrenia risk was estimated using Cox regression on a very large longitudinal population-based sample of the Danish population (943,027 persons). Living at the lowest amount of green space was associated with a 1.52-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia compared to persons living at the highest level of green space. This association remained after adjusting for known risk factors for schizophrenia: urbanization, age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The strongest protective association was observed during the earliest childhood years and closest to place of residence. This is the first nationwide population-based study to demonstrate a protective association between green space during childhood and schizophrenia risk; suggesting limited green space as a novel environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. This study supports findings from other studies highlighting positive effects of exposure to natural environments for human health. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - DARWIN'S EVOLUTIONARY THEORY AS REFLECTED IN THE RUSSIAN CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL PRESS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY
T2  - VESTNIK MOSKOVSKOGO UNIVERSITETA. SERIYA 10. ZHURNALISTIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the polemic about Darwinism in the Russian press of the second half of the 19th century. This controversy made the problems of natural science part of the worldview and political debate between liberals and conservatives. In the 1880s, two journals, the liberal Russkaya Mysl and the conservative Russkiy Vesinik, discussed N. Ya. Danilevsky's book "Darwinism: the Critical Analysis". For the authors of the former publication (K A. Timiryazev, N. G. Chernyshevsky), the affirmation of the natural origin of the Earth and the human being was the basis for the struggle against clericalism. But some of them, the followers of socialist views, denied the struggle for existence as a factor in evolution, believing that this factor was not competition but cooperation. In Russkiy Vestnik, the conservatives (N. N. Strakhov) criticized Darwinism, defending the idea of creationism and development of nature in accordance with the divine plan of the Creator. The analysis of this polemic, as compared with up-to-date realities, makes it possible to assert that the involvement of scientific popularization in political discourse is one of the characteristic features of the Russian press throughout its existence.

TI  - Trends in Axillary Surgery
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node surgery in breast cancer patients has been subject to dramatic changes over the past 20 years. Originally, lymph nodes were removed in order to resect potentially involved tissue. When the axillary lymph node status was identified as the most important prognostic parameter to guide adjuvant treatment decisions, axillary surgery became a diagnostic procedure in patients with clinically uninvolved nodes. Axillary dissection (AD) was the only option to determine lymph node status for decades. In the late 1990s, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced as a minimally invasive procedure that reliably determines the lymph node status by removal of very few nodes. Thus, the postsurgical morbidity was significantly reduced in many women. In recent years, even the therapeutic effect of AD was increasingly questioned in patients with clinically occult axillary disease. According to the results of randomized trials, many patients with positive lymph nodes can be spared AD. An important precondition is a clearly defined multimodal treatment concept. The surgical approach to the axilla will undergo further evolution in the future. Preliminary data show that in patients who undergo primary surgery, axillary staging can eventually be omitted entirely. Surgical approaches in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are currently intensively debated and investigated in clinical trials. The feasibility, reproducibility and safety of SLNB after NACT is discussed. Further options to reduce the extent of axillary surgery by the effect of NACT are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

TI  - Review of contemporary literature on burst assembling and routing strategies in OBS networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPTICS-INDIA
M3  - Review
AB  - In the course of recent years, a lot of research has been directed in the ranges of optical packet switching and optical burst switching (OBS). This examination has been inspired by the requirement for procedures that are equipped for supporting the requesting prerequisites of developing dynamic high-transfer speed applications in an adaptable and effective way. In this paper we have undertaken the critical and mandatory factors of OBS such as (1) assembling the bursts, (2) routing (3) resource (such as transmission channels) scheduling and (4) burst segmenting for optimal transmission). Consequently the current research is focusing on these both of dissimilar variables of OBS and putting endeavors to contribute ideal ways to assemble, route, schedule or segment. This manuscript reviewed the nomenclature of the Optical Burst Switching Networks where fundamental ideas are examined and the aim is to identify the difficulties and strengths for optical packet and burst switching systems. This audit has been inspired by the requirement for methods that are equipped for supporting the future data transmission necessity of cutting edge applications and administrations of Internet Protocol systems. The authors have examined the fundamental ideas of OBS worldview and laid out issues identified with OBS systems. The future challenges that are still limiting the performance of the present contributions are told subsequently evincing the scope for future research.

TI  - Process improvement methodologies uncover unexpected gaps in stroke care
T2  - ACTA RADIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke requires timed and coordinated effort across multiple clinical teams.Purpose: To analyze the frequency and temporal distribution of emergent stroke evaluations (ESEs) to identify potential contributory workflow factors that may delay the initiation and subsequent evaluation of emergency department stroke patients.Material and Methods: A total of 719 sentinel ESEs with concurrent neuroimaging were identified over a 22-month retrospective time period. Frequency data were tabulated and odds ratios calculated.Results: Of all ESEs, 5% occur between 01:00 and 07:00. ESEs were most frequent during the late morning and early afternoon hours (10:00-14:00). Unexpectedly, there was a statistically significant decline in the frequency of ESEs that occur at the 14:00 time point.Conclusion: Temporal analysis of ESEs in the emergency department allowed us to identify an unexpected decrease in ESEs and through process improvement methodologies (Lean and Six Sigma) and identify potential workflow elements contributing to this observation.

TI  - Forest cover and disturbance changes, and their driving forces: A case study in the Ore Mountains, Czechia, heavily affected by anthropogenic acidic pollution in the second half of the 20th century
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the assessment of forest cover and disturbance changes in the heavily polluted Ore Mountains (Czechia, Central Europe) during the second half of the 20th century and onward. It analyzes the driving forces of forest changes with reference to environmental, societal and political development in the region. Anthropogenic air pollution, prevalently SO2 from adjacent coal-burning industry, caused extensive forest decline, especially between the 1970s and 1980s. The most affected tree species was the main economical timber species, Norway spruce, which proved to be remarkably pollution-sensitive. Weused Landsat time series, and a combination of an integrated forest Z-score and Disturbance Index (DI), to analyze the forest cover change and disturbance development during 1985-2016. In 1994, the forest cover reached its minimum there. The breakdown of communism in the 1990s implied fulfilling EU pollution standards via air protection regulations, investment in power plant desulphurization, and forest management measures, which were the main drivers of the forest recovery. The forest recovery continued till about 2005; however, fluctuations in forest cover and DI have continued during the last decade. Apparently, forests weakened by old loads are prone to new stress factors. Landsat time series represent a powerful data source to monitor the impact of these drivers on forests on a regional scale. Originally, the severely damaged eastern part with heavier acidic load and large forest decline recovered faster after remarkable lowering of air pollution loads compared to the western part, with lower loads and less damaged forests. However, the interactions of persisting driving forces (soil acidification, adverse meteorological events, climate change factors, air pollution, tree species composition and physiological state, pest outbreaks) still threaten the forests there, which remain moderately damaged in both parts of the Ore Mountains. This may lead to unpredictable forest development independently of societal and political driving forces.

TI  - THE GRAPE REMOTE SENSING ATMOSPHERIC PROFILE AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION EXPERIMENT
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Particularly in light of California's recent multiyear drought, there is a critical need for accurate and timely evapotranspiration (ET) and crop stress information to ensure long-term sustainability of high-value crops. Providing this information requires the development of tools applicable across the continuum from subfield scales to improve water management within individual fields up to watershed and regional scales to assess water resources at county and state levels. High-value perennial crops (vineyards and orchards) are major water users, and growers will need better tools to improve water-use efficiency to remain economically viable and sustainable during periods of prolonged drought. To develop these tools, government, university, and industry partners are evaluating a multiscale remote sensing-based modeling system for application over vineyards. During the 2013-17 growing seasons, the Grape Remote Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) project has collected micrometeorological and biophysical data within adjacent pinot noir vineyards in the Central Valley of California. Additionally, each year ground, airborne, and satellite remote sensing data were collected during intensive observation periods (IOPs) representing different vine phenological stages. An overview of the measurements and some initial results regarding the impact of vine canopy architecture on modeling ET and plant stress are presented here. Refinements to the ET modeling system based on GRAPEX are being implemented initially at the field scale for validation and then will be integrated into the regional modeling toolkit for large area assessment.

TI  - Turning an Axe on Its Head
T2  - WEST 86TH-A JOURNAL OF DECORATIVE ARTS DESIGN HISTORY AND MATERIAL CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A dark-green Neolithic axe head housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosts later, tenth-century carvings-on one side, the Crucifixion, and on the other, the chariot of Elijah. These later incisions reconfigure the object into one that expresses concepts belonging to a Christian worldview, with a specific focus on the moment of ascension and on life after death. Exegetical writings by early Church Fathers can clarify the connections between the two sides of the stone, especially drawing attention to the importance of discipleship. The inverse inscriptions on the object create a unique relationship with the owner because the inscriptions are only correctly viewed from the point of view of the wearer. The intimate relationship between owner and object heightens the Christian meanings while preserving resonances of its past role as an amulet, a "thunderstone," in its Neolithic existence.

TI  - Analyzing the December 2013 Metaponto Plain (Southern Italy) Flood Event by Integrating Optical Sensors Satellite Data
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and continuous information about flood dynamics are fundamental to ensure an effective implementation of the relief and rescue operations. Satellite data provided by optical sensors onboard meteorological satellites could have great potential in this framework, offering an adequate trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. The latest would benefit from the integration of observations coming from different satellite systems, also helping to increase the probability of finding cloud free images over the investigated region. The Robust Satellite Techniques for detecting flooded areas (RST-FLOOD) is a sensor-independent multi-temporal approach aimed at detecting flooded areas which has already been applied with good results on different polar orbiting optical sensors. In this work, it has been implemented on both the 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the 375 m Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The flooding event affecting the Basilicata and Puglia regions (southern Italy) in December 2013 has been selected as a test case. The achieved results confirm the RST-FLOOD potential in reliably detecting, in case of small basins, flooded areas regardless of the sensor used. Flooded areas have indeed been detected with similar performance by the two sensors, allowing for their continuous and near-real time monitoring.

TI  - Long-term eruptive trends from space-based thermal and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions: a comparative analysis of Stromboli, Batu Tara and Tinakula volcanoes
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Batu Tara (Indonesia) and Tinakula (Solomon Island) are two poorly known volcanoes with morphologies and short-term eruptive activity similar to Stromboli (Italy). However, quantitative information about their long-term eruptive behaviour is limited, making the comparisons with Stromboli descriptive and based on short periods of observations. Here, we use over a decade of satellite data to measure and compare the radiant flux (2000-2017) and the SO2 mass (2004-2017) of all three volcanoes. The combined analysis of volcanic radiant power (from MODIS data) and SO2 flux (from OMI data) reveals different long-term eruptive trends and contrasting ratios of SO2/VRP. These data indicate that the eruptive mechanisms operating at each volcano are quite different. The persistent open-vent activity of Stromboli volcano is episodically interrupted by flank eruptions that drain degassed magma stored in the very shallow portion of the central conduit. In contrast, a long-lasting exponential decay of both VRP and SO2 flux observed at Batu Tara is consistent with the eruption of undegassed magma from a deep, closed magma chamber, whilst Tinakula displays multiple year-long eruptive phases, characterised by evolving gas/thermal ratios and an eruptive intensity increasing with time. Magma budget calculations for the latter volcano are consistent with eruption from a volatile-zoned magma chamber, coupled with periods of gas/magma accumulations at depth. Our results suggest that the combined analysis of satellite thermal/gas data provides a valuable tool for decrypting the long-term volcanic dynamics that could remain hidden over shorter timescales.

AB  - Modifications of a nonparametric pattern recognition algorithm corresponding to the maximum likelihood criterion with additional decision functions are considered. The synthesis of the proposed algorithms is based on the analysis of the ratios of the estimates of the probability density distributions of random variables in classes and their functionals with input thresholds. The choice of the thresholds is determined by specific features of the classification problem. The results obtained are applied for assessing the states of forest tracts on the basis of remote sensing data.

TI  - Exploring the Inclusion of Small Regenerating Trees to Improve Above-Ground Forest Biomass Estimation Using Geospatial Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the contribution of understory components to the total above ground biomass (AGB) has to date received very little attention because most prior biomass estimation studies have ignored small regenerating trees beneath the main canopy with the assumption that their contribution to biomass is generally negligible. Only a few biomass studies have emphasized a considerable contribution to biomass of understory components in forest ecosystems. However, this study of native, tropical, deciduous forest biomass in the Central Highlands of Vietnam was able to explore the contribution of small regenerating trees to total biomass by exploiting a large field inventory of hundreds to thousands of individually-counted small regenerating trees per hectare. Thus, this study investigated the influence of small regenerating tree biomass on models of the relationship between total AGB and remote sensing data. These analyses were trained with and without topographic variables derived from ASTER-GDEM. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of small regenerating understory trees (R-2 = 0.42, NRMSE or %RMSE = 30.5%) provides a quantifiable improvement in total estimated AGB compared to using only large woody canopy trees (R-2 = 0.21, NRMSE or %RMSE = 36.6%) when correlating field-based biomass measurements with optical image-derived variables. All analyses show that the inclusion of terrain factors made an important contribution to biomass modeling. This study suggests that for young, open forests where there are many small regenerating trees, the contribution of understory biomass should be taken into consideration to improve total AGB estimation.

TI  - A Reconsideration of the Madaba Map
T2  - GESTA-INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF MEDIEVAL ART
M3  - Article
AB  - The mosaic map of Madaba, Jordan, has been attracting visitors and puzzling art historians since it was uncovered in the 1890s. The largest extant fragment of the map encompasses modern Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and parts of Egypt. It depicts rivers, mountains and deserts, villages and cities, and has more than 150 inscriptions that describe them. Previous analyses of the mosaic have been based on two assumptions: that it was designed for an early Byzantine church and that this supposed church was roughly similar in form to the nineteenth-century church that now houses the mosaic. On the basis of this presumed ecclesiastical context, the map has been interpreted either as a pilgrimage guide or as a unique expression of a Christian worldview, displaying all the sacred sites of the Holy Land with Jerusalem at the center. The mosaic does not fit well into a church setting, however, either physically or in terms of its content. It contains little overtly Christian imagery, and it does not resemble other Jordanian church floors in its composition, layout, choice of motifs, or use of inscriptions. In addition, it appears to have been designed for a hall with a north-south axis, not an east-west one. After laying out the case against an original church context, I argue that the map was instead designed for a secular hall, most likely one used for legal hearings, and then discuss some new ways of interpreting the architectural motifs on the map in light of this reading.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the seasonal, regional distribution of mosquito vectors related with disease vectors in the Jeju. From March to November, sample were collected from 11 points in four environmentally different sites in Jeju Island. Samples were collected twice a month using a black-light trap and a BG sentinel trap. Overall, five genera and seven species types of 6,042 female mosquitos were collected. Among the collected mosquitos, 4,159 (68.8%) and 1,348 (24.4%) were Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus, respectively, making them the dominant species. Additionally, collection using the black light trap produced 72.8 entities per trap in Jungang-dong service center in the center of the city, which was the highest value, while the lowest amount of 1.4 per trap was recovered from the airport. When the BG sentinel trap was used, the largest recovery was observed in the port, where there were 71.7 entities per trap, while the lowest amount of 28.3 entities per trap was recovered at Gealmae Eco Park. The overall number of mosquitoes collected started to increase from May, and reached the largest value of 1,156 (19.1%) in August. Trapped mosquitoes are created 364 pools of up to 50 grains per pool, by season, by environmental, and by species. When the pools were used, no flaviviral infection was observed upon real time RT-PCR.

TI  - How Long should the MISR Record Be when Evaluating Aerosol Optical Depth Climatology in Climate Models?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used the nearly continuous 17-year observation record from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra Earth Observing System satellite to determine which temporal subsets are long enough to define statistically stable speciated aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatologies (i.e., AOD by particle types) for purposes of climate model evaluation. A random subsampling of seasonally averaged total and speciated AOD retrievals was performed to quantitatively assess the statistical stability in the climatology, represented by the minimum record length required for the standard deviation of the subsampled mean AODs to be less than a certain threshold. Our results indicate that the multi-year mean speciated AOD from MISR is stable on a global scale; however, there is substantial regional variability in the assessed stability. This implies that in some regions, even 17 years may not provide a long enough sample to define regional mean total and speciated AOD climatologies. We further investigated the agreement between the statistical stability of total AOD retrievals from MISR and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), also on the NASA Terra satellite. The difference in the minimum record lengths between MISR and MODIS climatologies of total AOD is less than three years for most of the globe, with the exception of certain regions. Finally, we compared the seasonal cycles in the MISR total and speciated AODs with those simulated by three global chemistry transport models in the regions of climatologically stable speciated AODs. We found that only one model reproduced the observed seasonal cycles of the total and non-absorbing AODs over East China, but the seasonal cycles in total and dust AODs in all models are similar to those from MISR in Western Africa. This work provides a new method for considering the statistical stability of satellite-derived climatologies and illustrates the value of MISR's speciated AOD data record for evaluating aerosols in global models.

TI  - BULC-U: Sharpening Resolution and Improving Accuracy of Land-Use/Land-Cover Classifications in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift, in which approaches interpreting one or two images are giving way to a wide array of data-rich applications. These include assessing global forest loss, tracking water resources across Earth's surface, determining disturbance frequency across decades, and many more. These advances have been greatly facilitated by Google Earth Engine, which provides both image access and a platform for advanced analysis techniques. Within the realm of land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications, Earth Engine provides the ability to create new classifications and to access major existing data sets that have already been created, particularly at global extents. By overlaying global LULC classifications-the 300-m GlobCover 2009 LULC data set for example-with sharper images like those from Landsat, one can see the promise and limits of these global data sets and platforms to fuse them. Despite the promise in a global classification covering all of the terrestrial surface, GlobCover 2009 may be too coarse for some applications. We asked whether the LULC labeling provided by GlobCover 2009 could be combined with the spatial granularity of the Landsat platform to produce a hybrid classification having the best features of both resources with high accuracy. Here we apply an improvement of the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm that fused unsupervised Landsat classifications to GlobCover 2009, sharpening the result from a 300-m to a 30-m classification. Working with four clear categories in Mato Grosso, Brazil, we refined the resolution of the LULC classification by an order of magnitude while improving the overall accuracy from 69.1 to 97.5%. This "BULC-U" mode, because it uses unsupervised classifications as inputs, demands less region-specific knowledge from analysts and may be significantly easier for non-specialists to use. This technique can provide new information to land managers and others interested in highly accurate classifications at finer scales.

TI  - Comparative Study between Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Axillary Dissection in Patients with One or Two Lymph Node Metastases
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard axillary surgery in early breast cancer. If the SLNB result is positive, subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a routine procedure. In 2011, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial revealed that ALND may not be necessary in early breast cancer with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes among Korean patients with one or two positive axillary lymph nodes in the final pathology who did and did not undergo ALND. Methods: A total of 131,717 patients from the Korea Breast Cancer Society registry database received breast cancer surgery from January 1995 to December 2014. Inclusion criteria were T stage 1 or 2, one or two positive lymph nodes, and having received breast-conserving surgery (BCS), whole breast radiation therapy, and no neoadjuvant therapy. We analyzed the differences in disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who received SLNB only and those who underwent SLNB+ALND. Results: A total 4,442 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 1,268 (28.6%) in the SLNB group and 3,174 (71.4%) in the SLNB+ALND group. There were no differences in DSS and OS between the two groups (p=0.378 and p=0.925, respectively). The number of patients who underwent SLNB alone for one or two positive lymph nodes increased continuously from 2004 to 2014. Conclusion: Korean patients with early breast cancer and 1 or 2 positive axillary lymph nodes who received BCS plus SLNB showed no significant difference in DSS and OS regardless of whether they received ALND. The findings of this retrospective study demonstrate that omitting ALND can be considered when treating selected patients with early breast cancer who have one or two positive lymph nodes.

The C6 MODIS aerosol algorithm, a substantially improved version of the collection 5 (C5) algorithm, uses an enhanced aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval process consisting of new surface reflection and aerosol models. This study reports on the estimation and validation of the two latest versions, the C5 and C6 MODIS aerosol products over the East Asian region covering 20 degrees N to 56 degrees N and 80 degrees E to 150 degrees E. This study also presents a comparative validation of the two versions (C5 and C6) of algorithms with different methods (Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) retrieval methods) from the Terra and Aqua platforms to make use of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for the years 2000-2016. Over the study region, the spatially averaged annual mean AOT retrieved from C6 AOT is about 0.035(5%) less than the C5 counterparts. The linear correlations between MODIS and AERONET AOT are R = 0.89 (slope = 0.86) for C5 and R = 0.95 (slope = 1.00) for C6. Moreover, the magnitude of the mean error in C6 AOT-the difference between MODIS AOT and AERONET AOT-is 40% less than that in C5 AOT.

TI  - Improved Chlorophyll-a Algorithm for the Satellite Ocean Color Data in the Northern Bering Sea and Southern Chukchi Sea
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bering and Chukchi seas are an important conduit to the Arctic Ocean and are reported to be one of the most productive regions in the world's oceans in terms of high primary productivity that sustains large numbers of fishes, marine mammals, and sea birds as well as benthic animals. Climate-induced changes in primary production and production at higher trophic levels also have been observed in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Satellite ocean color observations could enable the monitoring of relatively long term patterns in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations that would serve as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass. The performance of existing global and regional Chl-a algorithms for satellite ocean color data was investigated in the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea using in situ optical measurements from the Healy 2007 cruise. The model-derived Chl-a data using the previous Chl-a algorithms present striking uncertainties regarding Chl-a concentrations - for example, overestimation in lower Chl-a concentrations or systematic overestimation in the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea. Accordingly, a simple two band ratio (R-rs(443)/R-rs(555)) algorithm of Chl-a for the satellite ocean color data was devised for the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea. The MODIS-derived Chl-a data from July 2002 to December 2014 were produced using the new Chl-a algorithm to investigate the seasonal and interannual variations of Chl-a in the northern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi Sea. The seasonal distribution of Chl-a shows that the highest (spring bloom) Chl-a concentrations are in May and the lowest are in July in the overall area. Chl-a concentrations relatively decreased in June, particularly in the open ocean waters of the Bering Sea. The Chl-a concentrations start to increase again in August and become quite high in September. In October, Chl-a concentrations decreased in the western area of the Study area and the Alaskan coastal waters. Strong interannual variations are shown in Chl-a concentrations in all areas. There is a slightly increasing trend in Chl-a concentrations in the northern Bering Strait (SECS). This increasing trend may be related to recent increases in the extent and duration of open waters due to the early break up of sea ice and the late formation of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea.

TI  - Spatial prediction of urban landslide susceptibility based on topographic factors using boosted trees
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As global warming accelerates, abnormal weather events are occurring more frequently. In the twenty-first century in particular, hydrological disruption has increased as water flows have changed globally, causing the strength and frequency of hydrological disasters to increase. The damage caused by such disasters in urban areas can be extreme, and the creation of landslide susceptibility maps to predict and analyze the extent of future damage is an urgent necessity. Therefore, in this study, probabilistic and data mining approaches were utilized to identify landslide-susceptible areas using aerial photographs and geographic information systems. Areas where landslides have occurred were located through interpretation of aerial photographs and field survey data. In addition, topographic maps generated from aerial photographs were used to determine the values of topographic factors. A frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to examine the influences of topographic, soil and vegetation factors on the occurrence of landslides. A total of 23 variables that affect landslide frequency were selected through FR analysis, and a spatial database was constructed. Finally, a boosted tree model was applied to determine the correlations between various factors and landslide occurrence. Correlations among related input variables were calculated as predictor importance values, and sensitivity analysis was performed to quantitatively analyze the impact of each variable. The boosted tree model showed validation accuracies of 77.68 and 78.70% for the classification and regression algorithms using receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. Reliable accuracy can provide a scientific basis to urban municipalities for policy recommendations in the management of urban landslides.

TI  - CHANGES IN PAST GLOBAL SOLAR RADIATION BASED ON CLIMATE MODELS AND REMOTE SENSING IN THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to perform a temporal and spatial analysis of the changes in the past global solar radiation based on climate models and remote sensing data in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the baseline period (1961-1990). Data from two climate models - the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis and Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory, were used for the A1B intermediate scenario, data from Conventional Weather Stations and orbital sensor Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1). The results of the Spatial Dependence Degree indicate that the best model to represent the global solar radiation is CCCMA-Exponential dry 70.01 and rainy 0.21 respectively. It was possible to verify that in places where the areas are occupied by forests there was reduction of global solar radiation for both dry and rainy periods of approximately 13 MJ m(-2) d(-1). These results indicate that these forest areas can function as islands of freshness, while maintaining the thermal comfort balanced. It was concluded that the dry period had the highest values of solar radiation compared to the rainy (57%), which can be justified by the occurrence of fires in Rio de Janeiro.

TI  - Predicting the seasonal dynamics of bird communities along an urban-rural gradient using NDVI
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a strong and widely used proxy for bird species richness in urban environments. However, its potential to predict composition and seasonal dynamics of bird communities in urban areas remains unexplored. Our main objective was to analyze the power of NDVI to predict the seasonal dynamics of bird communities along urbanization gradients. Birds were surveyed in the breeding and non breeding seasons. Bird species richness was estimated using COMDYN, and bird community composition was summarized in two axes using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). For each of the breeding and non breeding seasons, bird richness and the NMDS axis scores were related to both the mean NDVI of the season and the annual seasonal variation of NDVI (mean NDVI of the breeding season - mean NDVI of the non-breeding seasons). Results showed that NDVI decreased towards the most urbanized areas, with the highest seasonal variation occurring in agricultural areas. Single-family houses surrounded by yards held a high NDVI in both seasons and the lowest seasonal variation. Bird richness increased at intermediate levels of NDVI and was negatively related to the seasonal variations of the NDVI. Seasonal variation in bird community composition increased with annual mean and seasonal variation of the NDVI predicting higher seasonal stability of assemblage composition in urban than in non-urban areas. The results suggest that urbanization alters ecosystem functioning by reducing seasonal dynamics and the amount of primary productivity, which in turn promotes seasonal homogenization of urban avifauna relative to non-urban areas.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The stratosphere-troposphere exchange is a key process due to its effect on the global budget of chemical composition. Previous studies have shown that large-scale process is the most important in the stratosphere-troposphere exchange, but recent studies have shown that meso- and micro-scale processes also have important contributions to the stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The satellite data from MLS (the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder) and OMI (the Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and the ERA-Interim (European centre for medium-range weather forecasts Re-Analysis Interim) reanalysis data, combined with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are used to test two convection events occurred on the western and eastern side of the cold vortex over northeastern China. The results show that the convection among the mesoscale cloud systems occurred on the eastern side of the cold vortex, would have a long lifetime, a small vertical scale, with the high static stability in the lower stratosphere. In contrast, the isolated convection occurred on the western side of the cold vortex, would have a short lifetime, a small horizontal scale, with low static stability in the lower stratosphere and overshooting the lapse-rate tropopause. Simulations show that the mesoscale cloud systems can transport the boundary layer tracer to the tropopause layer with mixing between the whole troposphere. In contrast, the isolated convection can directly transport the boundary layer tracer to the tropopause without mixing between the free troposphere.

TI  - Necroptosis in the periodontal homeostasis: Signals emanating from dying cells
T2  - ORAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Periodontal tissues are constantly exposed to microbial stimuli. The equilibrium between microbes and host defense system helps maintain the homeostasis in the periodontal microenvironment. Growth of pathogenic bacteria in dental biofilms may induce proinflammatory cytokine production to recruit sentinel cells, mainly neutrophils and monocytes into the gingival sulcus or the periodontal pocket. Moreover, dysbiosis with overgrowth of anaerobic pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, may induce death of both immune cells and host resident cells. Necroptosis is one newly characterized programmed cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase like (MLKL). With its release of death-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into extracellular environment, necroptosis may help transmit the danger signal and amplify the inflammatory responses. In this review, we present recent advances on how necroptosis influences bacterial infection progression and what a role necroptosis plays in maintaining the homeostasis in the periodontal niche. Until we fully decipher the signals emanated from dying cells, we cannot completely understand the mechanism of disease progression.

TI  - Using SAR-Derived Vegetation Descriptors in a Water Cloud Model to Improve Soil Moisture Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water cloud model (WCM) is a widely used radar backscatter model applied to SAR images to retrieve soil moisture over vegetated areas. The WCM needs vegetation descriptors to account for the impact of vegetation on SAR backscatter. The commonly used vegetation descriptors in WCM, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are sometimes difficult to obtain due to the constraints in data availability in in-situ measurements or weather dependency in optical remote sensing. To improve soil moisture retrieval, this study investigates the feasibility of using all-weather SAR derived vegetation descriptors in WCM. The in-situ data observed at an agricultural crop region south of Winnipeg in Canada, RapidEye optical images and dual-polarized Radarsat-2 SAR images acquired in growing season were used for WCM model calibration and test. Vegetation descriptors studied include HV polarization backscattering coefficient (sigma(degrees)(HV)) and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) derived from SAR imagery, and NDVI derived from optical imagery. The results show that sigma(degrees )(HV)achieved similar results as NDVI but slightly better than RVI, with a root mean square error of 0.069 m(3)/m(3) and a correlation coefficient of 0.59 between the retrieved and observed soil moisture. The use of sigma(HV)degrees can overcome the constraints of the commonly used vegetation descriptors and reduce additional data requirements (e.g., NDVI from optical sensors) in WCM, thus improving soil moisture retrieval and making WCM feasible for operational use.

TI  - Detecting and mapping annual newly-burned plots (NBP) of swiddening using historical Landsat data in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA) during 1988-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Swidden agriculture is by far the dominant land use system in the uplands of Southeast Asia (SEA), as well as other tropical regions, which plays an important role in the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) of United Nations. To our knowledge, the long-term inter-annual area of newly burned plots (NBP) of swidden agriculture in mainland Southeast Asia is still not available, let alone in the whole tropics. With the strengthening regional geo-economic cooperation in SEA, swidden agriculture has experienced and/or is still experiencing extensive and drastic transformations into other diverse market-oriented land use types since the 1990s. In this study, high-level surface reflectance products of Landsat 4/5/7/8 family sensors including Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquired in March, April and May of each year between 1988 and 2016 were firstly utilized to detect and monitor the extent and area of NBP of swidden agriculture with multiple thresholds of four commonly-used vegetation indices, namely the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), in combination with local phenological features of swiddening and topographical data. The results showed that: (1) an annual average of 6.08x10(4) km(2) of NBP of swidden agriculture, or 3.15% of the total land area of MSEA, were estimated in the past nearly three decades. (2) Annual NBP were primarily distributed in four major geomorphic units including the Central Range of Hills, Northern Mountainous Region, Western Myanmar Hills, and Annamite Chain. (3) A decadal average analysis indicated that the NBP of swidden agriculture opened year by year declined as a whole, especially after 2010, merely with an average of 5.23x10(4) km(2). (4) The top ten provincial administrative units in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, which consistently accounted for over 90% of the newly opened swiddens of each country, showed distinct fluctuations in using slash-and-burn practices in the last decades. The Landsat-based (30 m) reconstructed 29-year longitudinal updated maps (including extent and area) of the NBP of swidden agriculture may contribute to REDD and local livelihood related studies in Continental Southeast Asia. Our study further demonstrated that the multiple vegetative indices thresholds approach holds great potential in detecting swidden agriculture in tropical mountainous regions.

TI  - Mapping High Mountain Lakes Using Space-Borne Near-Nadir SAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-nadir interferometric imaging SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques are promising in measuring global water extent and surface height at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. The concept of near-nadir interferometric measurements was implemented in the experimental Interferometric Imaging Radar Altimeters (InIRA) mounted on Chinese Tian Gong 2 (TG-2) space laboratory. This study is focused on mapping the extent of high mountain lakes in the remote Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) areas using the InIRA observations. Theoretical simulations were first conducted to understand the scattering mechanisms under near-nadir observation geometry. It was found that water and surrounding land pixels are generally distinguishable depending on the degree of their difference in dielectric properties and surface roughness. The observed radar backscatter is also greatly influenced by incidence angles. A dynamic threshold method was then developed to detect water pixels based on the theoretical analysis and ancillary data. As assessed by the LandSat results, the overall classification accuracy is higher than 90%, though the classifications are affected by low backscatter possibly from very smooth water surface. The algorithms developed from this study can be extended to all InIRA land measurements and provide support for the similar space missions in the future.

TI  - Identifying the Relationship between Soil Properties and Rice Growth for Improving Consolidated Land in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China has widely implemented land consolidation, which was expected to increase the amount of cultivated land and enhance grain yields. Key components of land consolidation include filling mall waterbodies and leveling land, both of which have strong impacts on the environment in the Yangtze River Delta. The impacts of land consolidation on soil ecology and agricultural production are not yet clear. Here, we conducted a field survey of soil properties and rice growth to detect the effects of land consolidation in the first growing season. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to analyze the remote sensing data. We found significant differences in the soil properties under different types of land leveling, with a general NDVI pattern of: control > borrowed topsoil area > filled waterbodies area > topsoil cutting area. We found significant heterogeneity in rice NDVI after land consolidation. The NDVI of rice had extremely significant positive correlations with soil organic matter and available zinc. The spatial variation in soil properties caused by land consolidation was a dominant factor leading to the heterogeneity of rice NDVI. Fertilizing soil and strengthening field management should be adopted to provide more ecological services while increasing quantity.

TI  - A spatial simulation model to assess controls upon grassland degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of alpine meadow across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), western China, are undergoing degradation. Drawing upon field and remotely sensed data we develop a spatially explicit grid-based simulation model to explore the long-term dynamics of alpine meadow communities in this area. Our model represents the spatial dynamics of four plant functional types (PFTs) - sedges, grasses, forbs and weeds - together with disturbance from livestock grazing and small mammal activity. The model is most sensitive to parameters related to the reproductive rate and lifespan of the three plant functional types. Comparisons between model outcomes and field observations of vegetation composition suggest that the model produces plausible predictions of community dynamics. Simulation experiments indicate that grazing intensity is a fundamental control of plant community dynamics in these ecosystems. As grazing intensity increases there is a shift from a community dominated by grasses and forbs (very low grazing level) to grasses and sedges (low and moderate grazing levels) to degraded ground (high grazing levels). Severely degraded alpine meadows (locally termed 'Heitutan' or 'black beach') emerge after 370 simulation years under high levels of grazing pressure, but after only two decades under extreme grazing pressure. Under low to moderate intensity grazing regimes small mammals play an important role in maintaining meadow ecosystems. However, our model suggests that small mammal activity is no longer beneficial to the grassland ecosystem under high grazing pressures, increasing the rate of Heitutan formation. The time frame for a return to a sedge-dominated community is shortest under a moderate intensity grazing regime, but even in this instance it may take several hundred years.

TI  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is strongly correlated with terrestrial photosynthesis for a wide variety of biomes: First global analysis based on OCO-2 and flux tower observations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been increasingly used as a proxy for terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Previous work mainly evaluated the relationship between satellite-observed SIF and gridded GPP products both based on coarse spatial resolutions. Finer resolution SIF (1.3kmx2.25km) measured from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) provides the first opportunity to examine the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale using flux tower GPP data. However, it remains unclear how strong the relationship is for each biome and whether a robust, universal relationship exists across a variety of biomes. Here we conducted the first global analysis of the relationship between OCO-2 SIF and tower GPP for a total of 64 flux sites across the globe encompassing eight major biomes. OCO-2 SIF showed strong correlations with tower GPP at both midday and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship observed for daily SIF at the 757nm (R-2=0.72, p<0.0001). Strong linear relationships between SIF and GPP were consistently found for all biomes (R-2=0.57-0.79, p<0.0001) except evergreen broadleaf forests (R-2=0.16, p<0.05) at the daily timescale. A higher slope was found for C-4 grasslands and croplands than for C-3 ecosystems. The generally consistent slope of the relationship among biomes suggests a nearly universal rather than biome-specific SIF-GPP relationship, and this finding is an important distinction and simplification compared to previous results. SIF was mainly driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and was also influenced by environmental stresses (temperature and water stresses) that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. OCO-2 SIF generally had a better performance for predicting GPP than satellite-derived vegetation indices and a light use efficiency model. The universal SIF-GPP relationship can potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates regionally or globally. Our findings revealed the remarkable ability of finer resolution SIF observations from OCO-2 and other new or future missions (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX) for estimating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide variety of biomes and identified their potential and limitations for ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle studies.

TI  - Integrated Orbit Determination of FengYun-3C, BDS, and GPS Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at weather forecast and global climate research, the satellite FengYun-3C (FY-3C), as the new generation of China's weather satellites, was launched in 2013. It carries the Global Navigation Satellite Systems Occultation Sounder instrument, a BDS+GPS receiver, to fulfill the demand of orbit determination and occultation. In this contribution, we develop an integrated orbit determination of FY-3C, BDS, and GPS satellites by joint processing of onboard FY-3C and ground data during 2013-2017. Four processing schemes, BDS, GPS, BDS+GPS, and BDS (without Geostationary Earth Orbit [GEO])+GPS, are designed to investigate the capability of BDS for the integrated precise orbit determination and the benefit of BDS and GPS fusion. Regional and global networks are also employed to analyze the influence of station distribution on the orbit determination. The results show that with a regional network, both BDS and GPS orbits present a significant improvement after including FY-3C data. For the BDS+GPS one-step solution, GPS orbits are improved by 20% compared with the two-step solution, while the improvement can reach 42%, 27%, and 27% for BDS GEO, Inclined Geosynchronous Satellite Orbit, and Medium Earth Orbit, respectively. The precision improvement of FY-3C is respectively 26%, 44%, and 30% in along, cross, and radial components. For a global network, the orbit precision of the BDS+GPS solution is improved by 4% for GPS and 5%, 16%, and 19% for BDS GEO, Inclined Geosynchronous Satellite Orbit, and Medium Earth Orbit, respectively. For FY-3C, the orbit improvement can reach 7%. The validation with satellite laser ranging also demonstrates the benefit of the integrated orbit determination. Such a high-quality orbit will potentially benefit meteorological studies and applications.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node detection in colorectal cancer: A systematic review
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine green fluorescence-imaging (ICG-FI) has emerged as a potential tool for increasing the accuracy of staging of patients with primary colorectal cancer (CRC) through the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Here, we report the results of a systematic review of the available literature in the clinical setting of ex vivo and in vivo ICG-FI for the detection of SLNs in primary colorectal cancer. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane literature databases were searched for original articles on the use of ICG in the setting of clinical studies of CRC. Eighty studies were identified and screened, 23 were assessed for eligibility and 10 were included for review. Both ex vivo and in vivo ICG-FI are reported to be feasible for the detection of SLNs in CRC. The reported sensitivity of both techniques remains low, varying from 0% to 100% for the in vivo technique and 57% for the ex vivo technique. ICG-FI has not yet been shown to perform better than the standard blue dye technique. In addition, large variability among reported studies in terms of techniques used (ICG dose, type of injection), type of pathologic analyses performed (HE, IHC, serial section), and definition of positive LN status for sensitivity calculations made them difficult to compare directly. ICG-FI is a promising technique for the detection of SLNs in the setting of CRC but more work needs to be done to clearly define protocols and indications for its use and to test its efficacy in larger patient populations.

TI  - Effects of Forest Canopy Vertical Stratification on the Estimation of Gross Primary Production by Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) in forests is the most important carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems. Forest ecosystems with high leaf area index (LAI) values have diverse species or complex forest structures with vertical stratifications that influence the carbon-water-energy cycles. In this study, we used three light use efficiency (LUE) GPP models and site-level experiment data to analyze the effects of the vertical stratification of dense forest vegetation on the estimates of remotely sensed GPP during the growing season of two forest sites in East Asia: Dinghushan (DHS) and Tomakomai (TMK). The results showed that different controlling environmental factors of the vertical layers, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), produce different responses for the same LUE value in the different sub-ecosystems (defined as the tree, shrub, and grass layers), which influences the GPP estimation. Air temperature and VPD play important roles in the effects of vertical stratification on the GPP estimates in dense forests, which led to differences in GPP uncertainties from -50% to 30% because of the distinct temperature responses in TMK. The unequal vertical LAI distributions in the different sub-ecosystems led to GPP variations of 1-2 gC/m(2) /day with uncertainties of approximately -30% to 20% because sub-ecosystems have unique absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and LUE. A comparison with the flux tower-based GPP data indicated that the GPP estimations from the LUE and APAR values from separate vertical layers exhibited better model performance than those calculated using the single-layer method, with 10% less bias in DHS and more than 70% less bias in TMK. The precision of the estimated GPP in regions with thick understory vegetation could be effectively improved by considering the vertical variations in environmental parameters and the LAI values of different sub-ecosystems as separate factors when calculating the GPP of different components. Our results provide useful insight that can be used to improve the accuracy of remote sensing GPP estimations by considering vertical stratification parameters along with the LAI of sub-ecosystems in dense forests.

TI  - Contaminated Shipping Materials Identified as the Source of Rotaviral Infection of Exported Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over a 4-wk period in 2017, we received notification from 7 different institutions that mice exported from our SPF barrier facilities had tested positive for mouse rotavirus (MRV). The exports originated from several different buildings across multiple campuses. Our institution excludes MRV in all of our barrier facilities and has historically been free of this virus. Extensive testing of our rooms from which the exported mice originated did not detect the presence of rotavirus. The single commonality among the 7 shipments was the use of shipping boxes acquired from one vendor. These shipping boxes arrived at our institution prepackaged with unsterilized feed and bedding, which we hypothesized was the source of the rotavirus. To test this hypothesis, we housed naive sentinel mice in clean cages with feed and bedding transferred from 29 unopened, unused shipping boxes. Sentinel mice were exposed to this bedding and feed for 14 d and then evaluated through MRV serology and PCR assay. Of the 29 sentinels, 24 were seropositive for MRV, and 14 of the 29 were PCR positive. These results provided direct evidence that MRV detected by recipient institutions originated from the contaminated feed or bedding within the shipping boxes. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of contaminated materials in shipping boxes resulting in rotaviral infection of mice during export.

TI  - LINEAMENT CONTROL ON SPRING CHARACTERISTICS AT CENTRAL WEST PROGO HILLS, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The research area is located at the centre of West Progo Hills, in Yogyakarta and Central Java Province, Indonesia. It is hard water area, but there are some springs appearing from Jonggrangan and Old Andesite Formations. These formations consist of hard, compacted Tertiary rocks which have dissected by some lineaments of structure or morphology. The lineaments may control springs characteristics, involve their appearance, frequency, and discharge. Field observation has been done to collect springs data. The small discharge has been measured by water gauge and stopwatch directly, while the big ones have been measured by river channeling measurements. On the other hands, lineaments were determined from Landsat image, SRTM and topographic map as well as from field. The result shows that lineaments in Old Andesite Formation develop in many directions followed by spring appearance, in a random location. Springs in Jonggrangan Formation mainly appear in NE-SW direction in accordance with the azimuth of lineaments almost in SW-NE direction. The springs of both formations usually appear controlled by individual lineaments, indicated by coefficient correlation of 84% for the relationship between the distance of spring lineament and the numbers of springs. The density of lineaments also controls of springs appearance (r = 62% for cross dots of fractures and r = 51% for length). The distance between lineament and spring to discharge rate of springs seems no influence indicated by r(2) = 0.0495. It means that lineaments influence to spring occurrence in their density and distance characteristics.

TI  - Global Meaning and Rehabilitation in People with Stroke
T2  - BRAIN IMPAIRMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A stroke can have implications for all areas of a person's life. In research on adaptation to stroke, finding meaning is associated with better adaptation. This study focuses on one of the driving principles behind meaning-making processes: global meaning. The aim of this study was to explore whether global meaning (i.e., fundamental beliefs and life goals concerning core values, relationships, worldview, identity and inner posture) is associated with processes and outcomes of rehabilitation, as experienced by people with stroke. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted, and analysed using qualitative research methods. Aspects of global meaning were associated with the following elements of process and outcome of rehabilitation: motivation, handling stress and emotions, physical functioning and acceptance. The influence was mostly positive. If rehabilitation professionals took global meaning into account, respondents tended to associate this with better or faster recovery.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide valuable societal and ecological services and goods. However, they have been experiencing high annual rates of loss in many parts of the world. In order to evaluate a long-term wetland conservation strategy that compromises urban development with comprehensive wetland ecosystem management, remote sensing techniques were used to analyze the changing mangrove distribution in the Zhanjiang Mangrove Forest National Nature Reserve. Between 1991 and 2000, the mangrove area within the study region declined from 2 264.9 to 2 085.9 ha consistent with an annual decrease of 0.79%. However, there was an overall 34.3% increase in mangrove coverage from 2 085.9 to 2 801.8 ha between 2000 and 2011. Major causes of forest loss include local human pressures in the form of deforestation, conversion to agriculture, and natural forces such as erosion. The recent gain in mangrove forest cover is attributed to effective conservation management in the nature reserve area, including intensive mangrove plantation efforts and increased local awareness of wetland conservation.

TI  - Multi-perspective analysis of vegetation cover changes and driving factors of long time series based on climate and terrain data in Hanjiang River Basin, China
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The Hanjiang River Basin is the source area of the Middle Route Project of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and the vegetation coverage in this basin directly affects the quality of the ecological environment. This study is based on long time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data synthesized over 16days from 2000 to 2016 in the Hanjiang River Basin. Major climatic data (temperature and rainfall) and topographic data (elevation, slope, and aspect) are employed to analyze the driving forces of NDVI changes. The results demonstrate the following: for the 2000-2016 period, the average annual NDVI is 0.823, with a change trend of 0.025year(-1). The overall NDVI upstream is higher than that downstream. The average annual value of NDVI upstream is 0.844, with a change trend of 0.036year(-1), and that of downstream is 0.799, with a change trend of 0.022year(-1). The spatial distribution of NDVI was significantly increased in the area around the upstream section of the river and near the Danjiangkou Reservoir, and the distribution of NDVI around the central city was significantly reduced. The NDVI was positively correlated with temperature and rainfall, and the impacts differed among different regions. At elevations below 2000m, the NDVI shows an increasing trend with increasing elevation, and at elevations exceeding 2000m, the NDVI is negatively correlated with elevation. Slope is positively correlated with the NDVI. The influence of aspect on the NDVI was small.

TI  - Remote sensing of Arctic percent vegetation cover and <i>f</i>APAR on Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Percent vegetation cover (PVC) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) are important functional variables for assessing Arctic vegetation density and vigor. In this study, field measures of PVC, fAPAR and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were collected from July 5 to August 8, 2015 (i.e., summer season) along a moisture gradient in the Apex River Watershed (ARW) (63 degrees 45'N, 68 degrees 30'W), Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. Two field methods for estimating PVC (i.e., the point-frame and image classification methods) were examined and it was determined that the image classification approach provided a suitable alternative to the point-frame method, especially for detecting changes in Arctic PVC. Meanwhile, fAPAR was measured based on the method presented by Tagesson et al. (2012): f APAR = (1 -PAR(Reflected)/PAR(incoming)) x PVC. The spatial and temporal patterns of PVC and fAPAR in the context of NDVI derived from remote sensing data were examined. For this site, vegetation types exhibited contrasting patterns of PVC as a result of differing moisture regimes: (1) vegetation types with saturated soils (e.g., sedge dominated) exhibited a continuous increase in PVC throughout the growing season; (2) mesic vegetation types with moderate soil moisture (e.g., mosses dominated with a mixture of sedges and shrubs) exhibited an increase in PVC from July to early August followed by a decline in mid-August; and (3) semi-desert vegetation types that tended to dry early in the growing season (e.g., dominated by prostrate dwarf shrubs, herb tundra and large areas of bare soil and rock) exhibited little variation in PVC. Field measures of PVC and fAPAR demonstrated strong relationships to field NDVI data and the vegetation indices (VIs) derived from 2 m-resolution WorldView-2 data, thereby providing further evidence that VIs are well-suited for modelling PVC and fAPAR of Arctic vegetation.

T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To estimate new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis rates among HIV negative men who have sex with men (MSM) who are repeatedly tested for HIV in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and assess the impact of demographic and disease-specific characteristics that are associated with higher HIV diagnosis rates.Study Design Retrospective analysis using 2010 to 2013 data from the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN), a sentinel surveillance system comprised of health departments in 12 cities conducting sentinel surveillance in 40 STD clinics. We analyzed data from all MSM repeatedly (2 times) tested for HIV, with an initial negative HIV test required for staggered cohort entry. Follow-up time was accrued from the date of the first negative HIV test to the most recent negative test or the first positive HIV test. The STD diagnoses during the follow-up period were reviewed. We estimated HIV diagnoses rates (number of HIV diagnoses/total number of person-years [PY] at risk) by demographic and clinical characteristics with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using an inverse variance weighted random effects model, adjusting for heterogeneity between SSuN jurisdictions.Results Overall, 640 HIV diagnoses occurred among 14,824 individuals and 20,951.6 PY of observation, for an adjusted incidence of HIV diagnosis of 3.0 per 100 PY (95% CI, 2.6-3.4). Rates varied across race/ethnicity groups with the highest rate among Blacks (4.7/100 PY; 95% CI, 4.1-5.3) followed by Hispanics, whites, and persons of other races/ethnicities. Men who have sex with men having a diagnosis of primary or secondary (P&S) syphilis on or after the first negative HIV test had a higher new HIV diagnosis rate (7.2/100 PY; 95% CI, 5.8-9.0) compared with MSM who did not have a P&S syphilis diagnosis (2.8/100 PY; 95% CI, 2.6-3.1). Men who have sex with men who tested positive for rectal gonorrhea (6.3/100 PY; 95% CI, 5.7-6.9) or rectal chlamydia (5.6/100 PY; 95% CI, 4.6-6.6) had higher rates of new HIV diagnosis when compared to those with negative test results.Conclusions Men who have sex with men attending SSuN STD clinics have high rates of new HIV diagnoses, particularly those with a previous diagnosis of P&S syphilis, rectal chlamydia, and/or gonorrhea. Sexually transmitted disease clinics continue to be important clinical setting for diagnosing HIV among MSM populations.

TI  - RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AS WORLD-VIEW BELIEFS
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I defend a moderately cognitive account of religious beliefs. Religious beliefs are interpreted as "worldview beliefs", which I explicate as being indispensable to our everyday and scientific practice; my reading is nonetheless distinct from non-cognitivist readings of "worldview belief" which occasionally appear in the literature. I start with a brief analysis of a recent German contribution to the debate which on the one hand (rightly) insists on the priority of epistemic reasons for or against religious beliefs, but on the other hand contends that religious beliefs are worldview beliefs (section 1). This leads me to explicate a special sense of worldview beliefs, as well as their cognitive role (2). After that, I shed some light on a special epistemological characteristic of worldview beliefs, namely the strong involvement of "free certitude" in their acceptance. I explore the implications for the possible role of arguments for worldview beliefs, especially for worldview beliefs concerning theism (3).

TI  - 3D Facade Labeling over Complex Scenarios: A Case Study Using Convolutional Neural Network and Structure-From-Motion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a "reverse" ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.

TI  - Water balance assessment of an ungauged area in Poyang Lake watershed using a spatially distributed runoff coefficient model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Poyang Lake ungauged area (PLUA) is an essential hydrology buffer surrounding Poyang Lake. For such a data-scarce area, a novel spatially distributed runoff coefficient model (SDRCM) was developed based on the underlying surface properties using remotely sensed precipitation and reanalysis data after their validation. The runoff simulated by the SDRCM based on both sets of gridded precipitation data were validated in a subbasin where R-2 and E-NS are larger than 0.87. In addition, a hydrodynamic model was applied to validate the proposed model further by considering the estimated water yield for PLUA that involves boundary inputs, in which the result more closely aligns to the monthly observed discharge. On an annual basis, the PLUA water flow accounted for 12%-19% of the total annual water flow within the watershed, which was approximately equal to the proportion of the area of PLUA in relation to the entire watershed. Finally, the water balance between inflow and outflow of Poyang Lake was investigated, with relative errors observed at the Hukou gauging station all being less than 10% from 1998 to 2009. The proposed model will be helpful in understanding the significance of water yields of such ungauged plain area when evaluating the water balance.

TI  - A Cosmology of Conservation in the Ancient Maya World
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Classic Maya of the southern lowlands were one with world rather than one with nature, a view that promoted the conservation of their world for millennia, what I term a cosmology of conservation. I explore how their cosmocentric worldview fostered biodiversity and conservation by discussing the ceremonial circuit and pilgrimage destination of Cara Blanca, Belize. Here the Maya left a minimal footprint in the form of ceremonial buildings from which they performed ceremonies, doing their part to maintain the world at several of the 25 water bodies/portals to the underworld. The Maya intensified their visits when several prolonged droughts struck between 800 and 900 ce; it was to no avail, and many Maya emigrated and have successfully renegotiated their relationship in the world to the present day. Their history of engagement serves as a lesson for present society, one that cannot be ignored.

TI  - HEGEL AND PATHOLOGIZED MODERNITY, OR THE END OF SPIRIT IN THE ANTHROPOCENE
T2  - HISTORY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article has two broad concerns, both of which are pursued primarily with reference to Hegel's philosophy of history. First, it examines whether Hegel can help explain the difficulty we have in modernity in responding to climate change and ecological crisis. It argues that Hegel provides a useful analysis of this problem, since the model of self-determination that he appeals to is comprehensively embedded in embodied forms of culture. This helps explain why even a self-correcting worldview like modernity is obdurate in the face of this crisis. Second, Hegel claims that the defining attribute of spirit is its capacity for self-production. Modernity is characterized by the emerging and widespread knowledge that spirit is self-producing. Modernity develops institutions that facilitate and provide an objective reality for spirit's self-production and its freedom. This aspect of the article examines whether the distinctive capacity of spirit for self-determination, which is realized in modernity, is subject to the same atrophying conditions by which Hegel says all other historical shapes of spirit are characterized. It asks if the present ecological crisis, something that is directly attributable to spirit itself, represents the limits of self-producing spirit. The article concludes by examining the difficult position of those countries that cannot be considered to be responsible for the emergence of the Anthropocene but whose actions in the present will amplify its impact.

TI  - An Improved Method for Impervious Surface Mapping Incorporating LiDAR Data and High-Resolution Imagery at Different Acquisition Times
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface mapping incorporating high-resolution remote sensing imagery has continued to attract increasing interest, as it can provide detailed information about urban structure and distribution. Previous studies have suggested that the combination of LiDAR data and high-resolution imagery for impervious surface mapping yields better performance than the use of high-resolution imagery alone. However, due to LiDAR data's high cost of acquisition, it is difficult to obtain LiDAR data that was acquired at the same time as the high-resolution imagery in order to conduct impervious surface mapping by multi-sensor remote sensing data. Consequently, the occurrence of real landscape changes between multi-sensor remote sensing data sets with different acquisition times results in misclassification errors in impervious surface mapping. This issue has generally been neglected in previous works. Furthermore, observation differences that were generated from multi-sensor data-including the problems of misregistration, missing data in LiDAR data, and shadow in high-resolution images-also present obstacles to achieving the final mapping result in the fusion of LiDAR data and high-resolution images. In order to resolve these issues, we propose an improved impervious surface-mapping method incorporating both LiDAR data and high-resolution imagery with different acquisition times that consider real landscape changes and observation differences. In the proposed method, multi-sensor change detection by supervised multivariate alteration detection (MAD) is employed to identify the changed areas and mis-registered areas. The no-data areas in the LiDAR data and the shadow areas in the high-resolution image are extracted via independent classification based on the corresponding single-sensor data. Finally, an object-based post-classification fusion is proposed that takes advantage of both independent classification results while using single-sensor data and the joint classification result using stacked multi-sensor data. The impervious surface map is subsequently obtained by combining the landscape classes in the accurate classification map. Experiments covering the study site in Buffalo, NY, USA demonstrate that our method can accurately detect landscape changes and unambiguously improve the performance of impervious surface mapping.

TI  - STAIR: A generic and fully-automated method to fuse multiple sources of optical satellite data to generate a high-resolution, daily and cloud-/gap-free surface reflectance product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance data with high resolutions in both space and time have been desired and demanded by scientific research and societal applications. Standard satellite missions could not provide such data at both high resolutions. Fusion approaches that leverage the complementary strengths in various satellite sources (e.g. MODISNIIRS/GOES-R's sub-daily revisiting frequency and Landsat/Sentinel-2's high spatial resolution) provide a viable means to simultaneously achieve both high resolutions in the fusion data. In this paper, we presented a novel, generic and fully-automated method, STAIR, for fusing multi-spectral satellite data to generate a high frequency, high-resolution and cloud-/gap-free data. Building on the time series of multiple sources of satellite data, STAIR first imputes the missing-value pixels (due to cloud cover or sensor mechanical issues) in satellite images using an adaptive-average correction process, which takes into account different land covers and neighborhood information of miss-value pixels through an automatic segmentation. To fuse satellite images, it employs a local interpolation model to capture the most informative spatial information provided by the high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat) and then performs an adjustment step to incorporate the temporal patterns provided by the high-frequency data (e.g., MODIS). The resulting fused products contain daily, high spatial resolution and cloud-/gap-free fused images. We tested our algorithm to fuse surface reflectance data of MODIS and Landsat in Champaign County at Illinois and generated daily time series for all the growing seasons (Apr 1 to Nov 1) from 2000 to 2015 at 30 m resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAIR not only captures correct texture patterns but also predicts accurate reflectance values in the generated images, with a significant performance improvement over the classic STARFM algorithm. This method is computationally efficient and ready to be scaled up to continental scales. It is also sufficiently generic to easily include various optical satellite data for fusion. We envision this novel algorithm can provide effective means to leverage historical optical satellite data to build long-term daily, 30 m surface reflectance record (e.g. from 2000 to present) at continental scales for various applications, as well as produce operational near-realtime daily and high-resolution data for future earth observation applications.

TI  - On the Effects of InSAR Temporal Decorrelation and Its Implications for Land Cover Classification: The Case of the Ocean-Reclaimed Lands of the Shanghai Megacity
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we focused on the ocean-reclaimed lands of the Shanghai coastal region and we evidenced how, over these areas, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence maps exhibit peculiar behavior. In particular, by analyzing a sequence of Sentinel-1 SAR InSAR coherence maps, we found a significant coherence loss over time in correspondence to the ocean-reclaimed platforms that are substantially different from the coherence loss experienced in naturally-formed regions with the same type of land cover. We have verified whether this is due to the engineering geological conditions or the soil consolidation subsidence in ocean-reclaimed region. In this work, we combine the information coming from InSAR coherence maps and the retrieved temporal decorrelation model with that obtained by using optical Sentinel-2 data, and we performed land cover classification analyses in the zone of the Pudong International Airport. To estimate the accuracy of utilizing InSAR coherence information for land cover classification, in particular, we have analyzed what causes the difference of the InSAR coherence loss with the same type of land cover. The presented results show that the coherence models can be useful to distinguish roads and buildings, thus enhancing the accuracy of land cover classification compared with that allowable by using only Sentinel-2 data. In particular, the accuracy of classification increases from 75% to 86%.

TI  - An Improved Spatial and Temporal Reflectance Unmixing Model to Synthesize Time Series of Landsat-Like Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution limits the acquisition of dense time series of Landsat images, and limits the ability to properly monitor land surface dynamics in time. Spatiotemporal image fusion methods provide a cost-efficient alternative to generate dense time series of Landsat-like images for applications that require both high spatial and temporal resolution images. The Spatial and Temporal Reflectance Unmixing Model (STRUM) is a kind of spatial-unmixing-based spatiotemporal image fusion method. The temporal change image derived by STRUM lacks spectral variability and spatial details. This study proposed an improved STRUM (ISTRUM) architecture to tackle the problem by taking spatial heterogeneity of land surface into consideration and integrating the spectral mixture analysis of Landsat images. Sensor difference and applicability with multiple Landsat and coarse-resolution image pairs (L-C pairs) are also considered in ISTRUM. Experimental results indicate the image derived by ISTRUM contains more spectral variability and spatial details when compared with the one derived by STRUM, and the accuracy of fused Landsat-like image is improved. Endmember variability and sliding-window size are factors that influence the accuracy of ISTRUM. The factors were assessed by setting them to different values. Results indicate ISTRUM is robust to endmember variability and the publicly published endmembers (Global SVD) for Landsat images could be applied. Only sliding-window size has strong influence on the accuracy of ISTRUM. In addition, ISTRUM was compared with the Spatial Temporal Data Fusion Approach (STDFA), the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), the Hybrid Color Mapping (HCM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) methods. ISTRUM is superior to STDFA, slightly superior to HCM in cases when the temporal change is significant, comparable with ESTARFM and a little inferior to FSDAF. However, the computational efficiency of ISTRUM is much higher than ESTARFM and FSDAF. ISTRUM can to synthesize Landsat-like images on a global scale.

TI  - Quantitative Responses of Satellite-Derived Nighttime Lighting Signals to Anthropogenic Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes across China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed artificial lighting radiances at night can provide spatially explicit proxy measures of the magnitude of human activity. Satellite-derived nighttime light images, mainly provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB), have been increasingly used to study demographic and socioeconomic activities for a wide range of issues-for instance, human population dynamics, economic growth, and urbanization process-at multiple scales. In practice, the lack of texture information regarding man-made surfaces would usually lead to substantial difficulty in delineating the spatial dynamics in human settlements due to the diverse distributions of artificial nocturnal lighting sources, which are closely related to the predominant land-use/land-cover (LULC) types and their evolutions. An understanding of how nighttime lighting signals respond to synchronous anthropogenic LULC changes, therefore, is crucially important for the spatiotemporal investigations of human settlement dynamics. In this study, we used DMSP-derived nighttime light (NTL) data and Landsat-derived LULC maps to quantitatively estimate the pixel-level responses of NTL signals to different types of human-induced LULC conversions between 1995 and 2010 across China. Our results suggest that the majority (>70%) of pixel-level LULC conversions into artificial lands (including urban, rural, and built-up lands) might show a statistically significant increase in nighttime brightness with an average >20 (in digital number, DN) step change in nighttime lights (dNTL), both of which are distinctly higher than that in the LULC conversions into non-man-made surfaces on the whole. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-based analysis implies that we might have an average chance of -90% to identify the nationwide LULC conversions into man-made surfaces from all types of conversions through the observed changes in artificial nocturnal luminosity signals. Moreover, ROC curve-based analyses also yield two nation-level optimal dNTL thresholds of 4.8 and 7.8 DN for recognizing newly emerged three types of artificial lands and urban lands between 1995 and 2010 across the entire country, respectively. In short, our findings reveal fundamental insights into the quantitative connections between the anthropogenic LULC changes and the corresponding responses of synchronous nightlight signals at the pixel-level, which are generally essential for further applications of satellite-derived nocturnal luminosity data in the spatiotemporal investigations of human settlement dynamics.

TI  - Observation of Internal Solitary Waves Using an Underwater Glider in the Northern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are frequently observed in the ocean, in particular in the South China Sea. Petrel-II, the autonomous underwater glider developed by Tianjin University, conducted ISW observations in the northern South China Sea in August 2017. With the payload conductivity, temperature, and depth, Petrel-II can obtain the repeating thermohaline profiles from the surface to nearly 1500-m depth. Combined with the analysis of a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer true-color image, it is verified that the thermohaline fluctuation is caused by the ISWs. The features of the ISW are estimated by calculation of vertical velocity using a glider flight model. The ISW captured by Profile-46 of the glider was a depression wave, with a period of about 24 minutes and an amplitude of about 127 m. The application of underwater gliders will contribute to studies on the features, generation, propagation, and evolution of ISWs in the South China Sea.

T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 25 November 2016 (14:24:30 UTC), an Mw6.6 earthquake occurred in Aketao county of Xinjiang. We derived the coseismic deformation field of the earthquake from ESA's Sentinel-1B images and inverted the fault geometry and slip distribution by using a homogenous half-space elastic model and the Steepest Decent Method (SDM) program. The slip model shows that the rupture plane is about 68 km in length and 40 km in width and has an average strike of 105.2 degrees SE and an average dip of 76.0 degrees S. The average amount of slip is similar to 0.16 m and the maximum amount of slip is 0.59 m. The estimated seismic moment is 1.31 x 10(19 )N.m and the corresponding moment magnitude is Mw6.68. The dislocation is mainly distributed in the depth of 5-22 km, where the rupture center is located at 39.17 degrees E, 74.38 degrees N, and a depth of similar to 8.8 km, so this earthquake is a shallow earthquake. In terms of the tectonic settings, the earthquake was triggered by the release of residual stresses on the seismogenic Muji fault. The ruptures were stimulated simultaneously by the main shock, which made the slip distribution pattern of a strike-slip fault with a double fracture. Due to the tectonic setting and the seismic gap between the ruptures, the Muji fault would have a risk of rupture to some extent and trigger an earthquake in future.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Local winter abundance of grassland passerines is highly variable throughout the Chihuahuan Desert among years. The objective of this study is to determine if plant biomass in grasslands and precipitation are predictors of bird abundance in space and time through Chihuahuan Desert. We conducted avian surveys in 17 Grassland Priority Conservation Areas (GPCA) in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the winters of 2007-2011. We used distance sampling on line transects to estimate annual winter bird density in all GPCAs. We used a hierarchical model of distance sampling to estimate the effect of summer precipitation and vegetative cover during the fall on bird density for 10 grassland species. We used the MODIS NDVI at a pixel resolution of 231.5 m as a measure of plant biomass. Grasshopper Sparrow, Baird's Sparrow, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, and Eastern Meadowlark showed a strict positive response to NDVI, while Homed Lark, Sprague's Pipit, Chestnut-collared Longspur and Lark Bunting did not show a strictly-positive response to NDVI. Our results provide a valuable tool for the conservation of declining migratory birds on their wintering grounds by identifying a wildlife-habitat relationship using a remotely-sensed and readily available index of vegetative growth.

T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The mausoleums of the Emperors and of some members of the royal family of the Western Han Chinese Dynasty are a spectacular ensemble of tombs, covered by huge earth mounds and scattered throughout the outskirts of modern Xi'an. Their inspiration comes from the world-famous mausoleum of the first Emperor of the Qin, who reigned immediately before the Han, and these in turn inspired the much later mausoleums of the Song Dynasty. For numerous reasons it is nowadays difficult to acquire data and to capture on the ground the spatial and cognitive relationships between these monuments and the way they formed a unified cultural landscape. Therefore we make use here of satellite data to investigate dimensions, orientations and mutual cognitive aspects of their projects. The analysis encompasses a consideration of the cultural links of astronomy with orientation and topography, as well as a test of the possible influence of traditional Chinese doctrines on these. The special case of the mountain tomb of Emperor Wen of Han is also discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent erosional problem around a river delta on the Cox's Bazar coast was analyzed in this study. The coastline extends from south to north. Rapid erosion has affected some portions of a 24-km road along the coast, and local authorities have attempted to protect the road via revetment. However, the structure was soon buried with sediment because of a growing sand spit along the river delta, and a new area was eroded. Shoreline positions for a 44-year (1972-2016) period were digitized using Landsat images. From the time stack images, we observed a sand spit growing in a northward direction from 2000 to 2015, and the adjacent erosion area extended in the same direction. We employed a numerical model (MIKE21FM SM) for the computation of wave-driven currents and sediment transport along the coast, and attempted to reproduce recent erosional processes. The numerical result shows that net littoral drift is dominant in the northward direction along the coast, which is the same direction of the spit growth observed in the satellite images. A higher amplitude spit induces higher sediment transport compared to a low amplitude spit because of the difference in local incident wave angles resulting in greater positive gradient of the longshore sediment flux distribution, causing erosion in the downcoast.

Next, non-parametric change point and trend detection algorithms were applied to T-a, RH and VP over 1950-2017 to estimate the impacts of urbanization on urban climate. Three historical thermal comfort indices: temperature humidity index (THI), effective temperature index (ETI) and relative strain index (RSI) were estimated from climate data collected between 1950 and 2017 to assess the impact of urbanization on human thermal comfort. The results reveal substantial LUC, rapid increasing impervious surface areas in low-lying areas of Cairo at 75.2 km(2)/decade since the 1990s. Rapid urbanization had resulted in a statistically significant change point in T-a after 1995 with a warming trend of 0.19 degrees C/decade, a negative trend in RH of 0.55%/decade and a rising trend in VP of 0.24 hPa/decade. Severe heat stress levels emerged and persisted every July September since 1994. THI, ETI, and RSI show statistically significant change points at 1994 and a rising trend of 0.33 degrees C/decade, 0.29 degrees C/decade, and 0.06/decade, respectively. The highest thermal discomfort risk was found in urban areas of the old Cairo, but the risk is marginally smaller at new cities where there are vegetation covers. This study clearly demonstrates the impacts of rapid urbanization on the urban climate of hot-arid environment.

TI  - Modelling the spatiotemporal distribution of fisheries discards: A case study on eastern Ionian Sea trawl fishery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The mitigation and incorporation of fisheries discards into the spatial management perspective call for a well-planned approach considering their high spatiotemporal variability. This study describes an approach to map the spatiotemporal distribution of bottom trawl discards taking into account on-board observer data, environmental information and high-resolution estimates of fishing effort derived from Vessel Monitoring System data. Two were the main objectives: i) mapping the Discards Per Unit Effort (DPUE: kg/h) and ii) mapping the total discards quantities (in kg) in a predefined spatial unit (grid cell of 5 x 5 km). For this purpose, discards data from commercial bottom trawlers (seasonal basis, period 2003-2006, 2008) operating on the continental shelf of the eastern Ionian Sea were analyzed. The DPUE for a) all species with Minimum Landing Size (MLS), b) all species without MLS and c) all fish species, were modeled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using satellite environmental parameters, bathymetry and season as independent covariates. Mapping discards quantities in a predefined spatial unit was based on the spatial overlapping between GAM estimates for the year 2010 and fishing effort distribution for the same year. Spatial clusters of high discard quantities (hot spots) and their spatiotemporal persistence were also investigated. Results revealed how the environmental and temporal factors influence the DPUE distribution of each discard group and indicated increased discards quantities in areas of high fishing effort. The potential implications of the resulting DPUE maps for advancing discards spatial mitigation are further discussed. Mapping discards quantities using both the DPUE and the fishing effort distribution provide valuable insights that can be useful to investigate the broader ecosystem consequences of the EU landing obligation and other potential fishery management policies.

TI  - Mapping chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in a cyanobacteria- and algae-impacted Vaal Dam using Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is crucial for water quality management in turbid and productive case II water bodies, which are largely influenced by suspended sediment and phytoplankton. Recent developments in remote sensing technology offer new avenues for water quality assessment and chl-a detection for inland water bodies. In this study, the red to near-infrared (NIR-red) bands were tested for the Vaal Dam in South Africa to classify chl-a concentrations using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for 2014-2016 by means of stepwise logistic regression (SLR). The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were also used for validating chl-a concentration classes. The chl-a concentrations were classified into low and high concentrations. The SLR applied on 2014 images yielded an overall accuracy of 80% and kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.74 on April 2014 data, while an overall accuracy of 65% and kappa=0.30 were obtained for the May 2015 Landsat data. There was a significant (p<0.05) negative correlation between chl-a classes and red band in all analyses, while the NIR band showed a positive correlation (0.0001; p<0.89) for April 2014 data set. The 2015 image classification yielded an overall accuracy of 83% and kappa=0.43. The difference vegetation index showed a significant (p<0.003) positive correlation with chl-a concentrations for May 2015 and July 2016, with chl-a ranges of between 2.5 mu g/L and 1219 mu g/L. These correlations show that a class increase in chl-a (from low to high) is in response to an increase in greenness within the Vaal Dam. We have demonstrated the applicability of Landsat 8 OLI data for inland water quality assessment.Significance:The magnitude of the algae problem in the Vaal Dam is highlighted.Landsat 8 OLI satellite data have potential in mapping chl-a in inland water bodies.Both the red and the near infrared wavelengths were significant in mapping chl-a concentrations in the Vaal Dam.Satellite earth observation can be instrumental for water quality monitoring and decision-making.

TI  - Gap-Filling of MODIS Time Series Land Surface Temperature (LST) Products Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a basic parameter in energy exchange between the land and the atmosphere, and is frequently used in many sciences such as climatology, hydrology, agriculture, ecology, etc. Time series of satellite LST data have usually deficient, missing, and unacceptable data caused by the presence of clouds in images, the presence of dust in the atmosphere, and sensor failure. In this study, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) algorithm was used to resolve the problem of missing and outlier data caused by cloud cover. The region studied in the present research included an image frame of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with horizontal number 22 and vertical number 05 (h22v05). This image involved a large part of Iran, Turkmenistan, and the Caspian Sea. In this study, MODIS LST products (MOD11A1) were used during 2015 with approximately 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution and day/night LST data (daily temporal resolution). On average, the data have 36.37% gaps in each pixel profile with 730 day/night LST data. The results of the SSA algorithm in the reconstruction of LST images indicated a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.95 Kelvin (K) between the original and reconstructed LST time series data in the study region. In general, the findings showed that the SSA algorithm using spatio-temporal interpolation can be effectively used to resolve the problem of missing data caused by cloud cover.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed thermal infrared (TIR) data have been widely used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). LST is an important parameter in the studies of urban thermal environment and dynamics. In the study, an attempt has been made using LANDSAT 8 thermal imagery to compute LST and the associated land cover parameters viz; land surface emissivity (LSE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Landsat 8 TIRS band 10 & 11 (thermal bands) during 21 Oct. 2016, 22 Nov.2016, 24 Dec. 2016 and 09 Jan. 2017 were processed for LST analysis. However, band 5 & band 4 of the imagery was processed for NDVI, band 6 & band 5 for NDBI and band 2 & band 5 for NDWI analysis. LST has been derived from both the bands 10 &11 and validated by in-situ observations on the date and time of satellite overpass from the study area. Band 10 derived LST have shown much temperature difference while comparing with the in-situ observations. However, LST derived from band 11 found similar & close to the in-situ measurements. Relationship between band 11 results and in-situ observed measurements were developed, which has showing a strong correlation with (r(2) = 0.991). Land surface emissivity were also evaluated which shows variation in different land cover surfaces like vegetation, settlement, forest cover and water body. The study has proven that land surface temperature derived from satellite band 11 is the actual surface temperature of the study area.

TI  - Framework for Mapping Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems combine livestock and crop production in the same area, increasing the efficiency of land use and machinery, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing production risks, plant diseases and pests. ICL systems are primarily divided into annual (ICLa) and multi-annual (ICLm) systems. Projects such as the "Integrated crop-livestock-forest Network" and the "Livestock Rally" have estimated the ICL areas for Brazil on a state or regional basis. However, it remains necessary to create methods for spatial identification of ICL areas. Thus, we developed a framework for mapping ICL areas in Mato Grosso, Brazil using the Enhanced Vegetation Index time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and a Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) classification method. The classification of ICL areas occurred in three phases. Phase 1 corresponded to the classification of land use from 2008 to 2016. In Phase 2, the ICLa areas were identified. Finally, Phase 3 corresponded to the ICLm identification. The framework showed overall accuracies of 86% and 92% for ICL areas. ICLm accounted for 87% of the ICL areas. Considering only agricultural areas or only pasture areas, ICL systems represented 5% and 15%, respectively.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Variability of the Eastern Coastal Zone of the Gulf of California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zones are areas with a high flow of energy and materials where diverse ecosystems are developed. The study of coastal oceanography is important to understand the variability of these ecosystems and determine their role in biogeochemical cycles and climate change. Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is indispensable for the characterization of physical and biological processes, and it is affected by processes at diverse timescales. The purpose of this work is to analyze the oceanographic variability of the Eastern Coastal Zone of the Gulf of California through the study of the SST from time series analysis of monthly data obtained from remote sensors (AVHRR-Pathfinder Version 5.1 and Version 5 resolution of 4 km, MODIS-Aqua, resolution of 4 km) for the period 1981 to 2016. The descriptive analysis of SST series showed that the values decrease from south to north, as well as the amplitude of the warm period decrease from south to north (cold period increase from south to north). The minimum values occurred during January and February, and ranged between 18 and 20 degrees C; and maximum values, of about 32 degrees C, arose in August and September. Cluster analysis allowed to group the data in four regions (south, center, midriff islands and north), the spectral analysis in each region showed frequencies of variation in scales: Annual (the main), seasonal, semiannual, and interannual. The latter is associated with the El Nino and La Nina climatological phenomena.

TI  - Untangling methodological and scale considerations in growth and productivity trend estimates of Canada's forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - In view of the economic, social and ecological importance of Canada's forest ecosystems, there is a growing interest in studying the response of these ecosystems to climate change. Accurate knowledge regarding growth trajectories is needed for both policy makers and forest managers to ensure sustainability of the forest resource. However, results of previous analyses regarding the sign and magnitude of trends have often diverged. The main objective of this paper was to analyse the current state of scientific knowledge on growth and productivity trends in Canada's forests and provide some explanatory elements for contrasting observations. The three methods that are commonly used for assessments of tree growth and forest productivity (i.e. forest inventory data, tree-ring records, and satellite observations) have different underlying physiological assumptions and operate on different spatiotemporal scales, which complicates direct comparisons of trend values between studies. Within our systematic review of 44 peer-reviewed studies, half identified increasing trends for tree growth or forest productivity, while the other half showed negative trends. Biases and uncertainties associated with the three methods may explain some of the observed discrepancies. Given the complexity of interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem processes at different scales, researchers should consider the different approaches as complementary, rather than contradictory. Here, we propose the integration of these different approaches into a single framework that capitalizes on their respective advantages while limiting associated biases. Harmonization of sampling protocols and improvement of data processing and analyses would allow for more consistent trend estimations, thereby providing greater insight into climate-change related trends in forest growth and productivity. Similarly, a more open data-sharing culture should speed-up progress in this field of research.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of MODIS active fire products in southern African savannah woodlands
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing offers a cost-effective method for monitoring fire occurrence in savannah systems, for proper fire management. However, the ability of satellite fire products to detect active fire is known to vary depending on the terrestrial ecosystems and sensor characteristics. In this study, the overall accuracy, kappa coefficient of agreement and true skill statistic (TSS) were used to assess the accuracy of two MODIS fire products (MOD14A1 and MCD14ML) to detect active fire at two savannah woodland sites dominated by Baikiaea plurijuga and Brachystegia spiciformis in Zimbabwe. In both sites, MOD14A1 with a coarse spatial resolution of 1km had a poor index of agreement with ground fire data (kappa=0, TSS=0 and overall accuracy0.4). By contrast, a moderate to strong agreement between MCD14ML and active fires measured on the ground was observed at both study sites (overall accuracy0.7, kappa0.6 and TSS0.6; Table). It was therefore concluded that MCD14ML, with a spatial resolution of 375m, is a more suitable product for detecting active fires in both Baikiaea plurijuga and Brachystegia-dominated savannah woodlands of southern Africa compared to MOD14A1.Resume La teledetection par satellite offre une methode efficiente de suivi de l'occurrence des feux dans les systemes savanicoles, pour une gestion adequate de ceux-ci. Cependant, on sait que la capacite des produits satellitaires de detecter des feux en cours varie selon les ecosystemes terrestres et les caracteristiques des detecteurs. Dans cette etude, on a teste la precision globale, le coefficient kappa de concordance et le taux d'efficacite reelle (TSS) pour etablir la precision globale de deux produits de feux MODIS (MOD14A1 et MCD14ML) dans la detection de feux actifs sur deux sites de savane arboree domines par Baikiaea plurijuga et Brachystegia spiciformis, au Zimbabwe. Sur les deux sites, MOD14A1, avec une resolution spatiale grossiere de 1km, a revele un faible indice de concordance avec les donnees de feu du terrain (kappa=0, TSS=0 et precision globale0,4). En revanche, on a observe une concordance moderee a forte entre MCD14ML et les feux actifs mesures sur le terrain dans les deux sites d'etude (precision globale0,7, kappa0,6 et TSS0,6; Tableau1). On en conclut des lors que, compare a MOD14A1, MCD14ML avec une resolution spatiale de 375 m est un produit mieux adapte a la detection de feux actifs dans les savanes arborees dominees par Baikiaea plurijuga et Brachystegia spiciformis en Afrique australe.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Remote sensing have been intensively used across many disciplines, however, such information was limited in spatial epidemiology.Methods: Two years (2009 & 2010) Landsat TM satellite data was used to develop vegetation, water bodies, air temperature and humidity criterion maps to model malaria risk and its spatiotemporal seasonal variation. The criterion maps were used in weighted overlay analysis to generate final categorized malaria risk map.Results: Overall, 25%, 68%, 18% and 16% of the total area of Rawalpindi region was categorized as danger zone for Jun 2009, Oct 2009, Jan 2010 and Jun 2010, respectively. The malaria risk reached at its peak during the monsoon season whereas air temperature and relative humidity were the main contributing factors in seasonal variation.Conclusion: Malaria risk maps could be used for prioritizing areas for malaria control measures.

TI  - Satellite remote-sensing observations for definitions of areas for marine conservation: Case study of the Scotian Slope, Eastern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing offshore areas for marine conservation faces impediment from logistics and costs of in situ data collection. This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation. Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define "dynamic" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years. This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.

TI  - Fire Severity and Vegetation Recovery on Mine Site Rehabilitation Using WorldView-3 Imagery
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As open-cut coal mines progress towards closure, mining companies have an obligation to provide certainty to stakeholders that their rehabilitated landscapes have the capacity to withstand future disturbance impacts such as fire and drought. This paper describes the assessment of fire severity and recovery using WorldView-3 spectral indices following an experimental fire in a 19- to 21-year old coal mine rehabilitation in semi-arid Central Queensland, Australia. In a highly heterogeneous reconstructed environment, the differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) outperformed the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) with an overall map accuracy of 65% and 58%, respectively. The combination of red and near infra-red multispectral bands proved more effective at classifying severity compared with the shortwave infra-red, particularly when pre-fire imagery was dominated by highly cured grasses (>70%) and post-fire imagery contained a high coverage of residual ash. Recovery trends using spectral indices demonstrate the trajectory towards vegetation recovery, with 62% of the burnt site demonstrating high regrowth in the first two years following fire. This is supported by in situ recovery trends of understory biomass suggesting that under the study conditions, the rehabilitated site has the capacity to withstand impacts from a wildfire and recover to pre-fire levels.

TI  - An Evaluation of MODIS-Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth over AERONET Sites in Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The air quality monitoring network in Alaska is currently limited to ground-based observations in urban areas and national parks, leaving a large proportion of the state unmonitored. The use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) to estimate ground-level particulate pollution concentrations has been successfully demonstrated around the world and could potentially be used in Alaska. In this work, MODIS AOD measurements at 550 nm were validated against AOD derived from two ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sunphotometers in Alaska, located at Utqiagvik (previously known as Barrow) and Bonanza Creek, to determine if MODIS AOD from the Terra and Aqua satellites could be used to estimate ground-level particulate pollution concentrations. The MODIS AOD was obtained from MODIS collection 6 using the dark target Land and Ocean algorithms from years 2000 to 2014. MODIS data could only be obtained between the months of April and October; therefore, it was only evaluated for those months. Individual and combined Terra and Aqua MODIS data were considered. The results showed that MODIS collection 6 products at 10-km resolution for Terra and Aqua combined are not valid over land but are valid over the ocean. Note that the individual Terra and Aqua MODIS collection 6 AOD products at 10-km resolution are valid over land individually but not when combined. Results also suggest the MODIS collection 6 AOD products at 3-km resolution are valid over land and ocean and perform better over land than the 10-km product. These findings indicate that MODIS collection 6 AOD products can be used quantitatively in air quality applications in Alaska during the summer months.

TI  - Evidence for an effect of landscape connectivity on <i>Borrelia</i> <i>burgdorferi</i> sensu stricto dispersion in a zone of range expansion
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In North America, different strains of the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto cluster into phylogenetic groups that are associated with different levels of pathogenicity and, for some, specific rodent reservoir hosts. Here we explore whether landscape connectivity, by impacting host dispersal, influences B. burgdorferi s.s. spread patterns. This question is central to modelling spatial patterns of the spread of Lyme disease risk in the zone of northward range-expansion of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Canada where the study was conducted. We used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to characterise B. burgdorferi s.s. in positive ticks collected at 13 sites in southern Quebec, Canada during the early stages of B. burgdorferi s.s. invasion. We used mixed effects logistic regression to investigate whether landscape connectivity (probability of connectivity; PC) affected the probability that samples collected at different sites were of the same strain (MLST sequence type: ST). PC was calculated from a habitat map based on high spatial resolution (15 m) Landsat 8 imagery to identify woodland habitat that are preferred by rodent hosts of B. burgdorferi s.s. There was a significant positive association between the likelihood that two samples were of the same ST and PC, when PC values were grouped into three categories of low, medium and high. When analysing data for individual STs, samples at different sites were significantly more likely to be the same when PC was higher for the rodent-associated ST1. These findings support the hypothesis that dispersion trajectories of B. burgdorferi s.s. in general, and some rodent-associated strains in particular, are at least partly determined by landscape connectivity. This may suggest that dispersion of B. burgdorferi s.s. is more common by terrestrial mammal hosts (which would likely disperse according to landscape connectivity) than by birds, the dispersal of which is likely less constrained by landscape. This study suggests that accounting for landscape connectivity may improve model-based predictions of spatial spread patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. The findings are consistent with possible past dispersal patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. as determined by phylogeographic studies.

TI  - Capitalization of Urban Green Vegetation in a Housing Market with Poor Environmental Quality: Evidence from Beijing
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green vegetation provides amenity value for urban residents and improves the living environment. These changes in value can be reflected in the variation of house prices. This paper uses a unique housing transaction data set to estimate the impact of urban green vegetation on house values in Beijing, China, using the hedonic price model. To measure urban green vegetation, we calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) by time-series Landsat TM 8 remote-sensing imagery. For model specification, we applied spatial lag models to address spatial spillover effects that might lead to biased estimates if ignored. Spatial hedonic results indicate that urban green vegetation has a positive effect on residential housing prices when the measurement scale of NDVI value is smaller than or equal to 18.01 acres for each block of flats, whereas greater NDVI values generate a negative effect on property values if the scale is larger. This implies that urban green vegetation within 135m could increase house prices in the range of 7.95-10.59%, which indicates a potential 20.2-26.9billion yuan increase in the value of the sample real estate market in Beijing.

TI  - Antimicrobial Susceptibility of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Isolates in Baltimore, Maryland, 2016: The Importance of Sentinel Surveillance in the Era of Multi-Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing rates of gonorrhea infections and the global emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) threaten the successful management of gonorrhea. In the era of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), surveillance projects are urgently needed to monitor prevalence and trends in the antimicrobial susceptibility of NG. In this study, we retrospectively determined the susceptibility profile of NG isolates to previously and currently prescribed antimicrobials. NG isolates collected in Baltimore, Maryland between January and October 2016 were evaluated by the E-test method and/or molecular methods for susceptibility to ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, gentamicin, and penicillin. One-hundred and forty-three NG isolates from African-American males (98.6%), primarily heterosexual (88.8%), ranging in age from 15 to 69 years of age were included in the study. Ciprofloxacin resistance was observed in 44.1% of isolates. Plasmid-mediated resistance to penicillin and tetracycline resistance was detected in 22.4% and 10.1% of isolates, respectively. Three isolates (2.1%) displayed high-level resistance to azithromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 256 g/mL). Forty-three percent of isolates were resistant or had decreased susceptibility to three antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and penicillin). All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Overall, the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant NG in Baltimore continues to evolve, and the emergence of azithromycin resistance in this population emphasizes the need for continued sentinel surveillance programs to monitor susceptibility trends and aid in treatment recommendations.

TI  - Evaluation of the Multilook Size in Polarimetric Optimization of Differential SAR Interferograms
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interferometric coherence is a measure of the correlation between two SAR images and constitutes a commonly used estimator of the phase quality. Its estimation requires a spatial average within a 2-D window, usually named as multilook. The multilook processing allows reducing noise at the expenses of a resolution loss. In this letter, we analyze the influence of the multilook size while applying a polarimetric optimization of the coherence. The same optimization algorithm has been carried out with different multilook sizes and also with the nonlocal SAR filter filter, which has the advantage of preserving the original resolution of the interferogram. Our experiments have been carried out with a single pair of quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images mapping the Mount Etna's volcanic eruption of May 2008. Results obtained with this particular data set show that the coherence is increased notably with respect to conventional channels when small multilook sizes are employed, especially over low-vegetated areas. Conversely, very decorrelated areas benefit from larger multilook sizes but do not exhibit an additional improvement with the polarimetric optimization.

TI  - Monitoring of Thermal Activity at the Hatchobaru-Otake Geothermal Area in Japan Using Multi-Source Satellite Images-With Comparisons of Methods, and Solar and Seasonal Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hatchobaru-Otake (HO) geothermal field is proximal to the Kuju volcano on Kyushu, Japan. There are currently three geothermal power plants operating within this geothermal field. Herein, we explore the thermal status of the HO geothermal area using ASTER thermal infrared data to monitor heat losses from 2009 to 2017. We assessed the solar effects and seasonal variation on heat losses based on day- and night-time Landsat thermal infrared images, and compared three conventional methods of land surface temperature (LST) measurements. The normalized difference vegetation index threshold method of emissivity, the split window algorithm for LST, and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux (RHF) were used to determine the heat loss within the study area. The radiative heat loss (RHL) was 0.36 MW, 38.61 MW, and 29.14 MW in 2009, 2013, and 2017, respectively, from the HO geothermal field. The highest anomaly in RHF was recorded in 2013, while the lowest was in 2009. The RHLs were higher from Otake than from the Hatchobaru thermal area in the year of 2013 (similar to 31%) and 2017 (similar to 78%). The seasonal variation in the RHLs based on all three LST estimation methods had a similar pattern, with the highest RHL (about 383-451 MW) in spring and the lowest (about 10-222 MW) in autumn for the daytime images from the HO geothermal field. In the nighttime images, the highest RHL was about 35-67 MW in autumn and the lowest was about 1-3 MW in spring, based on the three LST methods for RHFs. The highest RHL was about 35-42 MW in spring (day) and 3-7 MW in autumn (night) from the Hatchobaru thermal area, analyzed separately. Similarly, the highest RHL was about 22-25 MW in spring (day) and 4-5 MW in winter (night) from the Otake thermal area. The seasonal variation was greatly influenced by the regional ambient temperature. We also observed that clouds had a huge effect, with the highest values for both LST and RHF recorded below clouds on an autumn day. Overall, we obtained higher LSTs at nighttime and lower LSTs during the day from the improved mono-window algorithm than the split window algorithms for all of the seasons. The heat losses were also higher for the improved mono-window algorithm than the split window algorithms, based on the LST nighttime thermal infrared data. Considering the error level of the LST methods and Landsat 8 band 11, this study recommends the IWM method for LST using the Landsat 8 band 10 data. This study also suggests that both the nighttime ASTER and Landsat 8 thermal infrared data could be effective for monitoring the thermal status of the HO geothermal area, given that data is available for the entire period.

TI  - Economic Assessment of Fire Damage to Urban Forest in the Wildland-Urban Interface Using Planet Satellites Constellation Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wildland-urban interface (WUI)-the area where wildland vegetation and urban buildings intermix-is at a greater risk of fire occurrence because of extensive human activity in that area. Although satellite remote sensing has become a major tool for assessing fire damage in wildlands, it is unsuitable for WUI fire monitoring due to the low spatial resolution of the images from satellites that provide frequent information which is relevant for timely fire monitoring in WUI. Here, we take advantage of frequent (i.e., ca. daily), high-spatial-resolution (3 m) imagery acquired from a constellation of nano-satellites operated by Planet Labs ("Planet") to assess fire damage to urban trees in the WUI of a Mediterranean city in Israel (Haifa). The fire occurred at the end of 2016, consuming ca. 17,000 of the trees (152 trees ha(-1) ) within the near-by wildland and urban parts of the city. Three vegetation indices (GNDVI, NDVI and GCC) from Planet satellite images were used to derive a burn severity map for the WUI area after applying a subpixel discrimination method to distinguish between woody and herbaceous vegetation. The produced burn severity map was successfully validated with information acquired from an extensive field survey in the WUI burnt area (overall accuracy and kappa: 87% and 0.75, respectively). Planet's vegetation indices were calibrated using in-field tree measurements to obtain high spatial resolution maps of burned trees and consumed woody biomass in the WUI. These were used in conjunction with an ecosystem services valuation model (i-Tree) to estimate spatially-distributed and total economic loss due to damage to urban trees caused by the fire. Results show that nearly half of the urban trees were moderately and severely burned (26% and 22%, respectively). The total damage to the urban forest was estimated at ca. 41 +/- 10 M USD. We conclude that using the method developed in this study with high-spatial-resolution Planet images has a great potential for WUI fire economic assessment.

TI  - ON THE AUTOMATION OF GESTALT PERCEPTION IN REMOTELY SENSED DATA
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gestalt perception, the laws of seeing, and perceptual grouping is rarely addressed in the context of remotely sensed imagery. The paper at hand reviews the corresponding state as well in machine vision as in remote sensing, in particular concerning urban areas. Automatic methods can be separated into three types: 1) knowledge-based inference, which needs machine-readable knowledge, 2) automatic learning methods, which require labeled or un-labeled example images, and 3) perceptual grouping along the lines of the laws of seeing, which should be pre-coded and should work on any kind of imagery, but in particular on urban aerial or satellite data. Perceptual grouping of parts into aggregates is a combinatorial problem. Exhaustive enumeration of all combinations is intractable. The paper at hand presents a constant-false-alarm-rate search rationale. An open problem is the choice of the extraction method for the primitive objects to start with. Here super-pixel-segmentation is used.

TI  - Comparing dune migration measured from remote sensing with sand flux prediction based on weather data and model, a test case in Qatar
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores validating and calibrating the wind regime predicted by Global Circulation Models (GCM) on Earth and other planets using optical remote sensing of dune dynamics. We use Spot-5 images to track the migration of 64 Barchan dunes in Qatar using the COSI-Corr technique. We estimate the volume of the dunes using a scaling law calibrated from one particular dune, which was surveyed in the field. Using volume and migration rate, we determine the sand flux from a single dune, Qnunes, and scale this estimate to the whole dune field. We compare the measured sand flux with those derived from wind velocity measurements at a local meteorological station as well as with those predicted from ERA-Interim (a Global Circulation Model). The comparison revealed that the wind velocity predicted by ERA-Interim is inappropriate to calculate the sand flux. This is due to the 6-h sampling rate and to systematic bias revealed by a comparison with the local wind data. We describe a simple procedure to correct for these effects. With the proposed correction, similar sand flux are predicted using the local and ERA-Interim data, independently of the value of the value of the shear velocity threshold, 11,4. The predicted sand flux is about 65% of Q(Dunes.) The agreement is best assuming the value u(*t) = 0.244 m/s, which is only slightly larger than the value of u(*t)= 0.2612 m/s estimated based in the sand granulometry measured from field samples. The influence of the dune topography on the wind velocity field could explain the underestimation. In any case, the study demonstrates the possibility of validating GCM model and calibrating aeolian sand transport laws using remote sensing measurements of dune dynamics and highlights the caveats associated to such an approach. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Testing and evaluating different LiDAR-derived canopy height model generation methods for tree height estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The LiDAR-derived Canopy height model (CHM), due to its wide applications in forestry, is important for foresters. Before a CHM can be considered a valuable, objective source of information about a canopy surface, it must be properly interpolated and preprocessed, which may sometimes be challenging, especially in case of multilayer and multispecies forest.This study tested and evaluated the impact of CHM interpolation methods on the accuracy of estimating tree height, which is one of the most important trees and stands feature. Tree heights calculated from 5 CHMs (1. raw CHM; 2. pit-free CHM; 3. spike-free CHM; 4. Smoothed CHM (with a median filter and with a Gaussian filter) were compared to heights measurements in the field. It was also tested whether applying linear regression can improve the accuracy of tree height estimations based on LiDAR-derived CHMs.The obtained results indicate that the method of generating CHMs influences the accuracy of tree height estimations. The mean differences between the means of field heights and LiDAR-derived heights (for each CHM separately and the 99th percentile) were statistically significant. The most accurate results were obtained with the spike-free CHM (RMSE calculated for all trees was 1.42 m (5.80%)). The smallest errors were observed for conifers-the RMSEs obtained for the spike-free CHM were 1.07 m (3.75%) and 1.18 m (4.57%) for spruce and pine, respectively. The use of linear regression improved the accuracy of tree height estimations from LiDAR data (especially for the CHMs filtered with Gaussian and median filters).

TI  - When a Straight Road becomes a Garden Path: The 'False Lead' as a Pedagogical Strategy in the Book of Proverbs
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The book of Proverbs is filled with poetic devices, many of which are used to didactic ends. One such device is the 'false lead' or 'garden path'. When reading a false lead proverb, one interpretation immediately occurs to the reader, but this interpretation jars with the worldview espoused in the book. The reader finds it unacceptable and realizes they have been led 'up the garden path'. They must go back and reanalyse the proverb, searching for a better interpretation. This article analyses five proverbs containing this device, and suggests that it is a deliberate pedagogical strategy. The technique teaches the reader the limits of their own wisdom, and also their capacity to rectify mistakes. They are forced to exercise their skills of discernment and moral reasoning.

TI  - Detection of transverse cirrus bands in satellite imagery using deep learning
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate the viability of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial recognition of meteorological phenomena in satellite imagery. Transfer learning was used to fine tune the widely used VGG-16 network architecture and allow the network to successfully detect (94% accuracy) the presence of transverse cirrus bands (TCBs) in NASA MODIS and VIIRS satellite browse imagery. The CNN exhibited better performance compared to a random forest classifier (84% accuracy) and was further validated by applying it to NASA satellite browse imagery in order to create a multi-year (2013-2015) global heat map of TCB occurrence. The annual heat map shows spatial patterns that are consistent with known mechanisms for the generation of TCBs, providing confidence in the CNN classifications. Our study shows that CNNs are well suited for meteorological phenomena detection due to their generalization capabilities and strong performance. An immediate application of our work intends to enable phenomena-based search of big satellite imagery databases. With additional modifications, the CNN could be utilized for other applications such as providing situational awareness to operational forecasters or developing phenomena specific climatologies.

TI  - Retrospective growth analysis of the dwarf shrub <i>Cassiope tetragona</i> allows local estimation of vascular plant productivity in high arctic Svalbard
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionVascular plant productivity of arctic tundra has often been viewed as varying little between years and thus being largely insensitive to the high inter-annual variation in summer weather conditions. Yet, remote-sensing data and retrospective growth analyses of the circumpolar dwarf shrub, Cassiope tetragona, commonly show considerable between-year variability in plant growth in response to variation in summer temperature. Given that both Cassiope growth and vascular plant biomass production share a common environmental driver, summer temperature, we would expect positive co-variation between them. Here we investigate whether this is indeed the case and if so over what spatial scale.LocationMethodsNordenskioldland, high arctic Svalbard.We brought dendroecology and plot-based field estimation methodologies together in an empirical study using retrospective analysis of Cassiope growth and annual estimation of above-ground vegetation biomass production to investigate their temporal and spatial co-variation and sensitivity to summer weather conditions.ResultsConclusionsDespite substantial small-scale heterogeneity, we found spatial co-variation in Cassiope growth patterns, which weakened as distance between sampling sites increased from 0 to 25km. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between annual estimates of above-ground live vascular plant biomass and Cassiope shoot growth over a 12-year period at a local scale. The correlation declined with distance, likely due to increasing differences in local weather conditions.We demonstrate that Cassiope growth can be used as a proxy for above-ground tundra vegetation productivity at the local scale. Our findings suggest that Arctic plant productivity is as sensitive to between-year variation in summer temperature as the well-established growth response of Cassiope. This challenges the view that tundra plant productivity varies little between years and provides a mechanistic understanding that helps reconcile field- and satellite-based annual estimation methods.

TI  - The relation between land use and subsidence in the Vietnamese Mekong delta
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vietnamese Mekong delta is subsiding due to a combination of natural and human-induced causes. Over the past several decades, large-scale anthropogenic land-use changes have taken place as a result of increased agricultural production, population growth and urbanization in the delta. Land-use changes can alter the hydrological system or increase loading of the delta surface, amplifying natural subsidence processes or creating new anthropogenic subsidence. The relationships between land use histories and current rates of land subsidence have so far not been studied in the Mekong delta.We quantified InSAR-derived subsidence rates for the various land-use classes and past land-use changes using a new, optical remote sensing-based, 20-year time series of land use. Lowest mean subsidence rates were found for undeveloped land-use classes, like marshland and wetland forest(similar to 6-7 mm yr(-1)), and highest rates for areas with mixed-crop agriculture and cities (similar to 18-20 mm yr(-1)). We assessed the relationship strength between current land use, land-use history and subsidence by predicting subsidence rates during the measurement period solely based on land-use history. After initial training of all land-use sequences with InSAR-derived subsidence rates, the land-use-based approach predicted 65-92% of the spatially varying subsidence rates within the measurement error range of the InSAR observations (RMSE = 5.8 mm). As a result, the spatial patterns visible in the observed subsidence can largely be explained by land use. We discuss in detail the dominant land-use change pathways and their indirect, causal relationships with subsidence. Our spatially explicit evaluation of these pathways provides valuable insights for policymakers concerned with land-use planning in both subsiding and currently stable areas of the Mekong delta and similar systems.

TI  - Glacier recession and glacial lake outburst flood studies in Zanskar basin, western Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier recession and formation of glacial lakes along with outburst flood hazards are increasing in response to changing climate in the Himalayan region. This study describes evolution of Dalung and Padam glaciers and their associated lakes employing multi-temporal datasets of Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM + ), Indian Remote Sensing LISS-III, Google Earth (TM), ASTER GDEM and Survey of India topographic maps. The Dalung Glacier (DG) and Lake (DL) are present in Suru River catchment whereas the Padam Glacier (PG) and Lake (PL) are present in Tsarap River catchment of Zanskar basin, western Himalaya. From 1962 to 2015; the DG and PG have shrunk at different rates. The DG has shrunk by 2.6 +/- 0.56 km(2) (19.2 +/- 4.1%) at a rate of 0.05 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1) whereas, the PG has shrunk by 3.4 +/- 0.65 km(2) (12.7 +/- 2.4%) at a rate of 0.06 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1). The frontal recession was recorded as 1.240 +/- 0.02 km (15.7 +/- 2.0%) at a rate of 20 +/- 0.4 m a(-1) for DG and 2.690 +/- 0.5 m (21.3 +/- 2.1%) at a rate of 50.7 +/- 0.1 m a(-1) for PG. Consequently, the proglacial glacial lakes have formed indicating an expansion of 20 +/- 3.4% (DL) and 58 +/- 4.5% (PL) during 1990-2015. Using integrated criteria of standard indices for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs), the lakes were found to be vulnerable and have a potential to cause breaching in the coming years. In order to provide inputs for the emergency action plan, one dimensional MIKE 11 Model was used to generate the peak flood hydrographs at the lake and other vulnerable sites downstream. Highest peak discharge of 3361.7 m(3) s(-1) (DL) and 4210.3 m(3) s(-1) (PL) were estimated at the lake sites which has reduced to 1520.9 m(3) s(-1) and 1722.4 m(3) s(-1) respectively at the outlet sites. The reduced discharge at downstream sites still bears the potential to create dangerous flood hazards.

TI  - A Prospective Study of Immediate Breast Reconstruction with Laser-Assisted Indocyanine Green Angiography
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Complication rates following immediate breast reconstruction range from 4% to 60%. Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) is often the sentinel event leading to secondary complications.Methods: All patients undergoing immediate reconstruction were enrolled. Upon mastectomy completion, the surgeon visually interpreted the skin flaps, performed laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography (LAIGA), and intervened if needed. Patients were followed for 90 days, documenting skin necrosis, infection, seroma, hematoma, implant loss, and reoperation.Results: There were 126 patients who had 206 immediate breast reconstructions. The complication rate was 22.3%. The incidence of MSFN was 14.1%. The reoperation rate was 8.7%. There was 1 necrosis-related implant loss. Postoperative surveys were completed on 193 breasts: 137 had visual and LAIGA interpretation of well or adequately perfused, resulting in 5.8% rate of necrosis, 2 reoperations, and no implant losses. Twenty breasts had visual and LAIGA interpretation of marginal or poor perfusion. Sixteen of these underwent intervention. The necrosis rate in this group was 35% with no implant losses. A third group with 26 breasts had adequate visual interpretation with marginal or poor perfusion on LAIGA. Ten breasts had no intervention, and 16 received intervention. The overall necrosis rate in this group was 42.3%, with 4 reoperations for necrosis and 1 implant loss.Conclusions: LAIGA can more accurately predict complications from MSFN than surgeon assessment alone. When surgeon decision making is supplemented with LAIGA, it reduces the incidence of MSFN, infection, implant loss, and overall unexpected reoperation rate. LAIGA is a valuable adjunct for intraoperative decision making.

TI  - Modeling Wildfire Smoke Pollution by Integrating Land Use Regression and Remote Sensing Data: Regional Multi-Temporal Estimates for Public Health and Exposure Models
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the health effects of wildfire smoke, it is important to accurately assess smoke exposure over space and time. Particulate matter (PM) is a predominant pollutant in wildfire smoke. In this study, we develop land-use regression (LUR) models to investigate the impact that a cluster of wildfires in the northwest USA had on the level of PM in southern Alberta (Canada), in the summer of 2015. Univariate aerosol optical depth (AOD) and multivariate AOD-LUR models were used to estimate the level of PM2.5 in urban and rural areas. For epidemiological studies, it is also important to distinguish between wildfire-related PM2.5 and PM2.5 originating from other sources. We therefore subdivided the study period into three sub-periods: (1) Pre-fire, (2) during-fire, and (3) post-fire. We then developed separate models for each sub-period. With this approach, we were able to identify different predictors significantly associated with smoke-related PM2.5 verses PM2.5 of different origin. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the models' performance. Our results indicate that model predictors and model performance are highly related to the level of PM2.5, and the pollution source. The predictive ability of both uni- and multi-variate models were higher in the during-fire period than in the pre- and post-fire periods.

TI  - Prediction of spatio-temporal land use/land cover dynamics in rapidly developing Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India, using geospatial approach: a comparison of hybrid models
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover changes (LULCC) are one of the foremost aspects of environmental changes caused by human-induced activities mainly in rapidly developing areas. This study endeavors to evaluate and compare three hybrid models: stochastic Markov chain (ST-MC), cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-MC), and multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC) to predict future land use/land cover (LULC) scenario in Varanasi district. LULC information extracted for years 1988 and 2001 was first employed to predict LULC scenario for 2015 using three hybrid models. The predicted results were compared with the observed LULC information for the year 2015 to appraise the validity of models through kappa index statistics. The MLP-MC model yielded reliable and best results. Finally, based on this consequence, the prediction of future LULC scenarios for years 2030 and 2050 was performed. The findings of this study exhibited the constant but overall increase of built up area and a considerable reduction in agricultural land. The results also demonstrate the potentiality of MLP-MC hybrid model for better understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics and predicting future landsacpe scenario in Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India.

TI  - Estimating air temperature using MODIS surface temperature images for assessing <i>Aedes aegypti</i> thermal niche in Bangkok, Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue, the most widespread urban vector-borne disease, is transmitted to human by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Its distribution in urban areas is heterogeneous over time and space. In time, it is linked to seasonal variations such as warm and cold seasons, as well as rainy and dry seasons. In space, it is linked to social and environmental conditions, which alternate between rich and deprived neighborhoods, vegetated and densely built areas. These variations in terms of land cover can affect surface and air temperature. As a result of its influence on the mosquito's life cycle, temperature plays a crucial part in dengue epidemics potential. Thus, deciphering the thermal variations effects within cities could lead to the identification of precise thermal comfort zones, favorable to the survival of mosquito populations during inter-epidemic periods. The maps that could be produced as a result would enable health authorities to target specific areas. Most cities are equipped with meteorological stations. However, the network is generally not dense enough to precisely identify thermal comfort zones. Remote sensing can be used as a tool to solve this issue. The methodological objective of this paper is to assess the potential of the TVX (Temperature-Vegetation indeX) approach applied to MODIS thermal images for the purpose of estimating daily minimum and maximum air temperatures in the city of Bangkok, Thailand. The TVX approach has been seldom used over urban areas due to the heterogeneous nature of cities in terms of land cover. However, our study shows that in vegetated cities such as Bangkok, the TVX method provides valuable results which can be used to assess thermal niche of A. aegypti.

TI  - The Mars 2020 Candidate Landing Sites: A Magnetic Field Perspective
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - We present an analysis of the remaining three candidate landing sites for Mars 2020, Columbia Hills (CH), Northeast Syrtis (NES) and Jezero (JE) from the perspective of understanding Mars' crustal magnetic field. We identify how the different sites can address each of six community-defined paleomagnetic science objectives for Mars return samples. These objectives include understanding the early dynamo field and its variability, identification of magnetic minerals that carry magnetization in the samples, and characterization of any thermal and chemical alteration of samples. Satellite data have provided global and regional constraints on crustal magnetization, indicating strong magnetizations at CH and weak to no magnetization at JE and NES. However, the primary paleomagnetic interestunderstanding the early dynamorequires ground truth from a landing site at which pre-Noachian and Early Noachian deposits are accessible. This requirement is most likely met by the site NES, which contains meggabreccia deposits, and it is therefore the highest priority landing site for magnetic field investigations. Importantly, a sample return mission has never been done, and so any of the three landing sites will provide critical, new data that will contribute to understanding the history of Mars' magnetic field and crustal mineralogy and, in turn, yield constraints on the planet's evolution.Plain Language Summary Mars 2020, a mission to Mars, will for the first time collect rock samples for subsequent return to the Earth. Here we evaluate how each of the last three candidate landing sites can shed light on the Martian magnetic field and its history. We evaluate which landing site is best suited to address each of six science objectives regarding the origin, variability, and evolution of the magnetic signatures on Mars. We first summarize what is known about magnetization around the landing sites based on satellite data. Because we are primarily interested in the history of the magnetic field, an ideal site should offer ancient (approximate to 4 billion years old and older) accessible outcrops that might be recorders of Mars' ancient global magnetic field. We combine current knowledge about the surface age, geology, and magnetic field, and chose Northeast Syrtis as the preferred landing site, followed by Columbia Hills and Jezero. However, any of the three sites will provide us with new data that will contribute to understanding Mars' magnetic field history and, in turn, its evolution.

TI  - 1 Versus 2-cm Excision Margins for pT2-pT4 Primary Cutaneous Melanoma (MelMarT): A Feasibility Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma > 1 mm in Breslow thickness (BT). A narrower surgical margin is expected to be associated with lower morbidity, improved quality of life (QoL), and reduced cost. We report the results of a pilot international study (MelMarT) comparing a 1 versus 2-cm surgical margin for patients with primary melanoma > 1 mm in BT.Methods. This phase III, multicentre trial [NCT02385214] administered by the Australia & New Zealand Medical Trials Group (ANZMTG 03.12) randomised patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma > 1 mm in BT to a 1 versus 2-cm wide excision margin to be performed with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Surgical closure technique was at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Patients' QoL was measured (FACT-M questionnaire) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after randomisation.Results. Between January 2015 and June 2016, 400 patients were randomised from 17 centres in 5 countries. A total of 377 patients were available for analysis. Primary melanomas were located on the trunk (56.9%), extremities (35.6%), and head and neck (7.4%). More patients in the 2-cm margin group required reconstruction (34.9 vs. 13.6%; p < 0.0001). There was an increased wound necrosis rate in the 2-cm arm (0.5 vs. 3.6%; p = 0.036). After 12 months' follow-up, no differences were noted in QoL between groups.Discussion. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a large international RCT to provide a definitive answer to the optimal excision margin for patients with intermediate-to high-risk primary cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - The Potential Impact of AMAROS on the Management of the Axilla in Patients with Clinical T1-2N0 Breast Cancer Undergoing Primary Total Mastectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Recent trials have demonstrated that axillary observation or axillary radiation therapy (AxRT) is equivalent to axillary node dissection (ALND) for patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). These strategies have been widely adopted for patients having breast conservation. This report demonstrates the potential impact of the AMAROS trial on axillary therapy in a retrospective cohort of mastectomy patients.Methods. Patients undergoing primary mastectomy for cT1-2N0 breast cancer who had one or two positive SLNs were identified from institutional databases (2005-2015). Locoregional management strategies were evaluated, and variables predictive of the use of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) were identified.Results. Among 2594 mastectomies, 193 (7%) met the AMAROS eligibility criteria. The median patient age was 50 years (range 22-83 years). Locoregional treatment consisted of ALND + PMRT for 102 patients (53%), ALND alone for 66 patients (34%), PMRT alone for 11 patients (6%), and observation for 14 patients (7%). Overall, 59 ALND patients (35%) had additional positive nodes. In the multivariate analysis, age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-8.45), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR 5.78; 95% CI 2.53-4.78), macrometastases (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.54-10.97), and extracapsular extension (OR 11.66; 95% CI 2.55-88.34) were associated with receipt of PMRT.Conclusion. In this cohort of AMAROS-eligible patients, 168 (87%) underwent ALND, 102 (61%) of whom also received PMRT, suggesting that AxRT could have been used instead of ALND for a significant number of patients. Preoperative factors associated with the receipt of PMRT, such as young age and LVI, may be useful for defining a multidisciplinary decision-making framework for axillary management in this population.

TI  - Mapping Population Distribution from High Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery in a Data Poor Setting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of population distribution is essential for policy-making, urban planning, administration, and risk management in hazardous areas. In some countries, however, population data is not collected on a regular basis and is rarely available at a high spatial resolution. In this study, we proposed an approach to estimate the absolute number of inhabitants at the neighborhood level, combining data obtained through field work with high resolution remote sensing. The approach was tested on Ngazidja Island (Union of the Comoros). A detailed survey of neighborhoods at the level of individual dwellings, showed that the average number of inhabitants per dwelling was significantly different between buildings characterized by a different roof type. Firstly, high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery was used to define the location of individual buildings, and second to determine the roof type for each building, using an object-based classification approach. Knowing the location of individual houses and their roof type, the number of inhabitants was estimated at the neighborhood level using the data on house occupancy of the field survey. To correct for misclassification bias in roof type discrimination, an inverse calibration approach was applied. To assess the impact of variations in average dwelling occupancy between neighborhoods on model outcome, a measure of the degree of confidence of population estimates was calculated. Validation using the leave-one-out approach showed low model bias, and a relative error at the neighborhood level of 17%. With the increasing availability of high resolution remotely sensed data, population estimation methods combining data from field surveys with remote sensing, as proposed in this study, hold great promise for systematic mapping of population distribution in areas where reliable census data are not available on a regular basis.

In this study, we aimed to quantify deforestation and fragmentation by identifying forest remnants capable of maintaining populations of the endangered crested capuchin monkey (Sapajus robustus) within its distributional limits in the states of Bahia, Espirito Santo, and Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used Landsat images from 1985 to 2010 to generate three time-interval mosaics classified by natural and non-natural vegetation. We then calculated the size of the forest remnants and the distance of each fragment of natural vegetation to its nearest neighbor. Between the first (1985-1990) and second (1995-2000) mosaics there was a vegetation loss of 41.4%, and between the second and third (2005-2010) mosaics there was a natural vegetation gain of 1%. The third mosaic showed smaller and more isolated fragments in comparison to the first mosaic. Across the three periods, Bahia was the state with the highest rate of deforestation. While Espirito Santo had fewer identified forest remnants, it retained the most natural vegetation within these small fragments. The landscape within the currently recognized distributional limits of the crested capuchin monkey is dominated by agriculture and livestock. Both decreasing fragment size and increasing species isolation by distance between fragments can negatively affect primate populations, increasing their risk of extinction. Isolation makes it difficult for migration and recolonization events to occur. Therefore, habitat restoration should be prioritized to reduce isolation between populations. Our findings may serve as a resource for future conservation efforts and management of the crested capuchin monkey.

TI  - Increasing Potential for Air Pollution over Megacity New Delhi: A Study Based on 2016 Diwali Episode
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution over the megacity New Delhi has gained significant attention in recent times. Local pollution, along with advection from upwind sources, long-range transport and festivities (e.g., Diwali) contributing large emissions from firecrackers, has led to high loading conditions over the city. In this study, we assess a particulate pollutant event that coincided with the festival of Diwali in 2016 using multiple parameters related to particulate pollution from the ground and satellite based measurements in relation to the observed climatology during the period of 2000 to 2016. Our analysis reveals that the episode of severe air pollution in 2016 was exacerbated by the long-range transport of absorbing fine aerosols emanating from biomass/stubble burning in the adjacent states to the northwest of National Capital Territory (NCT) of India Based on concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis using the PM2.5 mass concentration and AOD, the high loading conditions were related to trajectories that passed through the northwest of NCT. The period after Diwali in 2016 also coincided with air masses traversing large biomass burning areas. The long-term changes in the fire counts indicate that these events have been increasing at an alarming rate of similar to 25% per year since 2000, creating the potential for high particulate pollution over downwind cities such as Delhi.

TI  - Remap: An online remote sensing application for land cover classification and monitoring
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Recent assessments of progress towards global conservation targets have revealed a paucity of indicators suitable for assessing the changing state of ecosystems. Moreover, land managers and planners are often unable to gain timely access to the maps they need to support their routine decision-making. This deficiency is partly due to a lack of suitable data on ecosystem change, driven mostly by the considerable technical expertise needed to develop ecosystem maps from remote sensing data.2. We have developed a free and open-access online remote sensing and environmental modelling application, the Remote Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment Pipeline (Remap; ), that enables volunteers, managers and scientists with little or no experience in remote sensing to generate classifications (maps) of land cover and land use change over time.3. Remap utilizes the geospatial data storage and analysis capacity of Google Earth Engine and requires only spatially resolved training data that define map classes of interest (e.g. ecosystem types). The training data, which can be uploaded or annotated interactively within Remap, are used in a random forest classification of up to 13 publicly available predictor datasets to assign all pixels in a focal region to map classes. Predictor datasets available in Remap represent topographic (e.g. slope, elevation), spectral (archival Landsat image composites) and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) that are relevant to the distribution of ecosystems and land cover classes.4. The ability of Remap to develop and export high-quality classified maps in a very short (<10 min) time frame represents a considerable advance towards globally accessible and free application of remote sensing technology. By enabling access to data and simplifying remote sensing classifications, Remap can catalyse the monitoring of land use and change to support environmental conservation, including developing inventories of biodiversity, identifying hotspots of ecosystem diversity, ecosystem-based spatial conservation planning, mapping ecosystem loss at local scales and supporting environmental education initiatives.

TI  - Conservation impacts of a near real-time forest monitoring and alert system for the tropics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time (NRT) forest monitoring and alert systems based on remotely sensed data are among the most recently developed tools to help manage and protect forest resources. The use of satellite and airborne remote sensing to quickly and accurately detect activities associated with deforestation has great potential for catalyzing local response teams responsible for assessing and interdicting threats to tropical forest ecosystems. To better understand the utility of NRT monitoring technologies in improving environmental protection and management, from 2008 to 2016 Conservation International conducted a series of surveys and interviews with users of these systems in four countries where wildfires threaten tropical forest ecosystems: Madagascar, Indonesia, Bolivia and Peru. Users reported that NRT forest monitoring systems made significant contributions to improving the ability of conservation and forest management organizations to respond to and reduce the impacts of fire, deforestation and other illegal or undesirable forest activity. Understanding the types of applications for which users successfully employed forest monitoring data, the challenges they faced in accessing, analyzing or disseminating these data, and the lessons learned from our attempts to develop and deploy NRT forest monitoring systems is useful to institutions interested in successfully incorporating NRT monitoring into their work.

TI  - Modeling Water and Heat Balance Components for Large Agricultural Region Utilizing Information from Meteorological Satellites
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The method has been developed to evaluate water and heat balance components for vegetation covered area of regional scale based on the refined physical-mathematical model of vertical water and heat exchange between land surface and atmosphere (Land Surface Model, LSM) for vegetation season adapted to satellite information on land surface and meteorological conditions. The LSM is accommodated for utilizing satellite-derived estimates of vegetation and meteorological characteristics as model parameters and input variables. Estimates of these characteristics presented as distributions of their values over the study area have been obtained from AVHRR/NOAA, MODIS/EOS Terra and Aqua, SEVIRI/Meteosat-9, -10 data. To build such estimates methods and technologies have been developed and refined using results of thematic processing measurement data from these sensors. Among them the original Multi Threshold Method (MTM) has been developed and tested to calculate daily precipitation sums using rainfall intensity estimates retrieved from AVHRR and SEVIRI data with subsequent replacement of ground-measured rainfall amounts by these daily rainfalls. All technologies have been adapted to the study area with square of 227300 km(2) being the part of the Central Black Earth Region of European Russia. Developed earlier procedures of utilizing satellite derived estimates of vegetation and meteorological characteristics (including precipitation) in the model have been refined and verified. Final result of modeling is the fields of soil water content, evapotranspiration and other water and heat balance components of the region under study for years 2012-2014 vegetation seasons.

TI  - Determination of relationship between basement faults and alteration zones in Bafq-Esfordi region, central Iran
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing was utilized for mineral exploration specifically to look for the presence of altered minerals. In addition, airborne magnetic data have been used for modelling of basement faults/structures. Furthermore, these data provide a synoptic view, which is helpful in the identification and delineation of various land forms, linear features and structural elements. Moreover, mapping geological lineaments is essential for regional exploration of hydro thermal deposits. The aim of this study is the determination of relationship between faults/structures and hydrothermal alteration zones based on geophysical and remote sensing data in the Esfordi area, central Iran. Basement faults were extracted by magnetic airborne data and alteration zones were detected using remote sensing data. Statistical and geostatistical parameters were determined in this area including correlation between areas of alteration zones and distances to faults, variograms and anisotropic These reveal that there is a direct correlation between alteration zones and basement faults in the study area.

TI  - ALOS: Automatic learning of an occupancy schedule based on a new prediction model for a smart heating management system
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In our day and age, lowering energy consumption in buildings is a must. Smart-buildings will provide the answer if and when they can adjust the required indoor temperature to the occupancy. Developing an occupancy model that forecasts the time of arrival and departure is therefore mandatory. Our article deals with the occupancy prediction model of a building meant for an inteligent heating management system. The prediction also integrates short and long duration of occupation/unoccupation. ALOS is based on an unsupervised clustering method (to classify the events 'departure' and 'arrival') and on the EM (Expectation Maximisation) algorithm with a new mixture model to determine short and long duration of the events. While most previous studies focused on either the residential or the tertiary building, our approach predicts occupancy in both types of buildings. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, it was tested on real occupancy datasets (familly consisting of 4 people and elderly person living alone). The results indicate that ALOS achieves excellent average prediction accuracies, notebaly from 80% up to 90%, which makes it efficient and provides easy implementation. Finally, a major strength of the ALOS method is that it only needs just under a week to integrate a change of the occupants' habits.

TI  - Large-scale rainfall-runoff-inundation modeling for upper Citarum River watershed, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Citarum River is one of the strategic rivers in West Java, Indonesia. Its total watershed area is approximately 1800km(2). Almost every year, the overflow from the Citarum River causes the inundation of most of the upper Citarum River watershed. To prevent and mitigate flood damage, it is necessary to understand the flooding characteristics. The region, however, suffers from a lack of observational data. Therefore, to analyze the inundation caused by flooding in the upper Citarum River watershed, a rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model was employed. It used the following multiple satellite-derived datasets as input data as well as for model verification: Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation, Hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle elevation Derivatives at multiple scales, Global Mosaics of the standard MODIS land cover type data product, and Landsat 7 satellite images. Parameter calibration was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was performed for February 2010. The results of this study show that the RRI model identifies inundation areas in large-scale river watersheds more effectively when using multiple satellite-derived datasets compared with the observed inundation map obtained from JICA in 2010 and Landsat 7 images. The model results can be improved if high-quality observed rainfall data, topographic data, and river cross-sectional data are available.

TI  - Estimation of Rice Height and Biomass Using Multitemporal SAR Sentinel-1 for Camargue, Southern France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The research and improvement of methods to be used for crop monitoring are currently major challenges, especially for radar images due to their speckle noise nature. The European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-1 constellation provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coverage with a 6-day revisit period at a high spatial resolution of pixel spacing of 20 m. Sentinel-1 data are considerably useful, as they provide valuable information of the vegetation cover. The objective of this work is to study the capabilities of multitemporal radar images for rice height and dry biomass retrievals using Sentinel-1 data. To do this, we train Sentinel-1 data against ground measurements with classical machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)) to estimate rice height and dry biomass. The study is carried out on a multitemporal Sentinel-1 dataset acquired from May 2017 to September 2017 over the Camargue region, southern France. The ground in-situ measurements were made in the same period to collect rice height and dry biomass over 11 rice fields. The images were processed in order to produce a radar stack in C-band including dual-polarization VV (Vertical receive and Vertical transmit) and VH (Vertical receive and Horizontal transmit) data. We found that non-parametric methods (SVR and RF) had a better performance over the parametric MLR method for rice biophysical parameter retrievals. The accuracy of rice height estimation showed that rice height retrieval was strongly correlated to the in-situ rice height from dual-polarization, in which Random Forest yielded the best performance with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.92 and the root mean square error (RMSE) 16% (7.9 cm). In addition, we demonstrated that the correlation of Sentinel-1 signal to the biomass was also very high in VH polarization with R-2 = 0.9 and RMSE = 18% (162 g.m(-2)) (with Random Forest method). Such results indicate that the highly qualified Sentinel-1 radar data could be well exploited for rice biomass and height retrieval and they could be used for operational tasks.

TI  - Relevance of healthcare reimbursement data to monitor syphilis epidemic: an alternative surveillance through the national health insurance database in France, 2011-2013
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In France, surveillance of early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent) relies on the clinician-based ResIST sentinel network. Although ResIST enables the monitoring of trends, a complete picture of the syphilis epidemic is not possible. More specifically, cases reported by this network are mostly diagnosed in free sexually transmitted infection clinics and hospitals (75% and 24%, respectively). This study aims to estimate the number and rate of diagnoses made outside these health facilities by exploring health insurance data.Methods An algorithm combining healthcare reimbursements for specific diagnostic tests and recommended treatment was fitted to identify syphilis cases. Sensitivity analyses were used to validate the algorithm. Age-standardised and gender-standardised diagnosis rates were estimated using census data.Results Between 2011 and 2013, 12 644 (7.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants) reimbursements were made for syphilis-related diagnoses. The annual number of cases increased by 22% from 2011 (n=3771, rate=6.7/100 000) to 2013 (n=4589, rate=8.2/100 000). The rate of syphilis diagnosis increased in men from 12.9/100 000to 16.0/100000, while it remained steady in women at approximately 1.8/100000. The disease burden was greatest in French overseas territories (18.1/100000) and in the Paris area (11.7 cases/100000).Conclusion Despite the lack of data on the number of confirmed diagnoses and information on sexual behaviour, these findings demonstrate the relevance of analysing insurance data to help monitor the syphilis epidemic in patients who visit general practitioners and non-hospital-based specialists. Thus, reimbursement database might be a relevant alternative source of continuous information on syphilis in countries with similar insurance-based healthcare systems.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes and Their Effect on the Flow Regime in the Upstream Dong Nai River Basin, Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The upstream Dong Nai River Basin is located in the country's key economic development region and its water resources are a key component of sustainable regional development. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on the flow regime in this tropical forest basin using a flow-duration curve analysis that has been widely used in Japan. This study combined two different temporal and spatial scales of satellite data, Landsat and Global Inventory Modeling, and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to analyze LUCC. Results from the land cover classification of five Landsat images between 1973 and 2014 indicated that the forest area decreased significantly in the period of 1994 to 2005 due to population growth, leading to land conversion for agriculture. Furthermore, secular changes in the annual GIMMS-NDVI data revealed that land cover changes occurred from 1996 and a large amount of forest was lost in 1999; however, due to the rapid regrowth of secondary forest of tropical forests and the development of the crop, the vegetation recovered shortly afterwards in 2000 before decreasing again after 2004. Following large-scale deforestation, the total discharge, maximum flow, and the plentiful, ordinary, low, and small-scale runoff increased sharply and decreased thereafter because of vegetation regrowth.

AB  - Background. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may downstage axillary disease in node-positive breast cancer. Several clinical trials have shown that sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery after NAC is feasible for these patients. We sought to evaluate the use of SLN surgery and ALND in cN1 patients undergoing NAC.Methods. We identified all patients with biopsy-proven cN1 breast cancer treated with NAC at our institution between January 2009 and December 2017. Approximated biologic subtype was determined by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Cochran-Armitage trend and Chi square tests were used for statistical analysis.Results. Of 430 cN1 patients treated with NAC, 93 (22%) underwent SLN surgery only, 100 (23%) underwent SLN and ALND, and 237 (55%) underwent ALND only. The use of SLN surgery (+/- ALND) increased from 28% in 2009 to 86% in 2017 (p < 0.001), while the performance of ALND decreased from 100% in 2009 to 38% in 2017 (p < 0.001). Among SLN+ patients who underwent ALND, disease was limited to the SLNs in 25/73 (34%) patients. The nodal pathologic complete response rate was 46% and varied by tumor subtype (p < 0.001). Among patients undergoing SLN surgery, ALND was avoided in 48% of patients overall and varied by biologic subtype: 55% ER-/HER2+, 61% ER+/HER2+, 62% ER-/HER2-, and 31% ER+/HER2- (p = 0.001). With shortterm follow-up, no nodal recurrences have occurred in patients without ALND.Conclusions. We observed a significant shift in axillary surgery for cN1 breast cancer patients treated with NAC, with increasing use of SLN surgery to assess nodal treatment response, and decreasing use of ALND.

TI  - Automated Snow Extent Mapping Based on Orthophoto Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the application of the k-means clustering in the process of automated snow extent mapping using orthophoto images generated using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithm from oblique aerial photographs taken by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A simple classification approach has been implemented to discriminate between snow-free and snow-covered terrain. The procedure uses the k-means clustering and classifies orthophoto images based on the three-dimensional space of red-green-blue (RGB) or near-infrared-red-green (NIRRG) or near-infrared-green-blue (NIRGB) bands. To test the method, several field experiments have been carried out, both in situations when snow cover was continuous and when it was patchy. The experiments have been conducted using three fixed-wing UAVs (swinglet CAM by senseFly, eBee by senseFly, and Birdie by FlyTech UAV) on 10/04/2015, 23/03/2016, and 16/03/2017 within three test sites in the Izerskie Mountains in southwestern Poland. The resulting snow extent maps, produced automatically using the classification method, have been validated against real snow extents delineated through a visual analysis and interpretation offered by human analysts. For the simplest classification setup, which assumes two classes in the k-means clustering, the extent of snow patches was estimated accurately, with areal underestimation of 4.6% (RGB) and overestimation of 5.5% (NIRGB). For continuous snow cover with sparse discontinuities at places where trees or bushes protruded from snow, the agreement between automatically produced snow extent maps and observations was better, i.e. 1.5% (underestimation with RGB) and 0.7-0.9% (overestimation, either with RGB or with NIRRG). Shadows on snow were found to be mainly responsible for the misclassification.

AB  - Case 1 involved a 75-year-old woman with breast cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL).Although we initially administered the R-CHOP regimen, the breast tumor increased in size and surgery had to be performed.After surgery, the R-CHOP regimen was re-initiated and DLBCL achieved clinical complete response.Case 2 involved a 74-year-old woman with breast cancer and gastric MALT lymphoma.After administration of rituximab and H. pylori eradication, a therapeutic effect was achieved in the lymphoma.A docetaxel and FEC regimen was continuously administered and surgery was performed. Case 3 involved a 62-year-old woman with breast cancer and follicular lymphoma.She presented with a history of DLBCL treatment.We performed mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which revealed metastasis of breast cancer, and axillary lymph node dissection was subsequently performed.Considering the pathological stage, adjuvant chemotherapy was needed.We selected the TCH regimen based on her past treatment.In conclusion, it is necessary to treat patients with double presentation of breast cancer and malignant lymphoma through cooperation with different departments.

TI  - Relationships between structural lineaments and Cenozoic volcanism, Tibesti swell, Saharan metacraton
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work reports an analysis of the relationships existing between the structural lineaments and the Cenozoic volcanism of the Tibesti area (northern Chad). Shield volcanoes, cinder cones, structural lineaments, intersection points of lineaments and faults are mapped using the combination of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Landsat satellite images of the Tibesti Volcanic Province.The interpretation of the distribution of these structural and morphological features allows constraining the structural/tectonic setting of the Tibesti. We show that the relationships between the lineaments and the volcanic centres of the Tibesti province can locally be explained as the result of the combination of two Riedel dextral tectonic systems, respectively oriented at N120 degrees E and N30-35 degrees E. Taking into account the geological features of the area, a geodynamical model is proposed: the emplacement of the Tibesti Volcanic Province results from the reactivation of inherited structures of the Saharan metacraton, characterized by relict rigid cratonic nuclei and metacratonic areas reworked during the Pan-African orogeny, among which is located the Tibesti. The contrasted behaviour of these rheologically different zones can explain the location and the evolution of the Tibesti swell and volcanism. The new data presented in this paper and their interpretation in terms of the emplacement of the Tibesti volcanic province in the Saharan metacraton bring a new and major information about the behaviour of the African plate within its collisional context with Europe.

TI  - NSQIP Analysis of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Rates for Breast Cancer: Implications for Resident and Fellow Participation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of the axilla in invasive breast cancer (IBC) has shifted away from more radical surgery such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), towards less invasive procedures, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy. Because of this shift, we hypothesize that there has been a national downward trend in ALND procedures, subsequently impacting surgical trainee exposure to this procedure using the ACS-NSQIP database to evaluate this.METHODS: Women with IBC were identified in the ACS-NSQIP database from 2007 to 2014. Procedures including ALND were identified using CPT codes. This number was divided by total cases, given a varying number of participating institutions each year. Next, cases involving resident participation were identified and divided by training level: junior (post graduate year-[PGY] 1-2), senior (PGY 3-5) and fellow (PGY >= 6). Two tailed z tests were used to compare proportions, with significance determined when p < 0.05.RESULTS: A total of 128,372 women were identified with IBC with 36,844 ALND. ALND rates decreased by an average of 2.43% yearly from 2007 to 2014. Resident participation significantly drops in 2011, from 49.3% before to 29.4% after (p < 0.01). Junior residents experienced a significant decrease in participation rate (43.3%-32.2%, p < 0.05). Senior residents and fellows experienced an upward trend in their participation, although not significant (51.2%-56.3%, p = 0.35, and 5.6%-11.6%, p = 0.056, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Using the ACS-NSQIP database, we demonstrate the downward trend in rate of ALND for IBC with subsequent decrease in resident participation. Junior residents experienced a significant decrease in their participation with no significant change for senior or fellow-level trainees. Awareness of this trend is important when creating future surgical curriculum changes for general surgery and fellowship training programs. (C) 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

TI  - Exploiting ConvNet Diversity for Flooding Identification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is the world's most costly type of natural disaster in terms of both economic losses and human causalities. A first and essential procedure toward flood monitoring is based on identifying the area most vulnerable to flooding, which gives authorities relevant regions to focus. In this letter, we propose several methods to perform flooding identification in high-resolution remote sensing images using deep learning. Specifically, some proposed techniques are based upon unique networks, such as dilated and deconvolutional ones, whereas others were conceived to exploit diversity of distinct networks in order to extract the maximum performance of each classifier. The evaluation of the proposed methods was conducted in a high-resolution remote sensing data set. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, providing improvements ranging from 1% to 4% in terms of the Jaccard Index.

TI  - Dynamics of Permafrost Coasts of Baydaratskaya Bay (Kara Sea) Based on Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic coasts composed of frozen deposits are extremely sensitive to climate change and human impact. They retreat with average rates of 1-2 m per year, depending on climatic and permafrost conditions. In recent decades, retreat rates have shown a tendency to increase. In this paper, we studied the coastal dynamics of two key sites (Ural and Yamal coasts) of Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea, where a gas pipeline had been constructed. Based on multi-temporal aerial and satellite imagery, we identified coastal erosion rates at several time lapses, in natural conditions and under human impact, and discussed their temporal variability. In addition to planimetric (m/yr), we calculated volumetric (m(3)/m/yr) retreat rates of erosional coasts using ArcticDEM. We also estimated the influence of geomorphology, lithology, and permafrost structure of the coasts on spatial variations of their dynamics. Erosional coasts of the Ural key site retreat with higher mean rates (1.2 m/yr and 8.7 m(3)/m/yr) as compared to the Yamal key site (0.3 m/yr and 3.7 m(3) /m/yr) due to their exposure to higher open sea waves, more complex lithology, higher ice content and lower coastal bluffs. Since the 1960s, coastal retreat rates have been growing on both coasts of Baydaratskaya Bay; we relate this effect with Arctic climate warming. From the 1960s to 2005, such growth was moderate, while in 2005-2016 it became rapid, which may be explained by the enhanced wave and thermal action or by the onset of industrial development. The adjacent coastal segments, originally accumulative, remained relatively stable from the 1960s to 2005. After 2005, a considerable part of them began to retreat as a result of changing weather conditions and/or increasing human impact.

TI  - Does the presence of sentinel lymph node macrometastases in breast cancer patients require axillary lymph node dissection?Single-center analysis
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the current guidelines on treatment of breast cancer patients, identification of metastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN (+)) is not an absolute indication for necessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In our study, we present long-term outcomes of treatment among SLN(+) patients referred for conservative treatment, for example, no further ALND. A total of 3145 breast cancer patients subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between November 2008 and June 2015. SLN metastases were identified in 719 patients (22.9%). Locoregional recurrences and distant metastases as endpoints were distinquished. The mean follow-up time for patients after ALND was 36.2 months (6-74 months); 18.8 months (6-38 months) for patients with SLN macrometastases without ALND; and 34.0 months (6-74 months) for patients with micrometastases. Adjuvant ALND was performed in 626 of SLN(+) patients. Conservative treatment was applied in the remaining 93 cases. Among SLN(+) patients without adjuvant ALND, there was one case of recurrence (1.07%). In the group of patients without SLN, metastases recurrence was noted in 32 patients (1.32%). Among SLN(+) patients diagnosed with macrometastases, recurrence concerned 2.01% of analyzed cases (all subjected to ALND). Lack of radical surgical treatment in SLN(+) breast cancer patients did not lead to worsening long-term outcomes. In the occurrence of macrometastases to the sentinel lymph node, abandoning completion axillary lymph node dissection might be a reasonable option. However, it would require continuation of current research, preferably involving a clinical trial.

TI  - A sustainable manufacturing system design: A fuzzy multi-objective optimization model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, there has been a growing concern about the environmental protection in public society as governments almost all over the world have initiated certain rules and regulations to promote energy saving and minimize the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in many manufacturing industries. The development of sustainable manufacturing systems is considered as one of the effective solutions to minimize the environmental impact. Lean approach is also considered as a proper method for achieving sustainability as it can reduce manufacturing wastes and increase the system efficiency and productivity. However, the lean approach does not include environmental waste of such as energy consumption and CO2 emissions when designing a lean manufacturing system. This paper addresses these issues by evaluating a sustainable manufacturing system design considering a measurement of energy consumption and CO2 emissions using different sources of energy (oil as direct energy source to generate thermal energy and oil or solar as indirect energy source to generate electricity). To this aim, a multi-objective mathematical model is developed incorporating the economic and ecological constraints aimed for minimization of the total cost, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions for a manufacturing system design. For the real world scenario, the uncertainty in a number of input parameters was handled through the development of a fuzzy multi-objective model. The study also addresses decision-making in the number of machines, the number of air-conditioning units, and the number of bulbs involved in each process of a manufacturing system in conjunction with a quantity of material flow for processed products. A real case study was used for examining the validation and applicability of the developed sustainable manufacturing system model using the fuzzy multi-objective approach.

TI  - The impact of the number of tuberculin skin test reactors and infection confirmation on the risk of future bovine tuberculosis incidents; a Northern Ireland perspective
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently policies enabling cattle herds to regain Official Tuberculosis Free (OTF) status after a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd incident vary between individual parts of the British Isles from requiring only one negative single comparative intradermal tuberculin test (SCITT) herd test when bTB infection is not confirmed to needing two consecutively negative SCITT herd tests after disclosure of two or more reactors, irrespective of bTB confirmation. This study used Kaplan-Meier curves and univariable and multivariable Cox Proportional Hazard models to evaluate the effect of the number of SCITT reactors and bTB confirmation on the risk of future bTB herd incident utilising data extracted from the national animal health database in Northern Ireland. Based on multivariable analyses the risk of a future bTB herd incident was positively associated with the number of SCITT reactors identified during the incident period (hazard ratio = 1.861 in incidents >5 SCITT reactors compared to incidents with only one SCITT reactor; P < 0.001), but not with bTB confirmation. These findings suggest that the probability of residual bTB infection in a herd increases with an increasing number of SCITT reactors disclosed during a bTB herd incident. It was concluded that bTB herd incidents with multiple SCITT reactors should be subjected to stricter control measures irrespective of bTB infection confirmation status.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of fluorescence intensity of ICG in sentinel nodes in early gastric cancer
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel node (SN) detection by dual tracer method using indocyanine green (ICG) and a radioisotope (RI) has been recommended for early gastric cancer. However, institutions are limited due to radioactivity in the RI method. The greatest advantage of the RI method is that it objectively assesses RI uptake as a numerical value. The aim of the present study was to verify the usefulness of ICG fluorescence intensity in SN.Seventeen patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in this study. RI uptake by each lymph node was measured using Navigator GPS and fluorescence nodes were identified using the hyper eye medical system (HEMS). Fluorescence intensity in fluorescence nodes was evaluated using ICG intensity imaging software (Mizuho, Japan) of the HEMS.The total number of dissected lymph nodes was 227, with an average of 13.3 per patient. The numbers of HN, FN-S, and FN-B were 64, 77, and 34. RI uptake was significantly greater by FN-S than by non-FN-S (P = 0.0016). The median fluorescence intensity value was higher in HN than in non-HN (P < 0.001). A correlation was observed between RI uptake and fluorescence intensity. Dissecting FNs with fluorescence intensity levels of 1-6 resulted in 92.1% dissection of HNs.It is possible that the evaluation of fluorescence intensity is useful for selected SNs instead of RI tracer. If fluorescence intensity is measurable in surgery, an infrared fluorescence method using ICG may be useful and safe for the detection of SN in early gastric cancer.

TI  - Comparison of the Performance of ALARM and SEBAL in Estimating the Actual Daily ET from Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Analytical Land Atmosphere Radiometer Model (ALARM) has been tested in several countries with observed evapotranspiration (ET) obtained from different ground-based methods, but none from a lysimeter, which is considered the most accurate ground-based method of measuring ET. The first objective of this work was to test ALARM against lysimeter ET data. The second objective was to compare the performance of ALARM with Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), the most widely used model for estimating ET from remotely sensed data. An experiment was conducted on a 1.5ha potato field in the Jordan Valley that has a weighing lysimeter located midfield. Potatoes were planted on the January 14, 2016, and harvested on the May 10, 2016. Three images from Landsat 8 were used to compute ALARM and SEBAL ET. The measured daily ET of the potatoes ranged from 5mmd-1 on March 22 to 7.5mmd-1 on April 23. ALARM underestimated the daily measured ET by 8% on March 22, 16% on April 7 and 33% on April 23 while SEBAL underestimated the daily measured ET by 4% on March 22, 15% on April 7 and 37% on April 23. Some modifications were made to improve the accuracy of ALARM and SEBAL ET estimation. The modified ALARM overestimated ET by 1% on March 22 and underestimated ET by 6 and 22% on April 7 and April 23, respectively. The modified SEBAL underestimated ET by 0.7, 10, and 35% on March 22, April 7, and April 23, respectively. These results demonstrated that the modified ALARM provides reasonable ET estimates that are superior to those obtained from SEBAL or modified SEBAL.

AB  - This paper aims at generating a long-term consistent record of Landsat-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products, which are central for producing downstream aquatic science products (e.g., concentrations of total suspended solids). The products are derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 observations leading to Landsat-8 era to enable retrospective analyses of inland and nearshore coastal waters. In doing so, the data processing was built into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) followed by vicariously calibrating Landsat-7 and -5 data using reference in situ measurements and near-concurrent ocean color products, respectively. The derived R rs products are then validated using (a) matchups using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data measured by in situ radiometers, i.e., AERONET-OC, and (b) ocean color products at select sites in North America. Following the vicarious calibration adjustments, it is found that the overall biases in R-rs products are significantly reduced. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE), however, indicate noticeable uncertainties due to random and systematic noise. Long-term (since 1984) seasonal R-rs composites over 12 coastal and inland systems are further evaluated to explore the utility of Landsat archive processed via SeaDAS. With all the qualitative and quantitative assessments, it is concluded that with careful algorithm developments, it is possible to discern natural variability in historic water quality conditions using heritage Landsat missions. This requires the changes in R-rs exceed maximum expected uncertainties, i.e., 0.0015 [1/sr], estimated from mean RMSEs associated with the matchups and intercomparison analyses. It is also anticipated that Landsat-5 products will be less susceptible to uncertainties in turbid waters with R-rs(660) > 0.004 [1/sr], which is equivalent of similar to 1.2% reflectance. Overall, end-users may utilize heritage R-rs products with "fitness-for-purpose" concept in mind, i.e., products could be valuable for one application but may not be viable for another. Further research should be dedicated to enhancing atmospheric correction to account for non-negligible near-infrared reflectance in CDOM-rich and extremely turbid waters.

TI  - 18-Year Ambient PM <sub>2.5</sub> Exposure and Night Light Trends in Indian Cities: Vulnerability Assessment
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is identified as one of the leading risk factors for morbidity and mortality in India. Here we estimate ambient PM2.5 exposure and its 18-year (1998-2015) trend in 109 Indian cities using satellite data and further classify them into six vulnerable classes (from index 1 for low vulnerability to index 6 for extreme vulnerability). PM2.5 exposure has shown a rapid increase in Delhi and the cities in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Amongst the cities with a population of more than 0.5 million (as per the 2011 census), Thiruvananthapuram is the least vulnerable and Aligarh is the most vulnerable city based on 18-year statistics. Only 27 cities are identified as 'low' to 'moderately' vulnerable to ambient air pollution. The median incremental rate of the annual PM(2.5 )exposure has increased by 57.9% (from 0.9 to 1.15 mu g m(-3) per year) with the night-light counts (a proxy for urbanization rate) increasing from < 20th percentile to > 80th percentile. 51 out of the 60 Indian cities chosen for the 'smart city' mission are highly vulnerable to PM2.5 exposure (vulnerability index > 2) and thereby face challenges to achieve the core objective of the mission (i.e., a sustainable environment). Our results will facilitate prioritizing a clean-air action plan for the cities based on their vulnerability rankings to achieve the maximum health benefit for the exposed population.

TI  - Associations Between 30-Day Mortality, Specialist Nursing, and Daily Physician Ward Rounds in a National Stroke Registry
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose-Well-organized stroke care is associated with better patient outcomes, but the most important organizational factors are unknown.Methods-Data were extracted from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme of adults with acute stroke treated in stroke hospitals in England and Wales between April 2013 and March 2015. Multilevel models with random intercepts for hospitals were used to estimate the association of each variable with 30-day mortality to estimate the impact of admission to differently organized hospitals.Results-Of the 143 578 patients with acute stroke admitted to 154 hospitals, 14.4% died within 30 days of admission. In adjusted analyses, admission to hospitals with higher ratios of nurses trained in swallow screening was associated with reduced odds of death (P=0.004), and admission to hospitals with daily physician ward rounds was associated with 10% lower odds of mortality compared with less-frequent ward rounds (95% CI, 0.82-0.98; P=0.013). Number of stroke admissions and overall ratio of registered nurses on duty at weekends were not found to be independently associated with mortality after adjustment for other factors.Conclusions-If these associations are causal, an extra 1332 deaths annually in England and Wales could be saved by hospitals providing care associated with a ratio of nurses trained in swallow screening of at least 3 per 10 beds and daily stroke physician ward rounds.

TI  - Indocyanine green and fluorescence lymphangiography for sentinel node identification in patients with melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) is a novel method for sentinel node localization. Our objective was to assess ICG and fluorescence imaging for preoperative and intraoperative utility.Methods: 87 eligible patients participated in this prospective study. All patients received injection of ICG dye in addition to both methylene blue and Tc-99m. Each sentinel node was assessed for the presence of each dye.Results: ICG was visible prior to incision in 44% of subjects. Tc-99m identified a mean of 1.89 SLN per patient. ICG identified a mean of 1.87 SLN while methylene blue (MB) dye identified a mean of 0.71 SLN. Tc-99m and ICG identified the same number of sentinel nodes per patient (P =.73) while methylene blue was inferior in its ability to localize sentinel nodes (P < .001).Conclusion: Our findings indicate that ICG/fluorescence imaging has limited ability to identify the nodal basin preoperatively, but is equivalent to Tc-99m for intraoperative identification of sentinel nodes and superior to MB.

TI  - Study of land use classification in an arid region using multispectral satellite images
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and deforestation have led to increased areas of wasteland in the northern region of the Akola district of Maharashtra, India. This study investigates land use variations in the arid region with the help of multi-temporal images. Land use maps were employed for analysis of different classes using image classification tools in ArcGIS software. Multispectral satellite imagery data were used to create land cover variation maps and land use forecast maps for the study area. The land use classification change maps were produced from LISS-III satellite images and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (2008 and 2015) using supervised classification techniques. Land use was divided into five major classes, i.e. agricultural land, developed land, wasteland, water bodies, and forestland. We observed significant changes in agricultural and forestland as a result of many factors including population growth, drought conditions, road infrastructure development, flooding, and soil erosion in the arid area. The overall accuracy of the supervised classification was 94.10% for 2008 and 88.14% for 2015, using the kappa method, which was a satisfactory result. The analysis of land use maps in the arid region revealed different patterns of use between 2008 and 2015. The results of this study may be useful for developing and implementing valuable management strategies for resource protection in the study area. These results show the potential for land use planning and development in arid regions using remote sensing and GIS technology.

TI  - Assessments of spatial land cover dynamic hotspots employing MODIS time-series datasets in the Ken River Basin of Central India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, advancements in remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) are progressively employed to combat sustainable land management issues. In the present study, advanced MODIS (MCD12Q1) time-series datasets have been utilized to identify the spatial land cover dynamic hotspots in the Ken River Basin (KRB) of Central India during the years 2001 to 2013. Annual MODIS land cover datasets were analyzed in the ArcGIS 10.2.2 environment. The "Combine" tool of the spatial analyst toolbox was employed to assign a unique combination of land cover dynamics. The result shows that the major land degradation was pronounced for natural vegetation (14.38%), and major land greening was observed for crop land (9.68%) and woody savannas (6.94%). The spatial analysis indicates that the upper KRB area has experienced the land degradation of natural vegetation class into crop land (3418.87 km(2)) and woody savannas (1242.23 km(2)) areas. The deciduous broadleaf forest of about 1043.6 km(2) area was changed into woody savannas. This might be the major transition to pronounce land greening in the study area. Moreover, major inter-transitions between crop land (669.31 km(2)) and woody savannas (874.09 km(2)) were observed during the years 2001-2013. The study reveals that the major part of natural vegetation (NV) has changed into woody savannas (WS) and crop land (CL). Furthermore, the spatial analysis shows that hotspots of land cover dynamics have been observed mostly in the upper part of KRB. Overall, land transition information of the present study can be used as an early-warning land cover dynamic system for sustainable management and development of land resources.

AB  - Forestland is the carrier and an important component of forest resources. How to accurately and quickly obtain information of forestland change is of important significance to monitoring and management of forest resources. In this study, we improved the training sample selection method in the decision tree classification to enhance the accuracy of forestland classification and change detection. The reliability of the improved method was tested with Yichun as a case. The results showed that the improved decision tree classification method outperformed traditional method with the accuracy of change detection being improved by 4.01%. Furthermore, the method improved the detection accuracy in regions with shadow, mist and arable land. Therefore, our method is more reliable for the detection of forestland changes.

TI  - Superpixel-Level CFAR Detectors for Ship Detection in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most widely employed remote sensing modalities for large-scale monitoring of maritime activity. Ship detection in SAR images is a challenging task due to inherent speckle, discernible sea clutter, and the little exploitable shape information the targets present. Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors, utilizing various sea clutter statistical models and thresholding schemes, are near ubiquitous in the literature. Very few of the proposed CFAR variants deviate from the classical CFAR topology; this letter proposes a modified topology, utilizing superpixels (SPs) in lieu of rectangular sliding windows to define CFAR guardbands and background. The aim is to achieve better target exclusion from the background band and reduced false detections. The performance of this modified SP-CFAR algorithm is demonstrated on TerraSAR-X and SENTINEL-1 images, achieving superior results in comparison to classical CFAR for various background distributions.

TI  - Incidence and outcomes of pediatric extremity melanoma: A propensity score matched SEER study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a paucity of literature on treatment of melanoma in children with surgical management extrapolated from adult experience. The incidence and clinical outcomes of pediatric extremity melanoma were studied.Methods: SEER registry was analyzed between 1973 and 2010 for patients <20 years old with extremity melanoma. Multivariate and propensity-score matched analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of survival.Results: Overall, 917 patients were identified with an age-adjusted incidence of 0.2/100,000 persons, annual percent change 0.96. Most had localized disease (77%), histology revealing melanoma-not otherwise specified (52%). Surgical procedures performed included wide local excision (50%), excisional biopsy (32%), lymphadenectomy (LA) (28%), and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (15%). Overall, 30-year disease specific mortality was 7% with lower survival for extremity melanoma (90%), males (89%), nodular histology (69%), and distant disease (36%) (all P < 0.05). Post-treatment multivariate analysis revealed localized disease (HR 9.76; P = 0.006) as an independent prognosticator of survival; earlier diagnostic years 1988-1999 (HR 2.606; P = 0.017) were a negative prognosticator of survival. Propensity-score matched analysis found no difference in survival between SLNB/LA vs no sampling for regional/distant disease.Conclusions: Pediatric extremity melanoma in SEER demonstrate no survival advantage between children undergoing sampling procedures vs no sampling for regional/distant disease.Type of study: Retrospective, prognostic study.

AB  - This letter aims to discuss a general framework that allows the direct interpretation of the wrapped differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry phase in terms of surface strain S and rotation R components. The methodology is demonstrated showing the estimation of strain and rotation components of a glacier flow using three TerraSAR-X interferometric geometries (ascending right-looking, descending right-looking, and descending left-looking). Finally, since the left-looking geometry can be difficult to obtain on a regular basis, the surface parallel flow assumption is extended to the phase gradients inversion in order to reduce the amount of necessary geometries from three to two.

T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster that significantly affects human life; therefore, precise monitoring and prediction is necessary to minimize drought damage. Conventional drought monitoring is based predominantly on ground observation stations; however, satellite imagery can be used to overcome the disadvantages of existing monitoring methods and has the advantage of monitoring wide areas. In this research, we assess the applicability of drought monitoring based on satellite imagery, focusing on historic droughts in 2001 and 2014, which caused major agricultural and hydrological issues in South Korea. To assess the applicability and accuracy of the drought index, drought impact areas in the study years were investigated, and spatiotemporal comparative analyses between the calculated drought index and previously affected areas were conducted. For drought monitoring based on satellite imagery, we used hydro-meteorological factors such as precipitation, land surface temperature, vegetation, and evapotranspiration, and applied remote sensing data from various sensors. We verified the effectiveness of using precipitation data for meteorological drought monitoring, vegetation and land surface temperature data for agricultural drought monitoring, and evapotranspiration data for hydrological drought monitoring. Moreover, we confirmed that the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) can be indirectly applied to agricultural or hydrological drought monitoring by determining the temporal correlation between SPI, calculated for various time scales, and satellite-based drought indices.

TI  - Spaces for local voices? A discourse analysis of the decisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the existence and shape of a discursive space for local and indigenous voices in the arena of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Critical literature on global environmental governance argues that dominant or hegemonic discourses shape international-level decision making on environmental protection, and delimit the boundaries of possible policy choices. These discourses are identified by such scholarship as reflecting a dominant worldview stemming from a capitalist view of value and a dichotomous view of nature as separate from culture, which precludes discursive spaces for worldviews based on different conceptions of value and more holistic views of nature as inextricably bound up with culture. Such worldviews are often held by indigenous peoples and local communities considered to be crucial in protecting the environment and natural resources. The present article aims to contribute to this debate by looking in detail at decisions of the parties to the CBD, which is an arena argued by some to be more open to local and indigenous voices. The article presents a discourse analysis of the CBD's decisions since its creation and up to its most recent meetings held in late 2016. The analysis applies the arguments of the critical literature to the decisions of the CBD in order to investigate how far they conform to the critical view of them, or whether, and if so to what extent, they host spaces for local and indigenous voices.

TI  - Land Use and Salinity Drive Changes in SAV Abundance and Community Composition
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conserving and restoring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are key management goals for estuaries worldwide because SAV integrates many aspects of water quality and provides a wide range of ecosystem services. Management strategies are typically focused on aggregated abundance of several SAV species, because species cannot be easily distinguished in remotely sensed data. Human land use and shoreline alteration have been shown to negatively impact SAV abundance, but the effects have varied with study, spatial scale, and location. The differences in reported effects may be partly due to the focus on abundance, which overlooks within-community and among-community dynamics that generate total SAV abundance. We analyzed long-term SAV aerial survey data (1984-2009) and ground observations of community composition (1984-2012) in subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay to integrate variations in abundance with differences in community composition. We identified five communities (mixed freshwater, milfoil-Zannichellia, mixed mesohaline, Zannichellia, and Ruppia-Zostera). Temporal variations in SAV abundance were more strongly related to community identity than to terrestrial stressors, and responses to stressors differed among communities and among species. In one fifth of the subestuaries, the community identity changed during the study, and the probability of such a change was positively related to the prevalence of riprapped shoreline in the subestuary. Mixed freshwater communities had the highest rates of recovery, and this may have been driven by Hydrilla verticillata, which was the single best predictor of SAV recovery rate. Additional species-specific and community-specific research will likely yield better understanding of the factors affecting community identity and SAV abundance, more accurate predictive models, and more effective management strategies.

A comparative analysis of the algorithms proposed by Wang and Liu, Plantchon and Darboux, Pelletier, and Tarboton was performed to eliminate artifacts on original satellite images associated with local topographic lows (depressions, pits). The smallest errors for different terrain conditions were obtained using the algorithm of Wang and Liu.

TI  - Zero Deforestation Agreement Assessment at Farm Level in Colombia Using ALOS PALSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the fast deforestation rates in the tropics, multiple international efforts have been launched to reduce deforestation and develop consistent methodologies to assess forest extension and change. Since 2010 Colombia implemented the Mainstream Sustainable Cattle Ranching project with the participation of small farmers in a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme where zero deforestation agreements are signed. To assess the fulfillment of such agreements at farm level, ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR fine beam dual imagery for years 2010 and 2016 was processed with ad-hoc routines to estimate stable forest, deforestation, and stable nonforest extension for 2615 participant farms in five heterogeneous regions of Colombia. Landsat VNIR imagery was integrated in the processing chain to reduce classification uncertainties due to radar limitations. Farms associated with Meta Foothills regions showed zero deforestation during the period analyzed (2010-2016), while other regions showed low deforestation rates with the exception of the Cesar River Valley (75 ha). Results, suggests that topography and dry weather conditions have an effect on radar-based mapping accuracy, i.e., deforestation and forest classes showed lower user accuracy values on mountainous and dry regions revealing overestimations in these environments. Nevertheless, overall ALOS Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) data provided overall accurate, relevant, and consistent information for forest change analysis for local zero deforestation agreements assessment. Improvements to preprocessing routines and integration of high dense radar time series should be further investigated to reduce classification errors from complex topography conditions.

TI  - Analysis of Landsat-8 OLI Imagery for Estimating Exposed Bedrock Fractions in Typical Karst Regions of Southwest China Using a Karst Bare-Rock Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) has become the primary ecoenvironmental problem in the karst regions of southwest China. The rapid and efficient acquisition of exposed bedrock fractions (EBF) is crucial for the monitoring and assessment of KRD degree and distribution within the highly heterogeneous landscapes. Remote-sensing indices provide a useful method for the quick mapping of the EBF at large scales. The currently available rock indices, however, are faced with insensitivity to bedrock change characteristics, which greatly limits their performances and suitability. To address this problem, we proposed a novel karst bare-rock index (KBRI) that applies shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) bands from Landsat-8 OLI imagery to maximally distinguish between exposed bedrock and other land cover types in southwest China. A linear regression model was thus established between KBRI and the EBF derived from in situ measurements. The model developed here was then validated with an independent experiment and applied over a large geographic area to produce regional maps of EBF in southwest China. Experimental results showed good performance on root mean square error (5.59%), mean absolute error (4.63%), root mean absolute percentage error (13.59%), and coefficient of determination (0.72), respectively. The advantages of the proposed method are reflected in its simplicity and minimal requirements for auxiliary data while still achieving comparatively better accuracy than existing related indices. Thus, the KBRI has the great potential for the application in other regions around the world with the similar geological backgrounds, thereby helping to address the similar or other related environmental issues. Results of this study provide baseline data for the KRD assessment and karst-ecosystem management in southwest China.

TI  - Risk factors for HIV infection among 15 to 25-year-old rural unmarried Yi adolescents in an ethnic minority region of China
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to analyze factors related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among 15 to 25-year-old rural unmarried Yi adolescents in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture from 2011 to 2016, and to investigate the relationship among the HIV-related risk factors.Three sites (Butuo, Zhaojue, and Ganluo counties) with a Yi population were selected from 2011 to 2016 in Liangshan prefecture. We used questionnaires to investigate demographic and behavioral characteristics and performed HIV testing. Logistic regression analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) were used to analyze the data.A total of 6311 qualified rural unmarried Yi adolescents were involved in this study, with an HIV infection rate of 4.18% (264/6311). Logistic regression analysis indicated that males (OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.17-2.08), illiteracy (OR=2.70, 95% CI=1.79-4.08), primary school education or below (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.12-2.36), history of out-migrating for work (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.18-2.13), and injecting drug user (IDU) (OR=6.42, 95% CI=3.06-13.46) contributed to the risk of HIV infection. MCA revealed a strong interrelationship between the following risk factors and HIV infection: aged 23 to 25 years, IDU, history of out-migrating for work, and ever having sexual behaviors.HIV infection among 15 to 25-year-old rural unmarried Yi adolescents in Liangshan is a serious issue. MCA and logistic regression analysis can be used to assess the relationship between risk factors for HIV infection.

TI  - Spatial-temporal change of land surface temperature across 285 cities in China: An urban-rural contrast perspective
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important theme in global climate change and urban sustainable development, the changes of land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) have beenmore and more focused by urban ecologists. This study used land-use data to identify the urban-rural areas in 285 cities in China and comparatively analyzed LST in urban-rural areas with the perspective of spatial-temporal dynamics heterogeneity. The results showed that, 98.9% of the cities exhibited SUHI effect in summer nighttime and the effect was stronger in northern cities than that in southern cities. In 2010, themean SUHI intensitywas the largest in summer daytime, with 4.6% of the cities having extreme SUHI of over 4 degrees C. From 2001 to 2010, the nighttime LST of most cities increased more quickly in urban areas compared with rural areas, with an increasing tendency of the urban-rural LST difference. The difference in the urban-rural LST change rate was concentrated in the range of 0-0.1 degrees C/year for 68.0% of cities in winter and 70.8% of cities in summer. For the higher LST increasing in urban areas compared with rural areas, thereweremore cities in summer thanwinter, indicating that the summer nighttimewas the key temporal period for SUHImanagement. Based on the change slope of urban-rural LST, cities were clustered into four types and the vital and major zones for urban thermal environment management were identified in China. The vital zone included cities in Hunan, Hubei and other central rising provinces as well as the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi Province. The major zone included most of the cities in Central Plain Urban Agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. These results can provide scientific basis for SUHI adaptation in China.

TI  - Evaluation of Optical and Radar Images Integration Methods for LULC Classification in Amazon Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to evaluate different methods to integrate (fusion and combination) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR-1) (Fine Beam Dual mode-FDB) and LANDSAT images in order to identify those which lead to higher accuracy of land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping in an agricultural frontier region in Amazon. One method used to integrate the multipolarized information in SAR images before the fusion process was also evaluated. In this method, the first principal component (PC1) of SAR data was used. Color compositions of fused data that presented better LULC classification were visually analyzed. Considering the proposed objective, the following fusion methods must be highlighted: Ehlers, Wavelet a trous, Intensity, Hue and Saturation (IHS), and selective principal component analysis (SPC). These latter three methods presented good results when processed using PC1 from ALOS/PALSAR-1 FBD backscatter filtered image or three SAR extracted and selected features. These results corroborate with the applicability of the proposed method for SAR data information integration. Distinct methods better discriminate different LULC classes. In general, densely forested classes were better characterized by the Ehlers_TM6 fusion method, in which at least the polarization HV was used. Intermediate and initial regeneration classes were better discriminated using SPC-fused data with PC1 of ALOS/PALSAR-1 FBD data. Bare soil and pasture classes were better discriminated in optical features and the PC1 of ALOS/PALSAR-1 FBD data fused by the IHS method. Soybean with approximately 40 days from seeding was better discriminated in image classification obtained from ALOS/PALSAR-1 FBD image.

TI  - Multifrequency and Full-Polarimetric SAR Assessment for Estimating Above Ground Biomass and Leaf Area Index in the Amazon Varzea Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of multifrequency and Full-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for retrieving both Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) in the Amazon floodplain forest environment. Two specific questions were proposed: (a) Does multifrequency SAR data perform more efficiently than single-frequency data in estimating LAI and AGB of varzea forests?; and (b) Are quad-pol SAR data more efficient than single- and dual-pol SAR data in estimating LAI and AGB of varzea forest? To answer these questions, data from different sources (TerraSAR-X Multi Look Ground Range Detected (MGD), Radarsat-2 Standard Qual-Pol, advanced land observing satellite (ALOS)/ phased-arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR-1). Fine-beam dual (FDB) and quad Polarimetric mode) were combined in 10 different scenarios to model both LAI and AGB. A R-platform routine was implemented to automatize the selection of the best regression models. Results indicated that ALOS/PALSAR variables provided the best estimates for both LAI and AGB. Single-frequency L-band data was more efficient than multifrequency SAR. PALSAR-FDB HV-dB provided the best LAI estimates during low-water season. The best AGB estimates at high-water season were obtained by PALSAR-1 quad-polarimetric data. The top three features for estimating AGB were proportion of volumetric scattering and both the first and second dominant phase difference between trihedral and dihedral scattering, extracted from Van Zyl and Touzi decomposition, respectively. The models selected for both AGB and LAI were parsimonious. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSEcv), relative overall RMSEcv (%) and R-2 value for LAI were 0.61%, 0.55% and 13%, respectively, and for AGB, they were 74.6 t.ha(-1), 0.88% and 46%, respectively. These results indicate that L-band (ALOS/PALSAR-1) has a high potential to provide quantitative and spatial information about structural forest attributes in floodplain forest environments. This potential may be extended not only with PALSAR-2 data but also to forthcoming missions (e.g., NISAR, Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation Lidar (GEDI), BIOMASS, Tandem-L) for promoting wall-to-wall AGB mapping with a high level of accuracy in dense tropical forest regions worldwide.

TI  - Differential Effects of the US Supreme Court's Same-Sex Marriage Decision on National Support for Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Civil Rights and Sexual Prejudice
T2  - SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage throughout all US states and territories. Before that decision, after, and 1 year later, this successive-independent samples study identified clusters of individuals across the US based on worldview ideologies and used those clusters to examine effects of the SCOTUS decision on support for gay rights and sexual prejudice. Participants were 407 adults from 49 US states and territories. A cluster analysis identified three worldview groups: conservatives (23.6%), moderates (30.2%), and progressives (46.2%). Although no overall changes emerged over time in support for gay rights or sexual prejudice, the conservative group showed a marked polarization after the SCOTUS decision, becoming less supportive of gay rights and more prejudiced. Worldviews explained 68.3% of the variance in same-sex marriage support, 67.5% in gay rights support, and 68.8% in sexual prejudice, effects approaching nearly three times a large-sized effect in the social sciences. These findings add nuance to our understanding of the attitudinal impact of court decisions or legislation around progressive issues like same-sex marriage and gay rights, as well as the potential barriers to cultural progress on these issues.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-1 imagery for flood management in a reservoir-regulated river basin
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood hazard monitoring and mapping is of great importance because it represents a significant contribution to risk management. The present study investigated the flood event that occurred downstream from the transboundary Strymon River basin, more specifically at Serres basin-a reservoir-regulated basin, in the beginning of 2015. The focus of this study was to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamic of the flood and the causes that initiated the hazard. Within the Serres basin, the Strymon transboundary river outflows to Lake Kerkini, which regulates water flow downstream for irrigation purposes and flood protection. For this research, a dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images was collected and processed covering the period of October 2014October 2015 to investigate the water level changes in Lake Kerkini. Based on SAR images, binary water/non-water products and multitemporal RGB amplitude images were generated and interpreted. Sentinel-1 products have proved to be an effective tool on flood hazard dynamic extension mapping and estimation of water extent bodies retained by small reservoirs. In agreement with hydro-meteorological data and the high-resolution DEM, it was conceived that the flood event occurred due to the water volume flowing from upstream in the reservoir and the large amount of water draining from the tributaries into nearby sub-basins. Moreover, inefficient water management of the overwhelming water flow through the dam could further strengthen the flood event. The proposed approach, which is entirely based on open access remotely sensed data and processing tools, could be implemented in the same area for past flood events to produce archive retrospective data, as well as in other similar reservoir-regulated river basins in terms of water management and flood risk management.

TI  - Tidally-generated internal waves in Southeast Hudson Bay
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The location of the amphidromic point of the M2 tide in Hudson Bay roughly coincides with Belcher Islands, a region where the surface mixed layer stays relatively fresh throughout summer and winter due to significant ice melt and river discharge. High-resolution satellite radar imagery for the ice-free season revealed that the coastal region in the south-east Belcher Islands is a hot spot for short-period internal wave activity. For a first investigation of tidal dynamics in the region, we took advantage of the sea ice platform to deploy an ice-tethered mooring consisting of nine conductivity and temperature sensors and an acoustic Doppler current profiler. The mooring was deployed at 65 m depth in January-March 2014 in a narrow channel between Broomfield and O'Leary islands located in the south-east tip of the Belcher Islands group in Hudson Bay (56 degrees 20'N, 79 degrees 30'W), northeast Canada. The surface mixed layer under the land-fast ice in this area stays relatively fresh through winter presumably because of significant winter river discharge in nearby James Bay. The mooring recorded oscillations of temperature and salinity throughout the whole water column, which were attributed to vertical displacement caused by internal tidal waves. The tidal harmonic analysis performed for the M2 tidal constituent showed the dominance of the baroclinic tide with maximum velocity amplitudes at the surface and decreasing with depth. Vertical displacements of water parcels derived from both temperature and salinity were statistically similar and displayed the maximum values of 11.9 m at 35 m (instrument depth). The combination of winter hydrographic data and summer satellite observations confirmed that the observed internal waves were generated by the interaction of strong tides, typical for Hudson Bay, with highly variable bottom topography southeast of the Belcher Islands archipelago.

TI  - Behavior of the foliar vigor in seringueira in different phenological periods
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf vigor of the rubber tree shows variation during the year, reflecting phenological phases that influence the production of latex, in addition to periods susceptible to diseases and pests. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the foliar vigor of clones GT 1 and RRIM 600 in April and; in August, September and October, in the municipality of Itiquira - MT, with climate classified as Aw. The vigores of clones GT 1 and RRIM 600 were evaluated in April and; in August, September and October, months preceding the annual defoliation and subsequent to natural refoliation, respectively. The foliar vigor was evaluated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Landsat 5 satellite images where its averages were evaluated by Tukey test at 5% probability, with a randomized block design and two treatments (clones). In the analysis the two clones presented NDVI in April with average leaf vigor, occurring difference in NDVI means, with greater in RRIM 600. Between August and October the vigor was high, with no difference between the mean NDVI of these clones. Clone GT 1 older than 19 years showed a change of foliar phenology in April. The RRIM 600 clone, after the age of 17 or 18 years, it showed the beginning of phenological change of leaves in April.

TI  - JAXA High-Resolution Land Use/Land Cover Map for Central Vietnam in 2007 and 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust remote monitoring of land cover changes is essential for a range of studies such as climate modeling, ecosystems, and environmental protection. However, since each satellite data has its own effective features, it is difficult to obtain high accuracy land cover products derived from a single satellite's data, perhaps because of cloud cover, suboptimal acquisition schedules, and the restriction of data accessibility. In this study, we integrated Landsat 5, 7, and 8, Sentinel-2, Advanced Land Observing Satellite Advanced Visual, and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (ALOS/AVNIR-2), ALOS Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) Mosaic, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Mosaic, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ancillary data, using kernel density estimation to map and analyze land use/cover change (LUCC) over Central Vietnam from 2007 to 2017. The region was classified into nine categories, i.e., water, urban, rice paddy, upland crops, grassland, orchard, forest, mangrove, and bare land by an automatic model which was trained and tested by 98,000 reference data collected from field surveys and visual interpretations. Results were the 2007 and 2017 classified maps with the same spatial resolutions of 10 m and the overall accuracies of 90.5% and 90.6%, respectively. They indicated that Central Vietnam experienced an extensive change in land cover (33 18% of the total area) during the study period. Gross gains in forests (2680 km 2 ) and water bodies (570 km 2 ) were primarily from conversion of orchards, paddy fields, and crops. Total losses in bare land (495 km 2 ) and paddy (485 km 2 ) were largely to due transformation to croplands and urban & other infrastructure lands. In addition, the results demonstrated that using global land cover products for specific applications is impaired because of uncertainties and inconsistencies. These findings are essential for the development of resource management strategy and environmental studies.

TI  - Modelling the relationship between groundwater depth and NDVI using time series regression with Distributed Lag Models
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater plays a key role in hydrological processes, including in determining aboveground vegetal growth characteristics and species distribution. This study aimed at estimating time-series data of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using groundwater depth as a predictor in two land cover types: grassland and shrubland. The study also investigated the significance of past (lagged) groundwater and NDVI in estimating the current NDVI. Results showed that lagged groundwater depth and vegetation conditions influence the amount of current NDVI. It was also observed that first lags of groundwater depth and NDVI were significant predictors of NDVI in grassland. In addition, first and second lags of NDVI were consistently significant predictors of NDVI in shrubland. This shows the importance of vegetation type when modelling the relationship between groundwater depth and NDVI.

TI  - Extent of regional lymph node surgery and impact on outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer and limited axillary disease undergoing mastectomy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Management of the axilla in patients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) has evolved. Recent trials support less extensive axillary surgery in patients undergoing mastectomy. We examine factors affecting regional lymph node (RLN) surgery and outcomes in patients with ESBC undergoing mastectomy.Methods Women with clinical T1/2 N0 M0 invasive BC who underwent mastectomy with 1-2 positive nodes were selected from the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Axillary surgery was defined by number of RLNs examined: 1-5 sentinel LN dissection (SLND), and >= 10 axillary LND (ALND). Binary logistic regression and survival analyses were performed to assess the association between axillary surgery and clinical characteristics, and overall survival (OS), respectively.Results 34,243 patients were included: 13,821 SLND (40%) and 20,422 ALND (60%). SLND significantly increased from 21% (2004) to 45% (2015) (p < .001). Independent factors associated with SLND were treatment year, non-Academic centers, geographic region, tumor histology, and postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). Multivariable survival analysis showed that ALND was associated with better OS (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.83, p < .001) relative to SLND; however, there was no difference in patients with LN micrometastases treated without RT (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73-1.05, p = .153) or patients receiving PMRT (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76-1.13, p = .433).Conclusions SLND has significantly increased in patients undergoing mastectomy with limited axillary disease and is influenced by patient, tumor, and treatment factors. Survival outcomes did not differ by axillary treatment for patients with LN micrometastases treated without RT or patients who received PMRT. SLND may be considered in select patients with ESBC and limited axillary disease undergoing mastectomy.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of primary producers in shallow lakes as seen from space: Intra-annual observations from Sentinel-2A
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the current high anthropic pressure and climate change scenarios, a trend towards increasing changes in the trophic status of shallow lakes, and the development of opportunistic floating species is to be expected. This raises the need for monitoring and management actions to prevent widespread environmentally negative effects (e.g., anoxia). An efficient approach to monitoring water quality and primary producers in inland waters is to integrate in situ with remote sensing data. In this work, satellite multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2 A are used to assess the intra-annual spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton abundance, in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and macrophyte Leaf Area Index (LAI) in a shallow eutrophic fluvial lake system (Mantua Lakes, Italy). Chl-a concentrations and LAI were derived from Sentinel-2 A data by applying a semi-empirical band ratio algorithm combined with a bio-optical model (BOMBER) for the former (Chl-a), and a semi-empirical model for the latter (LAI). These products were validated against in situ data (rRMSE = 20% for both products; R-2 = 0.93 for Chl-a; R-2 = 0.83 for LAI). Phytoplankton maps showed a marked intra-annual spatial and temporal variability, generally revealing a Chl-a concentration gradient from lotic to lentic waters. Air temperature was the main driver of Chl-a concentration, followed by water discharge and precipitation. The macrophyte LAI followed aquatic plant growth seasonally, and was independent of the hydro-meteorological data. Allochthonous and invasive macrophyte species (such as Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala) had higher LAI compared than the Mantua Lakes' autochthonous floating-leaved species (e.g., Trapa natans and Nuphar lutea). Maps of the abundance of primary producers can be used to follow the temporal and spatial evolution of different communities and support management actions, e.g., by identifying potential algal bloom hotspots, or the optimal timing for measures to control invasive species overgrowth.

TI  - Supervised Classification of Multisensor Remotely Sensed Images Using a Deep Learning Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method to efficiently combine information from multisensor remotely sensed images for pixel-wise semantic classification. The CNN features obtained from multiple spectral bands are fused at the initial layers of deep neural networks as opposed to final layers. The early fusion architecture has fewer parameters and thereby reduces the computational time and GPU memory during training and inference. We also propose a composite fusion architecture that fuses features throughout the network. The methods were validated on four different datasets: ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, IEEE Zeebruges and Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 dataset. For the Sentinel-1,-2 datasets, we obtain the ground truth labels for three classes from OpenStreetMap. Results on all the images show early fusion, specifically after layer three of the network, achieves results similar to or better than a decision level fusion mechanism. The performance of the proposed architecture is also on par with the state-of-the-art results.

TI  - Monitoring of the 2015 Villarrica Volcano Eruption by Means of DLR's Experimental TET-1 Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Villarrica Volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the South Andes Volcanic Zone. This article presents the results of a monitoring of the time before and after the 3 March 2015 eruption by analyzing nine satellite images acquired by the Technology Experiment Carrier-1 (TET-1), a small experimental German Aerospace Center (DLR) satellite. An atmospheric correction of the TET-1 data is presented, based on the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Emissivity Database (GDEM) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water vapor data with the shortest temporal baseline to the TET-1 acquisitions. Next, the temperature, area coverage, and radiant power of the detected thermal hotspots were derived at subpixel level and compared with observations derived from MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. Thermal anomalies were detected nine days before the eruption. After the decrease of the radiant power following the 3 March 2015 eruption, a stronger increase of the radiant power was observed on 25 April 2015. In addition, we show that the eruption-related ash coverage of the glacier at Villarrica Volcano could clearly be detected in TET-1 imagery. Landsat-8 imagery was analyzed for comparison. The information extracted from the TET-1 thermal data is thought be used in future to support and complement ground-based observations of active volcanoes.

TI  - InSAR Monitoring of Italian Coastline Revealing Natural and Anthropogenic Ground Deformation Phenomena and Future Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we use X and C-band SAR data provided by the COSMO-SkyMed and ENVISAT missions to detect and measure some ground deformation phenomena along six coastal areas of Italy. In particular, we exploit multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), i.e., small baseline subsets (SBAS) and interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) methods, to retrieve the deformation rate maps and time series for each investigated area. Multi-temporal InSAR analysis revealed local subsidence and uplifting effects in Ravenna Coastal Areas, Fiumicino, Campi Flegrei, Sibari Plain, Augusta Bay, and Taranto Gulf. Our work is meant as a demonstrator to show how InSAR-based analysis can provide a detailed understanding of the coastal hazards. Such analysis also opens up new monitoring scenarios such as the possibility of designing a near real-time surveillance service based on Sentinel-1 SAR data.

TI  - Recovery Rates of Wetland Vegetation Greenness in Severely Burned Ecosystems of Alaska Derived from Satellite Image Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of wildfire impacts at the scale of less than a square kilometer can reveal important patterns of vegetation recovery and regrowth in freshwater Arctic and boreal regions. For this study, NASA Landsat burned area products since the year 2000, and a near 20-year record of vegetation green cover from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite sensor were combined to reconstruct the recovery rates and seasonal profiles of burned wetland ecosystems in Alaska. Region-wide breakpoint analysis results showed that significant structural change could be detected in the 250-m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for the vast majority of wetland locations in the major Yukon river drainages of interior Alaska that had burned at high severity since the year 2001. Additional comparisons showed that wetland cover locations across Alaska that have burned at high severity subsequently recovered their green cover seasonal profiles to relatively stable pre-fire levels in less than 10 years. Negative changes in the MODIS NDVI, namely lower greenness in 2017 than pre-fire and incomplete greenness recovery, were more commonly detected in burned wetland areas after 2013. In the years prior to 2013, the NDVI change tended to be positive (higher greenness in 2017 than pre-fire) at burned wetland elevations lower than 400 m, whereas burned wetland locations at higher elevation showed relatively few positive greenness recovery changes by 2017.

TI  - Altmetric Versus Bibliometric Perspective Regarding Publication Impact and Force
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses highlight key publications, which have been considered to be the most influential in their field. The hypothesis was that highly cited articles would correlate positively with levels of evidence and Altmetric scores (AS) and rank.Surgery as a search term was entered into Thomson Reuter's Web of Science database to identify all English-language full articles. The 100 most cited articles were analysed by topic, journal, author, year, institution, and AS.By bibliometric criteria, eligible articles numbered 286,122 and the median (range) citation number was 574 (446-5746). The most cited article (Dindo et al.) classified surgical complications by severity score (5746 citations). Annals of Surgery published most articles and received most citations (26,457). The country and year with most publications were the USA (n = 50) and 1999 (n = 11). By Altmetric criteria, the article with the highest AS was by Bigelow et al. (AS = 53, hypothermia's role in cardiac surgery); Annals of Surgery published most articles, and the country and year with most publications were USA (n = 4) and 2007 (n = 3). Level-1-evidence articles numbered 13, but no correlation was found between evidence level and citation number (SCC 0.094, p = 0.352) or AS (SCC = 0.149, p = 0.244). Median AS was 0 (0-53), and in articles published after the year 2000, AS was associated with citation number (r = 0.461, p = 0.001) and citation rate index (r = 0.455, p = 0.002). AS was not associated with journal impact factor (r = 0.160, p = 0.118).Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses provide important but different perspectives regarding article impact, which are unrelated to evidence level.

TI  - Tea plantations as a driving force of long-term land use and population changes in the Eastern Himalayan piedmont
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing the long-term impacts of tea plantations on land use and cover (LULC) change over time is important for making policy decisions on management and conservation. This can be very effectively done by integrating historical and remote sensing data; however, such approach has rarely been used to date. The present study analysed the role of the large tea plantation system in the forest cover change in 2105.9 km(2) of the Himalayan piedmont in India's West Bengal state, from the first settled agriculture in the mid-19th century to present day. The impact of domestic and international markets together with local factors such as floods on tea plantation development were also investigated to identify potential scenarios of LULC change in the next few decades. Analysis of historical and remote sensing data as well as census reports revealed that between 1874 and 2010, forest area decreased by 69.5% and land under tea cultivation increased to 30.7%. Population density grew as much as 5122.2% to 470 people km(-2) between 1872 and 2011. Piedmont development was not uniform and denoted two periods: new land use structure formation (1874-1930) and its further stabilization (1930-2010). The first period showed rapid deforestation at an annual rate of 16-30 km(2), with an increase of tea production areas up to 16 km(2) per year. The second period saw slower deforestation rates (2-4 km(2) annually) and steady growth of tea production areas (2 km(2) annually). Population growth changed from workforce immigration to settled families. Limited space for settlement expansion favoured population concentration and initiated urbanization processes. Despite the initiation of deforestation and migration through the location of tea gardens, the close relationship between deforestation and population density has not been found in piedmont. At the early stages of plantation development, the greatest deforestation occurred at the lowest population density in the piedmont history. Later, a significant decline in the deforestation rate was accompanied by a demographic explosion. At the same time, reserved forest played the very important role in preserving the remnants of forest cover. Features of the natural environment and land use policy led to tea cultivation approaching maximum expansion in the studied area.

TI  - Use of the temperature-vegetation dryness index for remote sensing grassland moisture conditions in the vicinity of a lignite open-cast mine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities, especially resulting in changes in the water conditions, usually disturb biological and agricultural functions of grasslands, leading to their degradation, often on large areas. Remote sensing observations of such changes in grassland ecosystems evoke a great interest, but they are still a difficult task, especially when performed on industrial and mining areas. This paper presents a new effective method of remote sensing of grassland moisture conditions based on temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) calculated from free Landsat imagery, and employing the TVDI spatial variability estimated from a semivariance analysis. The practical applicability of the method is demonstrated on the example of monitoring of the extensive neighborhood of lignite open-cast mine within a period of a few years. Besides, the developed method was validated at the studied area, using in situ information. Thus, we demonstrated that TVDI may serve as an effective indicator of grassland moisture conditions, even in problematic areas.

TI  - Assessing the potential of multi-seasonal high resolution Pleiades satellite imagery for mapping urban tree species
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the potential of five seasonal high resolution Pleiades satellite images for improving urban tree species classification in the City of Tampa, FL, USA. We assessed and compared the capabilities of individual and combined Pleiades images acquired during different seasons for classifying the urban tree species to understand the seasonal effect on tree species mapping accuracy. The seven species and groups included sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandifiora). A multi-level classification system was adopted to classify image objects of the tree species and groups. Species classification performance was compared between the five individual seasonal Pleiades images, between two combined dry-wet season images, and between the optimal single season and combined dry-wet season image data. Shade image objects were spectrally normalized to similar sunlit image objects. The tree species fraction features were extracted from the seasonal images using the Mixture Tuned Matching Filtering approach and used as additional features to a set of spectral and spatial/textural features. Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers were used to classify the seven tree species and groups with image objects features. The experimental results indicate significantly improved tree species mapping accuracies using late spring season (April) image compared to all other seasonal images (p < 0.01), and combined dry-wet season images performed even better. Results suggest a significant seasonal effect on tree species classification. The results also demonstrate that the Random Forest outperformed the Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers for tree species classification. Therefore, in practice, it is important to choose appropriate seasonal remote sensing data for mapping tree species.

TI  - Investigations on the Coregistration of Sentinel-1 TOPS with the Conventional Cross-Correlation Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sentinel-1 TOPS mode, the antenna sweeps in the azimuth direction for the purpose of illuminating the targets with the entire azimuth antenna pattern (AAP). This azimuth sweeping introduces an extra high-frequency Doppler term into the impulse response function (IRF), which poses a more strict coregistration accuracy for the interferometric purpose. A 1/1000 pixel coregistration accuracy is required for the interferometric phase error to be negligible, and the enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) method is applied for achieving such accuracy. However, since ESD derives miscoregistration from cross-interferometric phase, and phase is always wrapped to [-pi, pi) an initial coregistration method with enough accuracy is required to resolve the phase ambiguity in ESD. The mainstream for initial coregistration that meets this requirement is the geometrical approach, which accuracy mainly depends on the accuracy of orbits. In this article, the authors propose to investigate the feasibility of using the conventional coregistration approach, namely the cross-correlation-and-rigid-transformation, as the initial coregistration method. The aim is to quantify the coregistration accuracy for cross-correlation-and-rigid-transformation using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and determine whether this method could eventually help to resolve the phase ambiguities of ESD. In addition, we studied the feasibility and robustness of the cross-correlation plus ESD under different conditions. For validation, we checked whether the cross-correlation plus ESD approach could reach the same coregistration accuracy as geometrical plus ESD approach. In general, for large areas with enough coherence and little topography variance, the cross-correlation method could be used as an alternative to the geometrical approach. The interferogram from the two different approaches (with ESD applied afterward) shows a negligible difference under such circumstances.

TI  - Geological Mapping in Western Tasmania Using Radar and Random Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral exploration and geological mapping of highly prospective areas in western Tasmania, southern Australia, is challenging due to steep topography, dense vegetation, and limited outcrop. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can potentially penetrate vegetation canopies and assist geological mapping in this environment. This study applies manual and automated lithological classification methods to airborne polarimetric TopSAR and geophysical data in the Heazlewood region, western Tasmania. Major discrepancies between classification results and the existing geological map generated fieldwork targets that led to the discovery of previously unmapped rock units. Manual analysis of radar image texture was essential for the identification of lithological boundaries. Automated pixel-based classification of radar data using Random Forests achieved poor results despite the inclusion of textural information derived from gray level co-occurrence matrices. This is because the majority of manually identified features within the radar imagery result from geobotanical and geomorphological relationships, rather than direct imaging of surficial lithological variations. Inconsistent relationships between geology and vegetation or geology and topography limit the reliability of TopSAR interpretations for geological mapping in this environment. However, Random Forest classifications, based on geophysical data and validated against manual interpretations, were accurate (similar to 90%) even when using limited training data (similar to 0.15% of total data). These classifications identified a previously unmapped region of mafic-ultramafic rocks, the presence of which was verified through fieldwork. This study validates the application of machine learning for geological mapping in remote and inaccessible localities but also highlights the limitations of SAR data in thickly vegetated terrain.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Dynamics and Assessing the Ecosystem Service Values in the Trans-Boundary Gandaki River Basin, Central Himalayas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover is a fundamental variable that affects many parts of social and physical environmental aspects. Land use and land cover changes (LUCC) has been known as one of the key drivers of affecting in ecosystem services. The trans-boundary Gandaki River Basin (GRB) is the part of Central Himalayas, a tributary of Ganges mega-river basin plays a crucial role on LUCC and ecosystem services. Due to the large topographic variances, the basin has existed various land cover types including cropland, forest cover, built-up area, river/lake, wetland, snow/glacier, grassland, barren land and bush/shrub. This study used Landsat 5-TM (1990), Landsat 8-OLI (2015) satellite image and existing national land cover database of Nepal of the year 1990 to analyze LUCC and impact on ecosystem service values between 1990 and 2015. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to obtain the various land cover types. To estimate the ecosystem services values, this study used coefficients values of ecosystem services delivered by each land cover class. The combined use of GIS and remote sensing analysis has revealed that grassland and snow cover decreased from 10.62% to 7.62% and 9.55% to 7.27%, respectively compared to other land cover types during the 25 years study period. Conversely, cropland, forest and built-up area have increased from 31.78% to 32.67%, 32.47-33.22% and 0.19-0.59%, respectively in the same period. The total ecosystem service values (ESV) was increased from 50.16 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 51.84 x 10(8) USD y(-1) during the 25 years in the GRB. In terms of ESV of each of land cover types, the ESV of cropland, forest, water bodies, barren land were increased, whereas, the ESV of snow/glacier and grassland were decreased. The total ESV of grassland and snow/glacier cover were decreased from 3.12 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 1.93 x 10(8) USD y(-1) and 0.26 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 0.19 x 10(8) USD y(-1), respectively between 1990 and 2015. The findings of the study could be a scientific reference for the watershed management and policy formulation to the trans-boundary watershed.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the capability of the longer wavelength (L-band) and fine mode images of the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and the optical spectral bands of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) to map sedimentary formations and structures of the Marmul region, Central Oman. Results of study shows that the principal components image of the visible and near infrared-shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectral bands of the ASTER have potential to discriminate the occurrence and distribution of marine and Quaternary sedimentary formations of the region. The color composite image developed using PALSAR data (R:HH + HV; G:HH; B:HV) has capable to differentiate the occurrence of the sedimentary formations and structures of the region. We developed ratios images by summing the HH intensity as a numerator and the HV intensity as a denominator (R:HH+(HH + HV)/HV, G:HH + HV, B:HH/HV), and by summing the HV intensity as a numerator and the HH intensity as a denominator (R:HV+(HH + HV)/HH, G:HV + HH, B:HV/HH) to study better the sedimentary formations and structures. The images discriminated well the occurrence of the limestones and shale formations of the marine deposits, the wadi alluvium of the Quaternary deposits and the manmade building structures of the region. We studied the minerals of the sedimentary formations using VNIR-SWIR spectral bands of the ASTER by spectral angle mapper (SAM) image processing method. The study showed presence of carbonates, silicates and OH bearing aluminosilicate minerals in the formations. The image interpretations are verified in the field and confirmed by the laboratory studies.

TI  - Quantifying Surface Urban Heat Island Formation in the World Heritage Tropical Mountain City of Sri Lanka
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, and its adverse impacts, are becoming major research foci in various interrelated fields due to rapid changes in urban ecological environments. Various cities have been investigated in previous studies, and most of the findings have facilitated the introduction of proper mitigation measures to overcome the negative impact of UHI. At present, most of the mountain cities of the world have undergone rapid urban development, and this has resulted in the increasing surface UHI (SUHI) phenomenon. Hence, this study focuses on quantifying SUHI in Kandy City, the world heritage tropical mountain city of Sri Lanka, using Landsat data (1996 and 2017) based on the mean land surface temperature (LST), the difference between the fraction of impervious surfaces (IS), and the fraction of green space (GS). Additionally, we examined the relationship of LST to the green space/impervious surface fraction ratio (GS/IS fraction ratio) and the magnitude of the GS/IS fraction ratio. The SUHI intensity (SUHII) was calculated based on the temperature difference between main land use/cover categories and the temperature difference between urban-rural zones. We demarcated the rural zone based on the fraction of IS recorded, <10%, along with the urban-rural gradient zone. The result shows a SUHII increase from 3.9 degrees C in 1996 to 6.2 degrees C in 2017 along the urban-rural gradient between the urban and rural zones (10 < IS). These results relate to the rapid urban expansion of the study areas from 1996 to 2017. Most of the natural surfaces have changed to impervious surfaces, causing an increase of SUHI in Kandy City. The mean LST has a positive relationship with the fraction of IS and a negative relationship with the fraction of GS. Additionally, the GS/IS fraction ratio shows a rapid decline. Thus, the findings of this study can be considered as a proxy indicator for introducing proper landscape and urban planning for the World Heritage tropical mountain city of Kandy in Sri Lanka.

TI  - Plant identity, but not diversity, and agroecosystem characteristics affect the occurrence of <i>M</i>. <i>robertsii</i> in an organic cropping system
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic farmers rely largely on cultural practices, such as crop rotation and cover cropping, and on biological control to manage pests. Winter cover crops add diversity to agroecosystems and can benefit soil conservation and health, retention and supply of soil nutrients, regulation of arthropods, and crop yields. Within the framework of a three-year experiment to investigate ecosystem services and disservices associated with 12 winter cover crop treatments during the transition of a small grain - corn - soybean production system to organic management, we examined the effects of cash crop and crop management, cover crop species and diversity, arthropods, and soil properties on Metarhizium spp. in a single field site in central Pennsylvania, USA. We used sentinel insect assays with Galleria mellonella L. to determine the relative occurrence of Metarhizium spp. in soil samples from treatment plots. M. robertsii was the only species detected, and therefore Metarhizium species diversity was not related to cover crop diversity. Detection of M. robertsii was lower in cover crop monocultures and mixtures containing brassicas compared to those with legumes. M. robertsii was detected more frequently in the standing cover crops in the corn phase of the rotation than in the soybean phase, but there was no difference in soil samples in the corn and soybeans after cover crop termination. In samples from cover crops, 33% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with cover crop biomass in the previous fall, the biomass of weeds in the current season (spring), soil moisture, Ca, and timing of sampling in days after planting, and by negative correlations with number of days since disturbance prior to soil sampling and percent sand. In samples from corn and soybeans, 23% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with soil labile C, electrical conductivity, and activity-density of ground beetles (Carabidae), and by negative correlations with increasing number of days after planting relative to time of sampling, percent sand, and activity-density of mites. The complex interactions of multiple biotic and abiotic factors that shape the soil community requires further research to develop an understanding of how to manage production systems and practices to promote and conserve biological control in the soil.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma: Which hot nodes should be harvested and is blue dye really necessary?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The '10% rule' has become widely accepted by surgeons performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma. The purpose of this study was to compare the '10% rule' with alternative node harvesting criteria. In particular, we were interested to see whether the use of blue dye had any impact on the sensitivity of the test and whether it is necessary to remove all hot nodes.Methods: We reviewed 537 SLNBs performed for primary melanoma from 2009-2015. SLNB was offered to all patients with 1-4 mm Breslow thickness melanoma and sentinel nodes were harvested according to the '10% rule'.Results: One hundred sixteen patients (22%) had at least one positive sentinel node and there were 45 positive nodal basins from which more than one sentinel node had been harvested. Excluding blue dye and sampling only hot nodes would have enabled a 5% reduction in nodes harvested, without any compromise in the sensitivity of the test. However, applying harvesting criteria whereby not all hot nodes are taken was associated with a loss of sensitivity, with positive sentinel nodes being missed and patients understaged.Conclusions: Our data do not support the continued use of blue dye in SLNB for melanoma, as it does not improve the sensitivity of the test. This series adds to growing evidence, suggesting that the '10% rule' with the inclusion of blue nodes should be reconsidered and that radiocolloid tracer alone is sufficient for sentinel node localisation.

TI  - Applying Built-Up and Bare-Soil Indices from Landsat 8 to Cities in Dry Climates
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid and semi-arid regions have different spectral characteristics from other climatic regions. Therefore, appropriate remotely sensed indicators of land use and land cover types need to be defined for arid and semi-arid lands, as indices developed for other climatic regions may not give plausible results in arid and semi-arid regions. For instance, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) are unable to distinguish between built-up areas and bare and dry soil that surrounds many cities in dry climates. This paper proposes the application of two newly developed indices, the dry built-up index (DBI) and dry bare-soil index (DBSI) to map built-up and bare areas in a dry climate from Landsat 8. The developed DBI and DBSI were applied to map urban areas and bare soil in the city of Erbil, Iraq. The results show an overall classification accuracy of 93% ( = 0.86) and 92% ( = 0.84) for DBI and DBSI, respectively. The results indicate the suitability of the proposed indices to discriminate between urban areas and bare soil in arid and semi-arid climates.

TI  - Monitoring of Snow Cover Variability in Chenab Basin Using IRS AWiFS Sensor
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of seasonal snow cover is important for many applications such as melt runoff estimation, climate change studies and strategic requirements. Contribution of seasonal snow melt runoff of Chenab River is significant and important to meet hydrological requirement at foothills. Seasonal snow cover of Chandra, Bhaga, Miyar, Bhut, Warwan and Ravi, six major tributaries of Chenab River, becomes crucial to assess the water availability. In addition, altitudinal distribution of snow cover significantly influences the melt runoff which is highly sensitive to minor variations in atmospheric temperature. In this investigation, remote sensing based Normalized Difference Snow Index technique has been used to generate 10 daily snow cover product. Snow cover monitoring of all the sub-basins were carried out for 10 years from 2004-2005 to 2013-2014 during hydrological year (October to June) using Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) of Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS). Accumulation and ablation patterns of snow cover have also been analyzed for the six sub-basins. Accumulation and ablation pattern of snow cover, from 2004 to 2014 which shows slightly increasing trend for all the subbasins. Meteorological data of Kelong at Bhaga sub-basin was also analysed. Average monthly snow line altitude was estimated for all the sub-basins using hypsographic curve. Chandra and Bhaga sub-basins are at higher altitude and Ravi sub-basin is at lower altitude. It was also observed that areal extent of snow reaches to lower altitude during last 5 years, particularly in Ravi sub-basin.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration through an energy balance using remote sensors
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS Y RECURSOS AGROPECUARIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining evapotranspiration (ET) is an important element in the water use and management process. Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) calculates ET as a residual of the energy balance using satellite images. The objective was to validate the functioning of METRIC to calculate the ET and estimate the efficiency of water use in the Rio Yaqui Irrigation District (ID). Eight Landsat satellite (TM and ETM+ sensors) images and turbulent flow measurements with turbulent covariance towers (Eddy Covariance - EC) were used in a plot with common wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivation extending throughout the DR. The ET estimated with METRIC and the measurement with EC showed a high degree of correspondence; in the eight images, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.76 mm d(-1) was obtained, along with an absolute mean error (AME) of 0.65 mm d(-1), an agreement index (d) of 0.93 and an R-2 of 0.83 in the daily estimates. The METRIC methodology is a viable tool to estimate the spatial, temporal variability of ET and the efficiency of water use.

TI  - Monitoring the Impact of Land Cover Change on Surface Urban Heat Island through Google Earth Engine: Proposal of a Global Methodology, First Applications and Problems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - All over the world, the rapid urbanization process is challenging the sustainable development of our cities. In 2015, the United Nation highlighted in Goal 11 of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) the importance to "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for proper indicators, representing different aspects of city conditions, obviously including the Land Cover (LC) changes and the urban climate with its most distinct feature, the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the aspects of UHI is the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), which has been investigated through airborne and satellite remote sensing over many years. The purpose of this work is to show the present potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the huge and continuously increasing free satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for long-term and wide spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and its connection with LC changes. A large-scale spatio-temporal procedure was implemented under GEE, also benefiting from the already established Climate Engine (CE) tool to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery and the simple indicator Detrended Rate Matrix was introduced to globally represent the net effect of LC changes on SUHI. The implemented procedure was successfully applied to six metropolitan areas in the U.S., and a general increasing of SUHI due to urban growth was clearly highlighted. As a matter of fact, GEE indeed allowed us to process more than 6000 Landsat images acquired over the period 1992-2011, performing a long-term and wide spatio-temporal study on SUHI vs. LC change monitoring. The present feasibility of the proposed procedure and the encouraging obtained results, although preliminary and requiring further investigations (calibration problems related to LST determination from Landsat imagery were evidenced), pave the way for a possible global service on SUHI monitoring, able to supply valuable indications to address an increasingly sustainable urban planning of our cities.

TI  - Monitoring Mediterranean Oak Decline in a Peri-Urban Protected Area Using the NDVI and Sentinel-2 Images: The Case Study of Castelporziano State Natural Reserve
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities in particular are important causes of the possible variations in Mediterranean basin forest health conditions. Over the last decades, deciduous oak-forest mortality has been a recurrent problem in central and southern Italy. Despite the perception of increasingly visible damage in oak forests in drought sites, the role of various environmental factors in their decline is not completely clear. Among the modern methods of monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, remote sensing is of prime importance thanks to its ability to provide synoptic information on large areas with a high frequency of acquisition. This paper reports the preliminary results regarding a replicable and low cost monitoring tool planned to quantify forest health conditions based on the application of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using the diachronic images provided by the Sentinel-2 satellite. The study area is represented by a peri-urban forest of natural Mediterranean deciduous oaks, characterized by a high variability in the composition of the species and in the silvicultural structures. In order to monitor the health conditions of a specific forest canopy cover with remote sensing data, it is necessary to classify the forest canopy cover in advance to separate it from other species and from the Mediterranean scrub. This is due to the spatial distribution of vegetation and the high rate of biodiversity in the Mediterranean natural environment. To achieve this, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, forest management data and field sampling data were analyzed. The main results of this research show a widespread decline in oak health conditions over the observed period (2015-2017). Specifically, for the studied area, thanks to the specific localization of the oak canopy cover, we detected a high potential concerning the Sentinel-2 data application in monitoring forest health conditions by NDVI application.

TI  - Melanoma in the very elderly, management in patients 85 years of age and over
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Melanoma treatment in the elderly can entail complex decision making. This study characterizes the presentation, management, and outcome of melanoma in the very elderly.Method: Retrospective review of all patients in their 85th year or older presenting to a tertiary referral cancer centre between 2000 and 2012 with American Joint Committee on Cancer stages 0-II cutaneous melanoma.Results: 127 patients, 26 with in-situ disease and 101 with stages I-II disease, were included. For invasive primary disease, the median age was 87 years (IRQ = 86-89). Most patients had melanomas with poor prognoses at diagnosis: 49.5% were ulcerated, 68.3% mitotically active (mitotic rate >= 1), and the median tumor thickness was 3.7 mm (IQR = 1.7-5.8). Nodular melanomas were the most frequent subtype (31.7%, 32/101). Only 66.3% received an excision margin >= 10 mm. Suboptimal excision margins were associated with increased risk of local recurrence (HR = 6.87, 95% CI = 5.53-8.20, p = 0.0045) but not poorer disease specific survival (DSS, p = 037) or overall survival (OS, p = 0.19). Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) did not influence survival (DSS, p = 0.39, OS, p = 0.78). Median OS was 33 months. Overall, one-third (34.7%) of patients died from causes other than melanoma during the follow up period. In patients aged >= 90 only 1 patient (4.3%) died from melanoma, while 10 patients (43.5%) died of other causes.Conclusions: Older patients have thick, mitotically active and frequently ulcerated melanomas. An excision margin 10 mm should be considered to reduce risk of local recurrence. SNB did not impact on survival. With increasing age, patients will more commonly die of causes other than melanoma regardless of the extent of surgical care. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes Through Satellite Remote Sensing Approach: A Case Study of Indus Delta, Pakistan
T2  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series A-Physical Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indus deltas with its coastal zones are the most important coastal environment for mangrove and related habitats in Pakistan. The aim of the study is to identify the land use/land cover (LULC) classes of the Indus Delta during 2000 and 2014 through satellite remote sensing (SRS), to evaluate the LULC changes of Indus Delta during this period and to investigate the LULC classes from ground truths. Satellite remote sensing is a modern technique for detection and mapping of LULC patterns and their changes without going into survey. Satellite images of Landsat-7 ETM+, March 8, 2000 and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, April 8, 2014 were used. A supervised classification technique was used to classify ten LULC classes. Results indicate that normal mangrove, cultivated land, dry mudflat, dry barren / vacant land and turbid water increased with 324.93 km(2) (23.21 km(2)/year), 749.44 km(2) (53.53km(2)/year), 171.01 km(2) (12.21 km(2)/year), 375.31 km(2) (26.81 km(2)/year) and 59 km(2) (4.21 km(2)/year), respectively, during the period of 2000-2014 due to plantation of mangroves in various creek areas in Indus Delta by Sindh Forest and Wildlife Department, SCCP, IUCN, WWF, etc. in the year of 2009 to 2013. Cultivated land is increased after the flood of 2010 and 2013 in the northern part of Indus Delta, while dense mangrove, other vegetation, wet mudflat, wet barren/ vacant land and deep water decreased with 12.99 km(2) (0.93 km(2)/year), 280.58 km(2) (20.04 km(2)/year), 290.54 km(2) (20.75 km(2)/year), 844.59 km(2) (60.33 km(2)/year) and 237.16 km(2) (16.94 km(2)/year), respectively, during 2000-2014. Some areas of other vegetation lands are converted to cultivated lands during 2000 to 2014. Similarly, some wet mudflat and wet barren / vacant land are converted to normal mangrove in the southern part of Indus Delta. Many factors affect the LULC of Indus Delta like sea water intrusion, insufficient freshwater below Kotri barrage, and at least one annual cyclone destructive to Sindh coast.

TI  - Prevalence of Pain Diagnoses and Burden of Pain Among Active Duty Soldiers, FY2012
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Soldiers are at risk for acute and chronic pain due to the mental and physical challenges of military duties and ongoing training for force readiness. With the burden of pain on any individual attributable across pain sources, a broad perspective that goes beyond prior characterizations of pain is important. We aim to further the understanding of pain's effects among non-deployed active duty soldiers and the Military Health System (MHS), by describing prevalence of 10 painful conditions, reported pain levels, duration of pain and impact of pain on military duty limitations. Methods: Data are from the MHS Data Repository including outpatient MHS direct care encounters, claims for outpatient purchased care from civilian providers, and vital records, for all soldiers continuously enrolled in TRICARE and not deployed in FY 2012. Ten pain-related diagnostic categories were conceptually derived for this analysis and identified using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. We report the FY 2012 prevalence at the soldier-level (N = 297,120) for each pain category as a primary diagnosis, as well as in any diagnostic position, and at the soldier-level for reported pain level, duration, and military duty limitations. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to analyses. Results: Overall, 63% of soldiers had at least one pain diagnosis and 59% had a primary pain diagnosis during FY 2012. Back and neck pain (22%), non-traumatic joint disorders (28%), and other musculoskeletal pain (30%) were the most frequent categories for primary diagnosis. Nearly two-thirds of soldiers had a primary pain diagnosis in more than one category, and 23% in four or more categories. Moderate or severe pain levels were reported at least once during the year by 55% of soldiers who had a primary pain diagnosis. In the subsample of soldiers with primary pain in the first quarter, duration and chronicity of pain diagnoses varied by pain category: the back and neck pain category was the most common for both persistent pain occurring in each quarter of FY 2012 (23%) and chronic pain lasting for at least 3 mo (62%). In most pain categories, the majority of soldiers were released without duty limitations. Conclusion: These data provide a deeper understanding of pain diagnoses and burden of pain among active duty soldiers. A substantial proportion of soldiers with pain diagnoses were seen for pain self-reported as only mild, or that did not result in significant restrictions in military duty limitations. However, given the prevalence of multiple pain diagnoses and common reports of moderate or severe pain and long duration, complex interventions may be required to minimize the effect of pain on force readiness. This encounters-based analysis is likely an underestimate of presence of pain, and does not include contextual factors that could better describe the true effect of pain among this population.

TI  - Linking animal movement and remote sensing - mapping resource suitability from a remote sensing perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is an important tool in the study of animal behavior providing ecologists with the means to understand species-environment interactions in combination with animal movement data. However, differences in spatial and temporal resolution between movement and remote sensing data limit their direct assimilation. In this context, we built a data-driven framework to map resource suitability that addresses these differences as well as the limitations of satellite imagery. It combines seasonal composites of multiyear surface reflectances and optimized presence and absence samples acquired with animal movement data within a cross-validation modeling scheme. Moreover, it responds to dynamic, site-specific environmental conditions making it applicable to contrasting landscapes. We tested this framework using five populations of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) to model resource suitability related to foraging achieving accuracies from 0.40 to 0.94 for presences and 0.66 to 0.93 for absences. These results were influenced by the temporal composition of the seasonal reflectances indicated by the lower accuracies associated with higher day differences in relation to the target dates. Additionally, population differences in resource selection influenced our results marked by the negative relationship between the model accuracies and the variability of the surface reflectances associated with the presence samples. Our modeling approach spatially splits presences between training and validation. As a result, when these represent different and unique resources, we face a negative bias during validation. Despite these inaccuracies, our framework offers an important basis to analyze species-environment interactions. As it standardizes site-dependent behavioral and environmental characteristics, it can be used in the comparison of intra- and interspecies environmental requirements and improves the analysis of resource selection along migratory paths. Moreover, due to its sensitivity to differences in resource selection, our approach can contribute toward a better understanding of species requirements.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Complex Wetland Classification Using Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergistic use of spatial features with spectral properties of satellite images enhances thematic land cover information, which is of great significance for complex land cover mapping. Incorporating spatial features within the classification scheme have been mainly carried out by applying just low-level features, which have shown improvement in the classification result. By contrast, the application of high-level spatial features for classification of satellite imagery has been underrepresented. This study aims to address the lack of high-level features by proposing a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn deep spatial features for wetland mapping using optical remote sensing data. Designing a fully trained new convolutional network is infeasible due to the limited amount of training data in most remote sensing studies. Thus, we applied fine tuning of a pre-existing CNN. Specifically, AlexNet was used for this purpose. The classification results obtained by the deep CNN were compared with those based on well-known ensemble classifiers, namely random forest (RF), to evaluate the efficiency of CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN was superior to RF for complex wetland mapping even by incorporating the small number of input features (i.e., three features) for CNN compared to RF (i.e., eight features). The proposed classification scheme is the first attempt, investigating the potential of fine-tuning pre-existing CNN, for land cover mapping. It also serves as a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art machine learning tools for processing remote sensing data.

TI  - Terrestrial primary production for the conterminous United States derived from Landsat 30 m and MODIS 250 m
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial primary production is a fundamental ecological process and a crucial component in understanding the flow of energy through trophic levels. The global MODIS gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) products (MOD17) are widely used for monitoring GPP and NPP at coarse resolutions across broad spatial extents. The coarse input datasets and global biome-level parameters, however, are well-known limitations to the applicability of the MOD17 product at finer scales. We addressed these limitations and created two improved products for the conterminous United States (CONUS) that capture the spatiotemporal variability in terrestrial production. The MOD17 algorithm was utilized with medium resolution land cover classifications and improved meteorological data specific to CONUS in order to produce: (a) Landsat derived 16-day GPP and annual NPP at 30m resolution from 1986 to 2016 (GPP(L30) and NPPL30, respectively); and (b) MODIS derived 8-day GPP and annual NPP at 250m resolution from 2001 to 2016 (GPP(M250) and NPPM250 respectively). Biome-specific input parameters were optimized based on eddy covariance flux tower-derived GPP data from the FLUXNET2015 database. We evaluated GPP(L30) and GPP(M250) products against the standard MODIS GPP product utilizing a select subset of representative flux tower sites, and found improvement across all land cover classes except croplands. We also found consistent interannual variability and trends across NPPL30, NPPM250, and the standard MODIS NPP product. We highlight the application potential of the production products, demonstrating their improved capacity for monitoring terrestrial production at higher levels of spatial detail across broad spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - DIAGNOSING ENVIRONMENTAL FRAGILITY ON THE HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN OF SANTO ANTONIO RIVER, MS: SUBSIDY TO ENVIRONMENTAL ZONING
T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the environmental fragility of the Hydrographic Basin of Santo Antonio River, and to suggest an initial environmental zoning. For this purpose, it was used Ross's (1994 and 2012) methodology of potential and environmental fragility supported by remote sensing data as well as geoprocessing. It was used image from Landsat satellite 8/0LI-2014 for Land use mapping and project GeoMS data about land cover. The environmental fragility was developed from the combination of potential fragility maps and theme maps of land use and cover of 2014. The results have shown that there is predominance of medium environmental fragility (74.81%), associated to the major occupation of the basin by pasture, which occupies 52.1% of the area. There are also Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) improperly occupied with pasture and agriculture. Giving the situation in which the basin is found, it was proposed an initial environmental planning with use and occupation guidelines of the area in a sustainable manner with recommendations and limitations of use in vulnerable areas, such as proposition of recovering degrades areas.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated with Major Neonata Birth Injuries During Caesarean Section in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Southern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Neonatal birth injuries are commonly associated with instrumental vaginal deliveries, but have also been known to occur at uncomplicated vaginal or caesarean deliveries. Caesarean section confers some amount of protection against injuries at birth, but these can still occur with an incidence of 1.1%. Most common injury noted has been scalp lacerations followed by cephalohaematoma; others are fractures, brachial plexus injury, etc.Aim: This study was carried out to find the incidence of and risk factors associated with major neonatal injuries sustained during Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) done in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, a tertiary level hospital in Southern India, over a period of one year.Materials and Methods: The hospital numbers of babies who had sustained major birth injuries during LSCS from June st 2015 to May 31st 2016 were retrieved from the sentinel events register, being maintained by the charge nurse in the operation theatre. The details of the mothers, including details of LSCS, intraoperative findings, and their babies were then retrieved from the medical records.Major birth injuries were defined as lacerations or cuts requiring suturing; fracture of bones; intracranial haemorrhage; skull fracture, facial nerve injury and intra-abdominal injury. The data was entered into clinical proforma and analysed using SPSS software (IBM, version 23). Descriptive measures like mean, median and standard deviation were computed for all continuous variables.Results: There were a total of 12,430 deliveries in the period from June 1st 2015 to May 31st 2016, out of which 35% (4,375) were caesarean deliveries. Out of 4,375 caesarean deliveries, there were six cases of major neonatal birth injuries, incidence being 0.13%. Of the six birth injuries, 66.6% were lacerations and remaining were femoral fractures (33.3%).We found that primiparous women carrying singleton pregnancies in cephalic presentation, undergoing LSCS following onset of labour were at increased risk of having major neonatal birth injuries. Presence of oligohydramnios intraoperatively, incision to delivery interval <5 minutes and surgery carried out by surgeons with mid-level expertise during "risk hours" (12am-8am) were also at risk. We did not find an increased risk with J or U shaped uterotomy incisions. Neonatal risk factors included prematurity and female gender. We did not find any correlation with very low birth weight and/or macrosomia. The average birth weight in this cohort was 2.35 kg.Conclusion: Presence of risk factors like foetal prematurity, presence of oligohydramnios intraoperatively; incision to delivery interval <5 minutes and delivery during the "risk hours" increases the risk of major birth trauma at LSCS. However, our numbers are small to measure the exact correlation. Hence, prospective studies with larger sample size are needed to study the risk factors.

TI  - Systemic Semantics: A Systems Approach to Building Ontologies and Concept Maps
T2  - SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of systemology does not yet have a standardised terminology; there are multiple glossaries and diverse perspectives even about the meanings of fundamental terms. This situation undermines researchers' and practitioners' ability to communicate clearly both within and outside their own specialist communities. Our perspective is that different vocabularies can in principle be reconciled by seeking more generalised definitions that reduce, in specialised contexts, to the nuanced meaning intended in those contexts. To this end, this paper lays the groundwork for a community effort to develop an Ontology of Systemology'. In particular we argue that the standard methods for ontology development can be enhanced by drawing on systems thinking principles, and show via four examples how these can be applied for both domain-specific and upper ontologies. We then use this insight to derive a systemic and systematic framework for selecting and organising the terminology of systemology. The outcome of this paper is therefore twofold: We show the value in applying a systems perspective to ontology development in any discipline, and we provide a starting outline for an Ontology of Systemology. We suggest that both outcomes could help to make systems concepts more accessible to other lines of inquiry.

TI  - A Systematic Framework for Exploring Worldviews and Its Generalization as a Multi-Purpose Inquiry Framework
T2  - SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systems science methodologies do not have a consistent way of working with worldviews, even though determining stakeholder perspectives is central to systems thinking. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Worldview Inquiry Framework that can be used across methodologies to govern the process of eliciting, documenting, and comparing the worldviews of stakeholders. We discuss the systemicity of worldviews and explain how this can help practitioners to find the roots of stakeholders' disagreements about value judgements. We then generalize the structure of the Worldview Inquiry Framework to produce a General Inquiry Framework that can be used to govern an inquiry process in other contexts. We show that the presented Worldview Inquiry Framework is a special case of this General Inquiry Framework and show how the General Inquiry Framework can be tailored for other contexts such as problem solving, product design, and fundamental research.

TI  - Remote Sensing Approach to Detect Burn Severity Risk Zones in Palo Verde National Park, Costa Rica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a site specific burn severity modelling using remote sensing techniques to develop severity patterns on vegetation and soil in the fire prone region of the Palo Verde National Park in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Terrain physical features, soil cover, and scorched vegetation characteristics were examined to develop a fire risk model and to quantify probable burned areas. Spectral signatures of affected areas were captured through multi-spectral analysis; i.e., Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Landsat derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and relativized dNBR (RdNBR). A partial unmixing algorithm, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) was used to isolate endmembers for scorched vegetation and soil. The performance of dNBR and RdNBR for predicting ground cover components was acceptable with an overall accuracy of 84.4% and Cohen's Kappa 0.82 for dNBR and an overall accuracy of 89.4% and Cohen's Kappa 0.82 for RdNBR. Landsat derived RdNBR showed a strong correlation with scorched vegetation (r(2) = 0.76) and moderate correlation with soil cover (r(2) = 0.53), which outperformed dNBR. The ecologically diverse and unique park area is threatened by wetland fires, which pose a potential threat to various species. Human induced fires by poachers are a common occurrence in such areas to gain access to these species. This paper aims to prioritize areas that are at a higher risk from fire and model spatial adaptations in relation to the direction of fire within the affected wetlands. This assessment will help wildlife personnel in managing disturbed wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Variability of the elemental composition of airborne mineral dust along the coast of Central Tunisia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first aim of this study is to document the variability of the elemental composition of the mineral dust collected along the Mediterranean coast in Central Tunisia. The second aim is to correlate this composition with the different source-areas from which the mineral dust (MD) originates. In all, 190 daily aerosol samples are analyzed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), and the elemental composition of the mineral dust is obtained by subtracting the non-crustal share from the bulk composition. On the basis of the MD concentration, 149 samples are classified as corresponding to "moderate" (3 < MD < 25 mu g m(-3)) dust-events, and 17 to "intense" (MD > 25 mu g m(-3)) ones. By using a combination of MODIS satellite observations, HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis, and dust emission simulations with the CHIMERE model, three geographical areas are identified as being at the origin of the intense events. From east to west, Area #1 corresponds to the south-east of Tunisia/west of Lybia region, Area #2 corresponds to the Algerian/Tunisian Border and contains the Chott El Jerid depression. Finally, Area #3 is in Central Algeria. Elemental ratios are commonly used to discuss the nature and origin of airborne particles. In good agreement with previous observations, the Ca/Al ratio is significantly larger in Area #1 than in Area #3 (2.4 +/- 0.4 as compared to 1.3 +/- 0.3). With values of 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.8 +/- 0.3 for Areas #1 and 3, respectively, a similar contrast is observed for the (Mg + Ca)/Fe ratio. In Area #2 that is at the origin of 5 of the 9 intense events and thus appears as being the most influential source-region for Central Tunisia, the Ca/Al ratio (2.8 +/- 0.9) compares to that of Area #1 but (Mg + Ca)/Fe (7.3 +/- 0.7) is significantly larger than in Areas #1 and 3. These differences of dust composition for the three source areas are confirmed by laboratory experiments in which mineral aerosols are generated using natural soils collected in the source regions and subsequently analyzed by XRF. These results do not only emphasize the strength of the link existing between the composition of the source soil and that of the aerosol generated from it, they also document the variability of the dust composition in the Central Mediterranean region and confirm the interest of using the Ca/Al and (Mg + Ca)/Fe ratios as tracers of the source areas.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of satellite-based aerosol optical depth over Iran in Southwest Asia: Identification of a regional aerosol hot spot
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of spatial and temporal variations of aerosols is essential for understanding the impacts of aerosols on air quality. Using aerosol products of the Collection 6 Terra MODIS Deep Blue, regional and temporal variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0.55 mu m in sixteen locations spread over nine different regions of Iran are studied for the period 2001-2015. Monthly means of dust column mass density in three locations of Iran are also obtained from the MERRA-2 dataset. It is found that southwestern Iran experiences the highest annual mean AOD, while other regions experience significantly lower values. Indeed, southwestern Iran is identified as a regional hot spot of aerosols in Southwest Asia, significantly contributing to degrading the air quality in the nearby regions. Annual mean AOD values in most of the other studied locations are between 0.08 and 0.12. High AOD over southwestern Iran is strongly related to frequent dust outbreaks over the region all year long, although AOD values are higher from April to August, during which dust events are more frequent over Southwest Asia. In other, mostly urban populated areas, maximum AOD values occur from mid-winter to mid-spring due to significant aerosol emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, combined with shallow atmospheric boundary-layer depths, which lead to the development of a concentrated mass of aerosols near the surface. On the other hand, minimum values of AOD occur from August to November. Trend analysis indicated that none of the regions of Iran has experienced a noticeable increase or decrease in AOD during 2001-2015.

T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A study on effects of particulate matter fractions (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) on health of school children was done from September 2014 to December 2015 covering one wheat and two rice crop seasons. The study was undertaken at 3 rural sites in the districts of Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib and Sangrur (Malwa region of Punjab). The monthly average values of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were about 3-4 times higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) given by Central Pollution Control Board during the crop residue burning periods. The MODIS data images of crop residue burning events confirmed the active fire operations over the region. The lung function parameters (Forced Vital Capacity, Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) of children (10-16 years) decreased with increase in particulate matter concentration while no significant effect was observed on Oxygen saturation level of children. The decrease in Forced Vital Capacity was slightly more in male subjects as compared to the female population. The sharp decrease in Pulmonary Function Test parameters during the crop residue burning period indicated the severity of the episodic burning events on the health of the children.

TI  - Identification of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard of care in axillary staging of breast cancer patients who are clinically node negative as it reduces the morbidity of axillary nodal dissection. SLN biopsy using blue dye and radioisotopes have high identification rates but its limitations include anaphylaxis, disposal of radioactive waste, and potential second surgery in up to 35% of patients who show nodal metastases on SLN biopsy. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has the potential for SLNs to be identified without the aforementioned risks. CEUS involves the administration of intravenous contrast agents containing microbubbles of perfluorocarbon or nitrogen gas. The bubbles greatly affect ultrasound backscatter and increase vascular contrast in a similar manner to intravenous contrast agents used in CT and MRI. It is safe and easily performed with no requirement for ionizing radiation and no risk of nephrotoxicity. Microbubbles are taken up by lymph nodes when injected directly into tissues, including sub-areolar injection in the breast cancer patient. This method may prove valuable in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ, where operative SLN biopsy remains controversial, and in women undergoing prophylactic mastectomies for high risk. This technique may also have a role after neoadjuvant chemotherapy where frequently there is fibrosis in the treated SLNs.

TI  - Cascading effects of combining synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatiles with companion plants to manipulate natural enemies in an agro-ecosystem
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDWhether tactics to manipulate natural enemies in agro-ecosystems enhance their ecosystem function and services remains debatable. We conducted field experiments in 2015-2016 to test the hypothesis that attraction of natural enemies to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), alone or in combination with companion plants, increases crop productivity. Our treatments consisted of bean plants alone or baited with methyl salicylate (MeSA; an HIPV), or combined with coriander (a companion plant), or with both MeSA and coriander. Numbers of arthropods were visually sampled in each treatment. Sentinel aphids were used to measure ecosystem function (i.e. predation). Plant damage and biomass, and the number and weight of pods and seeds, were measured as a proxy for ecosystem services.RESULTSMeSA and coriander, when alone or combined, increased the abundance of insect predators from six families, reduced herbivore (e.g. spider mite and thrips) populations, and increased aphid predation. MeSA and coriander also reduced damage by spider mites. MeSA with or without coriander did not, however, increase crop biomass or any yield parameters.CONCLUSIONSMeSA alone or combined with coriander attracted different predator communities, altered pest communities, and reduced damage; however, these results did not cascade down to improve crop productivity.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF LOCATION AND DISTANCE OF BIOGENTS SENTINEL™ TRAPS FROM HUMAN-OCCUPIED EXPERIMENTAL HUTS ON <i>AEDES</i> <i>AEGYPTI</i> RECAPTURE AND ENTRY INTO HUTS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A mark-release-recapture study was conducted to refine the "push-pull'' strategy for controlling the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus vector Aedes aegypti in a peridomestic environment by determining optimal locations and distances from human-occupied experimental huts for placement of the "pull'' component (Biogents Sentinel (TM) [BGS] traps) to maximize the capture of mosquitoes. The BGS traps were placed at portals of entry (windows or doors) or corners of the experimental huts and at varying distances from the huts (0, 3, and 10 m). The location optimization trials revealed higher trap capture rates and reduction in entry of mosquitoes when the BGS traps were positioned nearer the experimental hut portals of entry than those placed in the corner of the huts. The trap capture rate at huts' portals of entry was 38.7% (116/300), while the corners recorded 23.7% (71/300). The percentage reduction in entry of mosquitoes into the huts was 69% and 31% at portals of entry and corners or vertices, respectively. In the distance optimization trials, the highest captures were recorded at 0 m (18.5%; 111/600) and 10 m (14.2%; 128/900) distances from the hut. Moreover, the highest percentage reduction in entry of mosquitoes into the huts occurred for traps set at 0 m (65.6%) compared with 3 m (17.2%) or 10 m (14.6%) distances from the huts.

TI  - Methodological Validation for Automated Lineament Extraction by LINE Method in PCI Geomatica and MATLAB based Hough Transformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution and pattern recognition of geologic lineaments are very effective in hazard risk evaluation. To make the process automated, various algorithms with various data sources were applied. This paper aims to make a review on such algorithms as well as data sources used. Comparative analysis of the LINE algorithm in PCI Geomatica and Hough Transformation in MATLAB has been conducted to explore the procedural accuracy with reference to existing landslides in the Darjeeling Himalayan region. Another comparison was made based on data sources like Landsat-8 OLI and digital elevation model, with reference to the same. As lineament density affects the landslide occurrences predominantly, the output lineament density by these two methods as well as with ground reflection and ground elevation data, were correlated with that of the landslide inventory map. A relational illustration was also done in between the lithological thrust direction and the direction of the individual lineament outputs. Hence, this study provides a decision on the use of a reliable method and data source for the automated lineament extraction which can be considered as generating an output with higher accuracy and, hence, safer for using it in the structural planning and execution of projects on various natural hazard studies.

TI  - Classification of VHR Multispectral Images Using ExtraTrees and Maximally Stable Extremal Region-Guided Morphological Profile
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel-based contextual classification methods, including morphological profiles (MPs), extended MPs, attribute profiles (APs), and MPs with partial reconstruction (MPPR), have shown the benefits of using geometrical features extracted from very-high resolution (VHR) images. However, the structural element sequence or the attribute filters that are necessarily adopted in the above solutions always result in computationally inefficient and redundant high-dimensional features. To solve the second problem, we introduce maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) guided MPs (MSER_MPs) and MSER_MPs(M), which contains mean pixel values within regions, to foster effective and efficient spatial feature extraction. In addition, the extremely randomized decision tree (ERDT) and its ensemble version, ExtraTrees, are introduced and investigated. An extremely randomized rotation forest (ERRF) is proposed by simply replacing the conventional C4.5 decision tree in a rotation forest (RoF) with an ERDT. Finally, the proposed spatial feature extractors, ERDT, ExtraTrees, and ERRF are evaluated for their ability to classify three VHR multispectral images acquired over urban areas, and compared against C4.5, Bagging(C4.5), random forest, support vector machine, and RoF in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The experimental results confirm the superior performance of MSER_MPs(M) and MSER_MPs compared to MPPR and MPs, respectively, and ExtraTrees is better for spectral-spatial classification of VHR multispectral images using the original spectra stacked with MSER_MPs(M) features.

TI  - Dynamics of agriculture and mapping of the land use on the manacapuru municipality
T2  - REVISTA ACTA GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use of a certain region is due to human activities upon a surface, and cause transformations such as: Urban areas, exposed soil, agriculture and mining. The general purpose of this essay was to verify the dynamics of agriculture and land use on the Manacapuru municipality in the period of 2005 to 2015. The methodology consisted on the following steps: Implementation of the theoretical referential about the use and ocupation of the lands; aquisition of vectorial data for the development of a basemap; gathering of agricultural data from the IBGE; and image processing from the Landsat 5 TM & 8 OLI Satellites to map the land use. Manacapuru's economy relies heavyly on agriculture and is in expansion, with 302.69 ha (50,6% of the municipality's GDP), represented mainly by the banana, manioc and cattle breeding (IBGE, 2017). The agricultural areas are on the surroundings of the urban area and Solimoes e Manacapuru river banks, due to the proximity to the largest consumer market. Most of the municipality still is covered by vegetation (72.7%) and water (22.0%) being little used by agriculture (4.1%) and with no area gains on the temporal series of the mapping.

TI  - Post-socialist cropland changes and abandonment in Mongolia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale cropland changes have significant implications for global and national food supply as well as degradation in land resources. We examined cropland dynamics at the national scale in Mongolia over the last three decades using Google Earth Engine cloud computing and 11,360 Landsat satellite images. Our overarching goal was to develop the first comprehensive, high-resolution maps of Mongolia's cropland extent for two nominal years: 1990 at the peak of the socialist era production and 2014 after major socio-political and economic regime changes. By comparing the two cropland maps, we estimate cropland changes and identify areas of post-socialist cropland abandonment. Our cropland classifications produce high overall accuracies (overall weighted, statistical accuracies of 98% and 97%, respectively), and the cropland area estimates compare well with county-level crop area statistics (R-2=0.91, p value <.001). We estimate 38% cropland decline in Mongolia throughout the major crop regions but 18% increase in the central region due to increased concentration of crop production. The observed large-scale cropland abandonment would be expected to result in substantial land conversion to rangelands as well as land degradation in the abandoned fields, including soil erosion, increased contribution to desertification, and reduced species diversity. Future studies can monitor the long-term trajectory in the abandoned crop fields and recommend targeted restoration strategies.

TI  - A Study on Variation in Channel Width and Braiding Intensity of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, India
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brahmaputra River flows through Assam, India, for about 670 km along an alluvial valley as a wide braided river. The width of the river varies with time along its course. The braiding intensity of this river is estimated using the braiding index (BI) of Brice (1964), which also changes with space and time along the course of the river. Temporal changes of both width and BI have been studied using topographic maps of 1912-1928 and 1963-1975, and dry season satellite data of 1996, 2000, 2007 and 2009. The mean widths of the Brahmaputra River channel in Assam during 1912-1928, 1963-1975, 1996, 2000, 2007 and 2009 were 5949 m, 7455 m, 7505 m, 8008 m, 8308 m and 9012 m, respectively, confirming an overall increase in width with time. Both the width and variation of width are lowest in four short narrower segments of the river. Three of these segments represent hard points comprising gneissic rock, and one segment is on alluvium comprising cohesive clay. The increase in width is correlated to enormous sediment load produced by the great Assam earthquake of 1950 and large-scale deforestation in the Himalayas. The mean BIs for the Brahmaputra for 1963-1975, 1996, 2000, 2007 and 2009 were 8.59, 8.43, 6.67, 6.58 and 7.70, respectively, indicating in general a decreasing trend up to 2007. The BI showed low variation at the four narrow segments where there is also a minimum variation of the channel width. The BI has increased significantly in the upstream part of the river. Very high fluctuation of discharge (17,000 m(3)/s(-1) in 24 h) and high sediment loads of the Brahmaputra (daily mean sediment discharge of 2.0 million tonnes during monsoon), erodible alluvial banks and high width/depth ratios are the main causes of development of braiding. The interrelationship between channel width and BI of the Brahmaputra shows a positive correlation, indicating an increase in BI with increasing channel width.

TI  - Thermal sharpening of land surface temperature maps based on the impervious surface index with the TsHARP method to ASTER satellite data: A case study from the metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring high spatial/temporal land surface temperature (LST) is a significant key in urban climate studies. Current satellite thermal sensors have a trade-off in their spatial and temporal resolution. The objective of this study is to develop an adaptive thermal sharpening (TsHARP) algorithm to downscale LST by utilizing impervious surface (IS) index in urban areas. The study utilizes the aggregated sharpened LST retrieved from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) L1B image derived over Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on the 14th Feb 2003. Kuala Lumpur is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in terms of population and economy in South-East Asia. With the application of the proposed downscaling procedure on ASTER data covering Kuala Lumpur, it was found that all the evaluated resolutions attained superior results compared to the traditional methods of over urban imagery particularly for environments with heterogeneous land covers. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive TsHARP method showed optimal performance at the 240 m resolution with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE 1.83 degrees C. The model enhances the capability of the adapted TsHARP in unmixing temperature with decreasing resolution. It concluded that applying such improved technique to ASTER satellite data is an urgent and cost-effective application, which is indeed very timely to input for urban/cities landscape planning for metropolitan regions around the world.

TI  - Satellite land surface temperature and reflectance related with soil attributes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil attributes (clay, organic matter and moisture) directly influence land surface temperature (LST). Although there are several studies using soil spectra measured by satellites, soil evaluation through LST is still scarce. The objective of this research was to define the influence of soil attributes on LST and satellite image spectra. The study area (198 ha) is located in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Soil samples were collected in a 100 x 100 m (0-0.2 m) regular grid. A Landsat 5 image, with bare soils, was acquired and LST was extracted using the inversion of Planck's function in band 6. Land surface emissivity was estimated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index threshold method. Reflectance values were extracted from bands 1 to 5 and 7. Linear regression (LR) models were calibrated for soil attributes prediction. Each model used a different set of covariates: (a) LST; (b) elevation; (c) spectral reflectance; and (d) all predictors. Ordinary kriging was performed and its results were compared to maps obtained from LR. There was significant correlation between soil attributes and reflectance, LST, and elevation. Models using only elevation presented poor performance for prediction of clay, sand, OM, and iron oxides; models using LST, moderate; and Vis-NIR-SWIR bands, good. The use of LST for estimating soil attributes increases the predictive performance when associated with surface reflectance, improving the validation of models. Mapping of clay, sand, OM and iron oxides using Landsat 5 products can strongly enhance agriculture management approaches.

TI  - Soil texture and organic carbon mapping using surface temperature and reflectance spectra in Southeast Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of soil attributes maps is crucial for proper field management, especially in tropical countries where agriculture plays a major role in economy, such as Brazil. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared wavelength can be related with soil properties, particularly texture. The availability of LST data on a regular basis, with good spatial resolution to cover extensive agricultural regions and also integrated with reflectance data enhances its use in soil attributes mapping. The objectives of this research were to verify the relationships between soil attributes texture and organic carbon (OC) with the remote sensing (RS) products LST and surface reflectance and perform maps of classes of such attributes based on these variables. The study area (473 ha) is located near the municipality of Barra Bonita, southeast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. A regular sampling grid with 100 x 100 m(2) and with sampling density of one sample per hectare was established on the study site, from where surface samples (0-0.2 m) were collected via auger and had their contents determined by wet chemistry analysis. Images from Landsat 5 were obtained for extraction of LST and reflectance. The algorithm Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) was applied for soil attributes mapping using 55 toposequences samples and considering (a) three LST images; (b) only reflectance from one Landsat scene and (c) reflectance + LST from the same scene as in (b). Besides this, maps were performed using only one LST image with a histogram-based classification. The weighted kappa (k(w)) was calculated with validation samples and indicated the classification accuracy. Mapping of texture and OC through SAM algorithm produced better results than the classification of LST, regardless of the variables being considered. For both attributes, the best map was produced using reflectance + LST, with substantial agreement for texture and moderate for OC. The use of LST for mapping soil attributes concomitantly with reflectance spectra improved the mapping accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling Dengue vector population using remotely sensed data and machine learning
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquitoes are vectors of many human diseases. In particular, Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables. Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial risk system that is running since 2012.

TI  - Quantifying shorebird habitat in managed wetlands by modeling shallow water depth dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 50% of Western Hemisphere shorebird species are in decline due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation. In some regions of high wetland loss, shorebirds are heavily reliant on a core network of remaining human-managed wetlands during migration journeys in the spring and fall. While most refuges have been designed and managed to match the habitat needs of waterfowl, shorebirds typically require much shallower water (<10cm deep). Traditional static habitat modeling approaches at relatively coarse spatial and temporal resolution are insufficient to capture dynamic changes within this narrow water depth range. Our objectives were to (1) develop a method to quantify shallow water habitat distributions in inland non-tidal wetlands, and (2) to assess how water management practices affect the amount of shorebird habitat in Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex. We produced water depth distributions and modeled optimal habitat (<10cm deep) within 23 managed wetlands using high-resolution topography and fixed-point water depth records. We also demonstrated that habitat availability, specifically suitable water depth ranges, can be tracked from satellite imagery and high-resolution topography. We found that wetlands with lower topographic roughness may have a higher potential to provide shorebird habitat and that strategically reducing water levels could increase habitat extent. Over 50% of the wetlands measured provided optimal habitat across <10% of their area at the peak of migration in early April, and most provided a brief duration of shallow water habitat. Reducing water volumes could increase the proportion of optimal habitat by 1-1,678% (mean=294%) compared to actual volumes measured at peak spring migration in 2016. For wetlands with a high habitat potential, beginning wetland drawdown earlier and extending drawdown time could dramatically improve habitat conditions at the peak of shorebird migration. Our approach can be adapted to track dynamic hydrologic changes at broader spatial scales as additional high-resolution topographic (e.g., lidar, drone imagery photogrammetry) and optical remote sensing data (e.g., planet imagery, drone photography) become available.

TI  - Subverting bradykinin-evoked inflammation by co-opting the contact system: lessons from survival strategies of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewDuring Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi alternates between intracellular and extracellular developmental forms. After presenting an overview about the roles of the contact system in immunity, I will review experimental studies showing that activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) translates into mutual benefits to the host/parasite relationship.Recent findingsT. cruzi trypomastigotes initiate inflammation by activating tissue-resident innate sentinel cells via the TLR2/CXCR2 pathway. Following neutrophil-evoked microvascular leakage, the parasite's major cysteine protease (cruzipain) cleaves plasma-borne kininogens and complement C5. Tightly regulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), kinins and C5a in turn further propagate inflammation via iterative cycles of mast cell degranulation, contact system activation, bradykinin release and activation of endothelial bradykinin B2 receptors (B2R). Recently, studies in the intracardiac model of infection revealed a dichotomic role for bradykinin and endothelin-1: generated upon contact activation (mast cell/KKS pathway), these pro-oedematogenic peptides reciprocally stimulate trypomastigote invasion of heart cells that naturally overexpress B2R and endothelin receptors (ETaR/ETbR).SummaryStudies focusing on the immunopathogenesis of Chagas disease revealed that the contact system plays a dual role in host/parasite balance: T. cruzi co-opts bradykinin-induced plasma leakage as a strategy to increment heart parasitism and increase immune resistance by upregulating type-1 effector T-cell production in secondary lymphoid tissues.

TI  - Glacier Calving Rates Due to Subglacial Discharge, Fjord Circulation, and Free Convection
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidewater glacier calving provides the most direct mechanism of ice transfer from land to the ocean. However, the physical melt processes influencing calving remain challenging to constrain. In this study we focus on calving rates at Kongsbreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard, due to three mechanisms of submarine melt: (1) free convection, (2) horizontal fjord circulation, and (3) meltwater discharge. To calculate an overall calving rate, we measure glacier velocity and terminus change using Sentinel imagery. We calculate free convection, fjord circulation, and meltwater discharge calving using mooring data for mid-fjord ocean temperature (30-80 m depth), reanalysis results for meltwater runoff, and georectified time-lapse imagery to track icebergs and infer surface circulation. Results show that the total glacier calving rate is highly correlated with ocean temperature during the 2016 melt season. When runoff was present, we found that subglacial discharge accounted for calving rates an order of magnitude greater than the maximum calving rates assigned to the other two melting mechanisms combined. Further, subglacial discharge at Kongsbreen was more efficient in inducing calving later in the season than earlier in the season, implying that the increase in ocean temperatures, the timing of meltwater discharge within a melt season, and/or the development of discrete meltwater exit channels are critical components to calving rates. As the recent atmospheric warming trend and subsequent increase in meltwater discharge is expected to continue, it is essential to understand the processes contributing to an increase in glacier calving and incorporate these processes into predictive models.

TI  - Synergetic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for assessments of heathland conservation status
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat quality assessments often demand wall-to-wall information about the state of vegetation. Remote sensing can provide this information by capturing optical and structural attributes of plant communities. Although active and passive remote sensing approaches are considered as complementary techniques, they have been rarely combined for conservation mapping. Here, we combined spaceborne multispectral Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data for a remote sensing-based habitat quality assessment of dwarf shrub heathland, which was inspired by nature conservation field guidelines. Therefore, three earlier proposed quality layers representing (1) the coverage of the key dwarf shrub species, (2) stand structural diversity and (3) an index reflecting co-occurring vegetation were mapped via linking insitu data and remote sensing imagery. These layers were combined in an RGB-representation depicting varying stand attributes, which afterwards allowed for a rule-based derivation of pixel-wise habitat quality classes. The links between field observations and remote sensing data reached correlations between 0.70 and 0.94 for modeling the single quality layers. The spatial patterns shown in the quality layers and the map of discrete quality classes were in line with the field observations. The remote sensing-based mapping of heathland conservation status showed an overall agreement of 76% with field data. Transferring the approach in time (applying a second set of Sentinel-1 and -2 data) caused a decrease in accuracy to 73%. Our findings suggest that Sentinel-1 SAR contains information about vegetation structure that is complimentary to optical data and therefore relevant for nature conservation. While we think that rule-based approaches for quality assessments offer the possibility for gaining acceptance in both communities applied conservation and remote sensing, there is still need for developing more robust and transferable methods.

TI  - HIRS Outgoing Longwave Radiation-Daily Climate Data Record: Application toward Identifying Tropical Subseasonal Variability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the development of a new globally gridded climate data record (CDR) for daily outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) using the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) sensor. The new product, hereafter referred to as HIRS OLR, has several differences and advantages over the widely-used daily OLR dataset derived from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on the same NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), hereafter AVHRR OLR. As a CDR, HIRS OLR has been intersatellite-calibrated to provide the most homogeneous record possible. AVHRR OLR only used the daytime and nighttime overpasses from a single satellite at a time, which creates some challenges for resolving the large diurnal cycle of OLR. HIRS OLR leverages all available overpasses and then calibrates geostationary estimates of OLR to represent that cycle more faithfully. HIRS also has more spectral channels, including those for measuring water vapor, which provides a more accurate measure of OLR. This difference is particularly relevant for large-scale convective systems such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, whereby the HIRS OLR can better identify the subtropical variability between the tropical convection and the extratropical teleconnections.

TI  - Assimilation of Argo Temperature and Salinity Profiles Using a Bias-Aware EnOI Scheme for the Labrador Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, temperature and salinity profiles from Argo floats are assimilated into a coupled ice-ocean model over the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic using an ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme, with the aim of improving the thermohaline structure of the Labrador Sea estimated by the model. Data assimilation experiments are carried out from September 2014 to April 2015 both with and without a one-step bias correction method from the literature. It is found that assimilation of the Argo profiles reduces the errors in the model temperature and salinity when verification is done against both withheld Argo profiles and sea surface temperature from satellite data. The assimilation also leads to deeper mixed layer depth in the Labrador Sea, closer to observations shown in other studies, in particular when bias correction is used. We hypothesize that this is because the bias field leads to vertical density profiles that are less stratified, and hence requiring less energy for mixing, than when bias correction is not used.

AB  - This research aims to compare precipitation data derived from satellite observation and ground measurements through a dense station network over Central Java, Indonesia. A precipitation estimate from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 Version 7 are compared with precipitation data from interpolated rain gauge stations. Correlation analysis, mean bias error (MBE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were utilized in the analysis for each thee-monthly seasonal statistics. The result shows that the 3B42 products often estimate lower rainfall than observed from weather stations in the peak of the rainy season (DJF). Further, it is revealed that the 3B42 product are less robust in estimating rainfall at high elevation, especially when humid environment, which is typical during the rainy season peak, are involved.

TI  - The impact of land use and land cover change on biodiversity within and adjacent to Kibasira Swamp in Kilombero Valley, Tanzania
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are crucial ecosystems with multiple values and functions to a range of different stakeholders. The future of wetlands depends both on the legacy of the past and how they are currently used. Using 48 vegetation survey plots (0.08ha) combined with Landsat 5 and 7 TM imagery, we assessed the influence of long-term (1990-2011) land use and land cover change on the biodiversity of the Kibasira Swamp. Information on perceptions of adjacent communities on historical changes and drivers for the changes were also collected. Results showed an increase in the area covered by open water by 1% and forest by 4% between 1990 and 1998 whilst Cyperus papyrus L and cultivated land area decreased by 8% and 3%, respectively on the same period. Between 1998 and 2011, there was a decrease in areas covered by water by 35% and forest by 9% whereas C. papyrus L increased by 40% and cultivated land increased by 8%. These changes have affected the biodiversity of the swamp and adjacent to it as numbers of mammals have declined. However, the Swamp still provides extensive habitat for plants and bird species despite the ongoing human pressure. Interventions may be necessary to maintain biodiversity in Kibasira Swamp to ensure sustainable ecosystem services.Resume Les zones humides sont des ecosystemes essentiels avec de multiples valeurs et fonctions a une gamme de parties prenantes differentes.

Des informations sur les perceptions des communautes adjacentes sur les changements historiques et les facteurs stimulant les changements ont egalement ete recueillies et incluses dans l'evaluation. Les resultats demontrent une augmentation des surfaces couvertes par les eaux libres de 1% et de la foret de 4% entre 1990 et 1998, tandis que Cyperus papyrus et les terres cultivees ont diminue de 8% et 3%, respectivement, durant la meme periode. Entre 1998 et 2011, les zones couvertes par l'eau ont diminue de 35% et les forets de 9%, tandis que C. papyrus a augmente de 40% et les terres cultivees ont augmente de 8%. Ces changements ont affecte la biodiversite et la qualite des services ecosystemiques du marecage en convertissant une partie du marecage en terres agricoles. Cependant, le marecage est encore un habitat sauvage potentiel pour les plantes et les especes d'oiseaux malgre la pression humaine continue.

TI  - In-Situ and Remote Sensing Platforms for Mapping Fine-Fuels and Fuel-Types in Sonoran Semi-Desert Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has historically played an important role in shaping the structure and composition of Sonoran semi-desert grassland vegetation. Yet, human use and land management activities have significantly altered arid grassland ecosystems over the last century, often producing novel fuel conditions. The variety of continuously updated satellite remote sensing systems provide opportunities for efficiently mapping combustible fine-fuels and fuel-types (e.g., grass, shrub, or tree cover) over large landscapes that are helpful for evaluating fire hazard and risk. For this study, we compared field ceptometer leaf area index (LAI) measurements to conventional means for estimating fine-fuel biomass on 20, 50 m x 20 m plots and 431, 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR) in southern Arizona. LAI explained 65% of the variance in fine-fuel biomass using simple linear regression. An additional 19% of variance was explained from Random Forest regression tree models that included herbaceous plant height and cover as predictors. Field biomass and vegetation measurements were used to map fine-fuel and vegetation cover (fuel-type) from plots on BANWR comparing outcomes from multi-date (peak green and dormant period) Worldview-3 (WV3) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Fine-fuel biomass predicted from WV3 imagery combined with terrain information from a digital elevation model explained greater variance using regression tree models (65%) as compared to OLI models (58%). Vegetation indices developed using red-edge bands as well as modeled bare ground and herbaceous cover were important to improve WV3 biomass estimates. Land cover classification for 11 cover categories with high spatial resolution WV3 imagery showed 80% overall accuracy and highlighted areas dominated by non-native grasses with 87% user's class accuracy. Mixed native and non-native grass and shrublands showed 59% accuracy and less common areas dominated by native grasses on plots showed low class accuracy (23%). Digital data layers from WV3 models showed a significantly positive relationship (r(2) = 0.68, F = 119.2, p < 0.001) between non-native grass cover (e.g., Eragrostis lehmanniana) and average fine-fuel biomass within refuge fire management units. Overall, both WV3 and OLI produced similar fine-fuel biomass estimates although WV3 showed better model performance and helped characterized fine-scale changes in fuel-type and continuity across the study area.

TI  - How do modern transportation projects impact on development of impervious surfaces via new urban area and urban intensification? Evidence from Hangzhou Bay Bridge, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries have been constructing modem ground transportation projects. This raises questions about the impacts of such projects on development of impervious surfaces, yet there have been few attempts to systematically analyze these impacts. This paper attempts to narrow this information gap using the Hangzhou Bay Bridge project, China, as an exploratory case study. Using remotely sensed data, we developed a framework based on statistical techniques, wavelet multi-resolution analysis and Theil-Sen slope analysis to measure the changes in impervious surfaces. The derived changes were then linked to the bridge project with respect to socioeconomic factors and land use development activities. The findings highlight that the analytical framework could reliably quantify the area, pattern and form of new urban area and urban intensification. Change detection analysis showed that urban area, GDP and the length of highways increased moderately in the pre-Hangzhou Bay Bridge period (1995-2002) while all of these variables increased more substantially during (2002-2009) and after (2009-2013) the bridge construction. The results indicate that the development of impervious surfaces due to new urban area came at the expense of permeable surfaces in the urban fringe and within rural regions, while urban intensification occurred mainly in the form of the redevelopment of older structures to modem high-rise buildings within existing urban regions. In the context of improved transportation infrastructure, our findings suggest that new urban area and urban intensification can be attributed to consecutive events which act like a chain reaction: construction of improved transportation projects, their impacts on land use development policies, effects of both systems on socio-economic variables, and finally all these changes influence new urban area and urban intensification. However, more research is needed to better understand this sequential process and to examine the broader applicability of the concept in other developing regions.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS, OMI, MISR and CALIOP Aerosol Products for Estimating Surface Visual Range: A Mathematical Model for Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of atmospheric visibility (VR) using ground and satellite sensors is ineffective under Hong Kong's complex atmosphere and climate. Therefore, the relationship between columnar Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from four space-borne sensors (OMI, MODIS, MISR and CALIOP) and B(ext )from two visibility-recording stations was evaluated, to recommend an effective satellite-based method and spatial resolution, for estimation of VR over Hong Kong. Since most column-integrated aerosol particle extinction occurs within a mixing layer height (MLH) of 1-3 km, column-based AOD from satellites is expected to give a good indication of surface-level conditions, especially when MLH is a known input. The AOD from both MODIS and MISR showed high correlations with B-ext ; therefore, both were subjected to rigorous statistical analysis along with climatic data to simulate visibility. The best estimate of ground visibility was obtained from MODIS AOD combined with surface-level climatic data, and this explained 84% of the variance in VR, with a low distance error of 0.27 km. Results suggest that the water vapor mixing ratio (Q) alone can explain the combined effect of Atmospheric Pressure (P), Temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH) on VR, and that the advection term (VT) alone is sufficient to explain the effects of T, WS and WD on dispersion of aerosols, and hence on VR.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Analysis Using Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 Data: Contribution From VH Channel
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regular acquisition and relatively short revisit time of Sentinel-I satellite improve the capability of a persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) as a suitable geodetic method of choice for measuring ground surface deformation in space and time. The SAR instrument aboard the Sentinel-1 satellite supports operation in dual polarization (HH-HV, VV-VH), which can be used to increase the spatial density of measurement points through the polarimetric optimization method. This study evaluates the improvement in displacement mapping by incorporating the information obtained from the VH channel of Sentinel-1 data into the PS-InSAR analysis. The method that has shown great success with different polarimetric data performs a search over the available polarimetric space in order to find a linear combination of polarization states, which yields the optimum PS selection criterion using the amplitude dispersion index (ADI) criterion. We applied the method to a dataset of 50 dual-polarized (VV-VH) Sentinel-1 images over Trondheim city in Norway. The results show overall increase of about 186% and 78% in the number of PS points with respect to the conventional channels of VH and VV, respectively. The study concludes that, using the AIM optimization, we can incorporate information from the VH channel into the PS-InSAR analysis, which otherwise is lost due to its low amplitude.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used Landsat-8 imagery to test object- and pixel-based image classification approaches in an urban fringe area. For object-based classification, we applied four machine learning classifiers: decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random trees (RT), and support vector machine (SVM). For pixel-based classification, we utilized the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Specifically, we explored the influence of repeated sampling on classification results with different training sample sizes. We found that (1) except the overall accuracy of NB, those of the other four classifiers increased as the training sample size increased; (2) repeated sampling had a significant effect on classification accuracy, especially for the DT and NB classifiers; and (3) SVM achieved the best classification accuracy. In addition, the performance of the object-based classifiers was superior to that of the pixel-based classifier. The results of this study can provide guidance on the training sample size and classifier selection.

TI  - An Empirical Algorithm to Retrieve Significant Wave Height from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery Collected under Cyclonic Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an empirical algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant wave height (SWH) from dual-polarization Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected under cyclonic conditions. The retrieval scheme is based on the well-known CWAVE empirical function that is here updated to deal with multi-polarization S-1 SAR measurements collected using the interferometric wide (IW) and the Extra Wide-Swath (EW) imaging modes, under cyclonic conditions. First, a training dataset that consists of six S-1 SAR images collected under cyclonic conditions is exploited to both tune the retrieval function and to check the soundness of the retrievals against the co-located WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) numerical simulations. The comparison of simulation from the WW3 model and measurements from altimeter Jason-2 shows a 0.29m root mean square error (RMSE) of significant wave height (SWH). Then, a testing data-set that consists of two S-1 SAR images is exploited to provide a preliminary validation. The results, verified against both WW3 and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data, show the soundness of the herein approach.

TI  - District-level assessment of the ecohydrological resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances and its controlling factors in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes. The hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes. Increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence, the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems. In this study, an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in India to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district (i.e. administrative division) scale. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration, was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances. We found a large spatial variation in WUEe in India at district scale, which was significantly higher in lower Himalayan regions compared to rest of the country. Increasing trend in WUEe was found for central parts of the country. The resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the WUEe under the dry conditions and the mean WUEe which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance. Out of 634 districts considered for this study, only 241 (similar to 38%) districts were found resilient to dry conditions, whereas a significant reduction in WUEe was observed for some of the districts. The resilience at district scale indicates the cross-biomes response of ecosystems. In general, the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types. Also, districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience. Out of 30 states and union territories (UTs) only 10 states had more than 50% resilient area. The results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country.

TI  - Land cover classification from multi-temporal, multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery using patch-based recurrent neural networks
T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental sustainability research is dependent on accurate land cover information. Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution policy, most existing land cover datasets are derived from a pixel-based, single-date multi-spectral remotely sensed image with an unacceptable accuracy. One major bottleneck for accuracy improvement is how to develop an accurate and effective image classification protocol. By incorporating and utilizing multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and considering the inherit spatial and sequential interdependence among neighboring pixels, we propose a new patch-based recurrent neural network (PB-RNN) system tailored for classifying multi-temporal remote sensing data. The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular, it uses multi-temporal-spectral-spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow present in multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering an area of 771 square kilometers, the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over a pixel-based recurrent neural network (RNN) system, a pixel-based singleimage neural network (NN) system, a pixel-based multi-image NN system, a patch-based single-image NN system, and a patch-based multi-image NN system. For example, the proposed system achieves 97.21% classification accuracy while the pixel-based single-image NN system achieves 64.74%. By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Qualitative risk assessment of impact of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> on health of beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>, from the Eastern Beaufort Sea, Northwest Territories
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has increasingly been recognized in Arctic fauna, including beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS), Northwest Territories. We qualitatively assessed the risks of T. gondii to the health of EBS beluga because of their importance in livelihood of Arctic communities as well as their potential role as sentinels. This risk assessment used a standard framework including hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. We conclude that currently, the EBS beluga are at moderate risk of exposure to T. gondii, and low risk of developing disease associated with toxoplasmosis, based on the small amount of data available (only healthy, hunter-harvested animals have been examined). Though there was a high level of uncertainty due to limited published data and the challenges in determining prevalence and significance of disease in wild marine mammal populations, overall the EBS population was currently considered to be at a low risk for population level impacts of toxoplasmosis.. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that can guide future research, provide better evidence for future risk assessments, and ultimately better detect and mitigate changing risks for health of Arctic beluga, as well as the communities that rely on sustainable, healthy populations for harvest.

TI  - Developing Forest Cover Composites through a Combination of Landsat-8 Optical and Sentinel-1 SAR Data for the Visualization and Extraction of Forested Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution of forested areas and monitoring their spatio-temporal changes are necessary for the conservation and management of forests. This paper presents two new image composites for the visualization and extraction of forest cover. By exploiting the Landsat-8 satellite-based multi-temporal and multi-spectral reflectance datasets, the Forest Cover Composite (FCC) was designed in this research. The FCC is an RGB (red, green, blue) color composite made up of short-wave infrared reflectance and green reflectance, specially selected from the day when the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is at a maximum, as the red and blue bands, respectively. The annual mean NDVI values are used as the green band. The FCC is designed in such a way that the forested areas appear greener than other vegetation types, such as grasses and shrubs. On the other hand, the croplands and barren lands are usually seen as red and water/snow is seen as blue. However, forests may not necessarily be greener than other perennial vegetation. To cope with this problem, an Enhanced Forest Cover Composite (EFCC) was designed by combining the annual median backscattering intensity of the VH (vertical transmit, horizontal receive) polarization data from the Sentinel-1 satellite with the green term of the FCC to suppress the green component (mean NDVI values) of the FCC over the non-forested vegetative areas. The performances of the FCC and EFCC were evaluated for the discrimination and classification of forested areas all over Japan with the support of reference data. The FCC and EFCC provided promising results, and the high-resolution forest map newly produced in the research provided better accuracy than the extant MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) in Japan. The composite images proposed in the research are expected to improve forest monitoring activities in other regions as well.

TI  - Spatial Assessment of the Potential Impact of Infrastructure Development on Biodiversity Conservation in Lowland Nepal
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate with infrastructure development being one of the leading causes. New infrastructure, such as roads, provides new access and results in increased land clearing and wildlife hunting. A number of large infrastructure projects, including new roads and rail, are being planned in Nepal. We show the application of readily available remotely sensed data and geospatial tools to assess the potential impact of these future developments on habitat quality under three protection-level scenarios. Our findings reveal that there is currently large spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality across the landscape as a result of current anthropogenic threats, and that three areas in particular could have up to 40% reduction in habitat quality as a result of the planned infrastructure. Further research is required to determine more precisely the impact on key species. Strengthening protected areas and buffer zones will contribute to mitigating degradation to some degree, however, large areas of biologically significant areas outside protected areas will be affected without new controls. Our geographic information systems (GIS) based methodology could be used to conduct studies in data poor developing countries, where rapid infrastructure development across ecological sites are ongoing, in order to make society, policy makers, and development planners aware.

TI  - Identifying peri-urban growth in small and medium towns using GIS and remote sensing technique: A case study of English Bazar Urban Agglomeration, West Bengal, India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land in the peri-urban interface is of vital importance as there is a lack of clarity in the planning and policies in this region whether they should be governed under the authority of rural administration. In general, these areas are frequently ignored as a specific area in the study of urbanization being neither pure urban nor pure rural. In this regard, an attempt has been taken to detect the spatio-temporal dynamics of sprawl, the nature of land transformation taken place in the identified peripheral settlements with high probability of urban development within the buffer zone of 2.5 km around the boundaries of the two major urban bodies of Malda i.e. English Bazar municipality an Old Malda municipality. The secondary data of Census of India of 2011and Landsat TM imageries (1987, 2003, 2011 and 2015) have been employed to detect the evolutionary process with the view to capture the urban land-use growth by Land Use-Land Cover classification. The result shows that the built-up area has increased around 30% over the course of 28 years span. Computations of Shannon's Entropy, Urbanisation intensity index, built-up density have helped to explore the degree of transition taking place in each spatial unit under investigation. The spatial metrics with the gradient approach has revealed that beyond the buffer of 7 km from the city centre the increase of residential land uses is maximum which is characterised by a fragmented pattern with nearest entropy value to log N. The suitability analysis in search of most prospective future urban centre suggests the maximum distribution of urban units in the western front of the ULBs.

TI  - New to total primary production ratio (f-ratio) in the Bay of Bengal using isotopic composition of suspended particulate organic carbon and nitrogen
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the content and isotopic compositions of carbon and nitrogen in the suspended particulate matter were analysed to identify sources of nutrients and compute f- ratios (ratio of new production to primary production) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the post-monsoon period (November-December 2013). Remote sensing data during our observation period indicated that the study region encompassed meso-scale cyclonic (CE) and anticyclonic eddies (ACE) and was influenced by tropical cyclone Madi between 6 and 12 December 2013. Relatively higher concentrations of nitrate were observed in the CE and in the cyclone-influenced region compared to that in the ACE. Variable concentrations of nutrients controlled the size distributions of phytoplankton. Overall, the picoplankton population dominated, but the contributions of micro- and nano-plankton populations were significantly higher in the CE region because of higher concentration of nutrients. The delta C-13(sus) C:N molar ratios and C: Chl-alpha ratios suggested that suspended matter is mainly contributed by in situ processes during the study period. The delta N-15(sus). of suspended matter suggested that vertical supply of nutrients brought from subsurface water supported new production in the CE and cyclone-influenced regions, whereas regenerated nutrients supported phytoplankton production in the ACE. The f-ratios computed using delta N-15(sus) and depth of nitracline were high in the CE (0.41 +/- 0.14) and cyclone-influenced region (0.54 +/- 0.12) and lower in the ACE (0.27 +/- 0.06). This study revealed that the mesa-scale CEs are more important in enhancing exportable production in the BoB. As more than 30 CEs form annually in the BoB, their impact on basin-wide new production and export flux to the deeper ocean must be evaluated using both observations and high-resolution models.

TI  - Mechanical and Electrical Properties of a CFETR CSMC Conductor Under Transverse Mechanical Loadings
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The central solenoid model coil (CSMC) project of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor was launched in 2014 to verify the technological feasibility of a large-scale superconducting magnet at the Institute of Plasma and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences. The short twist pitch design recommended by CEA is chosen for the CSMC Nb3Sn cable-in-conduit conductors. In order to better understand the evolution of transport properties and coupling losses related to the effect of electromagnetic load cycles, the mechanical and electrical properties were measured and investigated employing a special cryogenic press facility for the transverse mechanical loadings. The results show that the transverse compression (d(y)) versus applied load force (F-y) is different from first to subsequent loading cycles. This mechanical behavior can be interpreted by the combination of strands bending between the crossovers and strands deformation at the crossovers. The fitting relations of d(y) versus F-y are also presented. The evolution of interstrand contact resistance (R-c) in the cabling stages with cyclic history and pressure effects are discussed. In addition, a fitting relation of R-c versus F-y is presented based on a combination of strand's microsliding and copper matrix resistivity. A clear correlation between intrapetal resistance R-c and coupling loss is also found.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation cover (1984-2017) and modelling of its change drivers, the case of Pingtan Island, China
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine vegetation cover dynamics through quantification of its greenness index, magnitude of change, nature of transition, and fragmentation levels using Landsat images from four periods, 1984, 1996, 2007 and 2017, together with physical and socioeconomic drivers. The results show high spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover that generally increased from plain to mountain and towards the recent decade (2007-2017). While low vegetation cover (fractional vegetation cover < 50% and NDVI < 0.3) remained to be the dominant cover type in Pingtan, spatiotemporal variations were observed during different time periods. Overall, forestland has increased by 11.43% (3682 ha), and shrub land has expanded by 0.28% (91 ha). In contrast, grassland has reduced by 5.41% (1743 ha). Considering all vegetation types, the expanded area dominated the vegetation cover change resulting in a net gain of 6.3% (2030 ha). The increase in vegetation cover was contributed mainly by farmland. The landscape pattern of each vegetation type shows variation across periods and some metrics have inconsistent trend with change in class size. Generally, patches' shape complexity, size variability and dominance reduced, while fragmentation level increased during the study period. Slope, elevation, strong wind and policy affected vegetation cover positively. Most socio economic variables showed significant influence (variable importance in the projection > 1) on both woodland (+) and grassland (-) in first latent factor that consists the highest proportion variance in the models. Having quantitative results of vegetation change using several metrics and its change maps would provide valuable information for comprehensive understanding of vegetation cover change and valuable inputs for environmental management planners.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for cytokeratin 19 messenger RNA is an intraoperative diagnostic procedure for the detection of lymph node metastasis.Objective. This study aimed to construct intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis and four or more axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases.Methods. Of the 4736 breast cancer patients (T1-3, NO) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and had SLNs examined intraoperatively with OSNA, 623 with SLN metastasis treated with completion ALN dissection (cALND) were retrospectively analyzed, and were randomly divided into training (n = 312) and validation (n = 311) sets.Results. Of the clinicopathological parameters available preoperatively and intraoperatively, the multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that clinical tumor size and total tumor load (TTL) determined by OSNA were significantly associated with NSLN metastasis, and that clinical tumor size, number of macrometastatic SLNs, and TTL were significantly associated with four or more ALN metastases. Nomograms for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases were constructed using these parameters, and their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set were both 0.70, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of previously reported postoperative nomograms.Conclusions. We constructed intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases. These nomograms are as accurate as the conventional postoperative nomograms and might be helpful for decision making regarding the indication for cALND or the choice of adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation field.

TI  - Patch-Based Assessments of Shifting Cultivation Detected by Landsat Time Series Images in Myanmar
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is a widely practiced agriculture system in the tropics. Regardless of the dominant land use, the dynamics of shifting cultivation over large areas are of limited knowledge. We conducted patch-based assessments and characterization of shifting cultivation extracted from already developed dataset, which detected shifting cultivation by a trajectory-based analysis using annual Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI time series images from 2000 to 2014 in Myanmar. An accuracy assessment was conducted in terms of the size and number of cleared areas compared with reference polygons of shifting cultivation, which were manually delineated by visual interpretation using Landsat and high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth (TM) in the selected areas. The producer's and user's accuracies in detecting the number of shifting cultivation patches were 78.1% and 88.4%, respectively. In whole study area, the probability of disturbances caused by shifting cultivation was significantly affected by distance to the nearest village, indicating the importance of accessibility from residences. The number of shifting cultivation patches showed a decreasing trend in this region and it will lead to less cleared forests such as located far from residences. These dynamics of shifting cultivation have possibility to affect the mosaic patterns of landscape and function maintained in the landscape in this region.

TI  - Validated HPLC-MS/MS Method To Quantify Low Levels of Domoic Acid in Plasma and Urine after Subacute Exposure
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Domoic acid (DA) is a marine neurotoxin produced by several species of Pseudo-nitzschia. DA causes severe neurological toxicity in humans and animals. To address the current analytical need to quantify low levels of DA in human and animal body fluids, a sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to measure DA in plasma and urine. This method was fully validated to accurately and precisely quantify DA between 0.31 and 16 ng/mL in plasma and between 7.8 and 1000 ng/mL in urine. Our group introduced the use of a novel internal standard, tetrahydrodomoic acid to control for matrix effects and other sources of variability. This validated method will be useful to assess DA concentrations in biological samples of human or animal origin after suspected DA exposure from contaminated food. It will also be applicable to sentinel programs and research studies to analyze body fluids with low levels of DA.

TI  - Estimation of River Discharge Solely from Remote-Sensing Derived Data: An Initial Study Over the Yangtze River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach has been developed to estimating river discharge solely using satellite-derived parameters. The temporal river width observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), made at two stream segments a distance apart, are plotted to identify the time lag. The river velocity estimate is then computed using the time lag and distance between the width measurement locations, producing a resultant velocity of 0.96 m/s. The estimated velocity is comparable to that computed from in situ gauge-observed data. An empirical relationship is then utilized to estimate river depth. In addition, the channel condition values published in tables are used to estimate the roughness coefficient. The channel slope is derived from the digital elevation model averaged over a river section approximately 516 km long. Finally, the temporal depth changes is captured by adjusting the estimated depth to the Envisat satellite altimetry-derived water level changes, and river width changes from Landsat ETM+. The newly developed procedure was applied to two river sites for validation. In both cases, the river discharges were estimated with reasonable accuracy (with Nash-Sutcliffe values >0.50). The performance evaluation of discharge estimation using satellite-derived parameters was also analyzed. Since the methodology for estimating discharge is solely dependent on global satellite datasets, it represents a promising technique for use on rivers worldwide.

TI  - Monitoring of heavy metal pollution and GIS derived land use changes in the major economic zone of Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water pollution and land use changes are exceeding the limit in the most important economic zone, Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) in Bangladesh and have become a great threat to the environment. To understand this threat, the dissolved metal concentration was measured from Turag and Bangshi River near DEPZ. The land use changes of DEPZ was measured and analyzed using Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO) and Landsat TM images through Arc GIS 10.1, ERDAS Imagine 9.1. The dissolved Pb, Cd, Ni and Zn concentration were found to be higher in compare with those of water standards except Cu at every sampling point. Elevated concentration of Cd and its corresponding enrichment factor (EF%) indicated accumulation possibility of metals in the river bed sediments. The principal component analysis result also showed the dominance of Cd ions along with Ni ions in the river water. pH was found to be the controlling factor of every dissolved metal in the rivers sourced from DEPZ. Alongside, the study represents that the land use pattern has been changed remarkably. Large volume of water has been converted into unplanned settlement and urbanization. Land use changes may lead drastic changes in the land quality, such as decreases in biodiversity, instability of ecosystem, decreased soil quality, loss of nutrients, planned and unplanned urbanization, and bare land. Comprehensive synoptic researches are required to monitor the water pollution caused by DEPZ into these rivers and to determine the exact land uses for monitoring further changes.

TI  - Assessment of satellite-retrieved surface UVA and UVB radiation by comparison with ground-measurements and trends over Mega-city Delhi
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar UV radiation reaching the Earths surface is known to have various effects on human health and on the ecosystem. Ground-based measurements of surface UV radiation are spatially sparse and in many cases do not provide long time series. Higher spatial coverage can be provided by measurements from satellite based instruments, but these measurements need to be compared to ground-based measurements of sufficient quality before they can be used in health and ecosystem applications. Here, we compare the measurements of surface solar UV radiation in UVA (315-400 nm) and UVB (280-315 nm) bands with the satellite retrievals (CERES) and validate the latter at an urban location, Delhi, India. We have also used MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) data to see the effect of atmospheric opacity on UV radiation. Ground based measurements of UVA and UVB were performed from 01 October, 2012 to 30 September, 2015: Correlations between daily surface measurements and CERES-derived surface UV fluxes showed very good agreement (r similar to 0.92-0.93) over Delhi. We found a negative correlation between UV fluxes and AOD over Delhi during all seasons. A unit increase in AOD leads to a decrease of similar to 4-5 Wm(-2) in UVA and similar to 0.09-0.14 Wm(-2) in UVB over Delhi. The trend analysis from monthly mean CERES-derived UV fluxes for 17 years data reveals that UVA and UVB are decreasing similar to 0.07 Wm(-2) yr(-1) and 0.003 Wm(-2) yr(-1), respectively with AOD increase (similar to 0.005 yr(-1)) over Delhi. The simultaneous increase in aerosol loading with decrease in UV fluxes at the surface may be explained as a masking effect of ever increasing pollution on surface UV radiation over Delhi. Our results show similar to 10% and similar to 20% decrease (with respect to mean) in UVA and UVB surface fluxes, respectively during last 17 years.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Satellite Databases of Incoming Short-Wavelength Fluxes to the World Ocean Surface
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work involves satellite data provided by EUMETSAT's Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF). The data cover the period from 1982 to 2015 depending on the type of satellite and coverage region. It has been found that monthly and daily average values for regional databases in the area of their overlap are overestimated for the western part and underestimated in the eastern part by approximately 25 W/m(2). The largest values for the mismatch of fluxes are observed at points close to the centers of database areas where the root-mean-square deviation reaches approximately 25 W/m(2). Comparative analysis of global and regional data reveals an area corresponding to the center of visibility for geostationary satellites. In this area, data from the satellites are comparable with global data; the difference between fluxes is less than 10 W/m(2). At the periphery of the satellite visibility area, the situation is the reverse: the global coverage data are more overstated than the regional data of geostationary satellites by more than 10 W/m(2); the root-meansquare deviation is about 30 W/m(2) for daily average values and about 45 W/m(2) for hourly average values.

TI  - Child Mortality in Mozambique: a Review of Recent Trends and Attributable Causes
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewIn the last 25 years, child mortality has significantly dropped at a global level. Understanding particularities of child mortality at the national level is useful to tailor health policy to those conditions requiring more attention. In Mozambique, a variety of efforts have been made to better characterize the overall child mortality and to describe the main contributors for death. In this review, we attempt to contextualize current knowledge on causes of pediatric deaths in Mozambique.Recent FindingsThe available data regarding the principal causes of death in Mozambican children point out to infectious diseases and neonatal causes as the principal causes of preventable deaths, with important variations in recent years in line with the epidemiological changes seen in the country as a result of reductions in malaria transmission and the impact of the nationwide introduction of different conjugate vaccines.SummaryData regarding the main causes of death among children in Mozambique are patchy, outdated, and in many cases based on methodologies with many underlying limitations, which make them unreliable. More robust postmortem methodologies to study the underlying causes of mortality, currently being introduced in a surveillance sentinel site of the country, will surely contribute to improve our understanding of what is really killing children in this country.

TI  - THE PROSPECTS OF THE RUSSIAN-CHINESE HUMANITARIAN COOPERATION IN FRAMEWORK OF "ONE BELT, ONE ROAD" INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTATION
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Nowadays, the steadily growing relationship with the People's Republic of China is one of the priority directions of the foreign policy of the Russian Federation. According to the author of the present paper, new opportunities for active constructive interaction between the countries are provided with the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR or BRI) adopted by China for the purpose of combination of efforts of the states for stable development of economy in the Eurasian space and peaceful co-existence of the people on the basis of the principles of openness, inclusivity of different civilizations, tolerance, safety, mutual benefit and training.The aim of the paper is to discuss the status and prospects of the RussianChinese cooperation in the humanitarian field and search for new narrative for development cooperation.Methodology and research methods. The research was performed with a support on philosophical and general scientific methods: comparative, structurally functional and system types of analysis, synthesis, generalization, and forecasting.Results and scientific novelty. The Russian-Chinese recent cooperation was considered. Special attention was given to education communication strategy as one of the reliable and checked channels of establishment and consolidation of international economic relations. The educational component of humanitarian interaction enables to provide effective tools for adjustment and support for the international dialogue and has an extensive range of opportunities for harmonization of cultural, social and even political standards.It is emphasized that further strengthening of the productive bilateral interaction of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation is prevented by its developed model which is under construction and functions mainly at the level of public authorities. In spite of the fact that the relations between two countries are on the rise, the potential of the existing model has become exhausted, and it is therefore necessary to search for other ways of future joint collaborative work. Strengthening of partnership requires the transition to multilateral cooperation with other states and mutual participation of Russia and China in the course of overcoming the social and economic imbalance in the zone of their shared interests - the territory of the revived Silk Road. The third countries located along its southern transit corridor, unlike the states of the northern direction, are characterized by the backwardness of economics, high unemployment rate, lack of the fair system of upward mobility, poverty and ignorance of the population, thus promoting the spread of religious extremism and escalation of international conflicts. The author proposed to involve the humanitarian sphere as the mechanism of the start of transcontinental infrastructure projects in order to normalize the social and economic situation in these regions, to overcome socio-cultural barriers and to achieve integration of economics of various states for the sake of their steady growth and effectivization. The coordinated actions of China, Russia and EU countries for the promotion and maintenance of modern models of education can become a decisive factor to stabilize and implement the One Belt and One Road Initiative in problematic regions. In the author's view, partner States should focus on actions for modernization of national education systems and dissemination of scientific worldview, e.g. in the regions of the Northern Silk Road. Otherwise, the South will remain the centre of regularly military conflicts and terrorism financing, whereas the Russian and Chinese companies will continue to spend considerable personnel and financial resources for the safety of the ongoing joint projects.Practical significance. Materials of the research can be useful as a guide to reconsider the objectives of the Russian-Chinese alliance in the humanitarian sphere and generate new ideas on development and ways of implementation of the international educational programs.

TI  - Use of a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Algorithm in a South African Population of Patients With Cervical Cancer and High Prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Cervical cancer is common in resource-poor settings with high prevalence of tuberculosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. There are no data regarding the sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm in these high-risk cancer populations. Our objectives were to establish the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SLN algorithm in cervical cancer and to compare the detection rate of indocyanine green (ICG) versus blue dye versus technetium Tc 99m nanocolloid ( Tc-99m).Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the University of Pretoria. Tc-99m-nanocolloid tracer, ICG dye, and methylene blue (MB) were used to detect SLNs. Pathological ultrastaging was performed on hematoxylin-eosin- negative nodes.Results: Results of 72 women were analyzed. The mean age was 47.2 years, 5.5% had a history of tuberculosis, 18.1% had pelvic inflammatory disease, and 65.3% were HIV positive. The SLN detection rate was 65.3%. Detection rate of MB was 56.9%; Tc-99m, 69.4%; ICG, 87.5%; and the combination of MB and Tc-99m, 91.7%. Pelvic nodal metastases occurred in 26.4%. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of SLN biopsy were 85.7%, 100%, 100%, and 98.33%, respectively. The false-negative rate was 14.3%, and it was 0% if the algorithm was applied.Conclusions: The SLN algorithm is a feasible option for use in cervical cancer women with a high prevalence of HIV infection. The detection rate is generally lower, but in select subgroups of women, it was comparable to that reported elsewhere. This is the first report of the use of SLN biopsy in a substantial group of HIV-infected women.

TI  - Distribution and ecological aspects of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) species in Northeastern Iran
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine both the distribution and the ecological characteristics of sand flies in Golestan Province, northeast of Iran in 2016. Methods: In this study, 34 villages were selected based on their geographical conditions. Sticky paper traps were used for collecting the sand flies. Sampling was carried out in each of villages from May to November. In each village, 60 traps for indoors and 60 for outdoors were monthly installed. The species of all collected sand flies were determined using approved morphological keys. Pearson coefficient correlation was used to find the relationship between the number of collected Phlebotomus papatasi from different villages and incidence rate of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis as well as the number of positive cases of the disease. The altitude of the studied villages was extracted from digital elevation model of the area using GIS and vegetation cover density index of the province was extracted from Modis satellite imagery and distribution map of sand flies drown up. Results: Overall, 5 428 sand flies were collected and identified, belonging to 18 species. Phlebotomus wenyoni was reported for the first time from the area in this study. The frequency of sand flies in the villages located in northeast of the Golestan province (the plateau area, lower altitude, arid and semi-arid climates, and lower vegetation cover density), were more than other villages in this province. There was a significant correlation between the number of collected Phlebotomus papatasi and incidence rate of the zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in different villages (r=0.837, P=0.019) as well as the number of positive cases of the disease (r=0.688, P<0.001). Conclusions: In the northeaster areas of Golestan Province which is known as the endemic foci of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, the abundance of sand flies were more and the conditions for their growth and development were more appropriate.

TI  - Particulate matter estimation over a semi arid region Jaipur, India using satellite AOD and meteorological parameters
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study estimates ground-level Respirable Particulate Matter (RSPM) by the combined use of satellite remote sensing Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 550 nm (AOD(MODIS) or MODIS AOD) and ground-based meteorological measurements from April-2010 to March-2014 over Jaipur, semi-arid region in North-western, India.The satellite MODIS Level 2.0 AOD is used in developing multi-regression statistical models to estimate RSPM values over the study area. The relationship between particulate matter (PM) and AOD depends on size distribution, particle composition and vertical profile of aerosols. Thus, for optimal representation of MODIS AOD, the factors like Height of Planetary Boundary Layer (HPBL) and meteorological parameters has been considered in all regression models in the present study as surrogates. The performance of regression models is analyzed on the basis of descriptive statistical measures i.e. Normalised Mean Square Error (NMSE), Correlation (R), Factor of two observations (FA2), and Fractional Bias (FB). The nonlinear multi-regression model (MODEL V) performed better than other models for our study period and region on the basis of statistical analysis (R = 0.80, NMSE = 0.01, FB = 0.0, FA2 = 100). The coefficients obtained from MODEL V were again used over Jodhpur and found to perform better than other models.The study is further extended to find out the Air Quality Index (AQI) category over Jaipur. The average RSPM obtained from Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB) observations and those of model estimated values come under the "Moderately Polluted" category as per Indian air quality standards.

TI  - A Novel Indocyanine Green Fluorescence-Guided Video-Assisted Technique for Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The equipment to detect indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer is not widely accessible nor optimal. The fluorescence appears as a poorly defined white shine on a black background, and dimmed lighting is required. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, accuracy and healthcare costs of a novel approach for SLN biopsy by a video-assisted ICG-guided technique.The technique for detecting SLN was radioisotope (RI) in 194 cases, video-assisted ICG-guided in 70 cases and a combined method in 71 cases. In the video-assisted ICG group, a full HD laparoscopic system equipped with xenon lamps was used for a laser-free detection of ICG within a colored and magnified high-resolution image.Detection of ICG fluorescence using a laparoscope with a near-infrared filter provided a highly defined and colored image during SLN biopsy. SLN was identified in 100% of patients in all groups. Multiple SLNs were identified in 0.5% of RI patients, in 12.9% of ICG patients and in 14.1% of ICG + RI patients (p < 0.0001). In ICG + RI group, 95.1% of lymph nodes were radioactive and 92.7% were fluorescent. Operative times and healthcare costs were equivalent between groups.Video-assisted ICG-guided technique is a feasible and surgeon-friendly method for SLN biopsy, with equivalent efficacy compared to RI, providing an accurate staging of the axilla.

TI  - Nonsinking Organic Matter Production in the California Current
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Productive eastern boundary upwelling systems such as the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) are important regions for supporting both local and remote food webs. Several studies have reported on the temporal and spatial variability of primary production and gravitational export in the CCE. However, few studies have quantified the partitioning of net primary and new production into other reservoirs of detrital organic matter. This study tested the hypothesis that nonsinking detrital reservoirs are an exportable reservoir of new production in the CCE with samples collected by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation survey between 2008 and 2010. Water column gradients in nitrate (NO3-) and total organic carbon (TOC; which excludes sinking particulate organic carbon) were used to estimate potential rates of new production (P-New) and TOC production (P-TOC), respectively. The P-TOC:P-New varied between 0.16 and 0.56 and often increased with indicators of enhanced autotrophic production. At times, surface stratification was also correlated with elevated P-TOC:P-New. In the most productive, inshore region, P-TOC exceeded previously reported sinking export rates, which identified TOC as a quantitatively significant repository of exportable carbon in the CCE. However the sum of P-TOC and sinking export for these productive regions was less than both P-New and oxygen-based estimates of net community production. These results imply that nonsinking reservoirs alone are not sufficient to explain observed imbalances between production and export for the most productive CCE regions.Plain Language Summary The ocean's biological pump is typically quantified as the organic carbon that quickly sinks, that is, is exported, out of the surface lighted zone to be subsequently sequestered in the deep ocean. Recent studies have shown that other forms of organic matter produced by phytoplankton can also contribute to carbon export. In this study, we quantified how much new production and net primary production was channeled into nonsinking reservoirs such as dissolved organic carbon and suspended particulate organic carbon in the productive eastern boundary California Current Ecosystem. To match the data coverage provided by our organic carbon measurements we used satellite data to calculate net primary production and used measured depth profiles of nitrate together with model-derived upwelling velocities, to determine new production. We quantified the amount of nonsinking organic matter that accumulated in surface waters following production and found that the timescale of accumulation enabled this reservoir to participate in export. In some regions, as much carbon was present in the accumulated nonsinking reservoir as was quantified as sinking particulate carbon. We also found that lateral export from the productive coastal region was a potentially important pathway that could carry nutrients and carbon in organic matter to less productive waters.

TI  - Relationship Between Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Speed and Modeled Effective Pressure
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use a numerical subglacial hydrology model and remotely sensed observations of Greenland Ice Sheet surface motion to test whether the inverse relationship between effective pressure and regional melt season surface speeds observed at individual sites holds on a regional scale. The model is forced with daily surface runoff estimates for 2009 and 2010 across an similar to 8,000-km(2) region on the western margin. The overall subglacial drainage system morphology develops similarly in both years, with subglacial channel networks growing inland from the ice sheet margin and robust subglacial pathways forming over bedrock ridges. Modeled effective pressures are compared to contemporaneous regional surface speeds derived from TerraSAR-X imagery to investigate spatial relationships. Our results show an inverse spatial relationship between effective pressure and ice speed in the mid-melt season, when surface speeds are elevated, indicating that effective pressure is the dominant control on surface velocities in the mid-melt season. By contrast, in the early and late melt seasons, when surface speeds are slower, effective pressure and surface speed have a positive relationship. Our results suggest that outside of the mid-melt season, the influence of effective pressures on sliding speeds may be secondary to the influence of driving stress and spatially variable bed roughness.

TI  - An Analysis of Factors Influencing the Relationship between Satellite-Derived AOD and Ground-Level PM10
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution can endanger human health, especially in urban areas. Assessment of air quality primarily relies on ground-based measurements, but these provide only limited information on the spatial distribution of pollutants. In recent years, satellite derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been used to approximate particulate matter (PM) with varying success. In this study, the relationship between hourly mean concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less (PM10) and instantaneous AOD measurements is investigated for Berlin, Germany, for 2001-2015. It is found that the relationship between AOD and PM10 is rarely linear and strongly influenced by ambient relative humidity (RH), boundary layer height (BLH), wind direction and wind speed. Generally, when a moderately dry atmosphere (30% < RH <= 50%) coincides with a medium BLH (600-1200 m), AOD and PM10 are in the same range on a semi-quantitative scale. AOD increases with ambient RH, leading to an overestimation of the dry particle concentration near ground. However, this effect can be compensated if a low boundary layer (<600 m) is present, which in turn significantly increases PM10, eventually leading to satellite AOD and PM10 measurements of similar magnitude. Insights of this study potentially influence future efforts to estimate near-ground PM concentrations based on satellite AOD.

TI  - Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry for Surface Deformation Monitoring in Low-Land Permafrost Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-land permafrost areas are subject to intense freeze-thaw cycles and characterized by remarkable surface displacement. We used Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry (InSAR) in order to analyse the summer surface displacement over four spots in the Arctic and Antarctica since 2015. Choosing floodplain or outcrop areas as the reference for the InSAR relative deformation measurements, we found maximum subsidence of about 3 to 10 cm during the thawing season with generally high spatial variability. Sentinel-1 time-series of interferograms with 6-12 day time intervals highlight that subsidence is often occurring rather quickly within roughly one month in early summer. Intercomparison of summer subsidence from Sentinel-1 in 2017 with TerraSAR-X in 2013 over part of the Lena River Delta (Russia) shows a high spatial agreement between both SAR systems. A comparison with in-situ measurements for the summer of 2014 over the Lena River Delta indicates a pronounced downward movement of several centimetres in both cases but does not reveal a spatial correspondence between InSAR and local in-situ measurements. For the reconstruction of longer time-series of deformation, yearly Sentinel-1 interferograms from the end of the summer were considered. However, in order to infer an effective subsidence of the surface through melting of excess ice layers over multi-annual scales with Sentinel-1, a longer observation time period is necessary.

TI  - The influence of landscape pattern on the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most Chinese cities face a series of 'urban diseases' or problems during rapid urbanization, and of which urban precipitation and subsequent water-logging is a severe hotspot. A better understanding of the influence of urban land-use patterns on water-logging will be helpful for enhancing urban flood resistance. The relationship between the characteristics of land-use patterns and the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster (UWLFD) was analyzed in this paper, using landscape pattern indicators to describe the land-use structure. These included patch density (PD), edge density (ED), landscape division index (DIVISION), contagion (CONTAG), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). The risk of UWLFD was measured using the topographic slope and urban surface cover. Based on GIS and remote sensing data in 2003 and 2013, a case study of the metropolitan region of Kunming City showed that the risk of UWLFD had a positive correlation with landscape fragmentation (e.g., PD and ED), and strong negative correlation with landscape contagion (e.g., CONTAG) during the study period. This implied that landscape fragmentation aggravated the risk of UWLFD while landscape connectivity reduced the risk. Measures such as unified and long-term urban planning and design and the construction of green infrastructure will reduce the risk of UWLFD. The relationship between the landscape pattern and the risk of UWLFD provides a new perspective for systematic urban planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Calibrating a hydrological model in a regional river of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau using river water width determined from high spatial resolution satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential for estimating streamflow in large continental rivers from satellite observations of river hydraulic variables has been well recognized. However this has not been widely applied to smaller regional rivers. In this study, we investigated the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for the upper Yalongjiang River Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, based solely on river water surface widths derived from four high spatial resolution commercial satellite images: two from QuickBird and one each from IKONOS and WorldView-1. The model was forced using satellite-based meteorological datasets and calibrated using remotely sensed river widths. In situ gauged data are not used for modeling, making the approach applicable for ungauged basins. To shift the calibration objective from streamflow to river width, the hydrological model is connected to the at-a station hydraulic geometry (AHG) relationship. Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used for automatic calibration and to better quantify simulation uncertainty. After constraining the model parameter space solely to the river width observations, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for the streamflow simulated using the calibrated model reached 64.3% in the calibration period and 55.8% in the validation period. When calibrating the model using river width datasets with designed measurement error associated with riparian canopy, the influences of error on model simulation were less than expected. This was because the effect of the error was counteracted by adjustment of the AHG parameters. Both superimposing updated ranges for the AHG parameters and further constraining the model output using hydrological signature information following calibration reduced simulation uncertainty, particularly with use of the latter method. This study demonstrates the potential for application of the proposed calibration method to regional ungauged basins lacking ground streamflow observation data, and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively integrated with hydrological modeling.

TI  - Developing a multi-filter convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation using high-resolution aerial imagery and LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery is one of the most challenging topics in the remote sensing domain. Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and its derivatives have recently shown the abilities in pixel-wise prediction of remote sensing data. Many existing deep learning methods fuse LiDAR and high-resolution aerial imagery towards an inter-modal mode and thus overlook the intra-modal statistical characteristics. Additionally, the patch-based CNNs could generate the salt-and-pepper artifacts as characterized by isolated and spurious pixels on the object boundaries and patch edges leading to unsatisfied labelling results. This paper presents a semantic segmentation scheme that combines multi-filter CNN and multi-resolution segmentation (MRS). The multi-filter CNN aggregates LiDAR data and high-resolution optical imagery by multi modal data fusion for semantic labelling, and the MRS is further used to delineate object boundaries for reducing the salt-and-pepper artifacts. The proposed method is validated against two datasets: the ISPRS 2D semantic labelling contest of Potsdam and an area of Guangzhou in China labelled based on existing geodatabases. Various designs of data fusion strategy, CNN architecture and MRS scale are analyzed and discussed. Compared with other classification methods, our method improves the overall accuracies. Experiment results show that our combined method is an efficient solution for the semantic segmentation of LiDAR and high-resolution imagery.

TI  - Extracting Building Boundaries from High Resolution Optical Images and LiDAR Data by Integrating the Convolutional Neural Network and the Active Contour Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying and extracting building boundaries from remote sensing data has been one of the hot topics in photogrammetry for decades. The active contour model (ACM) is a robust segmentation method that has been widely used in building boundary extraction, but which often results in biased building boundary extraction due to tree and background mixtures. Although the classification methods can improve this efficiently by separating buildings from other objects, there are often ineluctable salt and pepper artifacts. In this paper, we combine the robust classification convolutional neural networks (CNN) and ACM to overcome the current limitations in algorithms for building boundary extraction. We conduct two types of experiments: the first integrates ACM into the CNN construction progress, whereas the second starts building footprint detection with a CNN and then uses ACM for post processing. Three level assessments conducted demonstrate that the proposed methods could efficiently extract building boundaries in five test scenes from two datasets. The achieved mean accuracies in terms of the F1 score for the first type (and the second type) of the experiment are 96.43 3.34% (95.68 3.22%), 88.60 3.99% (89.06 3.96%), and 91.62 +1.61% (91.47 2.58%) at the scene, object, and pixel levels, respectively. The combined CNN and ACM solutions were shown to be effective at extracting building boundaries from high-resolution optical images and LiDAR data.

TI  - Drought evaluation using the GRACE terrestrial water storage deficit over the Yangtze River Basin, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are some of the worst natural disasters that bring significant water shortages, economic losses, and adverse social consequences. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are widely used to characterize and evaluate droughts. In this work, we evaluate drought situations in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) using the GRACE Texas Center for Space Research (CSR) mascon (mass concentration) data from 2003 to 2015. Drought events are identified by water storage deficits (WSDs) derived from GRACE data, while the drought severity evaluation is based on the water storage deficit index (WSDI), standardized WSD time series, and total water storage deficit (TWSD). The WSDI is subsequently compared with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and standardized runoff index (SRI). The results indicate the YRB experienced increased wetness during the study period, with WSD values increasing at a rate of 5.20mm/year. Eight drought events are identified, and three major droughts occurred in 2004, 2006, and 2011, with WSDIs of -2.05,-2.38, andn-1.30 and TWSDs of -620.96 mm,-616.81 mm, and -192.44 mm, respectively. Our findings suggest that GRACE CSR mascon data can be used effectively to assess drought features in the YRB and that the WSDI facilitates robust and reliable characterization of droughts over large-scale areas.

AB  - This study examines the MODIS time series NDVI datasets to detect greenness regeneration over Western Rajasthan and the Gujarat region of India. Time series analysis was applied to 17-years (2000-2016). MODIS NDVI satellite data product. Rainfall data for the same period were also analyzed to understand its impact over vegetation. NDVI time series datasets of MODIS 16-day composite proved sufficient for deriving statistically significant trend values for identifying areas of change in vegetation cover. Areas showing positive changes in NDVI trend was clearly correlated with area& which were brought under irrigational network over these areas, indicating an increase in vegetation, due to availability of water supply. Trends in NDVI were also compared with the trends in rainfall over the selected locations from Gujarat and Western Rajasthan. NDVI was positively correlated with the rainfall in both the regions. The NDVI time series trend analysis successfully detected the changes in greenness regeneration areas in Gujarat and western Rajasthan.

TI  - Performance of ratio-based, soil-adjusted and atmospherically corrected multispectral vegetation indices in predicting herbaceous aboveground biomass in a <i>Colophospermum mopane</i> tree-shrub savanna
T2  - GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and near-real-time estimation of herbaceous aboveground biomass (AGB) at farm level is crucial for monitoring pasture production and proactive management of stock in semiarid rangelands. Despite its importance, remote sensing has been rarely used by range ecologists and managers in Zimbabwe. This study aimed at assessing the performance of classical multispectral vegetation indices (MVIs) when either singly regressed with measured herbaceous AGB or combined with other visible spectral bands in predicting herbaceous AGB in a Colophospermum mopane savannah. Field herbaceous AGB and corresponding Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager visible spectral data were collected during the 2016-2017 rainy season. Relationships between measured AGB and classical MVIs and extended models of MVIs combined with other visible bands were analysed using bootstrapped simple and stepwise multiple linear regression functions. When MVIs were singly regressed with measured AGB, ratio-based indices yielded the highest r(2) value of 0.64, followed by soil-adjusted indices (r(2)=0.61), while atmospherically corrected MVIs showed the lowest r(2) of 0.58 (p=0.00). A significant improvement in herbaceous AGB estimation was obtained using a combination of MVIs and other visible bands. Soil-adjusted MVIs showed the greatest increase (44-46%) in r(2), while atmospherically corrected and ratio-based MVIs poorly improved (<5%). The findings demonstrate that combining MVIs with Landsat 8 optical bands, especially green band, provides the best models for estimating AGB in C.mopane savanna rangelands. These findings emphasize the importance of testing band-MVI combinations when developing models for estimating herbaceous AGB.

TI  - Probing tectonic processes with space geodesy in the south Carpathians: insights from archive SAR data
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Carpathian bend is amongst the tectonically most active areas in Europe where intraplate subduction triggers sub-crustal earthquakes releasing significant amount of seismic energy in a well-defined seismic zone. To constrain the deep processes by exploiting their linkage to the surface processes an accurate knowledge of surface deformations is required. Detection of small-magnitude tectonic processes with high reliability is a challenge in which the recent space geodetic techniques may bright a breakthrough. In this study we used the archive ENVISAT data set of the European Space Agency to investigate the feasibility limit of detecting crustal deformations in the region of the south Carpathian bend, where past geodetic observations failed to unravel the tectonic processes with high details. Despite the inherent limitations of radar interferometry our results show that coherent velocity field can be estimated with a magnitude of few mm/year. The vertical displacement field suggests subsidence in the Brasov basin which is in agreement with former studies, however radar interferometry can provide a more detailed picture.

TI  - Assessing the Resilience of CoastalWetlands to Extreme Hydrologic Events Using Vegetation Indices: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal wetlands (CWs) offer numerous imperative functions that support a diverse array of life forms that are poorly adapted for other environments and provide an economic base for human communities. Unfortunately, CWs have been experiencing significant threats due to meteorological and climatic fluctuations as well as anthropogenic impacts. The wetlands and marshes in Apalachicola Bay, Florida have endured the impacts of several extreme hydrologic events (EHEs) over the past few decades. These extreme hydrologic events include drought, hurricane, heavy precipitation and fluvial flooding. Remote sensing has been used and continues to demonstrate promise for acquiring spatial and temporal information about CWs thereby making it easier to track and quantify long term changes driven by EHEs. These wetland ecosystems are also adversely impacted by increased human activities such as wetland conversion to agricultural, aquaculture, industrial or residential use; construction of dikes along the shoreline; and sprawl of built areas. In this paper, we review previous works on coastal wetland resilience to EHEs. We synthesize these concepts in the context of remote sensing as the primary assessment tool with focus on derived vegetation indices to monitor CWs at regional and global scales.

TI  - An Integrated Hydrological-Hydraulic Model for Simulating Surface Water Flows of a Shallow Lake Surrounded by Large Floodplains
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated hydrological-hydraulic model employing the 2-D local inertial equation as the core is established for effective numerical simulation of surface water flows in a great lake and its floodplain. The model is a cascade of validated hydrological and hydraulic sub-models. The model was applied to simulating the surface water flows of the Tonle Sap Lake and its floodplain in Cambodia using the roughness coefficient value calibrated comparing with a remote-sensing data set. The resulting model reasonably handles backwater flows during the rainy season and simulates the propagations of wet and dry interfaces without numerical instability, owing to a proper setting of time step supported by a novel numerical stability analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the surface water dynamics focusing on the setting of roughness coefficient and the backwater effect was also carried out. Overall, utilizing the 2-D local inertial equation in the assessment of lake water dynamics is a new modelling approach, which turns out to be an efficient simulation tool.

TI  - The diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and sentinel node biopsy in the prediction of pelvic lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer A retrospective observational study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the sentinel node biopsy (SNB), systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) may not be needed for patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. On the other hand, imaging technology including fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has been developing worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT and SNB in the prediction of pelvic lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients.One hundred twenty-one patients with endometrial cancer underwent FDG PET/CT before hysterectomy and received SNB followed by systematic PLND. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT and SNB in the prediction of pelvic node metastasis to the ultimate histologic status.FDG PET/CT had lower sensitivity (36.8% versus 57.9%, P=. 1) and a higher specificity (96.4% versus 84.8%, P<.01) than SNB. The kappa statistics of FDG PET/CT and SNB were 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15-0.59) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.90), respectively. The sensitivity of SNB was significantly higher than that of FDG PET/CT in all hemi-pelvises (HPs) in which the short axis of the largest metastatic lymph node was <5mm in diameter (72.7% versus 18.2%, P=. 01). In contrast, the sensitivity of FDG PET/CT was higher than that of SNB in all HPs in which the short axis of the largest metastatic lymph node was >= 5mm in diameter (62.5% versus 37.5%, P=. 2); however, the difference was not statistically significant. When the combined diagnosis of FDG PET/CT and SNB was made, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.2% and 82.1%, respectively.SNB was more useful for detecting lymph node metastasis than FDG PET/CT, especially in patients with small metastatic lymph nodes. The combined diagnosis of FDG PET/CT and SNB improves the sensitivity; PET-positive nodes should be dissected regardless of SNB status and HPs in which SNB was not detected should be dissected systematically regardless of FDG PET/CT status.

TI  - Repeated resection-associated breast angiosarcoma A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: As a very rare vascular tumor, breast angiosarcoma (AS) can be divided into primary and second breast AS. However, the latter is slightly more commonly detected in clinical practice. Radiation post mastectomy is the common cause for the secondary breast AS, and although there are other reasons, it is still quite rare. In the present study, we reported a rare case of breast AS and summarized the relevant literatures so that to conduce to diagnose AS.Patient concerns: A 50-year-old female with a history of right breast neoplasm was treated with repeat lumpectomy for 4 times during 8 years.Diagnoses: Mammogram and ultrasound examination demonstrated a possible malignancy (BIRADS-4B and BI-RADS-4C, respectively). Immunohistochemically positive for endothelial markers CD31, CD34, ERG, and FVIII-R-Ag.Interventions: The patient underwent a right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy by our multidisciplinary team and no other therapy was given postsurgery.Outcomes: The patient had no recurrence after 3 months.Lessons: Based on our findings, we concluded that repeated resection might be a risk factor for the breast AS, especially for a gradual pathological evolution from benign to malignant. This case showed a very rare cause for angiomatosis of breast, and the patient had a successful outcome after a simple mastectomy.

TI  - Investigation of Ground Deformation in Taiyuan Basin, China from 2003 to 2010, with Atmosphere-Corrected Time Series InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive groundwater exploitation is common through the Taiyuan basin, China, and is well known to result in ground subsidence. However, most ground subsidence studies in this region focus on a single place (Taiyuan city), and thus fail to demonstrate the regional extent of the deformation phenomena in the whole basin. In this study, we used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis to investigate land subsidence across the entire Taiyuan basin region. Our data set includes a total of 75 ENVISAT ASAR images from two different frames acquired from August 2003 to September 2010 and 33 TerraSAR-X scenes spanning between March 2009 and March 2010. ERA-Interim reanalysis was used to correct the stratified delay to reduce the bias expected from the systematic components of tropospheric delay. The residual delay after correction of stratified delay can be considered as a stochastic component and be mitigated through spatial-temporal filtering. A comparison with MERIS (Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) measurements indicates that our atmospheric corrections improved agreement over the conventional spatial-temporal filtering by about 20%. The displacement results from our atmosphere-corrected time series InSAR were further validated with continuous GPS data. We found eight subsiding centers in the basin and a surface uplift to the north of Taiyuan city. The causes of ground deformation are analyzed and discussed in relation to gravity data, pre-existing faults, and types of land use.

TI  - Identifying the signs of weakness, deterioration, and damage to flood defence infrastructure from remotely sensed data and mapped information
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring flood defence condition is a critical part of the effective management of flood defence infrastructure. In this study, the use of remotely sensed data to identify indicators of weakness, deterioration, and damage is explored. Such indicators are often tell-tale signs of processes that can lead to flood defence failure and breaching. Sources of data and the techniques to analyse those data are discussed and a framework is developed that links data sources to indicators of flood defence performance. A range of examples are presented that highlight both the value and limitations of bringing together multiple sources of data such as Light Detection and Ranging and historical mapping to supplement visual inspection assessments. The paper concludes that nationally available sources of remotely sensed data can be used to supplement existing visual condition inspection procedures to help prioritise and programme maintenance and repair work.

TI  - Lake Nyos, a Multirisk and Vulnerability Appraisal
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Situated at the northern flank of the Oku Massif, Lake Nyos crater epitomizes landscape features originating from volcanic explosions during the Quaternary. The Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), to which it belongs, constitutes the most active volcanic region in Cameroon. In 1986, an outgas explosion occurred from beneath the lake and killed 1746 people in several neighbouring villages. The event influenced a radial area of 25 to 40 km wide, particularly in eastern and western direction. This was mainly due to: (1) the rugged nature of the landscape (fault fields), which enabled the heavier gas to follow valleys framed by faults corridors without affecting elevated areas; and (2) the seasonal dominating western wind direction, which channeled the gas along tectonic corridors and valleys. This paper assesses the geological risk and vulnerability in the Lake Nyos before and after several proposal to mitigate future outgas events. Remotely sensed data, together with GIS tools (topographic maps, aerial photographs), helped to determine and assess lineaments and associated risks. A critical grid combining severity and frequency analysis was used to assess the vulnerability of the local population. There is evidence that along the main fault directions (SW-NE), anthropogenic activities are most intensive and they may play an aggravating role for disasters. This requires the local population's consciousness-raising. The results also show that population around Lake Nyos still remains vulnerable to volcanic hazards and floods. However, the area has been safe since the last degassing and jet grouting through multiple procedures and actions proposed in the National Contingency Plan, and equally by the relief organization plan (DROP or ORSEC plan) for the Menchum Division. Another issue is that the local population is concerned with the idea of returning to the affected areas in order to stay close to their ancestors or the deceased. Therefore, even after jet grouting and degassing, the problem of risk minimization for local residents remains.

TI  - Forest cover loss and recovery in an East African remnant forest area: Understanding its context and drivers for conservation and sustainable ecosystem service provision
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of the often complex forest cover change drivers, and the perceived and observed forest cover changes substantially contributes to the sustainable management of tropical forests. This paper aims at developing an integrated view on tropical forest cover change and its drivers by combining the perception of the stakeholders (farmers, forest guards, and forest managers) and five decades forest cover mapping, based on interview and remote sensing respectively, through a case study in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Afforestation and deforestation occurred when law enforcement was stronger and weaker respectively, depending on political regimes. Since 1937 i.e., the early Imperial period, the position of the forest edge has not changed much over time, it rather became sharper. In the late Imperial era (1972-1975), the forest cover declined only by 1.6%. In the subsequent two governments, the socialist and the current federal rule (1975-2014), the forest cover increased by 17%. There was a 3.9% forest cover decline during the transition between the two governments. This pattern of overall net forest cover increase observed by remote sensing data has been correctly perceived by stakeholders. Stakeholders acknowledged the observed forest cover increase, however, they argued that the forest is declining in terms of its quality for several ecosystem services (ES). The ES decline is believed to have resulted from the gradual shift of pure dense indigenous forest to an increasing share of exotic plantations. In the three political regimes, land policy, illegal encroachments, population pressure and social unrest have been the leading drivers of forest cover change. Communities' involvement in forest management activities and sharing benefits were regarded as positive perception of forest management strategies during the federal administration (1993-2007) of the current government by farmers. Among the factors that determine forest management strategies proposed by stakeholders are gender, landholding size, education level and age. Future conservation and development interventions need to consider stakeholders' concerns. Their involvement in forest management is also necessary for improved biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service provision, and social wellbeing.

TI  - Using multispectral landsat and sentinel-2 satellite data to investigate vegetation change at Mount St. Helens since the great volcanic eruption in 1980
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term analyses of vegetation succession after catastrophic events are of high interest for an improved understanding of succession dynamics. However, in many studies such analyses were restricted to plot-based measurements. Contrarily, spatially continuous observations of succession dynamics over extended areas and time-periods are sparse. Here, we applied a change vector analysis (CVA) to investigate vegetation succession dynamics at Mount St. Helens after the great volcanic eruption in 1980 using Landsat. We additionally applied a supervised random forest classification using Sentinel-2 data to map the currently prevailing vegetation types. Change vector analysis was performed with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the urban index (UI) for three subsequent decades after the eruption as well as for the whole observation time between 1984 and 2016. The influence of topography on the current vegetation distribution was examined by comparing altitude, slope angles and aspect values of vegetation classes derived by the random forest classification. Wilcox- Rank-Sum test was applied to test for significant differences between topographic properties of the vegetation classes inside and outside of the areas affected by the eruption. For the full time period, a total area of 516 km(2) was identified as re-vegetated, whereas the area and magnitude of re-growing vegetation decreased during the three decades and migrated closer to the volcanic crater. Vegetation losses were mainly observed in regions unaffected by the eruption and related mostly to timber harvesting. The vegetation type classification reached a high overall accuracy of approximately 90%. 36 years after the eruption, coniferous and deciduous trees have established at formerly devastated areas dominating with a proportion of 66%, whereas shrubs are more abundant in riparian zones. Sparse vegetation dominates at regions very close to the crater. Elevation was found to have a great influence on the reestablishment and distribution of the vegetation classes within the devastated areas showing in almost all cases significant differences in altitude distribution. Slope was less important for the different classes - only representing significantly higher values for meadows, whereas aspect seems to have no notable influence on the reestablishment of vegetation at Mount St. Helens. We conclude that major vegetation succession dynamics after catastrophic events can be assessed and characterized over large areas from freely available remote sensing data and hence contribute to an improved understanding of succession dynamics.

TI  - Application of Low-Cost Fixed-Wing UAV for Inland Lakes Shoreline Investigation
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important factors that influences the performance of geomorphologic parameters on urban lakes is the water level. It fluctuates periodically, causing shoreline changes. It is especially significant for typical environmental studies like bathymetric surveys, morphometric parameters calculation, sediment depth changes, thermal structure, water quality monitoring, etc. In most reservoirs, it can be obtained from digitized historical maps or plans or directly measured using the instruments such as: geodetic total station, GNSS receivers, UAV with different sensors, satellite and aerial photos, terrestrial and airborne light detection and ranging, or others. Today one of the most popular measuring platforms, increasingly applied in many applications is UAV. Unmanned aerial system can be a cheap, easy to use, on-demand technology for gathering remote sensing data. Our study presents a reliable methodology for shallow lake shoreline investigation with the use of a low-cost fixed-wing UAV system. The research was implemented on a small, eutrophic urban inland reservoir located in the northern part of Poland-Lake Suskie. The geodetic TS, and RTK/GNSS measurements, hydroacoustic soundings and experimental aerial mapping were conducted by the authors in 2012-2015. The article specifically describes the UAV system used for experimental measurements, the obtained results and the accuracy analysis. Final conclusions demonstrate that even a low-cost fixed-wing UAV can provide an excellent tool for accurately surveying a shallow lake shoreline and generate valuable geoinformation data collected definitely faster than when traditional geodetic methods are employed.

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Extent and Change: A Globally Applicable Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates a globally applicable method for monitoring mangrove forest extent at high spatial resolution. A 2010 mangrove baseline was classified for 16 study areas using a combination of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat composite imagery within a random forests classifier. A novel map-to-image change method was used to detect annual and decadal changes in extent using ALOS PALSAR/JERS-1 imagery. The map-to-image method presented makes fewer assumptions of the data than existing methods, is less sensitive to variation between scenes due to environmental factors (e.g., tide or soil moisture) and is able to automatically identify a change threshold. Change maps were derived from the 2010 baseline to 1996 using JERS-1 SAR and to 2007, 2008 and 2009 using ALOS PALSAR. This study demonstrated results for 16 known hotspots of mangrove change distributed globally, with a total mangrove area of 2,529,760 ha. The method was demonstrated to have accuracies consistently in excess of 90% (overall accuracy: 92.2-93.3%, kappa: 0.86) for mapping baseline extent. The accuracies of the change maps were more variable and were dependent upon the time period between images and number of change features. Total change from 1996 to 2010 was 204,850 ha (127,990 ha gain, 76,860 ha loss), with the highest gains observed in French Guiana (15,570 ha) and the highest losses observed in East Kalimantan, Indonesia (23,003 ha). Changes in mangrove extent were the consequence of both natural and anthropogenic drivers, yielding net increases or decreases in extent dependent upon the study site. These updated maps are of importance to the mangrove research community, particularly as the continual updating of the baseline with currently available and anticipated spaceborne sensors. It is recommended that mangrove baselines are updated on at least a 5-year interval to suit the requirements of policy makers.

TI  - Evaluation of PROBA-V Collection 1: Refined Radiometry, Geometry, and Cloud Screening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PROBA-V (PRoject for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation) was launched in May-2013 as an operational continuation to the vegetation (VGT) instruments on-board the Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-4 and -5 satellites. The first reprocessing campaign of the PROBA-V archive from Collection 0 (C0) to Collection 1 (C1) aims at harmonizing the time series, thanks to improved radiometric and geometric calibration and cloud detection. The evaluation of PROBA-V C1 focuses on (i) qualitative and quantitative assessment of the new cloud detection scheme; (ii) quantification of the effect of the reprocessing by comparing C1 to C0; and (iii) evaluation of the spatio-temporal stability of the combined SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V archive through comparison to METOP/advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). The PROBA-V C1 cloud detection algorithm yields an overall accuracy of 89.0%. Clouds are detected with very few omission errors, but there is an overdetection of clouds over bright surfaces. Stepwise updates to the visible and near infrared (VNIR) absolute calibration in C0 and the application of degradation models to the SWIR calibration in C1 result in sudden changes between C0 and C1 Blue, Red, and NIR TOC reflectance in the first year, and more gradual differences for short-wave infrared (SWIR). Other changes result in some bias between C0 and C1, although the root mean squared difference (RMSD) remains well below 1% for top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance and below 0.02 for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Comparison to METOP/AVHRR shows that the recent reprocessing campaigns on SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V have resulted in a more stable combined time series.

TI  - Feasibility of near-infrared fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node evaluation of the oral cavity in healthy dogs
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVETo evaluate the usefulness of injection of indocyanine green (ICG) solution with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging for transcutaneous detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and their associated lymphatic vessels in the oral mucosa of healthy dogs.ANIMALS6 adult purpose-bred research hounds.PROCEDURESEach dog was sedated, and 1 mL of ICG solution was injected into the gingival mucosa dorsal to the right maxillary canine tooth. Subsequently, NIR fluorescence imaging was used to transcutaneously detect the lymphatic vessels and SLNs. The distance between the injection site and each SLN was measured. Time to first evidence of node fluorescence was recorded, and velocity of ICG movement was calculated. A slide preparation of a fine-needle aspiration sample of the fluorescing structure underwent cytologic examination (to confirm presence of lymphatic tissue) and NIR fluorescence imaging (to confirm presence of ICG).RESULTSThe ipsilateral mandibular lymphocentrum was the SLN in all dogs. The time to visually detectable fluorescence ranged from 4 to 15 minutes (mean +/- SD, 8.8 +/- 3.76 minutes). The mean velocity was 1.94 +/- 0.93 cm/min. Fluorescence was not observed in the contralateral lymph nodes. Each fluorescing structure was confirmed to be lymphatic tissue, and NIR fluorescence imaging revealed that ICG was present in the sampled SLN.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCEResults indicated that injection of ICG solution with NIR fluorescence imaging can be used to transcutaneously identify SLNs along with associated lymphatic vessels in the oral mucosa of healthy dogs. Time from injection to identification of fluorescence was rapid with prolonged retention of material within the SLN, indicating that this procedure could be performed during surgery.

TI  - Mapping Mediterranean seagrasses with Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three different supervised classifiers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected re-flectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km(2) between depths of 1.4-16.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-effective fashion.

TI  - Trapped Gravity Waves and Their Association with Turbulence in a Large Thunderstorm Anvil during PECAN
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-14 (GOES-14) 1-km visible satellite data with 1-min frequency revealed horizontally propagating internal gravity waves emanating from tropopause-penetrating deep convection on 3-4 June 2015 during the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field experiment. These waves had horizontal wavelengths of 6-8 km and approximate ground-relative phase speeds of 35 m s(-1). PECAN radiosonde data are used to document the environment supporting the horizontally propagating gravity waves within the 200-km-long downstream thunderstorm anvil. Comparisons among soundings within the anvil core, at the downstream anvil edge, and outside of the anvil, together with supporting high-resolution numerical simulations, establish the importance of the storm-induced upper-tropospheric/lower-stratospheric (UTLS) outflow in providing conditions allowing vertical trapping of internal gravity waves over large horizontal distances within the mesoscale anvil. Turbulence was reported by commercial aviation in proximity to the gravity waves near the downstream anvil edge. The simulations suggest that the strongest turbulence was consistent with a mesoscale destabilization of the outer portion of the downstream anvil at elevations immediately below the outflow jet, where differential temperature advection owing to the strong associated vertical shear reduces static stability. The simulated gravity waves are trapped at this elevation and extend for several kilometers below. Local minima of moist gradient Richardson number occur immediately above the simulated warm gravity wave temperature perturbations at anvil base, suggesting a possible role these waves could play in establishing precise locations for the onset of turbulence.

TI  - Analysing Retraction Notices of Scholarly Journals: A Study
T2  - DESIDOC JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) is not an unalloyed advantage when talking about propagation and expansion of scholarly knowledge. The same ICT which acts as an enabler to research in the comfort of one's study and preferred environment makes the researchers with weak conscience vulnerable to the temptation of research misconduct. Surprisingly, the same technology acts as a sentinel, helping academe nail such transgressions and withdrawing them or taking the contextual corrective recourse. Of late, there has been a substantial increase in the invalidation and withdrawal of research articles based on invalid data and findings. One analysed the retraction notices of 249 annulled articles, indexed in Scopus, during the period, 2000-2017. The study has highlighted that the majority of the retracted notices do not have explicit reasons for revoking the findings of research articles. It has stressed upon the immensely pivotal role of libraries in spreading awareness and sensitising researchers with regard to adherence to norms, ethics and policies of scholarly communication.

TI  - COMPARISON OF BG-SENTINEL PROTOTYPE, BG-SENTINEL-1, AND BG-SENTINEL-2: BETTER RESULTS WITH MODIFICATION OF EARLIER DESIGN
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The BG-Sentinel (R) (BGS) trap is considered "the gold standard'' for Aedes albopictus surveillance. With the risk of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in the USA, it is imperative our best surveillance asset is as dependable and cost-effective as possible. Biogents AG (Regensburg, Germany) in recent years has manufactured 3 generations of BGS traps in an effort to optimize trapping performance of invasive Aedes species. We evaluated the field efficacy of BG-Sentinel 2 prototype (BGS2P), BG-Sentinel (BGS1), and BG-Sentinel 2 (R) (BGS2). The field experiment was conducted between July 1 and September 21, 2016, on the outskirts of an abandoned industrial area in the city of Trenton, NJ (40 degrees 13'58.0"N, 74 degrees 44'21.6"W). All 3 traps were compared with 3-compound BG cartridge lures. There was no significant difference in total Ae. albopictus collections among BGS1 and BGS2. However, the number of Ae. albopictus collected from the BGS2P was significantly lower than BGS1 (P = 0.016) and BGS2 (P = 0.025). Our results indicate BGS2, encompassing the latest technology aimed with improved durability and efficacy, will yield the highest capture rates of adult Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.

TI  - Surface Moisture and Vegetation Cover Analysis for Drought Monitoring in the Southern Kruger National Park Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the southern summer season of 2015 and 2016, South Africa experienced one of the most severe meteorological droughts since the start of climate recording, due to an exceptionally strong El Nino event. To investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of surface moisture and vegetation structure, data from ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-1/-2 and NASA's Landsat-8 for the period between March 2015 and November 2017 were utilized. In combination, these radar and optical satellite systems provide promising data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1 C-band data was exploited to derive surface moisture based on a hyper-temporal co-polarized (vertical-vertical-VV) radar backscatter change detection approach, describing dynamics between dry and wet seasons. Vegetation information from a TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner)-derived canopy height model (CHM), as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, were utilized to analyze vegetation structure types and dynamics with respect to the surface moisture index (SurfMI). Our results indicate that our combined radar-optical approach allows for a separation and retrieval of surface moisture conditions suitable for drought monitoring. Moreover, we conclude that it is crucial for the development of a drought monitoring system for savanna ecosystems to integrate land cover and vegetation information for analyzing surface moisture dynamics derived from Earth observation time series.

TI  - Investigation on spatiotemporal distribution of aerosol optical properties over two oceanic regions surrounding Indian subcontinent during summer monsoon season
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Columnar spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) concentrations were collected on board the Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV) of Sagar Kanya (SK) during 7-21 June 2014 (SK-313) and 31 July-14 August 2015 (SK-323) over the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB), respectively, for the two successive years during summer monsoon season. AOD measured at 500 nm (AOD(500)) varied significantly from 0.08 to 0.66 (0.07 to 0.60), with a mean of 0.48 +/- 0.13 (0.34 +/- 0.13) over the BoB (AS) during SK-313 (SK-323). It simply implies that aerosol load was higher over BoB, not variability as the standard deviations of AOD over both oceans are identical (0.13). Daily AOD(500) ranged between 0.15 and 0.60 accounted for 70-75% of the total occurrences over two oceanic regions. Mean ngstrom exponent (alpha or alpha) and ngstrom turbidity coefficient (beta or beta) were found to be 0.43 +/- 0.17 (0.39 +/- 0.19) and 0.37 +/- 0.15 (0.27 +/- 0.13), respectively, which are higher over the AS during SK-323 (SK-313) that indicate predominance of coarse-relative to fine-mode particles. On the other hand, the spectral curvature and second derivative of alpha (alpha') also showed significant contribution of coarse-mode particles over fine during the two campaigns. Further, column aerosol size distribution (CSD) derived from the King's inversion also exhibited bimodal distribution with a predominant peak observed in the coarse mode (1.0 mu m) compared to the fine mode at a geometric mean radius at 0.1 mu m over two oceans. The observed data showed that the two marine regions are significantly influenced by various types of aerosols with a predominance of mixed type (MT) of aerosols. From the morphological study, it is inferred that the particles are a flake, spherical, irregular, and in flower and aggregated shapes conducted for the TSPM samples collected during SK-323 over the AS. Finally, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model is used to study the impact of long-distance transported aerosols and identify their sources.

TI  - Joint SAR Image Time Series and PSInSAR Data Analytics: An LDA Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the constant increase in Earth Observation (EO) data collections, the monitoring of land cover is facilitated by the temporal diversity of the satellite images datasets. Due to the capacity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors to operate independently of sunlight and weather conditions, SAR image time series offer the possibility to form a dataset with almost regular temporal sampling. This paper aims at mining the SAR image time series for an analysis of target's behavior from the perspective of both temporal evolution and coherence. The authors present a two-level analytical approach envisaging the assessment of global (related to perceivable structures on the ground) and local (related to changes occurred within a perceivable structure on the ground) evolution inside the scene. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is implemented to identify the categories of evolution present in the analyzed scene, while the statistical and coherent proprieties of the dataset's images are exploited in order to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic response, the so-called Persistent Scatterers (PS). A comparative study of the two algorithms' classification results is conducted on ERS and Sentinel-1 data. At global scale, the results fit human perception, as most of the points which can be exploited for Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PS-InSAR) are classified within the same class, referring to stable structures. At local scale, the LDA classification demands for an extended number of classes (defined through a perplexity-based analysis), enabling further differentiation inside the evolutional character of those stable structures. The comparison against the map of detected PS reveals which classes present higher temporal correlation, determining a stable evolutionary character, opening new perspectives for validation of both PS detection and SITS analysis algorithms.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck using the indocyanine green SPY <i>Elite</i> system
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Lymph node status is the single most important prognostic factor for patients with early-stage cutaneous melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard of care for intermediate depth melanomas. Modem SLNB implementation includes technetium-99 lymphoscintigraphy combined with local administration of a vital blue dye. However, sentinel lymph nodes may fail to localize in some cases and false-negative rates range from 0 to 34%. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new sentinel lymph node biopsy technique using indocyanine green (ICG) and the SPY Elite near-infrared imaging system.Materials and methods: Cases of primary cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck without locoregional metastasis, underwent SLNB at a single quaternary care institution between May 2016 and June 2017. Intraoperatively, 0.25 mL of ICG was injected intradermal in 4 quadrants around the primary lesion. 10-15 minute circulation time was permitted. SPY Elite identified the sentinel lymph node within the nodal basin marked by lymphoscintigraphy. Target first echelon lymph nodes were confirmed with a gamma probe and ICG fluorescence.Results: 14 patients were included with T1a to T4b cutaneous melanomas. Success rates for sentinel lymph node identification using lymphoscintigraphy and the SPY Elite system were both 86%. Zero false negatives occurred. Median length of follow-up was 323 days.Conclusions: In this pilot study, Indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence demonstrates a safe, and facile method of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck compared with lymphoscintigraphy and vital blue dyes.

TI  - Hurricane Maria in the US Caribbean: Disturbance Forces, Variation of Effects, and Implications for Future Storms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of Hurricane Maria on the U.S. Caribbean was used to study the causes of remotely-sensed spatial variation in the effects of (1) vegetation index loss and (2) landslide occurrence. The vegetation index is a measure of canopy 'greenness', a combination of leaf chlorophyll, leaf area, canopy cover and structure. A generalized linear model was made for each kind of effect, using idealized maps of the hurricane forces, along with three landscape characteristics that were significantly associated. In each model, one of these characteristics was forest fragmentation, and another was a measure of disturbance-propensity. For the greenness loss model, the hurricane force was wind, the disturbance-propensity measure was initial greenness, and the third landscape characteristic was fraction forest cover. For the landslide occurrence model, the hurricane force was rain, the disturbance-propensity measure was amount of land slope, and the third landscape characteristic was soil clay content. The model of greenness loss had a pseudo R(2 )of 0.73 and showed the U.S. Caribbean lost 31% of its initial greenness from the hurricane, with 51% lost from the initial in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) from Hurricane Maria along with Hurricane Irma. More greenness disturbance was seen in areas with less wind sheltering, higher elevation and topographic sides. The model of landslide occurrence had a pseudo R-2 of 0.53 and showed the U.S. Caribbean had 34% of its area and 52% of the LEF area with a landslide density of at least one in 1 km(2) from Hurricane Maria. Four experiments with parameters from previous storms of wind speed, storm duration, rainfall, and forest structure over the same storm path and topographic landscape were run as examples of possible future scenarios. While intensity of the storm makes by far the largest scenario difference, forest fragmentation makes a sizable difference especially in vulnerable areas of high clay content or high wind susceptibility. This study showed the utility of simple hurricane force calculations connected with landscape characteristics and remote-sensing data to determine forest susceptibility to hurricane effects.

TI  - Analyses of Land Cover Change Trajectories Leading to Tropical Forest Loss: Illustrated for the West Kutai and Mahakam Ulu Districts, East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Indonesia, land cover change for agriculture and mining is threatening tropical forests, biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, land cover change is highly dynamic and complex and varies over time and space. In this study, we combined Landsat-based land cover (change) mapping, pixel-to-pixel cross tabulations and expert knowledge to analyze land cover change and forest loss in the West Kutai and Mahakam Ulu districts in East Kalimantan from 1990-2009. We found that about one-third of the study area changed in 1990-2009 and that the different types of land cover changes in the study area increased and involved more diverse and characteristic trajectories in 2000-2009, compared to 1990-2000. Degradation to more open forest types was dominant, and forest was mostly lost due to trajectories that involved deforestation to grasslands and shrubs (similar to 17%), and to a lesser extent due to trajectories from forest to mining and agriculture (11%). Trajectories from forest to small-scale mixed cropland and smallholder rubber occurred more frequently than trajectories to large-scale oil palm or pulpwood plantations; however, the latter increased over time. About 11% of total land cover change involved multiple-step trajectories and thus intermediate land cover types. The combined trajectory analysis in this paper thus contributes to a more comprehensive analysis of land cover change and the drivers of forest loss, which is essential to improve future land cover projections and to support spatial planning.

TI  - A Landsat composite covering all Amazonia for applications in ecology and conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies at small spatial extents have shown that local floristic and edaphic patterns within the hyper-diverse Amazonian forests can be identified at a high thematic resolution using Landsat imagery. This suggests that Landsat images have the potential to indicate ecologically relevant environmental and biotic variation in the forests also at the extent of the entire basin. However, the full potential of Landsat data for these purposes has not yet been exploited in ecological and biodiversity research or in conservation applications. This is largely because the artifactual noise that is introduced by atmospheric and directional effects into multi-scene composite images can swamp the subtle spectral differences between different types of primary forest. Here, we present a new Landsat TM/ETM+ image composite for the entire Amazon biome that largely overcomes these problems. It is based on more than 16000 individual image acquisitions from the 10-year period 2000-2009. The images were individually processed to directionally and topographically normalized surface reflectance and combined into 2.5 degree tiles using the medoid compositing criterion. Visual inspection showed that the resulting image composite is radiometrically clearly more consistent than other currently available Landsat composites. We tested the ecological relevance of the new Landsat composite by comparing its reflectance values with edaphic properties measured in more than 300 field sampling localities spread across 2000km of Amazonia. We found a strong correlation between observed and predicted concentration of exchangeable base cations in the surface soil, which indicates that the compositing approach has succeeded in removing most of the artifactual noise. The Landsat composite image should be of great value for a multitude of applications in ecology, biodiversity research and conservation planning that require environmental data layers combining detailed spatial resolution, basin-wide coverage and high radiometric accuracy.

TI  - EARTH REMOTE SENSING DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY FOR OBTAINING VEGETATION TYPES MAPS
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an earth remote sensing data processing technology for obtaining vegetation types maps. The technology includes the following steps: obtaining superpixel representation of an image, calculating superpixel features, K-Means clustering of superpixels by a user-defined training sample, and obtaining vegetation types maps. When compared to other solutions, the major difference of the proposed technology is the ability to combine superpixel segmentation and feature calculation into a single process in one pass of an image that reduces the computational complexity. Another difference lies in the way of forming a sample dataset using superpixel representation of an image. The advantages of the proposed technology are the use of a smaller training dataset and a higher classification quality in comparison with the elemental classification.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 images were used for mapping debris-free glaciers for the first time in Cordillera Blanca. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were compared for glacier area estimation in 2016, obtaining comparable results. It was observed that normalized difference snow index method for glacier mapping using MSI data is less sensitive to cast shadows and steep terrain compared with Landsat data. Estimated total glacier areas in 1975, 1994, and 2016 were 726 +/- 20.3 km(2), 576.9 +/- 15.1 km(2) and 482.8 +/- 7.4 km(2), respectively. Glacier area in 2016 using Landsat was slightly lower (475.7 +/- 16.8 km(2)) compared to the area estimated using MSI data. Observed glacier shrinkage between 1975 and 2016 was 33.5 per cent, which is lower compared to observed glacier area loss in the eastern cordilleras of Peru. Glacier shrinkage was higher at northern and northeastern slopes (47.9 per cent and 48.1 per cent, respectively) compared to the south-western slopes (11.1 per cent).

AB  - Assessment of area under agroforestry in Tehri district of North Western Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India has been done using GIS and remote sensing technology. The study district characterized by hilly terrain with varying elevations from 288 m to more than 2800 m and generally gentle slopes, valleys, flat land covers and agricultural terraces. High-resolution satellite imageries (spatial resolution 5.8 m) were used in this study for land uses and land covers classification. According to unsupervised classification, highest area was found under forest class (65.22%) followed by cropland (20.41%). Considerable area was also found under snow cover (9.45%) in the district. Area under agroforestry was estimated to be 5572.26 ha (1.53%) by this method, whereas it was estimated to be 7029.06 ha (1.93%) by supervised classification. Estimated cropland area comes out to be about 20.0%. An accuracy of 86.5% was found in this classification for agroforestry class. Highest area under agroforestry of 3707.36 ha was obtained in 1200-2000 m elevations followed by 2231.26 ha in 288-1200 m elevations. Negligible area was found on high elevation zones of more than 2800 m. The major agroforestry systems of dominated by Grewia oppositifolia (Bhimal), Celtis australis (Kharik) and Quercus leucotrichophora (Banj) were identified and mapped and remaining systems were grouped as others class. Estimated area under G. oppositifolia, C. australis and Q. leucotrichophora based systems come out to be 2330.82, 1456.80 and 1129.10 ha, respectively. These systems are multiple usufructs are food, fuelwood, fodder, fiber and small timber. It has been observed from the accuracy assessment that the estimates of area under agroforestry obtained under this study are reliable.

TI  - Planetary Spectrum Generator: An accurate online radiative transfer suite for atmospheres, comets, small bodies and exoplanets
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed an online radiative-transfer suite (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov) applicable to a broad range of planetary objects (e.g., planets, moons, comets, asteroids, TNOs, KBOs, exoplanets). The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.

A common theme of that career has been complicatingor, as this comment puts it, mucking upexisting historical narratives. Finally, this comment suggests that Scranton's role as complicator sometimes gives too little guidance for how his thoughts connect to existing literature, and it puts forward some possible avenues for future exploration that spring from Scranton's examination of communist enterprise.

TI  - Sensitivity of Sentinel-1 Backscatter to Vegetation Dynamics: An Austrian Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring is of great importance for e.g., yield prediction and increasing water use efficiency. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission operated by the European Space Agency provides the opportunity to monitor Earth's surface using radar at high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1's Synthetic Aperture Radar provides co- and cross-polarized backscatter, enabling the calculation of microwave indices. In this study, we assess the potential of Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter and their ratio VH/VV, the cross ratio (CR), to monitor crop conditions. A quantitative assessment is provided based on in situ reference data of vegetation variables for different crops under varying meteorological conditions. Vegetation Water Content (VWC), biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI) and height are measured in situ for oilseed-rape, corn and winter cereals at different fields during two growing seasons. To quantify the sensitivity of backscatter and microwave indices to vegetation dynamics, linear and exponential models and machine learning methods have been applied to the Sentinel-1 data and in situ measurements. Using an exponential model, the CR can account for 87% and 63% of the variability in VWC for corn and winter cereals. In oilseed-rape, the coefficient of determination (R-2) is lower (R-2 = 0.34) due to the large difference in VWC between the two growing seasons and changes in vegetation structure that affect backscatter. Findings from the Random Forest analysis, which uses backscatter, microwave indices and soil moisture as input variables, show that CR is by and large the most important variable to estimate VWC. This study demonstrates, based on a quantitative analysis, the large potential of microwave indices for vegetation monitoring of VWC and phenology.

TI  - Empirical Study of the Application of Double-Consciousness Among African-American Men
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study serves to add to the existing literature on African-American men and masculinity, and to provide empirical evidence of the hypothesized mental conflict that exists among African-Americans, particularly as it relates to double-consciousness. Mental conflict was measured as a function of psychological distress, surfacing in high levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization, made evident through the measurement of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). It was hypothesized that African-American men engaged in the practice of double-consciousness made evident through the scores on the General Ethnicity Questionnaire (GEQ). More specifically, those who failed to integrate and only identified with one's Blackness and those who made drastic changes in one's reality by taking on characteristics of the Eurocentric worldview were expected to have higher levels of psychological distress. Results from this study found a practical use of the theory of double-consciousness and further provide implications for future research on the topic.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and Pleiades-1 in Mapping Mangrove Extent and Species
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping mangrove extent and species is important for understanding their response to environmental changes and for observing their integrity for providing goods and services. However, accurately mapping mangrove extent and species are ongoing challenges in remote sensing. The newly-launched and freely-available Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor offers a new opportunity for these challenges. This study presents the first study dedicated to the examination of the potential of original bands, spectral indices, and texture information of S2 in mapping mangrove extent and species in the first National Nature Reserve for mangroves in Dongzhaigang, China. To map mangrove extent and species, a three-level hierarchical structure based on the spatial structure of a mangrove ecosystem and geographic object-based image analysis is utilized and modified. During the experiments, to conquer the challenge of optimizing high-dimension and correlated feature space, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm is introduced. Finally, the selected features from RFE are employed in mangrove species discriminations, based on a random forest algorithm. The results are compared with those of Landsat 8 (L8) and Pleiades-1 (P1) data and show that S2 and L8 could accurately extract mangrove extent, but P1 obviously overestimated it. Regarding mangrove species community levels, the overall classification accuracy of S2 is 70.95%, which is lower than P1 imagery (78.57%) and slightly higher than L8 data (68.57%). Meanwhile, the former difference is statistically significant, and the latter is not. The dominant species is extracted basically in S2 and P1 imagery, but for the occasionally distributed K. candel and the pioneer and fringe mangrove A. marina, S2 performs poorly. Concerning L8, S2, and P1, there are eight (8/126), nine (9/218), and eight (8/73) features, respectively, that are the most important for mangrove species discriminations. The most important feature overall is the red-edge bands, followed by shortwave infrared, near infrared, blue, and other visible bands in turn. This study demonstrates that the S2 sensor can accurately map mangrove extent and basically discriminate mangrove species communities, but for the latter, one should be cautious due to the complexity of mangrove species.

TI  - Quantitative extraction of the bedrock exposure rate based on unmanned aerial vehicle data and Landsat-8 OLI image in a karst environment
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the karst regions of southwest China, rocky desertification is one of the most serious problems in land degradation. The bedrock exposure rate is an important index to assess the degree of rocky desertification in karst regions. Because of the inherent merits of macro-scale, frequency, efficiency, and synthesis, remote sensing is a promising method to monitor and assess karst rocky desertification on a large scale. However, actual measurement of the bedrock exposure rate is difficult and existing remote-sensing methods cannot directly be exploited to extract the bedrock exposure rate owing to the high complexity and heterogeneity of karst environments. Therefore, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for Xingren County, Guizhou Province, quantitative extraction of the bedrock exposure rate based on multi-scale remote-sensing data was developed. Firstly, we used an object-oriented method to carry out accurate classification of UAVimages. From the results of rock extraction, the bedrock exposure rate was calculated at the 30 m grid scale. Parts of the calculated samples were used as training data; other data were used for model validation. Secondly, in each grid the band reflectivity of Landsat-8 OLI data was extracted and a variety of rock and vegetation indexes (e.g., NDVI and SAVI) were calculated. Finally, a network model was established to extract the bedrock exposure rate. The correlation coefficient of the network model was 0.855, that of the validation model was 0.677 and the root mean square error of the validation model was 0.073. This method is valuable for wide-scale estimation of bedrock exposure rate in karst environments. Using the quantitative inversion model, a distribution map of the bedrock exposure rate in Xingren County was obtained.

TI  - Effects and Applications of Satellite Radiometer 2.25-μm Channel on Cloud Property Retrievals
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) channels, such as the 1.6- and 2.13-mu m channels of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), play an important role in inferring cloud properties because of their sensitivity to cloud amount and particle size. Instead of the 2.13-mu m channel, which has shown great success on MODIS, the central wavelength of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is shifted to 2.25 mu m. This paper investigates the influences of NIR channels (i.e., 2.13 and 2.25 mu m) on cloud optical and microphysical property retrievals and reveals the potential applications of the 2.25-mu m channel to cloud thermodynamic phase and multilayer cloud detections by combining with the 1.6-mu m channel. Rigorous radiative transfer simulations are performed to provide theoretical reflectance at the channels of interest, and MODIS and VIIRS observations are used for case studies. Our results indicate a minor influence of the 2.25-mu m channel on cloud optical depth and effective particle size retrievals. In combination with the 1.6-mu m channel, the 2.25-mu m channel provides additional information indicating cloud phases. However, the 1.6- and 2.13-mu m channels do not show any sensitivity to cloud phase. Furthermore, by considering the infrared-based cloud phase results, the 1.6- and 2.25-mu m channel combination becomes possible to infer multilayer clouds. Case studies based on simultaneous MODIS and VIIRS observations demonstrate the capability of the 1.6-2.25-mu m channel combination for determining cloud phase and multilayer clouds. Collocated satellite-based active lidar observations further validate these advantages of the 2.25-mu m channel over the original 2.13-mu m channel.

TI  - Developing an integrated indicator for monitoring maize growth condition using remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index and leaf area index
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and accurate assessment of maize growth is important for national food security. To improve the accuracy of maize growth monitoring in the central plain of Hebei Province, PR China, multiple growth-related factors, including water stress and vegetation coverage, should be comprehensively considered. This study derived the ten-day vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and leaf area index (LAI) from the first ten days of July to the third ten-day of September during 2010-2017 from MODIS data. Then, the grey relational analysis (GRA) method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used to determine the weight coefficients of the VTCI and LAI at four maize growth stages (the emergence-jointing, jointing-booting, booting-filling and filling-mature stages). Thus, an integrated maize growth monitoring index (G) was formulated for maize growth estimation at the main growth stage. Linear regression models between maize yields and G values for counties in five cities of the Hebei Plain from 2010 to 2015 were constructed to verify and analyze the precision of maize growth monitoring. The weight coefficients of the VTCI and LAI varied at the four growth stages. In Cangzhou City, the LAI weight coefficient at the jointing-booting stage was the highest, followed by the VTCI at the booting-filling stage, indicating that maize growth conditions and yields were highly correlated with vegetation coverage at the jointing-booting stage and that maize growth was most sensitive to water stress at the booting-filling stage. Linear regression models between G values and maize yields for the counties in the five cities all passed the significance test at the 0.01 level. Moreover, the correlation between G values and maize yields was closer than that between maize yields and VTCI or LAI alone and illustrated a high accuracy of the integrated maize monitoring results derived from the synthetic approach combining the two indices. According to the maize growth monitoring results, from 2010 to 2017, the best year regarding maize growth conditions was 2011, and the worst year was 2014. Growth in the northwestern plain was better than that in the other regions.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for endometrial cancer (EC) is a contemporary technique that could provide benefits over traditional lymphadenectomy. Comprehensive published literature on sentinel lymph node mapping for laparoscopy surgery in EC, data extraction, evidence-based medicine-based methods, and meta-analysis are carried out to further explore sentinel lymph node mapping in laparoscopy surgery in EC. The application value provides basis for prevention and treatment of EC.We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central for studies published before February 1, 2018 which had a sample size of at least ten patients, and reported the detection rate and/or sensitivity of the laparoscopy SLN biopsy. Statistical analysis was conducted using R-2.15.2 software.The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph node mapping was included in 389 patients of 8 studies, ranging from 25 to 71 patients, which was 96% (95% confidence interval 95-98). 366 patients were included in bilateral sentinel node detection rate, ranging from 30 to 71 patients; it was 73% (95% confidence interval, 69-77). The sensitivity of the overall detection rate of sentinel lymph node mapping was 96.3% with a sensitivity of 73.1% bilateral sentinel node detection rate.Laparoscopy sentinel lymph node localization is feasible and accurately predicts lymph node status in patients with EC. For patients with early stage clinical disease, it is very important to screen patients with no lymph node metastasis, reduce the range of surgical resection, reduce the incidence of the corresponding complications, and improve the quality of patients.

TI  - Consistent Calibration of VIRR Reflective Solar Channels Onboard FY-3A, FY-3B, and FY-3C Using a Multisite Calibration Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FengYun-3 (FY-3) Visible Infrared Radiometer (VIRR), along with its predecessor, the Multispectral Visible Infrared Scanning Radiometer (MVISR), onboard the FY-1C and FY-1D, has collected continuous daily global observations for 18 years. Achieving accurate and consistent calibration for VIRR reflective solar bands (RSBs) has been challenging, as there is no onboard calibrator and the frequency of in situ vicarious calibration is limited. In this study, a new set of reflectance calibration coefficients were derived for RSBs of the FY-3A, FY-3B, and FY-3C VIRRs using a multisite (MST) calibration method. This method is an extension of a previous MST calibration method, which relies on radiative transfer modeling over the multiple stable earth sites, and no synchronous in situ measurements are needed; hence, it can be used to update the VIRR calibration on a daily basis. The on-orbit radiometric changes of the VIRR onboard the FY-3 series were assessed based on analyses of new sets of calibration slopes. Then, all recalibrated VIRR reflectance data over Libya 4, the most frequently used stable Earth site, were compared with those provided from the Level 1B (L1B) product. Additional validation was performed by comparing the recalibrated VIRR data with those derived from radiative transfer simulations using measurements from automatic calibration instruments in Dunhuang. The results indicate that the radiometric response changes of the VIRRs onboard FY-3A and FY-3B were larger than those of FY-3C VIRR and were wavelength dependent. The current approach can provide consistent VIRR reflectances across different FY-3 satellite platforms. After recalibration, differences in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data across different VIRRs during the whole lifetime decreased from 5-10% to less than 3%. The comparison with the automatic calibration method indicates that MST calibration shows good accuracy and lower temporal oscillations.

TI  - Spatial-temporal evolution of vegetation evapotranspiration in Hebei Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of soil or water body evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth surface and ocean to the atmosphere, and thus plays a significant role in regulating carbon and water resource cycles. The time-series data set from the remote sensing MOIDS product (MOD16) was used to study the spatial-temporal evolution of vegetation evapotranspiration in salinized areas during 2000-2014 by analyzing the variability, spatial patterns and Mann-Kendall (MK) nonparametric trends for the time series. The results indicate that inter-annual and intra-annual variations of ET across various vegetated areas show seasonal changes, with the abnormal months identified. The cultivated land displays a greater degree of spatial heterogeneity and the spatial pattern of ET in the area covered by broadleaved deciduous forests corresponds to a higher ET rate and increased water consumption. Awidespread decline of ET is observed only in cultivated areas. However, agricultural cultivation doesn't worsen water shortage and soil salinization problems in the region, and water shortage problems are worsening for other vegetated areas. This research provides a basis of reference for the reasonable allocation of water resources and restructuring of vegetation patterns in salinized areas.

Therefore, it is important to detect the locations of ships accurately and rapidly. At present, ship detection is mainly carried out by combining satellite remote sensing imaging with constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. However, with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, remote sensing data have gradually begun to show the characteristics of "big data"; additionally, the accuracy and speed of ship detection can be improved by analysing big data, such as by deep learning. Thus, a ship detection algorithm that combines CFAR and CNN is proposed based on the CFAR global detection algorithm and image recognition with the CNN model. Compared with the multi-level CFAR algorithm that is based on multithreading, the algorithm in this paper is more suitable for application to ship detection systems.

TI  - Testing the Efficiency of Using High-Resolution Data From GF-1 in Land Cover Classifications
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing plays an important role in the study of subtle changes on the Earth's surface. The newly orbiting Chinese GF-1 satellites are designed to observe the Earth surface on a regional scale; however, the satellite efficiency requires further investigation. In this paper, the efficiency of using GF-1 01 satellite images to monitor a complex surface is tested by considering supplementary information and different land cover classification methods. Our work revealed that the GF-1 satellite observations can efficiently detect land cover fragments. When the support vector machine method is applied, the overall classification accuracy based on multisource data reaches 90.5%. The "salt and pepper phenomenon" is effectively reduced in classification images. These results also indicate that the accuracy of the GF-1 image classification is superior to the results when using the same method with the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A images, with the overall classification accuracy increasing by 23.6% and 13.6%. Our study suggests that GF-1 satellite observations are suitable for land cover studies on complex land surfaces. This approach can benefit various related fields such as land resource surveys, ecological assessments, environmental evaluations, and so forth.

TI  - Monitoring temporal-spatial variations of AOD over the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol can induce visibility reduction, affect radiation balance and modify cloud property on the environmental effect, and show the harmful effects on human health. Insight of aerosol becomes an integral task in the process of control measures for environmental pollution. The present study provided an analysis of temporal-spatial variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the MODO4 level-2 in collection 6 (C6) with the deep blue retrieval algorithm from January 2005 to December 2015 over Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China. The AOD validations between MODIS and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) were estimated by the methods of regression, correlation. Then, the periodic features and trends of AOD and angstrom exponent (AE) were explored with the wavelet transformation (WT) procedure. Further, the variations of AOD and AE spatial distribution on multi-time scales (annual, monthly and season) were demonstrated. Meantime, the sources of AOD are discussed. It was found that the daily AOD from MODIS has a strong correlation relationship (slope = 0.9838, r = 0.84) with AERONET over YRD. The variations of both AOD and AE on time series have been distinct temporal periodic (12, 6 and 4 months) characteristics, and show the decreasing trends on annual and semi-annual periods. On annual, the AOD on spatial distribution is slowly declining from the northwest towards the southeast, and the AE on spatial distribution is gradually decreasing from the northwest to the southeast and from the land to the coast. The variations both inter-annual AOD and AE on spatial distribution show the inverse trends, respectively. On monthly, the means of AOD range from minimum 0.46 in January to maximum 0.90 in July, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the north parts of Yangtze River and some scattered areas with high terrain and south coast. The means of AE range from minimum 1.13 in October to maximum 1.58 in April, and the variations of spatial distribution are mainly found in the south of Henan, the north of Jiangsu, the coast belt and the riverside of Yangtze River and the high terrain regions. On seasonality, the means of AOD reaches its maximum 0.68 in summer and minimum 0.50 in winter, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the coast belt, the north parts of Hongze Lake and the south parts with high terrain. The means of AE reaches its maximum 1.48 in spring and minimum 1.25 in autumn, and the variations of spatial distribution were shown the similarity with that of monthly.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Characteristics of Tropospheric Ozone and Its Precursors in Guangxi, South China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial distributions of tropospheric ozone and its precursors (NO2, CO, HCHO) are analyzed over Guangxi (GX) in South China. We used tropospheric column ozone (TCO) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard the Aura satellite (OMI/MLS), NO2 and HCHO from OMI and CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument in the period 2005-2016. The TCO shows strong seasonality, with the highest value in spring and the lowest value observed in the monsoon season. The seasonal variation of HCHO is similar to that of TCO, while NO2 and CO show slightly different patterns with higher values in spring and winter compared to lower values in autumn and summer. The surface ozone, NO2 and CO observed by national air quality monitoring network sites are also compared with satellite-observed TCO, NO2 and CO, showing good agreement for NO2 and CO but a different seasonal pattern for ozone. Unlike TCO, surface ozone has the highest value in autumn and the lowest value in winter. To reveal the difference, the vertical profiles of ozone and CO from the measurement of ozone and water vapor by airbus in-service aircraft (MOZAIC) observations over South China are also examined. The seasonal averaged vertical profiles of ozone and CO show obvious enhancements at 2-6 km altitudes in spring. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of TCO and surface ozone on meteorology and transport in detail along with the ECMWF reanalysis data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3BV42 dataset, OMI ultraviolet index (UV index) dataset, MODIS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and back trajectory. Our results show that the wind pattern at 800 hPa plays a significant role in determining the seasonality of TCO over GX, especially for the highest value in spring. Trajectory analysis, combined with MODIS FRP suggests that the air masses that passed through the biomass burning (BB) region of Southeast Asia (SEA) induced the enhancement of TCO and CO in the upper-middle troposphere in spring. However, the seasonal cycle of surface ozone is associated with wind patterns at 950 hPa, and the contribution of the photochemical effect is offset by the strong summer monsoon, which results in the maximum surface ozone concentration in post-monsoon September. The variations in the meteorological conditions at different levels and the influence of transport from SEA can account for the vertical distribution of ozone and CO. We conclude that the seasonal distribution of TCO results from the combined impact of meteorology and long-term transport.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Optical/Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays significant roles in various scientific fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and ecology. However, the spatial resolutions of microwave SSM products are too coarse for regional applications. Most current optical/thermal infrared SSM retrieval models cannot directly estimate the quantitative volumetric soil water content without establishing empirical relationships between ground-based SSM measurements and satellite-derived proxies of SSM. Therefore, in this paper, SSM is estimated directly from 5-km-resolution Chinese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite FY-2E data based on an elliptical-new SSM retrieval model developed from the synergistic use of diurnal cycles of land surface temperature (LST) and net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR). The elliptical-original model was constructed for bare soil and did not consider the impacts of different fractional vegetation cover (FVC) conditions. To optimize the elliptical-original model for regional-scale SSM estimates, it is improved in this paper by considering the influence of FVC, which is based on a dimidiate pixel model and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index product. A preliminary validation of the model is conducted based on ground measurements from the counties of Maqu, Luqu, and Ruoergai in the source area of the Yellow River. A correlation coefficient (R) of 0.620, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.146 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of 0.038 m(3)/m(3) were obtained when comparing the in situ measurements with the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-original model. In contrast, the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-new model exhibited greater consistency with the ground measurements, as evidenced by an R of 0.845, an RMSE of 0.064 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of 0.017 m(3)/m(3). To provide accurate SSM estimates, high-accuracy FVC, LST, and NSSR data are required. To complement the point-scale validation conducted here, cross-comparisons with other existing SSM products will be conducted in the future studies.

TI  - A Bayesian Downscaler Model to Estimate Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> Levels in the Conterminous US
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing interest in extending the coverage of ground particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m (PM2.5) monitoring networks based on satellite remote sensing data. With broad spatial and temporal coverage, a satellite-based monitoring network has a strong potential to complement the ground monitor system in terms of the spatiotemporal availability of the air quality data. However, most existing calibration models focus on a relatively small spatial domain and cannot be generalized to a national study. In this paper, we proposed a statistically reliable and interpretable national modeling framework based on Bayesian downscaling methods to be applied to the calibration of the daily ground PM2.5 concentrations across the conterminous United States using satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and other ancillary predictors in 2011. Our approach flexibly models the PM2.5 versus AOD and the potential related geographical factors varying across the climate regions and yields spatial- and temporal-specific parameters to enhance model interpretability. Moreover, our model accurately predicted the national PM2.5 with an R-2 at 70% and generated reliable annual and seasonal PM2.5 concentration maps with its SD. Overall, this modeling framework can be applied to national-scale PM2.5 exposure assessments and can also quantify the prediction errors.

TI  - Ship Classification in High-Resolution SAR Images Using Deep Learning of Small Datasets
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the capability to automatically learn discriminative features, deep learning has experienced great success in natural images but has rarely been explored for ship classification in high-resolution SAR images due to the training bottleneck caused by the small datasets. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to ship classification by using SAR images with the small datasets. First, ship chips are constructed from high-resolution SAR images and split into training and validation datasets. Second, a ship classification model is constructed based on very deep convolutional networks (VGG). Then, VGG is pretrained via ImageNet, and fine tuning is utilized to train our model. Six scenes of COSMO-SkyMed images are used to evaluate our proposed model with regard to the classification accuracy. The experimental results reveal that (1) our proposed ship classification model trained by fine tuning achieves more than 95% average classification accuracy, even with 5-cross validation; (2) compared with other models, the ship classification model based on VGG16 achieves at least 2% higher accuracies for classification. These experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - Forest Variable Estimation Using a High Altitude Single Photon Lidar System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the digitalization of the forest planning process, 3D remote sensing data is an important data source. However, the demand for more detailed information with high temporal resolution and yet still being cost efficient is a challenging combination for the systems used today. A new lidar technology based on single photon counting has the possibility to meet these needs. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the new single photon lidar sensor Leica SPL100 for area-based forest variable estimations. In this study, it was found that data from the new system, operated from 3800 m above ground level, could be used for raster cell estimates with similar or slightly better accuracy than a linear system, with similar point density, operated from 400 m above ground level. The new single photon counting lidar sensor shows great potential to meet the need for efficient collection of detailed information, due to high altitude, flight speed and pulse repetition rate. Further research is needed to improve the method for extraction of information and to investigate the limitations and drawbacks with the technology. The authors emphasize solar noise filtering in forest environments and the effect of different atmospheric conditions, as interesting subjects for further research.

TI  - Influence of canopy shading and snow coverage on effective albedo in a snow-dominated evergreen needleleaf forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of a forest canopy above highly reflective snow results in overall lower surface albedo, even when snow is intercepted by the forest canopy. The effective forest snow albedo (FSA) explains the overall upwelling radiation from the forest relative to the incoming radiation. FSA is strongly influenced by the complex pathways of radiation as it travels through the 3D canopy structure. Current errors in calculations of FSA arise due to uncertainties in how models should treat masking of snow by vegetation. Improvement of distributed models is currently limited by a lack of measurements that demonstrate both spatial and temporal variability over forests. We present above-canopy measurements of winter-time effective forest snow albedo using up- and down-looking radiometers mounted on an octocopter UAV for a total of fifteen flights on eight different days. Ground-view fractions across the flight path were between 0.12 and 0.81. Correlations between FSA and both ground-view fraction and maximum canopy height were statistically significant during 14 out of 15 flights, but correlation strength varied between flights as a function of solar angle and snow cover. Measured effective albedo across the flight path differed by up to 0.33 during snow-on canopy conditions. A subsequent comparison between maximum interception and no interception showed effective albedo differed by up 0.27. A similar variation (0.26) in effective FSA was measured during low (44) and high (67) solar zenith angles. This study therefore demonstrates that temporal and spatial variations in effective albedo caused by canopy shading of the snow surface are therefore as important as temporal variations caused by interception of snow by the canopy. Calculation of effective albedo of forested areas requires careful consideration of canopy height, canopy coverage, solar angle and interception coverage. The results of this study should be used to inform snow albedo and canopy structure parametrizations in local and larger scale land surface models.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and it's impacts on diurnal temperature range over the agricultural pastoral ecotone of Northern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural pastoral ecotone of Northern China (APENC), as a fragile ecological zone, has experienced dramatic land use/land cover changes (LULCC) owing to intensive human disturbances. The understanding of the impacts of LULCC on climate, especially the diurnal temperature range (DTR), is not sufficient in this region. The spatio-temporal processes of LULCC and its impacts on DTR were quantitatively analyzed, using the Terra/Aqua MODIS data (MYD11A2 and MCD12Q1, 2003-2013), on the premise of eliminating or weakening the effects of background climate. Results showed that the areas of croplands, forests, and waterbody increased with the annual rate of 2.84%, 0.95%, and 8.2%, respectively, whereas grasslands and bare land decreased with the annual rate of 0.69% and 7.32%, and built-up remained quite stable during the period of 2003-2013. The annual changing rate of LULC for 2008-2013 was nearly 2.84 times the value for 2003-2008. In general, LULC contributed to a decline of DTR over the whole APENC both at monthly/seasonal timescale. Croplands, forests, and mutual transformation between croplands and grasslands tended to decrease daytime maximum temperature (T-max), resulting in a decline of DTR. The grasslands could reduce the DTR by decreasing T-max and increasing nighttime minimum temperature (T-min). By contrast, the conversion of grasslands into forests tended to increase T-max and decrease T-min, thus a rise of DTR for winter, summer, and autumn had observed. These results can assist land resource development and relevant policies making in APENC.

T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an extensive feasibility study of the use of optical satellite data for flood risk monitoring. The article presents a review of existing and archival satellite systems. The capabilities and restrictions of using earth observation data are presented, in relation to the identified threat and taking into account the size, genesis and cause. The initial results of the studies demonstrate the potential of very high and high-resolution satellite imagery for the operational detection of damage and risk areas. In the presented approach, two analyses were conducted: bare soil detection and water range detection, based on different radiometric indices. As a result of the conducted research, the best results in bare soil detection were obtained using the MSAVI and NDVI indices. The most effective at delimiting water was the NDVI index. The automatization of satellite data processing from different satellite systems gives opportunities for hydrological services and crisis management professionals to access accurate and up-to-date information about the condition of levees for the early detection of flood risk.

TI  - Tuart (<i>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</i>) decline is not associated with other vegetation structure and composition changes
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree decline affects forests and woodlands on most continents. The loss of canopy species from these landscapes has marked impacts on the surrounding environment. Understanding the consequences of tree mortality on vegetation structure and composition will contribute to developing management strategies for these ecosystems. The tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala), once the dominant tree species on the coastal plain in southwest Western Australia, has been cleared extensively and today occurs over less than a third of its former range. Compounding the effects of this clearing, dramatic declines in tree health over the past two decades has been recorded. We examined whether E. gomphocephala decline is reflected in changes to overall vegetation structure and composition. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data, we identified 12 sites with stable or improving vegetation vigour over the previous 15years (healthy' sites) and 12 sites with declining vegetation vigour over this time (declining' sites). Health of E. gomphocephala trees, as well as litter, vegetation structure and vegetation composition were compared across these sites. Four health measures indicated that E. gomphocephala trees from healthy and declining sites were statistically distinguishable (p<0.001). Trees at declining sites showed marked epicormic growth (up to 96% of canopy), evidence of crown dieback, reduced crown density and increased foliage transparency. The canopy changes were reflected in marked reduction in leaf litter for declining sites (p=0.024). Despite the changes in E. gomphocephala canopy and leaf litter, however, there were no significant differences in vegetation community composition, relative vegetation cover for five height strata, vegetation structural and compositional diversity, presence of coarse woody debris, or overall canopy cover. There were also no differences in soil chemistry between the healthy and declining sites. The agent of tuart decline therefore appears to be specific to Eucalyptus gomphocephala at these sites, or alternatively the changes to other plant species have been too subtle to detect at this stage.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Machine Learning Algorithms for Scalable Classification of Tree Types and Tree Species Based on Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use freely available Sentinel-2 data and forest inventory data to evaluate the potential of different machine-learning approaches to classify tree species in two forest regions in Bavaria, Germany. Atmospheric correction was applied to the level 1C data, resulting in true surface reflectance or bottom of atmosphere (BOA) output. We developed a semiautomatic workflow for the classification of deciduous (mainly spruce trees), beech and oak trees by evaluating different classification algorithms (object- and pixel-based) in an architecture optimized for distributed processing. A hierarchical approach was used to evaluate different band combinations and algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for the separation of broad-leaved vs. coniferous trees. The Ebersberger forest was the main project region and the Freisinger forest was used in a transferability study. Accuracy assessment and training of the algorithms was based on inventory data, validation was conducted using an independent dataset. A confusion matrix, with User's and Producer's Accuracies, as well as Overall Accuracies, was created for all analyses. In total, we tested 16 different classification setups for coniferous vs. broad-leaved trees, achieving the best performance of 97% for an object-based multitemporal SVM approach using only band 8 from three scenes (May, August and September). For the separation of beech and oak trees we evaluated 54 different setups, the best result achieved an accuracy of 91% for an object-based, SVM, multitemporal approach using bands 8, 2 and 3 of the May scene for segmentation and all principal components of the August scene for classification. The transferability of the model was tested for the Freisinger forest and showed similar results. This project points out that Sentinel-2 had only marginally worse results than comparable commercial high-resolution satellite sensors and is well-suited for forest analysis on a tree-stand level.

TI  - Staging breast cancer by sentinel lymph node biopsy: Do patients with a single negative sentinel node (N=1) experience worse outcomes than those with multiple negative sentinel nodes (N&gt;1)?
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Though sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard of care for early breast cancer, concern remains for false negative nodes and potential implications for understaging and undertreatment, particularly when only one sentinel node is retrieved. We examined whether patients with a single negative SLN (N =1) experience worse survival than those with two or more negative SLNs (N > 1)Methods: This retrospective review examined 730 SLN-negative patients. Clinicopathologic and demographic data, recurrence-free and overall survival were assessed. Statistical analysis included Chi square tests, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests, and multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model.Results: There were no statistically significant differences in recurrence-free or overall survival between patients in the N =1 versus the N > 1 group (log rank test, p = 0.75 and p = 0.52, respectively). There were also no differences in local and distant recurrence (1.9% versus 2.1%, p = 0.89 and 2.4% versus 2.3%, p = 0.78) or breast cancer death (2.4% versus 2.7%, p = 0.85). Increased tumor size was associated with finding greater than one negative sentinel node intraoperatively (p = 0.01).Conclusions: A single negative sentinel node did not portend worse recurrence-free or overall survival. After thorough axillary exploration during SLNB, retrieval of a single negative SLN did not result in worse clinical outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Correlation of Isotope Count With Sentinel Node Positivity in Vulvar Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has become standard of care in early stage vulvar cancer. As the correlation of isotope count with the presence of metastases remains unclear, often several active nodes are excised per groin. This can result in increased morbidity in node-negative disease despite of SNB. In the current analysis, we assess whether resection of the hottest node could be sufficient to detect sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis.Methods: Patients with primary vulvar cancer receiving an SNB with radioactive tracer at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between 2008 and 2015 were evaluated.Results: A total of 145 patients with SNB were analyzed; thereof, 144 underwent bilateral SNB, resulting in 289 analyzed groins. A median of 2 SLNs (range, 1-7) per groin were removed. From 94 (32.5%) of 289 groins, more than 2 SLNs were excised. Median overall SLN isotope count was 1400 cps. In 50 groins, a positive SLN was detected (unilateral in 38 patients, bilateral in 6). The median number of positive SLN per groin was 1 (range, 1-4). The SLN with the highest isotope count carried metastases in 36 (78.3%) of 46 groins (in 4 cases, the highest count was unknown). In 10 (21.7%) of 46 positive groins, the SLN with the highest count was not the metastatic SLN (9/10 second highest count). Median count of these 10 SLN was 60% of the highest count with a range from 11.0% to 74.0%.Conclusions: The highest isotope count does not reliably detect the positive SLN in vulvar cancer. To prevent mostly fatal groin recurrences, surgeons should continue to remove all SLN accumulating relevant radioactive tracer over background activity.

TI  - Understanding the biosecurity monitoring and reporting intentions of livestock producers: Identifying opportunities for behaviour change
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries, government strategies for biosecurity planning and outbreaks depend upon private livestock producers being willing and able to conduct surveillance of their animals and the timely reporting of suspicious signs of disease. From a behavioural perspective, these two kinds of behaviours - surveillance and reporting should be treated separately when developing a biosecurity plan in which producers play a key role in the prevention, detection, and reporting of animal diseases. Having an effective surveillance system in place is conceptually and practically independent of a reporting system that is both feasible and trustworthy. The behavioural intentions of 200 Australian producers to monitor their livestock and report to either the government or a private vet were measured in a structured telephone interview. Structural equation modelling revealed that these intentions had different statistical relationships with a common set of predictor variables. Moreover, classification of the producers based on belief about monitoring and surveillance resulted in three contrasting groups. These results are discussed in terms of their meaning for the development of behavioural strategies to promote surveillance and monitoring of animal disease.

TI  - Mapping Individual Tree Species and Vitality along Urban Road Corridors with LiDAR and Imaging Sensors: Point Density versus View Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet a growing demand for accurate high-fidelity vegetation cover mapping in urban areas toward biodiversity conservation and assessing the impact of climate change, this paper proposes a complete approach to species and vitality classification at single tree level by synergistic use of multimodality 3D remote sensing data. So far, airborne laser scanning system (ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.

T2  - PSYCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the relationships that ecological worldview, environmental sensitivity, and personal norms have with pro-environmental behaviors in a particular child population in urban China. The survey questionnaires were distributed to 410 Grade 6 students from eight Green Schools in Shenzhen, China. The sample included 223 (54.3%) boys and 187 (45.6%) girls with ages ranging from 10 to 13 years. The results from structural equation modelling reveal that environmental sensitivity and personal norms were two critical factors in determining students' pro-environmental behaviors. The influence of ecological worldview was fully mediated by personal norms, whereas the effect of environmental sensitivity was partially mediated by both personal norms and ecological worldview.

TI  - Post-mastectomy Radiation Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients with Nodal Micrometastases
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Recent data support the use of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in women with one to three positive lymph nodes; however, the benefit of PMRT in patients with micrometastatic nodal disease (Nlmi) is unknown. We evaluated the survival impact of PMRT in patients with Nlmi within the National Cancer Database.Methods. The pattern of care and survival benefit of PMRT was examined in women with pT1-2Nlmi breast cancer who underwent mastectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were employed for survival analysis, and subanalyses of high-risk patients and a propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort were completed.Results. From 2004 to 2014, we identified 14,019 patients who fitted the study criteria. PMRT was delivered in 18.5% of patients and its use increased over the study period. Patients treated with PMRT were younger, had better performance status and larger primaries, were estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, had higher grade, lymphovascular invasion and positive surgical margins, and more often received systemic therapy. PMRT was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in univariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 [0.64-0.89]), but was not significant in multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 1.01 [0.84-1.20]). There was no survival benefit to PMRT in ER-negative, high-grade, and/or young patients. There were 2 (0.9%) death events in the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) + PMRT group versus 21 (2.9%) in the SLNB-alone group (log-rank p = 0.053), and 8 (3.9%) death events in the axillary lymph node biopsy (ALNB) + PMRT group versus 27 (3.6%) in the axillary lymph node dissection-alone group (p = 0.82). There was no significant association between PMRT and OS within the PSM subgroup.Conclusion. In this largest reported retrospective study, no OS differences were associated with PMRT, which suggests that PMRT may not benefit every patient with microscopic nodal disease.

TI  - Response of the Downstream Braided Channel to Zhikong Reservoir on Lhasa River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lhasa River basin is situated in the southern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is the most important region of economic and social development in Tibet. In order to efficiently utilize water resources in the basin and ease the shortage of regional electric power supply, Zhikong Reservoir was built in the upstream reach of the Lhasa River in 2006. Impoundment of this reservoir evidently affected the morphology and stability of the downstream braided channel below the dam. Yet, little is known about the complex responses of the downstream braided channel to the Zhikong Dam. Landsat images in the 2000-2016 period, together with daily discharges and field observations in the 2017-2018 period, were used to investigate the morphological response of the braided channel to the Zhikong Dam. The downstream Lhasa River below the Zhikong Dam was divided into four reaches (i.e., RS1, RS2, RS3 and RS4) based on the confluence of three downstream tributaries. Results showed that the number and area of central bars in the braided reach closest to Zhikong Dam (RS1) were increased because of main channel incision and water level drop. This increasing trend attenuated along the downstream channel of this reach. Braiding number index of multithread channels in RS1 obviously increased by 3 in one section and reduced by 2 in two sections, while changed in all sections randomly with no pronounced trend along the RS2 to RS3 and RS4 reaches. The average bar area in two focus reaches, RS1_B1 and RS2_B2, 6.0 km and 36.8 km far away to the Zhikong Dam, respectively, followed opposite trends with the former increasing and the later reducing. Furthermore, the mean dissection, landscape dissection and fragmentation shape indices in RS1, showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2016, indicating the shape of irregular central bars varied greatly because clean water release of Zhikong Dam eroded the downstream braided channel.

TI  - Pinpointing areas of increased soil erosion risk following land cover change in the Lake Manyara catchment, Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of long-term scientific land cover and erosional data impedes the development of sustainable land management plans to tackle land degradation and soil erosion problems in Tanzania. Using Landsat imagery, almost three decades of land cover change in the Lake Manyara catchment (1988-2016) was reconstructed. Data highlight that the major land cover types are highly dynamic and that there is a net conversion of natural or semi-natural land cover towards agricultural uses. Specifically, the biggest net declining cover types were found to be 'bushland', 'seasonal grassland' and 'permanent savanna', which have reduced by 8.7, 6.1 and 3.5% respectively. In this context an erosion risk model, based on the 'Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation', was applied to evaluate how changing land cover has affected risk of surface soil erosion by water. Model outputs indicate that a lot of land conversion has occurred in areas that are naturally vulnerable due to topography, soil type and rainfall patterns, seriously increasing the soil erosion risk. The resulting output maps can be particularly useful in pinpointing potential areas of increased erosion risk underpinning targeted investigation and management action to support soil conservation for improved food and water security.

TI  - Genomic integrity in the male germ line: evidence in support of the disposable soma hypothesis
T2  - REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Big Blue lambda Select-cII selection system has been employed along with whole-exome sequencing to examine the susceptibility of the male germ line to mutation in two challenging situations (i) exposure to a chemotherapeutic regime including bleomycin, etoposide and cis-platinum (BEP) and (ii) the ageing process. A 3-week exposure to BEP induced complete azoospermia associated with a loss of developing germ cells and extensive vacuolization of Sertoli cell cytoplasm. Following cessation of treatment, spermatozoa first appeared in the caput epididymis after 6 weeks and by 12 weeks motile spermatozoa could be recovered from the cauda, although the count (P< 0.001) and motility (P < 0.01) of these cells were significantly reduced and superoxide generation was significantly elevated (P< 0.001). Despite this increase in free radical generation, no evidence of chromatin instability was detected in these spermatozoa. Furthermore, embryos obtained from females mated at this 12-week time point showed no evidence of an increased mutational load. Similarly, progressive ageing of Big Blue mice had no impact on the quality of the spermatozoa, fertility or mutation frequency in the offspring despite a significant increase in the mutational load carried by somatic tissues such as the liver (P< 0.05). We conclude that the male germ line is highly resistant to mutation in keeping with the disposable soma hypothesis, which posits that genetic integrity in the germ cells will be maintained at the expense of the soma, in light of the former's sentinel position in safeguarding the stability of the genome.

TI  - "Regression-then-Fusion" or "Fusion-then-Regression"? A Theoretical Analysis for Generating High Spatiotemporal Resolution Land Surface Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions in satellite sensors has inspired the development of numerous thermal sharpening methods. Specifically, regression and spatiotemporal fusion are the two main strategies used to generate high-resolution land surface temperatures (LSTs). The regression method statically downscales coarse-resolution LSTs, whereas the spatiotemporal fusion method can dynamically downscale LSTs; however, the resolution of downscaled LSTs is limited by the availability of the fine-resolution LSTs. Few studies have combined these two methods to generate high spatiotemporal resolution LSTs. This study proposes two strategies for combining regression and fusion methods to generate high spatiotemporal resolution LSTs, namely, the "regression-then-fusion" (R-F) and "fusion-then-regression" (F-R) methods, and discusses the criteria used to determine which strategy is better. The R-F and F-R have several advantages: (1) they fully exploit the information in the available data on the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands; (2) they downscale the LST time series to a finer resolution corresponding to that of VNIR data; and (3) they inherit high spatial reconstructions from the regression method and dynamic temporal reconveyance from the fusion method. The R-F and F-R were tested with different start times and target times using Landsat 8 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data. The results showed that the R-F performed better than the F-R when the regression error at the start time was smaller than that at the target time, and vice versa.

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Forests Based on Multi-Tidal High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, which are essential for stabilizing coastal ecosystems, have been suffering from a dramatic decline over the past several decades. Mapping mangrove forests using satellite imagery is an efficient way to provide key data for mangrove forest conservation. Since mangrove forests are periodically submerged by tides, current methods of mapping mangrove forests, which are normally based on single-date, remote-sensing imagery, often underestimate the spatial distribution of mangrove forests, especially when the images used were recorded during high-tide periods. In this paper, we propose a new method of mapping mangrove forests based on multi-tide, high-resolution satellite imagery. In the proposed method, a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI), which is based on the differential spectral signature of mangroves under high and low tides from multi-tide, high-resolution satellite imagery, is designed to identify submerged mangrove forests. The proposed method applies the SMRI values, together with textural features extracted from high-resolution imagery and geographical features of mangrove forests, to an object-based support vector machine (SVM) to map mangrove forests. The proposed method was evaluated via a case study with GF-1 images (high-resolution satellites launched by China) in Yulin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The results show that our proposed method achieves satisfactory performance, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 94%, which is better than results obtained from object-based SVMs that use only single-date, remote sensing imagery.

TI  - A new approach to study terrestrial yardang geomorphology based on high-resolution data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): A showcase of whaleback yardangs in Qaidam Basin, NW China
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yardangs are wind-eroded ridges usually observed in arid regions on Earth and other planets. Previous geomorphology studies of terrestrial yardang fields depended on satellite data and limited fieldwork. The geometry measurements of those yardangs based on satellite data are limited to the length, the width, and the spacing between the yardangs; elevations could not be studied due to the relatively low resolution of the satellite acquired elevation data, e.g. digital elevation models (DEMs). However, the elevation information (e.g. heights of the yardang surfaces) and related information (e.g. slope) of the yardangs are critical to understanding the characteristics and evolution of these aeolian features. Here we report a novel approach, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to generate centimeter-resolution orthomosaics and DEMs for the study of whaleback yardangs in Qaidam Basin, NW China. The ultra-high-resolution data provide new insights into the geomorphology characteristics and evolution of the whaleback yardangs in Qaidam Basin. These centimeter-resolution datasets also have important potential in: (1) high accuracy estimation of erosion volume; (2) modeling in very fine scale of wind dynamics related to yardang formation; (3) detailed comparative planetary geomorphology study for Mars, Venus, and Titan.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Long Time Series for Global Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical input parameter in many climate and ecological models. Long time series of global FAPAR products are required for many applications, such as vegetation productivity, carbon budget calculations, and global change studies. Three long time series of global FAPAR products have been existing since the 1980s: Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) AVHRR, and third-generation Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS3g). Currently, no intercomparison studies exist that have evaluated these FAPAR products to understand their differences for effective applications. In this paper, these three long time series of global FAPAR products are first intercompared to evaluate their spatial and temporal consistencies, and then compared with FAPAR values derived from high-resolution reference maps of VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments sites. Our results demonstrate that the GLASS AVHRR FAPAR product is spatially complete, whereas the NCEI AVHRR and GIMMS3g FAPAR products contain many missing pixels, especially in rainforest regions and in middle-and high-latitude zones of the Northern Hemisphere. The GLASS AVHRR, NCEI AVHRR, and GIMMS3g FAPAR products are generally consistent in their spatial patterns. However, a relatively large discrepancy among these FAPAR products is observed in tropical forest regions and around 55 degrees N-65 degrees N. In latitudes between 15 degrees N and 25 degrees N, the mean GIMMS3g FAPAR values are clearly larger than the mean GLASS AVHRR and NCEI AVHRR FAPAR values during July-October each year. The GLASS AVHRR FAPAR product provides smooth FAPAR temporal profiles, whereas the NCEI AVHRR and GIMMS3g FAPAR products showed fluctuating trajectories, especially during the growing seasons. All three FAPAR products show high agreement coefficients (ACs) in vegetation regions with obvious seasonal variations and low ACs in tropical forest regions and sparsely vegetated areas. A comparison of these FAPAR products with the FAPAR values derived from high-resolution reference maps demonstrates that the GLASS AVHRR FAPAR product has the best performance [root mean square deviation (RMSD) = 0.0819 and bias = 0.0043], followed by the NCEI AVHRR FAPAR product (RMSD = 0.1061 and bias = 0.0371), and then finally, the GIMMS3g FAPAR product (RMSD = 0.1152 and bias = 0.0248).

TI  - In-orbit geometric calibration and experimental verification of the ZY3-02 laser altimeter
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - ZY3-02 is the first Chinese earth-observation satellite equipped with a laser altimeter, designed to assist stereo-image mapping elevations. Launch vibrations, the space environment and other factors, both expected and unexpected, cause bias in the designed ranging and pointing of the laser altimeter, influencing its height measurement accuracy. This paper proposes an in-orbit geometric calibration model which considers this bias as unknown systematic errors. The unknown parameters were calibrated by the minimum ranging error principle using laser spot geolocation data captured by a ground-based laser detector array. Based on precise orbit and attitude data, the precise geolocation information of the laser footprints could be obtained. Validation experiments show that the elevation precision of the laser altimeter can reach 1m.Resume ZY3-02 est le premier satellite chinois d'observation de la Terre a etre equipe d'un altimetre laser, concu pour assister les methodes de cartographie altimetrique basees sur l'imagerie stereoscopique.

TI  - A Multifeature Autosegmentation-Based Approach for Inshore Ambiguity Identification and Suppression With Azimuth Multichannel SAR Systems
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the problems of location and suppression of inshore azimuth ambiguous clutter for the azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, a multifeature autosegmentation-based approach is developed in this paper. This proposed method can segment a SAR image automatically according to the distinctions among main land clutter, ambiguous land clutter, and sea clutter in the features of interferogram's phase and magnitude. First, the finite mixture clutter model for a multilook covariance matrix (MLCM) is built, where the off-diagonal elements of the MLCM contain the information of magnitude and interferogram's phase between azimuth channels. Then, SAR image autosegmentation is carried out by using the expectation maximum algorithm with combination of the aforementioned mixture model, and the isolated points that are segmented incorrectly can be eliminated via exploiting the Markov random field smoothing technique. Finally, azimuth ambiguous clutter can be suppressed by means of the clutter covariance matrix, which is constructed by the training samples of segmented ambiguities. The experiments on simulated data and real data measured by TerraSAR-X demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain the more accurate position information and good cancellation performance for the azimuth ambiguous clutter, without the accurate system parameters and the information of the sources account for azimuth ambiguities.

TI  - Extraction of High-Precision Urban Impervious Surfaces from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery via Modified Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the performance of Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery for extracting urban impervious surface using a modified linear spectral mixture analysis (MLSMA) method. Sentinel-2A MSI provided 10 m red, green, blue, and near-infrared spectral bands, and 20 m shortwave infrared spectral bands, which were used to extract impervious surfaces. We aimed to extract urban impervious surfaces at a spatial resolution of 10 m in the main urban area of Guangzhou, China. In MLSMA, a built-up image was first extracted from the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) using the Otsu's method; the high-albedo, low-albedo, vegetation, and soil fractions were then estimated using conventional linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). The LSMA results were post-processed to extract high-precision impervious surface, vegetation, and soil fractions by integrating the built-up image and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The performance of MLSMA was evaluated using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Experimental results revealed that MLSMA can extract the high-precision impervious surface fraction at 10 m with Sentinel-2A imagery. The 10 m impervious surface map of Sentinel-2A is capable of recovering more detail than the 30 m map of Landsat 8. In the Sentinel-2A impervious surface map, continuous roads and the boundaries of buildings in urban environments were clearly identified.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in Water Clarity in Lake Liangzi Determined by Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (via the Secchi disk depth, SDD) is an important indicator of water quality and lake ecosystem health. Monitoring long-term SDD change is vital for water quality assessment and lake management. In this study, we developed and validated an empirical model for estimating the SDD based on Landsat ETM+ and OLI data using the combination of band ratio of the near-infrared (NIR) band to the blue band and the NIR band. Time series data of remotely estimated SDD in Lake Liangzi were retrieved from 2007 to 2016 using the proposed models based on forty Landsat images. The results of the Mann-Kendall test (p = 0.002) and linear regression (R-2 = 0.352, p < 0.001) indicated that the SDD in Lake Liangzi demonstrated a significant decreasing trend during the study period. The annual mean SDD in Lake Liangzi was significantly negatively correlated with the population (R 2 = 0.530, p = 0.017) and gross domestic product (R-2 = 0.619, p = 0.007) of the Lake Liangzi basin. In addition, water level increase and the flood have an important effect on SDD decrease. Our study revealed that anthropogenic activities may be driving factors for the long-term declining trend in the SDD. Additionally, floods and heavy precipitation may decrease the SDD over the short term in Lake Liangzi. A declining trend in the SDD in Lake Liangzi may continue under future intense anthropogenic activities and climate change such as the extreme heavy precipitation event increase.

TI  - Drought Influence on Forest Plantations in Zululand, South Africa, Using MODIS Time Series and Climate Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa has a long history of recurrent droughts that have adversely affected its economic performance. The recent 2015 drought has been declared the most serious in 26 years and impaired key agricultural sectors including the forestry sector. Research on the forests' responses to drought is therefore essential for management planning and monitoring. The effects of the latest drought on the forests in South Africa have not been studied and are uncertain. The study reported here addresses this gap by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation data retrieved and processed using the JavaScript code editor in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the corresponding normalized difference infrared index (NDII), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and El Nino time series data for KwaMbonambi, northern Zululand, between 2002 and 2016. The NDVI and NDII time series were decomposed using the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method to establish the trend and seasonal variation. Multiple linear regression and Mann-Kendall tests were applied to determine the association of the NDVI and NDII with the climate variables. Plantation trees displayed high NDVI values (0.74-0.78) from 2002 to 2013; then, they decreased sharply to 0.64 in 2015. The Mann-Kendall trend test confirmed a negative significant (p = 0.000353) trend between 2014 and 2015. This pattern was associated with a precipitation deficit and low NDII values during a strong El Nino phase. The PDSI (-2.6) values indicated severe drought conditions. The greening decreased in 2015, with some forest remnants showing resistance, implying that the tree species had varying sensitivity to drought. We found that the plantation trees suffered drought stress during 2015, although it seems that the trees began to recover, as the NDVI signals rose in 2016. Overall, these results demonstrated the effective use of the NDVI- and NDII-derived MODIS data coupled with climatic variables to provide insights into the influence of drought on plantation trees in the study area.

TI  - A cloud-based remote sensing data production system
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The data processing capability of existing remote sensing system has not kept pace with the amount of data typically received and need to be processed. Existing product services are not capable of providing users with a variety of remote sensing data sources for selection, either. Therefore, in this paper, we present a product generation programme using multisource remote sensing data, across distributed data centers in a cloud environment, so as to compensate for the low productive efficiency, less types and simple services of the existing system. The programme adopts "master-slave" architecture. Specifically, the master center is mainly responsible for the production order receiving and parsing, as well as task and data scheduling, results feedback, and so on; the slave centers are the distributed remote sensing data centers, which storage one or more types of remote sensing data, and mainly responsible for production task execution. In general, each production task only runs on one data center, and the data scheduling among centers adopts a "minimum data transferring" strategy. The logical workflow of each production task is organized based on knowledge base, and then turned into the actual executed workflow by Kepler. In addition, the scheduling strategy of each production task mainly depends on the Ganglia monitoring results, thus the computing resources can be allocated or expanded adaptively. Finally, we evaluated the proposed programme using test experiments performed at global, regional and local areas, and the results showed that our proposed cloud-based remote sensing production system could deal with massive remote sensing data and different products generating, as well as on-demand remote sensing computing and information service.

TI  - A novel statistical model for differential synthetic aperture radar tomography
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A deterministic differential tomographic synthetic aperture radar (D-TomoSAR) model, based on geometrical derivations and the assumption of accurate phase calibration, has been widely employed for spatially locating and temporally monitoring the point-like scatterers. In this work, we model the phase miscalibration effects of the extended scatters caused by partial correlation, i.e. the decorrelation effects from temporal and spatial changes as well as the residual atmospheric and deformation effects after preprocessing. Starting from the origin of four-dimensional SAR focusing, correlation of the target is analysed and a statistical D-TomoSAR model accounting for partial correlation effects is proposed. Based on the proposed model, a D-TomoSAR stack simulator is designed using Cholesky decomposition. Moreover, a linear minimum mean square error estimator based on the proposed model is developed for estimation of the height and deformation velocity of extended scatterers. Reconstruction results with both simulated data and real data acquired by TerraSAR-X/Tandem-X sensors are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The first Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder (GNOS) which is compatible of both BeiDou System (BDS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) was successfully launched into orbit onboard the FengYun 3 C satellite (FY-3C) on September 23, 2013, and it has already gathered a large amount of ionosphere radio occultation (RO) data so far. However, the detailed analysis and validation of GPS ionosphere RO data have not been done up to now. Therefore, this paper discusses the configuration of the FY-3C GNOS, the methods and results of GPS ionosphere occultation processment, the quality analysis of the GPS ionosphere RO products, and the precision consistency between the GNOS GPS ionosphere RO product and ionosonde data. The peak electron density (NmF2) correlation coefficient is 0.97, the corresponding standard deviation is 16.08%. The peak value altitude (hmF2) correlation coefficient is 0.89, and the corresponding standard deviation is 23.79 km. The in-orbit operation of GNOS provides a basis data set for the monitoring, forecasting and research of ionosphere's space weather.

TI  - Distributed correlation model mining from remote sensing big data based on gene expression programming
T2  - PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of remote sensing techniques, an enormous amount of remote sensing data is collected by observing the earth. The method by which researchers mine the relevant knowledge accurately and efficiently from remote sensing big data remains a topic of interest. The existing model mining algorithms usually rely on a priori knowledge, and cannot meet the actual needs of remote sensing data mining. This paper proposes distributed correlation model mining from remote sensing big data based on gene expression programming (DCMM-GEP) combined with cloud computing to find a better model for remote sensing big data using an abnormal value recognition algorithm based on residual sum of residual (AVR-RSR) and a global model generation algorithm for remote sensing big data based on linear least squares (GMGRS-LLS). Comparative experiments show that DCMM-GEP outperforms both distributed correlation model mining based on genetic programming and genetic algorithms, showing better average time-consumption, R-square values and prediction accuracy. The comparative results also show that with an increasing number of computing nodes, DCMM-GEP has a good speed-up ratio and scale-up ratio.

TI  - Improved MODIS-Aqua Chlorophyll-a Retrievals in the Turbid Semi-Enclosed Ariake Bay, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) from ocean color satellite data is extremely challenging in turbid, optically complex coastal waters. Ariake Bay in Japan is a turbid semi-enclosed bay of great socio-economic significance, but it suffers from serious water quality problems, particularly due to red tide events. Chl-a derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on satellite Aqua in Ariake Bay was investigated, and it was determined that the causes of the errors were from inaccurate atmospheric correction and inappropriate in-water algorithms. To improve the accuracy of MODIS remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue and green bands, a simple method was adopted using in situ Rrs data. This method assumes that the error in MODIS Rrs(547) is small, and MODIS Rrs(412) can be estimated from MODIS Rrs(547) using a linear relation between in situ Rrs(412) and Rrs(547). We also showed that the standard MODIS Chl-a algorithm, OC3M, underestimated Chl-a, which was mostly due to water column turbidity. A new empirical switching algorithm was generated based on the relationship between in situ Chl-a and the blue-to-green band ratio, max(Rrs(443), Rrs(448)/Rrs(547), which was the same as the OC3M algorithm. The criterion of Rrs(667) of 0.005 sr(-1) was used to evaluate the extent of turbidity for the switching algorithm. The results showed that the switching algorithm performed better than OC3M, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of estimated Chl-a decreased from 0.414 to 0.326. The RMSE for MODIS Chl-a using the recalculated Rrs and the switching algorithm was 0.287, which was a significant improvement from the RMSE of 0.610, which was obtained using standard MODIS Chl-a. Finally, the accuracy of our method was tested with an independent dataset collected by the local Fisheries Research Institute, and the results revealed that the switching algorithm with the recalculated Rrs reduced the RMSE of MODIS Chl-a from 0.412 of the standard to 0.335.

TI  - Co-Seismic and Postseismic Fault Models of the 2018 Mw 6.4 Hualien Earthquake Occurred in the Junction of Collision and Subduction Boundaries Offshore Eastern Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ascending and descending InSAR deformations derived from ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite SAR images and GPS displacements are used to estimate the fault model of the 2018 Mw 6.4 Hualien earthquake. The sinistral strike-slip fault dipping to the west with a high dip angle of 89.4 degrees and a rake angle of 201.7 degrees is considered as the seismogenic fault of this event. This seismogenic fault also triggered the ruptures of the Milun fault, which dips to the east with a dip angle of similar to 72 degrees, and an unknown west-dipping fault with a dip angle of 85.2 degrees. Two predicted faulting models indicate that the InSAR deformation fields include more postseismic slip than those of the GPS data. The north segment of the Milun fault and west-dipping fault have been triggered by the rupture of the seismogenic fault, but the postseismic slip occurred only in the south segment of the Milun fault. The InSAR-derived co-seismic and postseismic faulting model suggests that the significant slip concentrates at depths of 2.4-15.0 km of the main fault, 0.0-14.0 km of the Milun fault. Only minor slip is detected on the west-dipping fault. The maximum fault slip of ca. 2.1 m is located at the depth of ca. 2.4 km under the Meilun Tableland. The Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change calculated by the co-seismic and postseismic faulting model shows that there is a significant CFS increase in the east of the south segment of the Milun fault, but few of the aftershocks occur in this area, which indicates a high risk of future seismic hazard.

TI  - Integrated Analyses of PALSAR and Landsat Imagery Reveal More Agroforests in a Typical Agricultural Production Region, North China Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest among terrestrial ecosystems, forests are vital to maintaining ecosystem services and regulating regional climate. The area and spatial distribution of trees in densely forested areas have been focused on in the past few decades, while sparse forests in agricultural zones, so-called agroforests or trees outside forests (TOF), have usually been ignored or missed in existing forest mapping efforts, despite their important role in regulating agricultural ecosystems. We combined Landsat and PALSAR data to map forests in a typical agricultural zone in the North China Plain. The resultant map, based on PALSAR and Landsat (PL) data, was also compared with five existing medium resolution (30-100 m) forest maps from PALSAR (JAXA forest map) and Landsat: NLCD-China, GlobeLand30, ChinaCover, and FROM-GLC. The results show that the PL-based forest map has the highest accuracy (overall accuracy of 95 +/- 1% with a 95% confidence interval, and Kappa coefficient of 0.86) compared to those forest maps based on single Landsat or PALSAR data in the North China Plain (overall accuracy ranging from 85 +/- 2% to 92 +/- 1%). All forest maps revealed higher accuracy in densely forested mountainous areas, while the PL-based and JAXA forest maps showed higher accuracy in the plain, as the higher omission errors existed in only the Landsat-based forest maps. Moreover, we found that the PL-based forest map can capture more patched forest information in low forest density areas. This means that the radar data have advantages in capturing forests in the typical agricultural zones, which tend to be missing in published Landsat-based only forest maps. Given the significance of agroforests in regulating ecosystem services of the agricultural ecosystem and improving carbon stock estimation, this study implies that the integration of PALSAR and Landsat data can provide promising agroforest estimates in future forest inventory efforts, targeting a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem services of agroforests and a more accurate carbon budget inventory.

TI  - Effects of urban form on the urban heat island effect based on spatial regression model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is becoming more of a concern with the accelerated process of urbanization. However, few studies have examined the effect of urban form on land surface temperature (LST) especially from an urban planning perspective. This paper used spatial regression model to investigate the effects of both land use composition and urban form on LST in Wuhan City, China, based on the regulatory planning management unit. Landsat ETM+ image data was used to estimate LST. Land use composition was calculated by impervious surface area proportion, vegetated area proportion, and water proportion, while urban form indicators included sky view factor (SVF), building density, and floor area ratio (FAR). We first tested for spatial autocorrelation of urban LST, which confirmed that a traditional regression method would be invalid. A spatial error model (SEM) was chosen because its parameters were better than a spatial lag model (SLM). The results showed that urban form metrics should be the focus for mitigation efforts of UHI effects. In addition, analysis of the relationship between urban form and UHI effect based on the regulatory planning management unit was helpful for promoting corresponding UHI effect mitigation rules in practice. Finally, the spatial regression model was recommended to be an appropriate method for dealing with problems related to the urban thermal environment. Results suggested that the impact of urbanization on the UHI effect can be mitigated not only by balancing various land use types, but also by optimizing urban form, which is even more effective. This research expands the scientific understanding of effects of urban form on UHI by explicitly analyzing indicators closely related to urban detailed planning at the level of regulatory planning management unit. In addition, it may provide important insights and effective regulation measures for urban planners to mitigate future UHI effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating geologic and Landsat-8 and ASTER remote sensing data for gold exploration: a case study from Zarshuran Carlin-type gold deposit, NW Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Landsat-8 data were integrated with geological data to map lithologic units, lineament features, hydrothermal alteration zones, and distribution of Fe3+-bearing minerals in the Zarshuran Carlin-type gold deposit. The dominant hydrothermal alterations related to the gold mineralization in the study area, consist of argillic, alunite, silicified, and decalcified alterations of carbonate host rocks. The alteration assem-blages are accompanied by ferric iron minerals such as jarosite and hematite. The red-green-blue (RGB) combination of bands 5, 2, and 1 of the ASTER sensor provides excellent criteria for the separation of the host rock lithologic boundaries, particularly for the Oligo-Miocene andesitic volcanic rocks covering the vast parts of the study area. The ASTER lithologic map derived from RGB combination of bands 5, 2, and 1 is represented by a set of lineaments in which both the thrust and normal faults were enhanced. The band ratios obtained by the Landsat-8 and the ASTER datasets have been effectively used to delineate the alteration halos characterized by kaolinite, alunite, quartz, and ferric iron minerals both in regional and local (the Zarshuran gold mine) scales. In addition, methods such as the principal component analysis (PCA) and the selective principal component analysis (Crosta) were exerted on the ASTER data to identify the hydrothermal alteration zones. The spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm using the ASTER data could better differentiate the various alteration (e.g., argillic, alunite, and silicified) zones existing in the study area. The matched filtering (MF) technique processed on the Landsat-8 data was applied to characterize the ferric iron minerals (jarosite and hematite) and separate the hydrothermal alteration zones as well. The integration and combination of various image processing techniques indicated that the alteration zones at Zarshuran are affiliated with normal faults within the carbonate host rocks and can be used for prospection mapping purposes in regional scale.

TI  - Improved detection of archaeological features using multi-source data in geographically diverse capital city sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the world's oldest civilizations, China has a continuous history that extends for more than 5000 years. There are many important capital cities throughout China. However, little information is available in the literature about capital city sites using remote sensing because of its various geographical conditions. This paper designs new methodologies for detecting archaeological features in Northern and Southern China based on multi-source remotely sensed data. Based on various environmental factors, multitemporal images were interpreted to analyse an ancient city located in Southern China, while the integral of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and thermal infrared images were employed to detect the archaeological features in Northern China; these results were then cross compared with each other. The results demonstrate that the use of integrated remote sensing technology can provide valuable information and indications of archaeological remains in ancient capital city sites in different geomorphological and vegetated environments in China. Our results also demonstrate that capital city sites can be detected using the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest type identification by random forest classification combined with SPOT and multitemporal SAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a forest type classification technology for the Daxing'an Mountains of northeast China using multisource remote sensing data. A SPOT-5 image and two temporal images of RADARSAT-2 full-polarization SAR were used to identify forest types in the Pangu Forest Farm of the Daxing'an Mountains. Forest types were identified using random forest (RF) classification with the following data combination types: SPOT-5 alone, SPOT-5 and SAR images in August or November, and SPOT-5 and two temporal SAR images. We identified many forest types using a combination of multitemporal SAR and SPOT-5 images, including Betula platyphylla, Larix gmelinii, Pinus sylvestris and Picea koraiensis forests. The accuracy of classification exceeded 88% and improved by 12% when compared to the classification results obtained using SPOT data alone. RF classification using a combination of multisource remote sensing data improved classification accuracy compared to that achieved using single-source remote sensing data.

TI  - A Speckle Filtering Method Based on Hypothesis Testing for Time-Series SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the suppression effect for the speckle noise of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the ability of spatiotemporal information preservation of the filtered image without losing the spatial resolution, a novel multitemporal filtering method based on hypothesis testing is proposed in this paper. A framework of a two-step similarity measure strategy is adopted to further enhance the filtering results. Firstly, bi-date analysis using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is conducted in step 1 to extract homogeneous patches for 3-D patch stacks generation. Subsequently, the similarity between patch stacks is compared by a sliding time-series likelihood ratio (STSLR) test algorithm in step 2, which utilizes the multi-dimensional data structure of the stacks to improve the accuracy of unchanged pixels detection. Finally, the filtered values are obtained by averaging the similar pixels in time-series. The experimental results and analysis of two multitemporal datasets acquired by TerraSAR-X show that the proposed method outperforms the other typical methods with regard to the overall filtering effect, especially in terms of the consistency between the filtered images and the original ones. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is also discussed by analyzing the results from step 1 and step 2.

TI  - Effects of urban form on haze pollution in China: Spatial regression analysis based on PM<sub>2.5</sub> remote sensing data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, haze pollution has posed a great threat to public health in any Chinese cities. It is necessary to explore different prevention methods for haze, and shaping a reasonable urban form may be a good way to improve air quality. This study selected 269 cities as sample cities, used PM2.5 remote sensing data, and employed spatial regression models to explore the effects of urban form on haze pollution. The results show that urban form can affect the concentration of PM2.5 through vehicle use, green land regulation, pollutant diffusion, and the heat island effect. The results suggest that the effects of population density, degree of centering, and compactness on air quality depend on population size. Therefore, different development strategies should be used for cities of different sizes. Regional transmission is an important source of haze pollution, and regional joint management strategies for combating haze pollution should be strengthened.

TI  - Crustal thermal structure of the Farafra oasis, Egypt, based on airborne potential field data
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Farafra oasis is one of the most interesting and promising areas for geothermal energy development in Egypt. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the geothermal potential in the Farafra oasis and its suitability for geothermal development in the Western Desert using different tools such as remote sensing, seismic events, and aeromagnetic and aerogravity data. Remote sensing (Landsat 8 ETM +) was utilized to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) in the Farafra oasis. The resultant map of LSTs indicates that the surface temperature of the Farafra area ranges from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C and that the mean surface temperature of the whole area is approximately 26 degrees C. Most earthquake events are located to the east and northeast of the Farafra oasis (toward the Bahariya Oasis). However, the highest magnitude event (4.62) is located near the eastern border of the Farafra oasis. One event with a magnitude of 3.08 is located to the south and within the Farafra outline. The distributions of low-magnitude earthquake events can provide information about the locations of active faults, which indicate possible fracture permeability. The interpretation of aeromagnetic data indicates that the Curie point depth (CPD) ranges from 16 km to 26 km with an average of 22 km. The CPDs increase toward the center and north of the Farafra oasis and decrease westward. The interpretation of aerogravity data shows maximum anomalies above four main localities: Ain-Dalla, Bir-Sitta, northeast of Bir-Sitta and at the southern margin of the Farafra oasis, which indicates the existence of vertical or near-vertical contacts (faults) in these areas and provides a good correlation with structural lines on the geological map. Linear features striking NE-SW are pronounced on the tilt gradient map.

TI  - Allergen Delivery Inhibitors: A Rationale for Targeting Sentinel Innate Immune Signaling of Group 1 House Dust Mite Allergens through Structure-Based Protease Inhibitor Design
T2  - MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Diverse evidence from epidemiologic surveys and investigations into the molecular basis of allergenicity have revealed that a small cadre of "initiator" allergens promote the development of allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Pre-eminent among these initiators are the group 1 allergens from house dust mites (HDM). In mites, group 1 allergens function as cysteine peptidase digestive enzymes to which humans are exposed by inhalation of HDM fecal pellets. Their protease nature confers the ability to activate high gain signaling mechanisms which promote innate immune responses, leading to the persistence of allergic sensitization. An important feature of this process is that the initiator drives responses both to itself and to unrelated allergens lacking these properties through a process of collateral priming. The clinical significance of group 1 HDM allergens in disease, their serodominance as allergens, and their IgE-independent bioactivities in innate immunitymake these allergens interesting therapeutic targets in the design of new small-molecule interventions in allergic disease. The attraction of this new approach is that it offers a powerful, root-cause-level intervention from which beneficial effects can be anticipated by interference in a wide range of effector pathways associated with these complex diseases. This review addresses the general background to HDM allergens and the validation of group 1 as putative targets. We then discuss structure-based drug design of the first-in-class representatives of allergen delivery inhibitors aimed at neutralizing the proteolytic effects of HDM group 1 allergens, which are essential to the development and maintenance of allergic diseases.

TI  - Spatial distribution and temporal variation of aerosol optical depth and radiative effect in South China and its adjacent area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol loading over South China from 2001 to 2016 were investigated using aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and NO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (0M1). AOD values were high in the central part and low in the southeast and northwest parts of South China. High AOD (larger than 0.7) were found in the Pearl River Delta, Nanning, and Hanoi (Vietnam). The seasonal average AOD was high in spring (approximately 0.7) and low in winter (approximately 0.4). Generally, an increasing trend of AOD was found from 2001 to 2004 and a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2016 in the continent due to the change in pollutant discharging, which was verified by annual NO2 data. Furthermore, the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) was calculated using the Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code (MAGIC) and MODIS AOD time series. The spatial distribution and temporal variation of ARE at surface showed similar patterns to AOD, with high values occurring in the Pearl River Delta (39 W/m(2)), Hanoi (36 W/m(2)), and Nanning (30 W/m(2)). From 2001 to 2016, ARE at surface in South China decreased by approximately 4 W/m(2) with the highest value (24.75 W/m(2)) occurring in 2007.

TI  - An improved dual-polarized ratio algorithm for sea ice concentration retrieval from passive microwave satellite data and inter-comparison with ASI, ABA and NT2
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dual-polarized ratio algorithm (DPR) for the retrieval of Arctic sea ice concentration from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) data was improved using a contrast ratio (CR) parameter. In contrast to three other algorithms (Artist Sea Ice algorithm, ASI; NASA-Team 2 algorithm, NT2; and AMSR-E Bootstrap algorithm, ABA), this algorithm does not use a series of tie-points or a priori values of brightness temperature of sea-ice constituents, such as open water and 100% sea ice. Instead, it is based on a ratio (alpha) of horizontally and vertically polarized sea ice emissivity at 36.5 GHz, which can be automatically determined by the CR. alpha exhibited a clear seasonal cycle: changing slowly during winter, rapidly at other times, and reaching a minimum during summer. The DPR was improved using a seasonal alpha. The systematic differences in the Arctic sea ice area over the complete AMSR-E period (2002-2011) were -0.8%+/- 2.0% between the improved DPR and ASI; -1.3%+/- 1.7% between the improved DPR and ABA; and -0.7%+/- 1.9% between the improved DPR and NT2. The improved DPR and ASI (or ABA) had small seasonal differences. The seasonal differences between the improved DPR and NT2 decreased, except in summer. The improved DPR identified extremely low ice concentration regions in the Pacific sector of the central Arctic (north of 83 degrees N) around August 12, 2010, which was confirmed by the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition. A series of high-resolution MODIS images (250 mx250 m) of the Beaufort Sea during summer were used to assess the four algorithms. According to mean bias and standard deviations, the improved DPR algorithm performed equally well with the other three sea ice concentration algorithms. The improved DPR can provide reasonable sea ice concentration data, especially during summer.

TI  - Analyzing horizontal and vertical urban expansions in three East Asian megacities with the SS-coMCRF model
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - A recently proposed method based on the spectral similarity-enhanced Markov chain random field cosimulation (SS-coMCRF) model has provided a practical approach for estimating both horizontal and vertical urban expansion of megacities using Landsat images. Estimating vertical urban growth-the area change of mid-rise or taller buildings (MTBs)-makes it possible to gain some new insights into the urban expansion of megacities. This study makes use of the new approach to examine the horizontal and vertical urban expansion of three capital megacities (Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo) in East Asia during the late 1980s to the mid-2010s. In contrast to previous studies that only assessed horizontal urban growth, which usually showed almost no increase in urban area in some highly developed cities, this study indicates some different findings: (1) Both horizontal and vertical urban expansion had been happening in the three megacities during the studied period, especially with respect to vertical urban expansion. During the studied period there were 20.7 km(2), 11.3 Km(2), and 6.8 km(2) MTB area increases in Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo, respectively. (2) Different cities showed some differences in growth patterns, mainly because they were at different urban development stages and impacted by different local situations in terms of geography, population, and development policies. (3) A similarity is that the three megacities all tended to horizontally expand initially and then grow vertically in the already developed areas. This study may provide a useful new perspective on the urban expansion of megacities.

TI  - A SPECLib-based operational classification approach: A preliminary test on China land cover mapping at 30 m
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-resolution land cover mapping at the regional or global scale is usually time-consuming and involves a lot of manual participation. This article proposes a novel and automatic land cover mapping approach called the SPatial-tEmporal speCtral Library (SPECLib), which can produce a land cover map with a 30-m spatial resolution. First, the SPECLib is developed by extracting reference spectra for uniform, typical samples of each land cover type by combining the GlobCover2009 land cover product and the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance Product (MODO9 A1). SPECLib has a temporal resolution of 8 days and contains most of the land cover types in each 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees geographic cell. For an arbitrary temporal stage, for each geographical cell of the SPECLib, there are a total of about 5000 MODIS spectra. Secondly, an operational approach for automatic land cover mapping using Landsat data is developed based on SPECLib. For each Landsat scene to be classified, the reference spectra of the land cover types in the corresponding geographic cell were automatically extracted and normalized. The Landsat scene was then classified by using the normalized reference spectra from SPECLib in an integrated classification approach that combined MLC (Maximum Likelihood Classification) and SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper). Finally, the SPECLib-based approach is tested using 510 single-date Landsat 8 OLI scenes to produce a land cover map of China. The map was validated using 11,366 interpretation samples and was shown to have an overall accuracy of 77.34% and a kappa coefficient of 0.729. Therefore, the preliminary results indicate that the SPECLib-based operational classification approach is a promisingly automatic method for global land cover mapping at a resolution of 30 m.

TI  - A Geographically Weighted Regression Analysis of the Underlying Factors Related to the Surface Urban Heat Island Phenomenon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated how underlying biophysical attributes affect the characterization of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) phenomenon using (and comparing) two statistical techniques: global regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Land surface temperature (LST) was calculated from Landsat 8 imagery for 20 July 2015 for the metropolitan areas of Austin and San Antonio, Texas. We sought to examine SUHI by relating LST to Lidar-derived terrain factors, land cover composition, and landscape pattern metrics developed using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011. The results indicate that (1) land cover composition is closely related to the SUHI effect for both metropolitan areas, as indicated by the global regression coefficients of building fraction and NDVI, with values of 0.29 and -0.74 for Austin, and 0.19 and -0.38 for San Antonio, respectively. The terrain morphology was also an indicator of the SUHI phenomenon, implied by the elevation (0.20 for Austin and 0.09 for San Antonio) and northness (0.20 for Austin and 0.09 for San Antonio); (2) the SUHI phenomenon of Austin on 20 July 2015 was affected by the spatial pattern of the land use and land cover (LULC), which was not detected for San Antonio; and (3) with a local determination coefficient higher than 0.8, GWR had higher explanatory power of the underlying factors compared to global regression. By accommodating spatial non-stationarity and allowing the model parameters to vary in space, GWR illustrated the spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between different land surface properties and the LST. The GWR analysis of SUHI phenomenon can provide unique information for site-specific land planning and policy implementation for SUHI mitigation.

TI  - Assessing the effects of ecological restoration approaches in the alpine rangelands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has increased in prominence since the last century as an active way to reverse ecosystem deterioration derived from human interventions. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of restoration approaches on ecological and economic conditions of typical regions in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Data were collected using structured questionnaires delivered to 195 herders living in areas with average elevation above 3773 m. Land use maps, MODIS images, and government statistics were also used for the study. It was found that local herders have adopted five major approaches, i.e. enclosure, grazing prohibition, enclosure + deratization, enclosure + deratization + grass seeding, and enclosure + deratization + crop-forage cultivation + warm sheds, to ensure success of the restoration programs initiated by the government. The results show that vegetation coverage, especially for high and very high coverage grasslands, increased across the study sites and across approaches used, with a high grassland recovery rate observed in the areas where either grazing is prohibited or grassland management was dominated by integration approaches. Furthermore, households who employed integrated approaches tended to have more animals to rear, higher capability of resisting risks, and higher income than those who did not. These findings imply that balanced ecological and economic development is possible when appropriate management approaches are adopted. However, evaluation and monitoring of grassland conditions are needed to readjust restoration policy and associated approaches in a timely manner.

TI  - Differences among among three types of tropical deep convective clusters observed from A-Train satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convective clusters (DCCs) constitute a complex regime with a variety of types of cloud parameterization in multiple global climate models (GCMs). This study develops a method to identify tropical DCCs and presents regional differences in cloud occurrence, surface precipitation and a vertical survey of ice water content among separated DCCs, connected DCCs and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) determined by collocating data from MODIS, AMSR-E, CPR and CALIOP instruments on board A-Train satellites. The results reveal that separated DCCs and MCSs occur frequently over East Asia, while connected DCCs are more common over the warm pool of the West Pacific in June-August and over South America in December-February. Higher surface convective precipitation rates occur more frequently in MCSs than in separated and connected DCCs in non-monsoon areas. However, connected DCCs have a large ice water content (IWC) at 10-15 km similar to that of MCSs, and these clusters are more intense than those in separated DCCs. Remarkably large anvil-stratiform clouds connected with multiple deep convective cores in connected DCCs can be easily confused with MCSs if the cloud top brightness temperature in the horizontal view is the only parameter being considered. Combined observational data of surface precipitation of DCCs will be helpful for distinguishing connected DCCs and MCSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Antarctic Snowmelt Detected by Diurnal Variations of AMSR-E Brightness Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic surface snowmelt is sensitive to the polar climate. The ascending and descending passes of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System Sensor (AMSR-E) observed the Antarctic ice sheet in the afternoon (the warmest period) and at midnight (a cold period), enabling us to make full use of the diurnal amplitude variations (DAV) in brightness temperature (T-b) to detect snowmelt. The DAV in vertically polarized 36.5 GHz T-b (DAV36V) is extremely sensitive to liquid water and can reduce the effects of the structural changes in snowpacks during melt seasons. A set of controlled experiments based on the microwave emission model of layered snow (MEMLS) were conducted to study the changes of the vertically polarized 36.5 GHz T-b (Delta 36V) during the transitions from dry to wet snow regimes. Results of the experiments suggest that 9 K can be used as a DAV36V threshold to recognize snowmelt. The analyses of snowmelt suggest that the Antarctic ice sheet began to melt in November and became almost completely frozen in late March of the following year. The total cumulative melt area from 2002 to 2011 was 2.44 x 10(6) km(2), i.e., 17.58% of the Antarctic ice sheet. The annual cumulative melt area showed considerable fluctuations, with a significant (above 90% confidence level) drop of 5.24 x 10(4) km(2)/year in the short term. Persistent snowmelt (i.e., melt that continues for at least three days) detected by AMSR-E and hourly air temperatures (T-air) were very consistent. Though melt seasons became longer in the western Antarctic Peninsula and the Shackleton Ice Shelf, Antarctica was subjected to considerable decreases in duration and melting days in stable melt areas, i.e., -0.64 and -0.81 days/year, respectively. Surface snowmelt in Antarctica decreased temporally and spatially from 2002 to 2011.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Surface Deformation in Mining Area Based on InSAR and GRACE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the relationship between underground mining, groundwater storage change, and surface deformation, we first used two sets of ENVISAT data and one set of Sentinel-1A data to obtain surface deformation in eastern Xuzhou coalfield based on the temporarily coherent point interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TCPInSAR) technique. By comparison with underground mining activities, it indicated that the surface subsidence is mainly related to mine exploitation and residual subsidence in the goaf, while the surface uplift is mainly related to restoration of the groundwater level. The average groundwater storage change in the eastern Xuzhou coalfield from January 2005 to June 2017 was obtained through the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, and the results indicated that the groundwater storage changed nonlinearly with time. The reliability of the groundwater monitoring results was qualitatively validated by using measured well data from April 2009 to April 2010. Combining with time of mining and mine closing analysis, groundwater storage change within the research area had a strong correlation with drainage activity of underground mining. An analysis was finally conducted on the surface deformation and the groundwater storage change within the corresponding time. The results indicated that the groundwater storage variation in the research area has a great influence on the surface deformation after the mine closed.

TI  - Mapping Inter-Annual Land Cover Variations Automatically Based on a Novel Sample Transfer Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most land cover mapping methods require the collection of ground reference data at the time when the remotely sensed data are acquired. Due to the high cost of repetitive collection of reference data, however, it limits the production of annual land cover maps to a short time span. In order to reduce the mapping cost and to improve the timeliness, an object-based sample transfer (OBST) method was presented in this study. The object-based analysis with strict constrains in area, shape and index values is expected to reduce the accident errors in selecting and transferring samples. The presented method was tested and compared with same-year mapping (SY), cross-year mapping (CY) and multi-index automatic classification (MI). For the study years of 2001-2016, both the overall accuracies (above 90%) and detailed accuracy indicators of the presented method were very close to the SY accuracy and higher than accuracies of CY and MI. With the presented method, the times-series land cover map of Guangzhou, China were derived and analyzed. The results reveal that the city has undergone rapid urban expansion and the pressure on natural resources and environment has increased. These results indicate the proposed method could save considerable cost and time for mapping the spatial-temporal changes of urban development. This suggests great potential for future applications as more satellite observations have become available all over the globe.

TI  - A Prediction Smooth Method for Blending Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat images have been widely used in support of responsible development of natural resources, disaster risk management (e.g., forest fire, flooding etc.), agricultural production monitoring, as well as environmental change studies due to its medium spatial resolution and rich spectral information. However, its availability and usability are largely constrained by its low revisit frequency. On the other hand, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images for land studies have much more frequent coverage but with a lower spatial resolution of 250-500 m. To take advantages of the two sensors and expand their availability and usability, during the last decade, a number of image fusion methods have been developed for generating Landsat-like images from MODIS observations to supplement clear-sky Landsat imagery. However, available methods are typically effective or applicable for certain applications. For a better result, a new Prediction Smooth Reflectance Fusion Model (PSRFM) for blending Landsat and MODIS images is proposed. PSRFM consists of a dynamic prediction model and a smoothing filter. The dynamic prediction model generates synthetic Landsat images from a pair of Landsat and MODIS images and another MODIS image, either forward or backward in time. The smoothing filter combines the forward and backward predictions by weighted average based on elapsed time or on the estimated prediction uncertainty. Optionally, the smooth filtering can be applied with constraints based on Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In comparison to some published reflectance fusion methods, PSRFM shows the following desirable characteristics: (1) it can deal with one pair or two pairs of Landsat and MODIS images; (2) it can incorporate input image uncertainty during prediction and estimate prediction uncertainty; (3) it can track gradual vegetation phenological changes and deal with abrupt land-cover type changes; and (4) for predictions using two pairs of input images, the results can be further improved through the constrained smoothing filter based on NDSI or NDVI for certain applications. We tested PSRFM to generate a Landsat-like image time series by using Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS (MODO9GA) images and compared it to two reflectance fusion algorithms: STARFM (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) and ESTARFM (Enhanced version of STARFM). The results show that the proposed PSRFM is effective and outperforms STARFM and ESTARFM both visually and quantitatively.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing products are significant in the data assimilation of an ocean model. Considering the resolution and space coverage of different remote sensing data, two types of sea surface height (SSH) product are employed in the assimilation, including the gridded products from AVISO and the original along-track observations used in the generation. To explore their impact on the assimilation results, an experiment focus on the South China Sea (SCS) is conducted based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) technology. The comparison with EN4 data set and Argo profile indicates that, the along-track SSH assimilation result presents to be more accurate than the gridded SSH assimilation, because some noises may have been introduced in the merging process. Moreover, the mesoscale eddy detection capability of the assimilation results is analyzed by a vector geometry-based algorithm. It is verified that, the assimilation of the gridded SSH shows superiority in describing the eddy's characteristics, since the complete structure of the ocean surface has been reconstructed by the original data merging.

TI  - The Characteristics and Contributing Factors of Air Pollution in Nanjing: A Case Study Based on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Experiment and Multiple Datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) experiments, multiple datasets from ground-based stations and satellite remote sensing platforms, and backward trajectory models were combined to investigate the characteristics and influential mechanisms of the air pollution episode that occurred in Nanjing during 3-4 December 2017. Before the experiments, the position of the detector mounted on a UAV that was minimally disturbed by the rotation of the rotors was analyzed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The combined analysis indicated that the surface meteorological conditionshigh relative humidity, low wind speed, and low temperaturewere conducive to the accumulation of PM2.5. Strongly intense temperature inversion layers and the low thickness of the atmospheric mixed layer could have resulted in elevated PM2.5 mass concentrations. In the early stage, air pollution was affected by the synoptic circulation of the homogenous pressure field and low wind speeds, and the pollutants mainly originated from emissions from surrounding areas. The aggravated pollution was mainly attributed to the cold front and strong northwesterly winds above 850 hPa, and the pollutants mostly originated from the long-distance transport of emissions with northwesterly winds, mainly from the BeijingTianjinHebei (BTH) region and its surrounding areas. This long-distance transport predominated during this event. The air pollution level and aerosol optical depth (AOD) were positively correlated with respect to their spatial distributions; they could reflect shifts in areas of serious pollution. Pollution was concentrated in Anhui Province when it was alleviated in Nanjing. Polluted dust, polluted continental and smoke aerosols were primarily observed during this process. In particular, polluted dust aerosols accounted for a major part of the transport stage, and existed between the surface and 4 km. Moreover, the average extinction coefficient at lower altitudes (<1 km) was higher for aerosol deposition.

TI  - Supervised and Adaptive Feature Weighting for Object-Based Classification on Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique has been representing an evolving paradigm of remote sensing application, along with more high-resolution satellite images available. However, too many derived features from segmented objects also present a new challenge to OBIA applications. In this paper, we present a supervised and adaptive method for ranking and weighting features for object-based classification. The core of this method is the feature weight maps for each land type resulted from prior thematic maps and their corresponding satellite images of study areas. Specifically, first, satellite images to he classified are segmented using an adaptive multiscale algorithm, and the multiple (spectral, shape, and texture) features of segmented objects are calculated. Second, we extract distance maps and feature weight vectors for each land type from the prior thematic maps and corresponding satellite images, to generate feature weight maps. Third, a feature-weighted classifier with the feature weight maps, is applied on the segmented objects to generate classification maps. Finally, the classification result is evaluated. This approach is applied on a Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image and a Google Map image to produce objected-based classification maps, compared with the traditional feature selection algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is practically efficient to select important features and improve classification performance.

TI  - A Review of Ten-Year Advances of Multi-Baseline SAR Interferometry Using TerraSAR-X Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Since its launch in 2007, TerraSAR-X has continuously provided spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of our planet with unprecedented spatial resolution, geodetic, and geometric accuracy. This has brought life to the once inscrutable SAR images, which deterred many researchers. Thanks to merits like higher spatial resolution and more precise orbit control, we are now able to indicate individual buildings, even individual floors, to pinpoint targets within centimeter accuracy. As a result, multi-baseline SAR interferometric (InSAR) techniques are flourishing, from point target-based algorithms, to coherent stacking techniques, to absolute positioning of the former techniques. This article reviews the recent advances of multi-baseline InSAR techniques using TerraSAR-X images. Particular focus was put on our own development of persistent scatterer interferometry, SAR tomography, robust estimation in distributed scatterer interferometry and absolute positioning using geodetic InSAR. Furthermore, by introducing the applications associated with these techniques, such as 3D reconstruction and deformation monitoring, this article is also intended to give guidance to wider audiences who would like to resort to SAR data and related techniques for their applications.

TI  - An automatic method for screening clouds and cloud shadows in optical satellite image time series in cloudy regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and cloud shadows block land surface information in optical satellite images. Accurate detection of clouds and cloud shadows can help exclude these contaminated pixels in further applications. Existing cloud screening methods are challenged by cloudy regions where most of satellite images are contaminated by clouds. To solve this problem for landscapes where the typical frequency of cloud-free observations of a pixel is too small to use existing methods to mask clouds and shadows, this study presents a new Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA) method to screen clouds and cloud shadows in multi-temporal optical images. ATSA has five main steps: (1) calculate cloud and shadow indices to highlight cloud and cloud shadow information; (2) obtain initial cloud mask by unsupervised classifiers; (3) refine initial cloud mask by analyzing time series of a cloud index; (4) predict the potential shadow mask using geometric relationships; and (5) refine the potential shadow mask by analyzing time series of a shadow index. Compared with existing methods, ATSA needs fewer predefined parameters, does not require a thermal infrared band, and is more suitable for areas with persistent clouds. The performance of ATSA was tested with Landsat-8 OLI images, Landsat-4 MSS images, and Sentinel-2 images in three sites. The results were compared with a popular method, Function of Mask (Fmask), which has been adopted by USGS to produce Landsat cloud masks. These tests show that ATSA and Fmask can get comparable cloud and shadow masks in some of the tested images. However, ATSA can consistently obtain high accuracy in all images, while Fmask has large omission or commission errors in some images. The quantitative accuracy was assessed using manual cloud masks of 15 images. The average cloud producer's accuracy of these 15 images is as high as 0.959 and the average shadow producer's accuracy reaches 0.901. Given that it can be applied to old satellite sensors and it is capable for cloudy regions, ATSA is a valuable supplement to the existing cloud screening methods.

TI  - Early-season crop mapping using improved artificial immune network (IAIN) and Sentinel data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial efforts have been made to identify crop types by region, but few studies have been able to classify crops in early season, particularly in regions with heterogeneous cropping patterns. This is because image time series with both high spatial and temporal resolution contain a number of irregular time series, which cannot be identified by most existing classifiers. In this study, we firstly proposed an improved artificial immune network (IAIN), and tried to identify major crops in Hengshui, China at early season using IAIN classifier and short image time series. A time series of 15-day composited images was generated from 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Near-infrared (NIR) band and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were selected as optimal bands by pair-wise Jeffries-Matusita distances and Gini importance scores calculated from the random forest algorithm. When using IAIN to identify irregular time series, overall accuracy of winter wheat and summer crops were 99% and 98.55%, respectively. We then used the IAIN classifier and NIR and NDVI time series to identify major crops in the study region. Results showed that winter wheat could be identified 20 days before harvest, as both the producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) values were higher than 95% when an April 1-May 15 time series was used. The PA and UA of cotton and spring maize were higher than 95% with image time series longer than April 1-August 15. As spring maize and cotton mature in late August and September-October, respectively, these two crops can be accurately mapped 4-6 weeks before harvest. In addition, summer maize could be accurately identified after August 15, more than one month before harvest. This study shows the potential of IAIN classifier for dealing with irregular time series and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series at early-season crop type mapping, which is useful for crop management.

TI  - Marine mammals of Mexico: Richness patterns, protected areas, and conservation trends
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mexico registers about 60% of the total of marine mammals worldwide. However, species listed under a risk category show that, globally, Mexico faces big marine mammal conservation challenges. Thus, it becomes essential to successfully apply the existing knowledge into interdisciplinary conservation programs. We generated a presence/absence species richness map containing all 47 marine mammal species recorded in Mexico's Exclusive Economic Zone. After selecting nine oceanographic variables influencing marine mammal species richness, the top three factors influencing such richness were sea surface temperature and dissolved oxygen grouped in component #1, and salinity composed component #2. We also identified the species that are protected within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) category and its representation in management programs of these areas. Currently, 98% of marine mammal species distributed in Mexican waters are protected within an MPA; nevertheless, around 12% of them are not listed in management programs. Three priority sites in the Pacific Ocean and one for the Gulf of Mexico were identified to promote their conservation. Considering the sentinel and umbrella attributes of marine mammals, the information presented here will not only benefit their populations, but will also contribute to address marine species and ecosystems threats and improve the effectiveness of conservation plans.

TI  - An assessment of climate, weather, and fuel factors influencing a large, destructive wildfire in the Knysna region, South Africa
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In June 2017, wildfires burned 15 000 ha around the town of Knysna in the Western Cape, destroying > 800 buildings, > 5000 ha of forest plantations, and claiming the lives of seven people. We examined the factors that contributed to making this one of the worst fires on record in the region.Results: One third of the area that burned was in natural vegetation (mainly fynbos shrublands), and more than half was in plantations of invasive alien (non-native) pine trees, or in natural vegetation invaded by alien trees. We used satellite imagery to assess burn severity in different land cover types by comparing pre- and post-fire images to estimate biomass consumed. We used daily weather data from two weather stations to calculate fire danger and drought indices over 70 years, and compared the fire weather conditions during the 2017 Knysna fires to the long-term weather record. The amount of biomass consumed was significantly higher in plantations of invasive alien trees, and in fynbos invaded by alien trees, than in uninvaded fynbos, providing support for the contention that invasion by alien trees increases the impact and difficulty of control of wildfires. Fire danger indices on the days of the fires were in the top 0.1 to 0.2% of days in the historic record, indicating that fire weather conditions were extreme but not unprecedented. The fires were preceded by a prolonged drought, and 18-month running means for two drought indices were the highest on record.Conclusion: The severity of the fires was exacerbated by very high fire danger conditions, preceded by an unprecedented drought, and further worsened by the conversion of natural fynbos vegetation to plantations, and invasion of vegetation by alien trees. Historical fire suppression also resulted in fuel buildups, further aggravating the problem of fire control, while residential development within and adjacent to fire-prone areas increased the risks faced by residents. Our results support calls to control invasive alien plants, reduce commercial planting of invasive alien trees, strictly regulate development in areas of high fire risk, and maintain awareness of the need for fire-wise practices.

TI  - Estimating cotton water consumption using a time series of Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop coefficient (K-c)-based estimation of crop water consumption is one of the most commonly used methods for irrigation management. Spectral modeling of K-c is possible due to the high correlations between K-c and the crop phenologic development and spectral reflectance. In this study, cotton evapotranspiration was measured in the field using several methods, including eddy covariance, surface renewal, and heat pulse. K-c was estimated as the ratio between reference evapotranspiration and the measured cotton evapotranspiration. In addition, a time series of Sentinel-2 imagery was processed to produce 22 vegetation indices (VIs) based on the sensor's unique spectral bands. Empirical K-c - VI models were derived and ranked according to their prediction error. In accordance with previous studies, we found a strong correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and K-c (R-2 = 0.94), and yet, we also identified other spectral indices that are more strongly correlated to K-c. The indices that were found to be the most suitable for K-c prediction were based on the red and red-edge bands (MTCI, REP, and S2REP). This progress in estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that are available at no cost is a leap forward towards the development of crop irrigation requirements models. Consequently, this work sets the scene for near-real-time irrigation decision support systems.

TI  - Estimation of extreme wave height return periods from short-term interpolation of multi-mission satellite data: application to the South Atlantic
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the spatial pattern of wave extremes in the South Atlantic Ocean by using multiple altimeter platforms spanning the period 1993-2015. Unlike the traditional approach adopted by previous studies, consisting of computing the monthly mean, median or maximum values inside a bin of certain size, we tackled the problem with a different procedure in order to capture more information from short-term events. All satellite tracks occurring during a 2-day temporal window were gathered in the whole area and then gridded data were generated onto a mesh size of 2 degrees x 2 degrees through optimal interpolation. The peaks over threshold (POT) method was applied, along with the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). The results showed a spatial distribution comparable to previous studies and, additionally, this method allowed for capturing more information on shorter timescales without compromising spatial coverage. A comparison with buoy observations demonstrated that this approach improves the representativeness of short-term events in an extreme events analysis.

TI  - Global land change from 1982 to 2016
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land change is a cause and consequence of global environmental change(1,2). Changes in land use and land cover considerably alter the Earth's energy balance and biogeochemical cycles, which contributes to climate change and-in turn-affects land surface properties and the provision of ecosystem services(1-4). However, quantification of global land change is lacking. Here we analyse 35 years' worth of satellite data and provide a comprehensive record of global land-change dynamics during the period 1982-2016. We show that-contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally(5)-tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km(2) (+7.1% relative to the 1982 level). This overall net gain is the result of a net loss in the tropics being outweighed by a net gain in the extratropics. Global bare ground cover has decreased by 1.16 million km(2) (-3.1%), most notably in agricultural regions in Asia. Of all land changes, 60% are associated with direct human activities and 40% with indirect drivers such as climate change. Land-use change exhibits regional dominance, including tropical deforestation and agricultural expansion, temperate reforestation or afforestation, cropland intensification and urbanization. Consistently across all climate domains, montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover. The mapped land changes and the driver attributions reflect a human-dominated Earth system. The dataset we developed may be used to improve the modelling of land-use changes, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation-climate interactions to advance our understanding of global environmental change(1-4,6).

TI  - On the ecohydrology of the Yucatan Peninsula: Evapotranspiration and carbon intake dynamics across an eco-climatic gradient
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrology and productivity of the ecosystems of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) are highly constrained by two factors: (a) the lack of surface drainage networks due to the existence of a highly permeable and connected karstic aquifer roughly the size of the peninsula and (b) a climatic gradient that leads to a transition from seasonally dry deciduous and sub-deciduous tropical forests, in the north-western and central parts of the Peninsula, to evergreen forests, in the southern and eastern parts. As a result, surface water fluxes of the YP are restricted to evapotranspiration (ET) that are tightly coupled to ecosystems health and gross primary productivity (GPP). The magnitude and seasonal variation of these fluxes are sensitive to climatic variability and perturbations caused by extreme events such as droughts and tropical storms that are frequent in the YP. In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of ET and GPP above average dry and wet conditions through time series analyses of 15years of remotely sensed data from both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite products. Our results show that ET and GPP follow a regional moisture and temperature gradient that highly controls the distribution of ecosystems within the peninsula. We observe that ET and GPP are in phase with the rainy season in the deciduous forests, but for the evergreen forests, only the GPP is in phase. Additionally, and with the exception of droughts on deciduous ecosystems of the northern part of the YP, the productivity of these ecosystems shows a legacy effect, responding more to a defined trajectory (wetting or drying on the previous years), rather than to punctual extreme climatic events. This has implications on the resilience of these ecosystems to natural perturbations of climate. Comparisons between deciduous and evergreen forest indicate that both types of ecosystems have different plant water use strategies in response to hydrologic variability.

TI  - Space-time variability in UTLS chemical distribution in the Asian summer monsoon viewed by limb and nadir satellite sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian summer monsoon (ASM) creates a hemispheric-scale signature in trace-gas distributions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Data from satellite retrievals are the best source of information for characterizing these large-scale signatures. Measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), a limb-viewing satellite sensor, have been the most widely used retrieval products for these types of studies. This work explores the information for the ASM influence on UTLS chemical distribution from two nadir-viewing sensors, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), together with the MLS. Day-to-day changes in carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O-3) tracer distributions in response to dynamical variability are examined to assess how well the data from different sensors provide useful information for studying the impact of sub-seasonal-scale dynamics on chemical fields. Our results, using June-August 2008 data, show that although the MLS provides relatively sparse horizontal sampling on daily timescales, interpolated daily CO distributions show a high degree of dynamical consistency with the synoptic-scale structure of and variability in the anticyclone. Our analysis also shows that the IASI CO retrieval has sufficient sensitivity to produce upper tropospheric (UT) CO with variabilities independent from the lower to middle tropospheric CO. The consistency of IASI CO field with the synoptic-scale anticyclone dynamical variability demonstrates that the IASI UT CO product is a physically meaningful dataset. Furthermore, IASI CO vertical cross sections combined with the daily maps provide the first observational evidence for a model analyses-based hypothesis on the preferred ASM vertical transport location and the subsequent horizontal redistribution via east-west eddy shedding. Similarly, the OMI O-3 profile product is shown to be capable of distinguishing the tropospheric-dominated air mass in the anticyclone from the stratospheric-dominated background on a daily timescale, providing consistent and complementary information to the MLS. These results not only highlight the complementary information between nadir and limb sensors but also demonstrate the value of "process-based" retrieval evaluation for characterizing satellite data information content.

TI  - Remote sensing of <i>Trichodesmium</i> spp. mats in the western tropical South Pacific
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trichodesmium is the major nitrogen-fixing species in the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) region, a hot spot of diazotrophy. Due to the paucity of in situ observations, remote-sensing methods for detecting Trichodesmium presence on a large scale have been investigated to assess the regional-to-global impact of this organism on primary production and carbon cycling. A number of algorithms have been developed to identify Trichodesmium surface blooms from space, but determining with confidence their accuracy has been difficult, chiefly because of the scarcity of sea-truth information at the time of satellite overpass. Here, we use a series of new cruises as well as airborne surveys over the WTSP to evaluate their ability to detect Trichodesmium surface blooms in the satellite imagery. The evaluation, performed on MODIS data at 250 m and 1 km resolution acquired over the region, shows limitations due to spatial resolution, clouds, and atmospheric correction. A new satellite-based algorithm is designed to alleviate some of these limitations, by exploiting optimally spectral features in the atmospherically corrected reflectance at 531, 645, 678, 748, and 869 nm. This algorithm outperforms former ones near clouds, limiting false positive detection and allowing regional-scale automation. Compared with observations, 80 % of the detected mats are within a 2 km range, demonstrating the good statistical skill of the new algorithm. Application to MODIS imagery acquired during the February-March 2015 OUTPACE campaign reveals the presence of surface blooms northwest and east of New Caledonia and near 20 degrees S-172 degrees W in qualitative agreement with measured nitrogen fixation rates. Improving Trichodesmium detection requires measuring ocean color at higher spectral and spatial (< 250 m) resolution than MODIS, taking into account environment properties (e.g., wind, sea surface temperature), fluorescence, and spatial structure of filaments, and a better understanding of Trichodesmium dynamics, including aggregation processes to generate surface mats. Such sub-mesoscale aggregation processes for Trichodesmium are yet to be understood.

TI  - Brawls Bring Buzz: Male Size Influences Competition and Courtship in <i>Diadasia</i> <i>rinconis</i> (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sexual selection on male body size in species with a female-biased sexual size dimorphism is common yet often poorly understood. In particular, in the majority of bee species, the relative contribution of intrasexual competition and female choice to patterns of male body size is unknown. In this field study, we examined two possible components of male mating success with respect to body size in the solitary bee Diadasia rinconis Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Apidae): 1) ability to procure a mate and 2) the duration of copulation. We found that larger males were better able to procure mates and copulated for shorter periods of time. Although consistent with sperm competition theory, differences in copulation duration were slight; possibly, the shorter copulations of larger males instead reflect in copulo female choice. Consistent with this notion, males engaged in complex courtship while mounted, characterized for the first time in any bee in such detail via audio recordings and high-speed, high-definition video. The number of pulses in male courtship behavior was also positively associated with copulation duration and may have stimulated females to continue copulating, thereby potentially allowing smaller males to transfer a full ejaculate. Females were shown to be potentially polyandrous and although we did not observe precopulatory rejection in the field, captive females frequently rejected copulation attempts by captive males. Our work indicates that intrasexual competition selects for increased body size in a solitary bee.

TI  - Combining temporal 3-D remote sensing data with spatial rockfall simulations for improved understanding of hazardous slopes within rail corridors
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques can be used to gain a more detailed understanding of hazardous rock slopes along railway corridors that would otherwise be inaccessible. Multiple datasets can be used to identify changes over time, creating an inventory of events to produce magnitude-frequency relationships for rockfalls sourced on the slope. This study presents a method for using the remotely sensed data to develop inputs to rockfall simulations, including rockfall source locations and slope material parameters, which can be used to determine the likelihood of a rockfall impacting the railway tracks given its source zone location and volume. The results of the simulations can be related to the rockfall inventory to develop modified magnitude-frequency curves presenting a more realistic estimate of the hazard. These methods were developed using the RockyFor3D software and lidar and photogrammetry data collected over several years at White Canyon, British Columbia, Canada, where the Canadian National (CN) Rail main line runs along the base of the slope. Rockfalls sourced closer to the tracks were more likely to be deposited on the track or in the ditch, and of these, rockfalls between 0.1 and 10 m(3) were the most likely to be deposited. Smaller blocks did not travel far enough to reach the bottom of the slope and larger blocks were deposited past the tracks. Applying the results of the simulations to a database of over 2000 rockfall events, a modified magnitude-frequency can be created, allowing the frequency of rockfalls deposited on the railway tracks or in ditches to be determined. Suggestions are made for future development of the methods including refinement of input parameters and extension to other modelling packages.

TI  - Temporal-Scale Analysis of Environmental Controls on Sea Spray Aerosol Production Over the South Pacific Gyre
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of sea spray aerosol (SSA) production is needed to better assess its influence on climate. Using satellite data, we investigated the production of the coarse mode of aerosol optical depth (AOD(c)), a proxy for SSA, over the pristine South Pacific Gyre. The analysis was done on three time scales: daily, seasonal, and interannual. Scale-dependent links were shown between the AODc and wind speed (W). AOD(c) and W were positively correlated on both daily and interannual time scales but were significantly anticorrelated on the seasonal time scale. Seasonality of the AOD(c) - W link suggests contribution of other environmental factors. The main variable that could statistically explain trends in AODc on the seasonal time scale was chlorophyll a concentration, which showed a clear negative correlation with AODc. The AODc yield per W unit was clearly reduced when chlorophyll a concentration was high, suggesting a secondary, but important influence of marine biological activity on SSA production.Plain Language Summary In this study we conduct temporal-scale analysis on satellite data to explore the environmental factors that impact sea spray particles production. We focus on the South Pacific Ocean, which is a pristine marine environment and is characterized by low biological activity. The production of sea spray particles, that is wind-driven process, is shown to be affected by the state of the marine biological activity (detected best on a seasonal time scale). High biological activity is suggested as a secondary influence that suppresses particles' production. This discovery is important for estimates of marine particles' budgets and effects and will enable better representation of marine aerosols in climate models.

TI  - Recent Acceleration of a Rock Glacier Complex, adjet, Norway, Documented by 62 Years of Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent acceleration of rock glaciers is well recognized in the European Alps, but similar behavior is hardly documented elsewhere. Also, the controlling factors are not fully understood. Here we provide evidence for acceleration of a rock glacier complex in northern Norway, from 62 years of remote sensing data. Average annual horizontal velocity measured by aerial feature tracking increased from similar to 0.5 myr(-1) (1954-1977) to similar to 3.6 myr(-1) (2006-2014). Measured by satellite synthetic aperture radar offset-tracking, averages increased from similar to 4.9 to similar to 9.8 myr(-1) (2009-2016) and maximum velocities from similar to 12 to similar to 69 myr(-1). Kinematic analysis reveals different spatial-temporal trends in the upper and the lower parts of the rock glacier complex, suggesting progressive detachment of the faster front. We suggest that permafrost warming, topographic controls, and increased water access to deeper permafrost layers and internal shear zones can explain the kinematic behavior.Plain Language Summary Using remote sensing data we document unusual high surface displacement and accelerations on a rock glacier complex in a mountain hillside in northern Norway. Increasing creep rates have been reported from the European Alps, but an acceleration of this order has not been documented in Scandinavia before. Rock glaciers are permafrost landforms consisting of a mix of ice and debris. Using aerial photos, we document an acceleration from similar to 0.5 m per year (1954-1977) to similar to 3.6 m per year (2006-2014) for the lower parts of the rock glacier complex. For the same area, we observe an increase from similar to 4.9 to similar to 9.8 m per year, measured by satellite-based radar between 2009 and 2016. Maximum velocities increased from similar to 12 to similar to 69 m per year. Results suggest that the fast lower part is detaching from the slower upper part. Radar data delineate areas with subsidence and uplift, compression, and extension. Increase in temperature and precipitation during the 62-year period indicates possible permafrost degradation. Our work demonstrates the value of combining remote sensing data sources in documenting permafrost landforms in the Arctic. Important work still remains to document and understand their evolution and the effects of climate change.

TI  - Regional-scale management maps for forested areas of the Southeastern United States and the US Pacific Northwest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Forests in the United States are managed by multiple public and private entities making harmonization of available data and subsequent mapping of management challenging. We mapped four important types of forest management, production, ecological, passive, and preservation, at 250-meter spatial resolution in the Southeastern (SEUS) and Pacific Northwest (PNW) USA. Both ecologically and socio-economically dynamic regions, the SEUS and PNW forests represent, respectively, 22.0% and 10.4% of forests in the coterminous US. We built a random forest classifier using seasonal time-series analysis of 16 years of MODIS 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index, and ancillary data containing forest ownership, roads, US Forest Service wilderness and forestry areas, proportion conifer and proportion riparian. The map accuracies for SEUS are 89% (10-fold cross-validation) and 67% (external validation) and PNW are 91% and 70% respectively with the same validation. The now publicly available forest management maps, probability surfaces for each management class and uncertainty layer for each region can be viewed and analysed in commercial and open-source GIS and remote sensing software.

TI  - <i>Trissolcus hyalinipennis</i> Rajmohana & Narendran (Hymenoptera, Scelionidae), a parasitoid of <i>Bagrada hilaris</i> (Burmeister) (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae), emerges in North America
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Trissolcus hyalimpennis Rajmohana & Narendran is an Old World egg parasitoid of Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister). Its potential as a classical biological control agent in the United States has been under evaluation in quarantine facilities since 2014. A survey of resident egg parasitoids using fresh sentinel B. hilaris eggs in Riverside, California, revealed that T. hyalinipennis is present in the wild. Four cards with parasitized eggs were recovered, from which one yielded a single live T hyalinipennis and two unidentified dead wasps (Scelionidae), and three yielded twenty live Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) and one dead wasp. Subsequently, samples from Burbank, California, collected with a Malaise trap as part of the BioSCAN project, yielded five females of T. hyalinipennis. It is presumed that the introduction of T. hyalinipennis to this area was accidental. Surveys will be continued to evaluate the establishment of T. hyalinipennis as well as the presence of other resident parasitoid species.

TI  - Heterogeneity in topographic control on velocities of Western Himalayan glaciers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the seasonal and annual patterns of glacier velocities improve our understanding of the ice volume, topography, responses to climate change, and surge events of glaciers. Such studies are especially relevant and equally rare for the Himalayan glaciers, which supply many rivers that sustain some of the most heavily populated mountainous regions in the world. In particular, the control of the hypsometric distribution of geomorphometric parameters, such as slope, aspect, and curvature, on the dynamics of Himalayan glaciers have never been studied so far, at the river basin scale. Here, we present the degree to which topographic and hypsometric parameters affect the seasonal and annual average flow velocities of 112 glaciers in the Baspa River basin in the Western Indian Himalaya by analysing Global Land Ice Velocity Extraction from Landsat 8 (GoLIVE) datasets for the years 2013-2017. We observe, (i) significant heterogeneity in topographic controls on the velocities of these glaciers, (ii) elevation and the seasons play important roles in regulating the degree to which morphometric parameters (slope, aspect, and curvature) affect these velocities, (iii) a possible polythermal regime promoting both sliding and deformational forms of motion in a majority of these glaciers, and (iv) a detailed analysis of complex topographic controls within various elevation zones using a novel hypso-morphometric approach. These findings can help us to better model the dynamics of Himalayan glaciers and their responses to the future climatic scenarios. The inferences also suggest the need to incorporate dynamic topography in glacio-hydrological models in the wake of constant glacial evolutions.

TI  - Nighttime Mesospheric/Lower Thermospheric Tropical Ozone Response to the 27-Day Solar Rotational Cycle: ENVISAT-GOMOS Satellite Observation Versus HAMMONIA Idealized Chemistry-Climate Model Simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) satellite data are analyzed to estimate the first observation-based nighttime (22:00 median local time) ozone response to the 27-day solar rotational cycle in the tropical mesosphere/lower thermosphere (50-110 km altitude). The ozone response to solar rotational variability is derived from linear correlation and regressions using Lyman-a line (121.6 nm) as solar index that varies by about 10-15% over solar rotational cycles. In the lower mesosphere (50-70 km), the GOMOS ozone is found to be correlated with the solar fluctuations and exhibits a sensitivity of similar to 0.1 (expressed in percent change of ozone for 1% change in Lyman-alpha). In the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere (above 80 km), ozone variations become anticorrelated with solar rotational variations. In this region, the vertical profile of ozone sensitivity to the 27-day solar cycle exhibits a maximum of 1.8 at 81 km, a minimum of 0.3 at 100 km, and a sharp increase above. Such high ozone sensitivities are observed for the first time. The observed ozone response is compared with chemistry-climate simulations from the Hamburg model of the neutral and ionized atmosphere (HAMMONIA) that is forced with an idealized 27-day solar spectral irradiance time series. Although observational and model results share some common features, substantial discrepancies are found. Namely, the altitude of transition from positive to negative solar ozone correlation signal in the model simulation is found about 10 km below the altitude of the observations and the amplitude of the ozone sensitivity is generally vastly underestimated by the model.

TI  - Unseen Dust Emission and Global Dust Abundance: Documenting Dust Emission from the Mojave Desert (USA) by Daily Remote Camera Imagery and Wind-Erosion Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A large gap in understanding the effects of atmospheric dust at all spatial scales is uncertainty about how much and whence dust is emitted annually. Direct digital recording of dust emission at high spatial and temporal resolution would together with periodic flux measurements support improved estimates of local-scale dust flux. Remote camera recording of dust-emitting settings on and around Soda Lake (Mojave Desert) was conducted every 15 min during daylight between 10 November 2010 and 31 December 2016. Examination of 135,000 images revealed frequent dust events characterized as dust days, 68 per year on average, when dust plumes obscured mountains beyond areas of dust generation. Dust was not observed from examination of satellite retrievals (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite System) during six cloudless days of extreme emission. Estimated masses of emitted dust fractions were made from measured horizontal mass flux, sediment particle sizes, and areas of dust generation. Between April 2000 and June 2013, nearly 4 Tg/year of dust (particles < 63 mu m) were emitted across the study area. Higher rates (about 7 Tg/year) were estimated following the December 2010 Mojave River flood that deposited sediment across the lake basin. Within the Mojave and Great Basin deserts of western North America, many settings akin to those at Soda Lake similarly emit dust that is rarely detected in satellite retrievals, implying that local and regional dust emissions from western North America are far underestimated and that, by extension to relatively small dust-source areas across all drylands, global dust emissions may also be greatly underestimated.Plain Language Summary Small mineral particles in the air (atmospheric dust) affect many aspects of human and other environments-air quality and public health, delivery of nutrients across wide swaths of ocean and land, melting of snow and ice, and air temperature where and when dust plumes move across the globe. We cannot fully understand these effects until we know better how much dust is emitted from the land surface each year and the locations of dust-source areas where strong winds loft it into the atmosphere. Mostly from measurements and images from satellites, current ways to detect dust and estimate the annual mass of global dust can sense large emissions from dust storms (most global emission estimates are 1000-4000 million metric tons per year), but they likely miss the full ranges of places and amounts of such emission. To examine how much dust might go unseen and uncounted by satellite methods, we installed a remote camera to visually record dust emission from a small dust-source area, Soda Lake in the Mojave Desert, California. Images were taken every 15 min during daylight between 10 November 2010 and 31 December 2016, yielding 135,000 images. Dust emission was seen in the images during nearly 20% of days. Dust was never observed, however, from examination of satellite images at simultaneous periods of large dust storms seen from the ground. From periodic weighing of dust collected on the ground between April 2000 and June 2013 and an estimate of the area of dust generation, we roughly calculated the masses of emitted dust to be between 4 and 7 million metric tons of dust each year. Within the Mojave and Great Basin deserts of western North America, hundreds of settings akin to those around Soda Lake emit dust that is rarely detected by satellite, strongly implying that local and regional dust emissions from western North America are far underestimated and that, by extension to relatively small dust-source areas across all drylands, global dust emissions are probably greatly underestimated.

TI  - Evaluating Diffferent Machine Learning Methods for Upscaling Evapotranspiration from Flux Towers to the Regional Scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a vital variable for land-atmosphere interactions that links surface energy balance, water, and carbon cycles. The in situ techniques can measure ET accurately but the observations have limited spatial and temporal coverage. Modeling approaches have been used to estimate ET at broad spatial and temporal scales, while accurately simulating ET at regional scales remains a major challenge. In this study, we upscale ET from eddy covariance flux tower sites to the regional scale with machine learning algorithms. Five machine learning algorithms are employed for ET upscaling including artificial neural network, Cubist, deep belief network, random forest, and support vector machine. The machine learning methods are trained and tested at 36 flux towers sites (65 site years) across the Heihe River Basin and are then applied to estimate ET for each grid cell (1 km x 1 km) within the watershed and for each day over the period 2012-2016. The artificial neural network, Cubist, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms have almost identical performance in estimating ET and have slightly lower root-mean-square error than deep belief network at the site scale. The random forest algorithm has slightly lower relative uncertainty at the regional scale than other methods based on three-cornered hat method. Additionally, the machine learning methods perform better over densely vegetated conditions than barren land or sparsely vegetated conditions. The regional ET generated from the machine learning approaches captured the spatial and temporal patterns of ET at the regional scale.

TI  - Under What Conditions Can We Trust Retrieved Cloud Drop Concentrations in Broken Marine Stratocumulus?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we show how to obtain more reliable satellite-retrieved cloud drop number concentrations (N-d) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard cloud products. N-d is important as a fundamental cloud property that determines cloud albedo, precipitation-forming processes, cloud longevity, and fractional cover, all of which determine cloud radiative effects. N-d is determined by cloud base aerosols and updrafts. Satellite retrievals of N-d for marine stratocumulus clouds are performed based on the assumption of a nearly adiabatic cloud column. The retrievals, however, are fraught with problems that cause large biases (e.g., the retrieved N-d for partially filled cloudy pixels are less than one third of the retrieved N-d for the convective cores) and limit the usefulness of N-d, especially in broken cloud fields. The N-d of the brightest 10% of cloudy pixels are selected because the brightest clouds are the convective cores that most closely follow adiabatic parcels, a key assumption of our retrieval. It is shown that this criterion is representative of pixels that are also fully surrounded by cloudy pixels (N-d agreement within 5%).

TI  - Measurement of Land Damage Based on Active and Passive Remote Sensing in Wuhai Mining Area
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of coal resources is moving toward the west China acceleratively,, which aggravate the land damage in northwest mining area. Considering the traditional monitoring methods can hardly achieve the goal of overall diagnosis of land damage, Wuhai mining area was taken as study area and a model for measuring the land damage in mining area was proposed. The model mainly combined the functions of land structure damage and function damage. Landsat TM/OLI images, Sentinel-1A SAR images, 3S technology and InSAR technology are used to extract the model's critical parameters such as vegetation damage index, ground deformation index, land cover, etc. The results show that the spatial distribution of land damage is featured by attenuation around the mining working face. 42. 36 km(2) of land has high land damage value between 4. 5 and 8. 0, accounting for 2. 68% of the total area. 544. 21 km(2) of land has moderate land damage value, accounting for 34. 43%, while 994. 02 km(2) of land is non-damage area, accounting for 62. 89%. The measurement of land damage can refine the design of environmental restoration and provide reference for the land consolidation and restoration of Wuhai mining area.

TI  - Not again! Effect of previous test results, age group and reason for testing on (re-) infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in Germany
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in Europe. In Germany, Ct screening is offered free of charge to pregnant women since 1995 and to women < 25 years of age since 2008. For symptomatic individuals, testing is covered by statutory health insurance. Study results have shown that repeat Ct infection occurs in 10-20% of previously infected women and men. Our aim was to describe persons tested for Ct and to investigate the determinants of (repeat) Ct infection in women and men in Germany.Methods: We analysed Ct test results from men and women tested between 2008 and 2014 in laboratories participating in the German Chlamydia trachomatis Laboratory Sentinel surveillance. Reinfection was defined as at least 2 positive laboratory tests within more than 30 days. We performed logistic regression stratified by sex and, for women, reason for testing to determine the effect of previous test results and age group on subsequent test results.Results: In total, 2,574,635 Ct tests could be attributed to 1,815,494 women and 123,033 men. 5% of women and 14% of men tested positive at least once. 15-19- and 20-24-year-old women tested positive at least once respectively in 6.8 and 6.0%, while men respectively in 16.6 and 21.2%. Altogether, 23.1% of tested women and 11.9% of tested men were tested repeatedly between 2008 and 2014. Among those who previously tested positive, reinfection occurred in 2.0% of women and 6.6% of men. Likelihood to be tested Ct positive was higher in women and men with a positive Ct test in the past compared to previously tested Ct negative, odds ratios 4.7 and 2.6 (p < 0.01) respectively. Odds ratios ranged by age group and test reason.Conclusion: A history of Ct infection increased the likelihood of infection with Ct in women and men taking into account the result of the previous test. Health education, safer sex and treatment of partners are necessary for women and men who have tested positive to prevent reinfection and complications and to interrupt the chain of transmission. To identify potential reinfection repeat testing after treatment should be performed.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Vegetation and Dominant Factors in "Energy Golden Triangle" Region Based on Geographically Weighted Regression Model
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Energy Golden Triangle" area provides abundant energy for China, and its surface vegetation condition is closely related to the ecological restoration and reconstruction. The dynamic change of vegetation of the border regions of the three provincial areas (Ningxia, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia) from 2005 to 2015 was studied with the aid of a pixel-by-pixel trend analysis method using RS and GIS technology and taking the normalized vegetation index product ( MODIS NDVI) as the data source. Geo-weighted regression model is constructed based on a regular grid to explore the effect of 7 factors ( elevation, slope, soil clay content, multi-year mean temperature, year average precipitation, distance to coal mine area and distance to road) on vegetation change and its spatial nonstationarity. The results show that the annual average of NDVI of the research area displayed a fluctuating upward trend with a linear tendency being 0. 083 . (10 a) (-1) (P<0. 05) during 2005-2015. As for spatial distribution, NDVI showed a decreasing trend from southeast to the northwest. The area with improved NDVI is larger than the degraded area, and accounting for 27. 11% and 0. 64% of the total study area, respectively. The significant rising area is mainly distributed in the eastern part of Yulin City. NDVI decreased significantly in the whole area, and had stronger spatial clustering (Moran's I is 0. 851) from 2013 to 2015, but the degree of variation was spatially heterogeneous, compared with that of 2005 to 2012 years. The change of vegetation in the two periods (2005-2012 and 2012-2015) of the whole region is greatly affected by the natural factors such as climate and so on. The main factors affecting vegetation change are different in time and space. Human activities have double effects on vegetation change.

TI  - A general approach to incorporating spatial and temporal variation in individual-based models of fish populations with application to Atlantic mackerel
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fish population dynamics are affected by multiple ecosystem drivers, such as food-web interactions, exploitation, density-dependence and the wider environment. While tactical management is still dominated by single-species models that do not explicitly account for these drivers, more holistic ecosystem models are used in strategic management. One way forward in this regard is with individual-based models (IBMs), which provide a single framework in which these drivers can be represented explicitly. We present a generic marine fish IBM that incorporates spatial and temporal variation in food availability, temperature and exploitation. Key features of the model are that it (1) includes realistic energy budgets; (2) includes the full life cycle of fish; (3) is spatially-explicit and (4) incorporates satellite remote-sensing data to represent the environmental drivers. The rates at which individuals acquire and use energy depend on local food availability and temperature. Their state variables, including life stage, size and energy reserves, are updated daily, from which population structure and dynamics emerge. To demonstrate the use of the model we calibrate it for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North East Atlantic. Most parameters are taken from the literature, except the background early mortality rate and the strength predator density dependence, which were estimated by fitting the model to data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The calibrated model successfully matches the available data on mackerel population dynamics and structure. We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating the population effects of opening and closing a sector of the North Sea to mackerel fishing. Our model uses basic principles of behavioural and physiological ecology to establish how spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem drivers affect the individuals in the population. Population dynamics and structure are calculated from the collective effects on individuals. Application to a test case shows the method can fit available data well. Individual-based approaches such as this study have potential for use in strategic management because they can account for spatial structuring, food-web interactions, density dependence, and environmental drivers within a single framework.

TI  - Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in an Asymptomatic Child, Sibling, and Symptomatic Pregnant Mother in New York City by Tuberculin Skin Testing and the Importance of Screening High-Risk Urban Populations for Tuberculosis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Challenging differential diagnosisBackground: In 2017, in New York City (NYC), 86% of the cases of tuberculosis (TB) occurred in patients who were born outside the United States (US). This case report illustrates the importance of the use of the tuberculin skin test (TST), and other tests for TB infection (TTBI), in screening high-risk groups, the challenges of diagnosing TB in young children, and highlights the importance of preventing a delay in the diagnosis of TB in family members.Case Report: Following a routine TST in an asymptomatic 10-year-old girl, a diagnosis of TB was made, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (CXR) and by the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the sputum. Her family had emigrated from China to NYC ten years previously. All the family was screened using the TST, which was positive in her 2-year-old sister and her 37-year-old pregnant mother, and pulmonary TB was confirmed on CXR and by AFBs in the sputum. All three family members and the newborn baby were treated according to current guidelines, with a good clinical outcome.Conclusions: This case report raises awareness about the lack of symptoms in childhood TB and the importance of screening high-risk patients in an urban immigrant population. In children under 5 years of age, a diagnosis of TB can indicate a sentinel event, suggesting a potential undiagnosed or untreated source case, which is usually an adult family member. This report highlights the challenges of diagnosing TB in children, who may be asymptomatic with negative laboratory findings.

TI  - Modification of 6SV to remove skylight reflected at the air-water interface: Application to atmospheric correction of Landsat 8 OLI imagery in inland waters
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data in inland waters, the original Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-Vector version (6SV) model does not eliminate the specular reflection of downward skylight radiance at the air-water interface. Thus, we propose a modified version of the 6SV model (M6SV) that does remove reflected skylight at the air-water interface. We apply the new model to the atmospheric correction of a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image over Taihu Lake, China, where the aerosol optical depth is known. In situ reflectance measurements acquired concurrently with the L8/OLI image are used to validate the performance of the new M6SV algorithm. To further analyze the merits and demerits of M6SV, the model is compared with two short-wave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction models: the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor Data Analysis System short-wave infrared (SD-SWIR) model and the Vanhellemont & Ruddick short-wave infrared with a per scene fixed aerosol type (VR-SWIR-F) model. Comparisons of results from all three L8/OLI image atmospheric corrections with the in situ remote sensing reflectance data show that M6SV produces reliable atmospheric corrections in the green and red spectral bands and is an effective alternative for Landsat 8 OLI atmospheric correction in inland waters.

TI  - The impact of drought on vegetation conditions within the Damqu River Basin, Yangtze River Source Region, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought and vegetation conditions within the Damqu River Basin, part of the Yangtze River Source Region (YRSR), are assessed here using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the leaf area index (LAI). We utilized Sen's method, least squares regression method, linear regression and Pearson's correlation analysis to study variations in drought and vegetation indices and the drought effect on vegetation between 1988 and 2015. Results reveal that droughts occurred at a 25% frequency over this period; SPI and SPEI analyses show that 1994, 1999, 2005, and 2010 were change points and that the basin was characterized by varying drought and humidity trends. Subsequent to 2010, both SPI and SPEI decreased within the basin, while 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2010 were change points for NDVI and LAI while the watershed exhibited variable trends in vegetation reduction and increase. The NDVI-annual values of 63.36% regions and the LAI-summer values of 68.39% areas within the basin were decreased during 1988 +/- 2015 and 2000 +/- 2015, respectively. Subsequent to 2010, both NDVI and LAI decreased within the basin and significant positive correlations at inter-annual and inter-summer time scales were seen in both drought and vegetation indices; drought has exerted a lag effect on vegetation as shown by significant positive correlations between annual SPI/SPEI values and following year NDVI/LAI values.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node B cells can predict disease-free survival in breast cancer patients
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor invasion into draining lymph nodes, especially sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), is a key determinant of prognosis and treatment in breast cancer as part of the TNM staging system. Using multicolor histology and quantitative image analysis, we quantified immune cells within SLNs from a discovery cohort of 76 breast cancer patients. We found statistically more in situ CD3(+) T cells in tumor negative vs. tumor positive nodes (mean of 8878 vs. 6704, respectively, p = 0.006), but no statistical difference in CD20(+) B cells or CD1a(+) dendritic cells. In univariate analysis, a reduced hazard was seen with a unit increase in log CD3 with HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.30-0.80) and log CD20 with HR 0.37 (95% CI 0.22-0.62). In multivariate analysis, log CD20 remained significant with HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.25-0.69). When restricted to SLN tumor negative patients, increased log CD20 was still associated with improved DFS (HR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.90). The CD20 results were validated in a separate cohort of 21 patients (n = 11 good outcome, n = 10 poor outcome) with SLN negative triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) ("good" mean of 7011 vs. "poor" mean of 4656, p = 0.002). Our study demonstrates that analysis of immune cells within SLNs, regardless of tumor invasion status, may provide additional prognostic information, and highlights B cells within SLNs as important in preventing future recurrence.

TI  - [Prognosis and risk factors of 1 791 patients with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery based on real-world data].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the overall efficacy of early breast cancer after breast-conserving treatment. To analyze risk factors affecting local regional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM) and survival. Methods: 1 791 breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The inclusion criteria were pathologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer without supraclavicular and internal mammary node metastasis, T1-2N0-3M0, and no neoadjuvant therapy. Univariate analysis of survival was performed by Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: The median follow-up time was 4.2 years. For all patients, the 5-year LRR, DM, disease-free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS) rates were 3.6%, 4.6%, 93.0% and 97.4%, respectively. The LRR rates of patients with Luminal A, Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER-2 over-expressed and triple-negative breast cancer were 2.0%, 6.1%, 5.9%, 0 and 10.0%, while the DM rates were 3.2%, 6.7%, 8.3%, 4.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Among the N0 patients, axillary dissection was performed in 689 cases and sentinel lymph node biopsy in 652 cases. The 5-year LRR rates were 3.3% and 3.2% (P=0.859), and the OS rates were 98.2% and 98.3% (P=0.311) respectively, which showed no statistically significant. There were 1 576 patients that underwent postoperative radiotherapy. Postoperative radiotherapy significantly reduced the 5-year LRR compared with surgery alone (2.5% vs 12.9%). The 5-year LRR rates of patients who received conventional fractionated radiotherapy and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy were 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively. But the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.870). Multivariate analysis showed that age, lymphovascular invasion, pathological T staging, postoperative radiotherapy, ER/PR status and endocrine therapy were independent factors of LRR in breast cancer patients (all P<0.05). Histological grade and pathological N staging were independent factors of DM (all P<0.05). The age, lymphovascular invasion, pathological T and N staging, postoperative radiotherapy, ER/PR status and endocrine therapy were independent factors for DFS (all P<0.05). Histological grade, pathological N staging, ER/PR status and endocrine therapy were factors for OS (all P<0.05). Conclusions: With contemporary standard treatment, the recurrence rate of early breast cancer after breast conserving treatment is less than 10%. Node-negative patients after sentinel lymph node biopsy did not need axillary dissection. The overall utilization of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery is satisfactory. Hypofractionated radiotherapy is as effective as conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Local regional recurrence and distant metastasis have different risk factors.
AB  - 目的： 总结早期乳腺癌经过保乳治疗的总体疗效，分析并探讨局部区域复发(LRR)、远处转移(DM)和患者生存的影响因素。 方法： 回顾性分析1 791例病理分期为pT1～2N0～3，无锁骨上、内乳淋巴结转移及DM，经保乳治疗而未行新辅助治疗的乳腺浸润性癌患者的临床资料。生存分析的单因素分析采用Kaplan－Meier法和Log rank检验，多因素分析采用Cox回归模型。 结果： 全组患者中位随访4.2年，5年LRR率、DM率、无病生存(DFS)率和总生存(OS)率分别为3.6%、4.6%、93.0%和97.4%。Luminal A型、Luminal B1型、Luminal B2型、HER－2过表达型和三阴型乳腺癌患者的5年LRR率分别为2.0%、6.1%、5.9%、0和10.0%，5年DM率分别为3.2%、6.7%、8.3%、4.8%和7.3%。术后病理N0患者中，689例行腋窝清扫术，652例行前哨淋巴结活检术。5年LRR率分别为3.3%和3.2%，5年OS率分别为98.2%和98.3%，差异均无统计学意义(P值分别为0.859和0.311)。1 576例患者行术后放疗，其5年LRR率较单纯手术患者显著降低(2.5%和12.9%)。常规分割放疗组和大分割放疗组患者的5年LRR率分别为2.7%和3.1%，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.870)。多因素Cox回归分析显示，患者年龄、脉管瘤栓情况、病理T分期、术后放疗、ER或PR状态与内分泌治疗是乳腺癌患者LRR的独立影响因素(均P<0.05)，组织学分级、病理N分期是乳腺癌患者DM的独立影响因素(均P<0.05)，患者年龄、脉管瘤栓情况、病理T分期和N分期、术后放疗、ER或PR状态与内分泌治疗情况是乳腺癌患者DFS的独立影响因素(均P<0.05)，组织学分级、病理N分期、ER或PR状态与内分泌治疗是乳腺癌患者OS的独立影响因素(均P<0.05)。 结论： 在标准治疗的基础上，保乳治疗后乳腺癌的10年LRR率不到10%。前哨淋巴结活检阴性者不必行腋窝淋巴结清扫。保乳术后放疗使用率较高，大分割放疗与常规分割放疗疗效无差别。乳腺癌保乳治疗后LRR和DM具有不同的高危因素。.

TI  - Global fatal landslide occurrence from 2004 to 2016
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a ubiquitous hazard in terrestrial environments with slopes, incurring human fatalities in urban settlements, along transport corridors and at sites of rural industry. Assessment of landslide risk requires high-quality landslide databases. Recently, global landslide databases have shown the extent to which landslides impact on society and identified areas most at risk. Previous global analysis has focused on rainfall-triggered landslides over short similar to 5-year observation periods. This paper presents spatiotemporal analysis of a global dataset of fatal non-seismic landslides, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2016. The data show that in total 55 997 people were killed in 4862 distinct landslide events. The spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous, with Asia representing the dominant geographical area. There are high levels of interannual variation in the occurrence of landslides. Although more active years coincide with recognised patterns of regional rainfall driven by climate anomalies, climate modes (such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation) cannot yet be related to landsliding, requiring a landslide dataset of 30+ years. Our analysis demonstrates that landslide occurrence triggered by human activity is increasing, in particular in relation to construction, illegal mining and hill cutting. This supports notions that human disturbance may be more detrimental to future landslide incidence than climate.

TI  - Experience of the signaller explains the use of social versus personal information in the context of sentinel behaviour in meerkats
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To maximise foraging opportunities while simultaneously avoiding predation, group-living animals can obtain personal information on food availability and predation risk and/or rely on social information provided by group members. Although mainly associated with low costs of information acquisition, social information has the potential to be irrelevant or inaccurate. In this study we use playbacks of individually distinct sentinel calming calls produced during sentinel behaviour, a form of coordinated vigilance behaviour, to show that meerkats (Suricata suricatta) discriminate between social information provided by different sentinels and adjust their personal vigilance behaviour according to the individual that is played back. We found that foraging group members acquired the lowest amounts of personal information when hearing social information provided by experienced individuals that act as sentinels most often in their group and littermates. Our study shows that social information can be flexibly used in the context of sentinel behaviour in order to optimize the trade-off between foraging and vigilance behaviours dependent on discrimination among signallers. We also provide novel evidence that the experience of sentinels rather than their age or dominance status is the main factor affecting the extent to which individuals use social information.

TI  - Scale dependence of cirrus heterogeneity effects. Part II: MODIS NIR and SWIR channels
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a context of global climate change, the understanding of the radiative role of clouds is crucial. On average, ice clouds such as cirrus have a significant positive radiative effect, but under some conditions the effect may be negative. However, many uncertainties remain regarding the role of ice clouds on Earth's radiative budget and in a changing climate. Global satellite observations are particularly well suited to monitoring clouds, retrieving their characteristics and inferring their radiative impact. To retrieve ice cloud properties (optical thickness and ice crystal effective size), current operational algorithms assume that each pixel of the observed scene is plane-parallel and homogeneous, and that there is no radiative connection between neighboring pixels. Yet these retrieval assumptions are far from accurate, as real radiative transfer is 3-D. This leads to the plane-parallel and homogeneous bias (PPHB) plus the independent pixel approximation bias (IPAB), which impacts both the estimation of top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiation and the retrievals. An important factor that determines the impact of these assumptions is the sensor spatial resolution. High-spatial-resolution pixels can better represent cloud variability (low PPHB), but the radiative path through the cloud can involve many pixels (high IPAB). In contrast, low-spatial-resolution pixels poorly represent the cloud variability (high PPHB), but the radiation is better contained within the pixel field of view (low IPAB). In addition, the solar and viewing geometry (as well as cloud optical properties) can modulate the magnitude of the PPHB and IPAB. In this, Part II of our study, we simulate TOA 0.86 and 2.13 mu m solar reflectances over a cirrus uncinus scene produced by the 3DCLOUD model. Then, 3-D radiative transfer simulations are performed with the 3DMCPOL code at spatial resolutions ranging from 50m to 10 km, for 12 viewing geometries and nine solar geometries. It is found that, for simulated nadir observations taken at resolution higher than 2.5 km, horizontal radiation transport (HRT) dominates biases between 3-D and 1-D reflectance calculations, but these biases are mitigated by the side illumination and shadowing effects for off-zenith solar geometries. At resolutions coarser than 2.5 km, PPHB dominates. For off-nadir observations at resolutions higher than 2.5 km, the effect that we call THEAB (tilted and homogeneous extinction approximation bias) due to the oblique line of sight passing through many cloud columns contributes to a large increase of the reflectances, but 3-D radiative effects such as shadowing and side illumination for oblique Sun are also important. At resolutions coarser than 2.5 km, the PPHB is again the dominant effect. The magnitude and resolution dependence of PPHB and IPAB is very different for visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared channels compared with the thermal infrared channels discussed in Part I of this study. The contrast of 3-D radiative effects between solar and thermal infrared channels may be a significant issue for retrieval techniques that simultaneously use radiative measurements across a wide range of solar reflectance and infrared wavelengths.

TI  - Landscape drivers of recent fire activity (2001-2017) in south-central Chile
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades large fires have affected communities throughout central and southern Chile with great social and ecological consequences. Despite this high fire activity, the controls and drivers and the spatiotemporal pattern of fires are not well understood. To identify the large-scale trends and drivers of recent fire activity across six regions in south-central Chile (similar to 32 +/- 40 E S Latitude) we evaluated MODIS satellite-derived fire detections and compared this data with Chilean Forest Service records for the period 2001 +/- 2017. MODIS burned area estimates provide a spatially and temporally comprehensive record of fire activity across an important bioclimatic transition zone between dry Mediterranean shrublands/ sclerophyllous forests and wetter deciduous-broadleaf evergreen forests. Results suggest fire activity was highly variable in any given year, with no statistically significant trend in the number of fires or mean annual area burned. Evaluation of the variables associated with spatiotemporal patterns of fire for the 2001 +/- 2017 period indicate vegetation type, biophysical conditions (e. g., elevation, slope), mean annual and seasonal climatic conditions (e. g., precipitation) and mean population density have the greatest influence on the probability of fire occurrence and burned area for any given year. Both the number of fires and annual area burned were greatest in warmer, biomass-rich lowland B oA o-B oA o and Araucan oA a regions. Resource selection analyses indicate fire 'preferentially' occurs in exotic plantation forests, mixed native-exotic forests, native sclerophyll forests, pasture lands and matorral, vegetation types that all provide abundant, flammable and connected biomass for burning. Structurally and compositionally homogenous exotic plantation forests may promote fire spread greater than native deciduous-Nothofagaceae forests which were once widespread in the southern parts of the study area. In the future, the coincidence of warmer and drier conditions in landscapes dominated by flammable and fuel-rich forest plantations and mixed nativeexotic and sclerophyll forests are likely to further promote large fires in south-central Chile.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node fluorescence detection during robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in early endometrial cancer: a prospective case series
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the last few decades, the introduction of technologies such as single-site surgery, robotics, and sentinel lymph node detection has reduced invasiveness in the treatment and staging of endometrial cancer patients. The goal of the present prospective cohort study is to evaluate the feasibility of lymph node fluorescence detection with robotic single-site approach in low-risk endometrial cancer.Results: Fifteen non consecutive low-risk endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH) patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and total hysterectomy utilizing the Da Vinci Si Single-Site Surgical. System and Firefly 3D imaging. Indications for surgery included eight (53.3%) IA FIGO stage G1 EC, three (20%) IA FIGO stage G2 EC, and four (26.6%) EAH. Mean operative time was 155 min (range 112-175). One vaginal laceration was the only perioperative complication encountered, and all patients were discharged within 48 h of surgery. SLN was detected in 86.6% of cases; 1/29 (3.4%) SLN results were positive for isolated tumor cells (ITCs) at immunohistochemical analysis.Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of robotic single-site approach with SLN fluorescence detection for the staging of low-risk endometrial cancer.

This study used satellite and field data to obtain annual estimates of Lake Chapala's area and water volume from 1973 to 2009, as well as water intakes from 1934 to 2013. Twenty-one Landsat images (multispectral scanner system, 2, 5, and 7) for the period of 1973 to 2009 were processed. Gap filling correction was applied to Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus scan line corrector-off images. Binary water/no-water segmentation was obtained with a Markov random field model using the normalized difference water index. An area-based model was developed to calculate water volume, which used the lake's area estimated based on the images as well as an exponential function obtained from area-elevation curves. Three of the resulting water/no-water layers were validated against reference points taken from aerial photography. Overall accuracies of 77% to 90% were obtained. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 resulted when comparing the results from using remote sensing to calculate water volume against field measurements. Given the observed reduction in volume, we concluded that it will be difficult to continue to use the lake as the main source of freshwater for the Guadalajara metropolitan area without substantial interventions.

TI  - Conflicts Between Humans and Terrestrial Vertebrates: A Global Review
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Conflicts between human beings and wild animals have been recorded in many parts of the world and mainly involve damage to crops, predation of domestic animals, and attacks on humans. This study presents, by means of a literature review, a worldview of such conflicts and their implications. The results found 262 species of terrestrial vertebrates recorded in conflicts with humans, of which 53 are included in the list of threatened species. The results indicated that damage to agricultural crops and attacks on domestic animals are the most common factors of conflicts and that socioeconomic factors seem to be correlated with their incidence. Studies aimed at finding more efficient ways to reduce conflicts and lessen the impact on animal populations are relevant to the search for a more peaceful coexistence between humans and wild animals.

TI  - Implementation of a simple thermodynamic sea ice scheme, SICE version 1.0-38h1, within the ALADIN-HIRLAM numerical weather prediction system version 38h1
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is an important factor affecting weather regimes, especially in polar regions. A lack of its representation in numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems leads to large errors. For example, in the HARMONIE-AROME model configuration of the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system, the mean absolute error in 2 m temperature reaches 1.5 degrees C after 15 forecast hours for Svalbard. A possible reason for this is that the sea ice properties are not reproduced correctly (there is no prognostic sea ice temperature in the model). Here, we develop a new simple sea ice scheme (SICE) and implement it in the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system in order to improve the forecast quality in areas influenced by sea ice. The new parameterization is evaluated using HARMONIE-AROME experiments covering the Svalbard and Gulf of Bothnia areas for a selected period in March-April 2013. It is found that using the SICE scheme improves the forecast, decreasing the value of the 2 m temperature mean absolute error on average by 0.5 degrees C in areas that are influenced by sea ice. The new scheme is sensitive to the representation of the form drag. The 10 m wind speed bias increases on average by 0.4 m s(-1) when the form drag is not taken into account. Also, the performance of SICE in March-April 2013 and December 2015-December 2016 was studied by comparing modelling results with the sea ice surface temperature products from MODIS and VIIRS. The warm bias (of approximately 5 degrees C) of the new scheme is indicated for areas of thick ice in the Arctic. Impacts of the SICE scheme on the modelling results and possibilities for future improvement of sea ice representation in the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system are discussed.

TI  - Extreme levels of Canadian wildfire smoke in the stratosphere over central Europe on 21-22 August 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light extinction coefficients of 500 Mm(-1), about 20 times higher than after the Pinatubo volcanic eruptions in 1991, were observed by European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) lidars in the stratosphere over central Europe on 21-22 August 2017. Pronounced smoke layers with a 1-2 km vertical extent were found 2-5 km above the local tropopause. Optically dense layers of Canadian wildfire smoke reached central Europe 10 days after their injection into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere which was caused by rather strong pyrocumulonimbus activity over western Canada. The smoke-related aerosol optical thickness (AOT) identified by lidar was close to 1.0 at 532 nm over Leipzig during the noon hours on 22 August 2017. Smoke particles were found throughout the free troposphere (AOT of 0.3) and in the pronounced 2 km thick stratospheric smoke layer at an altitude of 14-16 km (AOT of 0.6). The lidar observations indicated peak mass concentrations of 70-100 mu g m(-3) in the stratosphere. In addition to the lidar profiles, we analyzed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire radiative power (FRP) over Canada, and the distribution of MODIS AOT and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol index across the North Atlantic. These instruments showed a similar pattern and a clear link between the western Canadian fires and the aerosol load over Europe. In this paper, we also present Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer observations, compare photometer and lidar-derived AOT, and discuss an obvious bias (the smoke AOT is too low) in the photometer observations. Finally, we compare the strength of this record-breaking smoke event (in terms of the particle extinction coefficient and AOT) with major and moderate volcanic events observed over the northern midlatitudes.

TI  - Impact of cyclonic eddies and typhoons on biogeochemistry in the oligotrophic ocean based on biogeochemical/physical/meteorological time-series at station KEO
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, a sediment trap mooring was deployed adjacent to station Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO)'s National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) surface mooring. These data, from July 2014 to July 2016, are used here to investigate nutrient supply mechanisms that support ocean productivity in this oligotrophic region of the subtropical western North Pacific. Both years of sediment trap data show that biogenic material fluxes at similar to 5000 m increased between late winter (March) and late spring (June). Based on sea surface temperature and upper ocean water temperature profiles, from the NOAA surface buoy, and satellite-based surface chlorophyll-alpha, this increase was likely due to an increase of ocean productivity in early spring (March) that was supported by nutrients supplied by winter mixing. On the other hand, biogenic material fluxes also increased in October 2014, and between late December 2014 and January 2015 when concentrations of nutrients near the surface typically are low. Sea surface height anomalies and vertical profiles of water temperature in the upper 500 m showed cyclonic eddies passing station KEO and causing upwelling in late July-early August 2014 and November 2014. It appears that these events supplied nutrients to the upper layer, which then caused ocean productivity in the subsurface layer to temporally increase, resulting in increased deep biogenic material fluxes in autumn and winter. This interpretation of the data is consistent with a simple 3D physical- biological model simulation that shows meso-scale cyclonic eddies can supply nutrient to support new production at KEO. During the 2-year-long sediment trap deployments, several typhoons also passed near station KEO and near-inertial internal waves were observed near the nitracline depth after the typhoons passed. Although turbulent mixing caused by near-inertial internal wave could have possibly supplied nutrient to upper oligotrophic euphotic layer, numerical simulations of the turbulent nutrient supply indicate that enhanced turbulent diffusion across the nutrient concentration gradient did not supply enough nitrate to support the increase in biogenic material flux in autumn.

TI  - Modification of harmonic analysis model for diurnal surface soil heat flux estimate from multiple remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional surface soil heat flux (G(0)) is very important for the large-scale land surface process modeling, and particularly for the regional evapotranspiration estimation. Harmonic analysis method (HM) could obtain regional G(0) using remote sensing data. However, it has been demonstrated that HM cannot work well during nighttime due to the nonharmonic nature of G(0). Encouraged by the half-order method (HO), which can resolve nonharmonic series, this study combined the two methods of HM and HO in order to obtain an accurate estimation of G(0) for full day. The combined method was assessed with in-situ measurements and was applied to the Heihe River Basin (HRB) of northwest China using multiremote sensing observations at 30-min intervals. The below-canopy soil surface temperature (T-s) is one of the key variables in the model, which can be estimated from canopy temperature (T-e). The relationship of T-e and T-s was discussed. Results show that the nighttime G(0) improves with coefficient of determination (R-2) from 0.17 to 0.66 by HO method over maize and from 0.09 to 0.81 over grassland, and root mean square error decreases from 24.5 to 16.6 W m(-2), 16.1 to 8.68 W m(-2) over maize and grassland, respectively. Regional G(0) for bare soil is larger than the vegetation surface, and values in the middle reach area of HRB are generally higher than the upper reach area because of larger fractional vegetation cover in the upper reach. For maize, grassland, and vegetable surfaces (all are dense vegetation in July in this study), the combined method performed better when using T-e (almost coincides with remote sensing measurement land surface temperature) than estimated T-s by a simple empirical formula provided by Murray and Verhoef. The combined method gets more accurate diurnal G(0) than individual HM. However, a more theoretical relationship of T-e and T-s is required when more accurate G(0) is needed in other studies.

TI  - Surface water monitoring in small water bodies: potential and limits of multi-sensor Landsat time series
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrometric monitoring of small water bodies (110 ha) remains rare, due to their limited size and large numbers, preventing accurate assessments of their agricultural potential or their cumulative influence in watershed hydrology. Landsat imagery has shown its potential to support mapping of small water bodies, but the influence of their limited surface areas, vegetation growth, and rapid flood dynamics on long-term surface water monitoring remains unquantified. A semi-automated method is developed here to assess and optimize the potential of multi-sensor Landsat time series to monitor surface water extent and mean water availability in these small water bodies. Extensive hydrometric field data (1999-2014) for seven small reservoirs within the Merguellil catchment in central Tunisia and SPOT imagery are used to calibrate the method and explore its limits. The Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) is shown out of six commonly used water detection indices to provide high overall accuracy and threshold stability during high and low floods, leading to a mean surface area error below 15 %. Applied to 546 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images over 19992014, the method reproduces surface water extent variations across small lakes with high skill (R-2 = 0.9) and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 9300m(2). Comparison with published global water datasets reveals a mean RMSE of 21 800m(2) (+ 134 %) on the same lakes and highlights the value of a tailored MNDWI approach to improve hydrological monitoring in small lakes and reduce omission errors of flooded vegetation. The rise in relative errors due to the larger proportion and influence of mixed pixels restricts surface water monitoring below 3 ha with Landsat (Normalised RMSE = 27 %). Interferences from clouds and scan line corrector failure on ETM+ after 2003 also decrease the number of operational images by 51 %, reducing performance on lakes with rapid flood declines. Combining Landsat observations with 10m pansharpened Sentinel-2 imagery further reduces RMSE to 5200m(2), displaying the increased opportunities for surface water monitoring in small water bodies after 2015.

TI  - Surgical Standards for Management of the Axilla in Breast Cancer Clinical Trials with Pathological Complete Response Endpoint
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in the surgical management of the axilla in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially those with node positive disease at diagnosis, have led to changes in practice and more judicious use of axillary lymph node dissection that may minimize morbidity from surgery. However, there is still significant confusion about how to optimally manage the axilla, resulting in variation among practices. From the viewpoint of drug development, assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains paramount and appropriate assessment of residual disease-the primary endpoint of many drug therapy trials in the neoadjuvant setting-is critical. Therefore decreasing the variability, especially in a multicenter clinical trial setting, and establishing a minimum standard to ensure consistency in clinical trial data, without mandating axillary lymph node dissection, for all patients is necessary. The key elements which include proper staging and identification of nodal involvement at diagnosis, and appropriately targeted management of the axilla at the time of surgical resection are presented. The following protocols have been adopted as standard procedure by the I-SPY2 trial for management of axilla in patients with node positive disease, and present a framework for prospective clinical trials and practice.

In addition, we are providing the market basket update that will apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to these limits for FY 2019. We are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2019. In addition, we are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for quality reporting by specific Medicare providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs). We also are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for eligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs (now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability Programs). In addition, we are finalizing modifications to the requirements that apply to States operating Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs. We are updating policies for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. We also are making changes relating to the required supporting documentation for an acceptable Medicare cost report submission and the supporting information for physician certification and recertification of claims.

TI  - <i>Culicoides</i> species composition and abundance on Irish cattle farms: implications for arboviral disease transmission
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Following the emergence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Ireland in 2012, a sentinel herd surveillance program was established in the south of Ireland with the primary aim of investigating the species composition and abundance of Culicoides on livestock farms in the region.Methods: Ultraviolet-light trapping for Culicoides was carried out on 10 sentinel farms. Each site was sampled fortnightly over 16 weeks (21st July to 5th November 2014). One Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute UV light trap was run overnight at each site and catches were transferred immediately into 70% ethanol. Culicoides were morphologically identified to species level. Collection site habitats were characterised using the Phase 1 habitat survey technique (Joint Nature Conservation Committee).Results: A total of 23,929 individual Culicoides from 20 species was identified, including one species identified in Ireland for the first time, Culicoides cameroni. The most abundant species identified were Culicoides obsoletus/Culicoides scoticus (38%), Culicoides dewulfi (36%), Culicoides pulicaris (9%), Culicoides chiopterus (5%) and Culicoides punctatus (5%), comprising 93% of all Culicoides specimens identified. Collection site habitats were dominated by improved grassland and a combination of broadleaf woodland and native woodland species.Conclusions: The most abundant species of Culicoides identified were the putative vectors of bluetongue virus (BTV) and SBV in northern Europe. Their presence and abundance demonstrates the potential for future transmission of arboviruses among livestock in this region.

TI  - Diversity pattern of Duffy binding protein sequence among Duffy-negatives and Duffy-positives in Sudan
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vivax malaria is a leading public health concern worldwide. Due to the high prevalence of Duffy-negative blood group population, Plasmodium vivax in Africa historically is less attributable and remains a neglected disease. The interaction between Duffy binding protein and its cognate receptor, Duffy antigen receptor for chemokine plays a key role in the invasion of red blood cells and serves as a novel vaccine candidate against P. vivax. However, the polymorphic nature of P. vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP), particularly N-terminal cysteine-rich region (PvDBPII), represents a major obstacle for the successful design of a DBP-based vaccine to enable global protection. In this study, the level of pvdbpII sequence variations, Duffy blood group genotypes, number of haplotypes circulating, and the natural selection at pvdbpII in Sudan isolates were analysed and the implication in terms of DBP-based vaccine design was discussed.Methods: Forty-two P. vivax-infected blood samples were collected from patients from different areas of Sudan during 2014-2016. For Duffy blood group genotyping, the fragment that indicates GATA-1 transcription factor binding site of the FY gene (- 33 T > C) was amplified by PCR and sequenced by direct sequencing. The region II flanking pvdbpII was PCR amplified and sequenced by direct sequencing. The genetic diversity and natural selection of pvdbpII were done using DnaSP ver 5.0 and MEGA ver 5.0 programs. Based on predominant, non-synonymous, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), prevalence of Sudanese haplotypes was assessed in global isolates.Results: Twenty SNPs (14 non-synonymous and 6 synonymous) were identified in pvdbpII among the 42 Sudan P. vivax isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that 11 different PvDBP haplotypes exist in Sudan P. vivax isolates and the region has evolved under positive selection. Among the identified PvDBP haplotypes five PvDBP haplotypes were shared among Duffy-negative as well as Duffy-positive individuals. The high selective pressure was mainly found on the known B cell epitopes (H3) of pvdbpII. Comparison of Sudanese haplotypes, based on 10 predominant non-synonymous SNPs with 10 malaria-endemic countries, demonstrated that Sudanese haplotypes were prevalent in most endemic countries.Conclusion: This is the first pvdbp genetic diversity study from an African country. Sudanese isolates display high haplotype diversity and the gene is under selective pressure. Haplotype analysis indicated that Sudanese haplotypes are a representative sample of the global population. However, studies with a large number of samples are needed. These findings would be valuable for the development of PvDBP-based malaria vaccine.

This study assessed the influence of physical characteristics of houses and surrounding environments on mosquito biting risk in rural Tanzanian villages, and examined knowledge and perceptions of residents on relationships between these factors and malaria transmission. The study further assessed whether people worried about these risks and how they coped.Methods: Entomological surveys of indoor mosquito densities were conducted across four villages in Ulanga district, south-eastern Tanzania. The survey involved 48 sentinel houses sampled monthly and other sets of 48 houses randomly recruited each month for one-off sampling over 12 months. Physical characteristics of the houses and surrounding environments were recorded. Questionnaire surveys were administered to 200 household heads to assess their knowledge and concerns regarding the observed housing and environmental features, and whether they considered these features when constructing houses. Focus group discussions, were conducted to clarify emergent themes on people's perceptions on relationships between housing or environmental factors and malaria transmission.Results: The entomological surveys showed statistically higher indoor densities of the malaria vectors (Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus) in houses with mud walls compared to plastered or brick walls, open eaves compared to closed eaves and unscreened windows compared to screened windows. Most respondents reported that their houses allowed mosquito entry, at least partially. Participants were aware that house structure and environmental characteristics influenced indoor mosquito densities and consequently malaria transmission. They were concerned about living in poorly-constructed houses with gaps on eaves, walls, windows and doors but were constrained by low income.Conclusion: In rural south-eastern Tanzania, significant proportions of people still live in houses with open eaves, unscreened windows and gaps on doors. Though they are fully aware of associated mosquito biting and pathogen transmission risks, they are constrained by low-income levels. The study proposes that community-based house improvement initiatives combined with targeted subsidies could lower the financial barriers, improve access to essential construction materials or designs, and significantly accelerate malaria transmission control in these communities.

TI  - A measurement-based verification framework for UK greenhouse gas emissions: an overview of the Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) project
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the motivation, design, and execution of the Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) project. The overarching scientific objective of GAUGE was to use atmospheric data to estimate the magnitude, distribution, and uncertainty of the UK greenhouse gas (GHG, defined here as CO2, CH4, and N2O) budget, 2013-2015. To address this objective, we established a multi-year and interlinked measurement and data analysis programme, building on an established tall-tower GHG measurement network. The calibrated measurement network comprises ground-based, airborne, ship-borne, balloon-borne, and space-borne GHG sensors. Our choice of measurement technologies and measurement locations reflects the heterogeneity of UK GHG sources, which range from small point sources such as landfills to large, diffuse sources such as agriculture. Atmospheric mole fraction data collected at the tall towers and on the ships provide information on sub-continental fluxes, representing the backbone to the GAUGE network. Additional spatial and temporal details of GHG fluxes over East Anglia were inferred from data collected by a regional network. Data collected during aircraft flights were used to study the transport of GHGs on local and regional scales. We purposely integrated new sensor and platform technologies into the GAUGE network, allowing us to lay the foundations of a strengthened UK capability to verify national GHG emissions beyond the project lifetime. For example, current satellites provide sparse and seasonally uneven sampling over the UK mainly because of its geographical size and cloud cover. This situation will improve with new and future satellite instruments, e.g. measurements of CH4 from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard Sentinel-5P. We use global, nested, and regional atmospheric transport models and inverse methods to infer geographically resolved CO2 and CH4 fluxes. This multi-model approach allows us to study model spread in a posteriori flux estimates. These models are used to determine the relative importance of different measurements to infer the UK GHG budget. Attributing observed GHG variations to specific sources is a major challenge. Within a UK-wide spatial context we used two approaches: (1) Delta(CO2)-C-14 and other relevant isotopologues (e.g. delta(CCH4)-C-13) from collected air samples to quantify the contribution from fossil fuel combustion and other sources, and (2) geographical separation of individual sources, e.g. agriculture, using a high-density measurement network. Neither of these represents a definitive approach, but they will provide invaluable information about GHG source attribution when they are adopted as part of a more comprehensive, long-term national GHG measurement programme. We also conducted a number of case studies, including an instrumented landfill experiment that provided a test bed for new technologies and flux estimation methods. We anticipate that results from the GAUGE project will help inform other countries on how to use atmospheric data to quantify their nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.

TI  - A 2′FY-RNA Motif Defines an Aptamer for Ebolavirus Secreted Protein
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With properties such as stability to long-term storage and amenability to repetitive use, nucleic acid aptamers are compatible with many sensing/transducing platforms intended for use in remote locations. Sensors with these properties are important for quickly identifying ebolavirus outbreaks, which frequently start in locations that lack sophisticated equipment. Soluble glycoprotein (sGP), an excellent biomarker for ebolaviruses, is produced from the same gene as the ebolavirus glycoprotein GP1,2 that decorates the surface of the viral particle and is secreted in abundance into the blood stream even during the early stages of infection. Here, we report the selection and properties of a 2'fluoro pyrimidine (2'FY)-modified RNA aptamer, 39SGP1A, that specifically binds sGP. We demonstrate by computational and biochemical analysis that the recognition motif of 39SGP1A is a novel polypyrimidine-rich sequence. Replacement of -F by -OH in the 2' position of the ribose resulted in complete loss of affinity for sGP. The protein motif to which the aptamer binds requires an intact sGP dimer and binds to an epitope conserved between Ebola virus (EBOV) and Sudan virus (SUDV) sGP, the most divergent Ebolavirus species. This identifies 39SGP1A as an excellent option for integration on a sensor platform to detect ebolavirus infections.

TI  - Infectious diseases acquired by international travellers visiting the USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Estimates of travel-related illness have focused predominantly on populations from highly developed countries visiting low-or middle-income countries, yet travel to and within high-income countries is very frequent. Despite being a top international tourist destination, few sources describe the spectrum of infectious diseases acquired among travellers to the USA.Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis summarizing demographic and travel characteristics, and clinical diagnoses among non-US-resident international travellers seen during or after travel to the USA at a GeoSentinel clinic from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2016.Results: There were 1222 ill non-US-resident travellers with 1393 diagnoses recorded during the 20-year analysis period. Median age was 40 (range 0-86 years); 52% were female. Patients visited from 63 countries and territories, most commonly Canada (31%), Germany (14%), France (9%) and Japan (7%). Travellers presented with a range of illnesses; skin and soft tissue infections of unspecified aetiology were the most frequently reported during travel (29 diagnoses, 14% of during-travel diagnoses); arthropod bite/sting was the most frequently reported after travel (173 diagnoses, 15% after-travel diagnoses). Lyme disease was the most frequently reported arthropod-borne disease after travel (42, 4%). Nonspecific respiratory, gastrointestinal and systemic infections were also among the most frequently reported diagnoses overall. Low-frequency illnesses (<2% of cases) made up over half of diagnoses during travel and 41% of diagnoses after travel, including 13 cases of coccidioidomycosis and mosquito-borne infections like West Nile, dengue and Zika virus diseases.Conclusions: International travellers to the USA acquired a diverse array of mostly cosmopolitan infectious diseases, including nonspecific respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic and systemic infections comparable to what has been reported among travellers to low-and middle-income countries. Clinicians should consider the specific health risks when preparing visitors to the USA and when evaluating and treating those who become ill.

TI  - Global Estimates of River Flow Wave Travel Times and Implications for Low-Latency Satellite Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth-orbiting satellites provide valuable observations of upstream river conditions worldwide. These observations can be used in real-time applications like early flood warning systems and reservoir operations, provided they are made available to users with sufficient lead time. Yet the temporal requirements for access to satellite-based river data remain uncharacterized for time-sensitive applications. Here we present a global approximation of flow wave travel time to assess the utility of existing and future low-latency/near-real-time satellite products, with an emphasis on the forthcoming SWOT satellite mission. We apply a kinematic wave model to a global hydrography data set and find that global flow waves traveling at their maximum speed take a median travel time of 6, 4, and 3 days to reach their basin terminus, the next downstream city, and the next downstream dam, respectively. Our findings suggest that a recently proposed <= 2-day data latency for a low-latency SWOT product is potentially useful for real-time river applications.Plain Language Summary Satellites can provide upstream conditions for early flood warning systems, reservoir operations, and other river management applications. This information is most useful for time-sensitive applications if it is made available before an observed upstream flood reaches a downstream point of interest, like a basin outlet, city, or dam. Here we characterize the time it takes floods to travel down Earth's rivers in an effort to assess the time required for satellite data to be downloaded, processed, and made accessible to users. We find that making satellite data available within a recently proposed <= 2-day time period will make the data potentially useful for flood mitigation and other water management applications.

TI  - Global Distribution of Non-algal Particles From Ocean Color Data and Implications for Phytoplankton Biomass Detection
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades, phytoplankton biomass has been commonly studied from space. However, satellite analysis of non-algal particles (NAPs), including heterotrophic bacteria and viruses, is relatively recent. In this work, we estimate the backscattering coefficient associated with the NAP fraction that does not covary with chlorophyll based on satellite particulate backscattering coefficient and chlorophyll (b(bp)NAP). b(bp)NAP is computed at 100-km resolution using 19 years of monthly satellite data. We find clear differences in b(bp)NAP between northern and southern oceans. High b(bp)NAP values are found in the Arctic and Southern Oceans, the North Atlantic area influenced by the Gulf Stream current, as well as shelf regions (i.e., Patagonian shelf) affected by upwelling regimes. Low correlation between chlorophyll and backscattering prevents precise b(bp)NAP estimations in oligotrophic areas (e.g., subtropical gyres). These b(bp)NAP estimations lead to a reduction to half in satellite-based phytoplankton biomass estimates respect to previously published results.Plain Language Summary In the ocean, there are different seawater constituents that contribute to the inherent optical properties: Phytoplankton is a major constituent and one of the most studied in the last decade. Other important constituents are the colored dissolved organic matter and non-algal particles (NAPs). NAP includes (i) heterotrophic organisms such as bacteria, micrograzers, and viruses; (ii) detrital organic particles such as fecal pellets and cell debris; and (iii) mineral particles of both biogenic (e.g., calcite liths and shells) and terrestrial origin (e.g., clays and sand). This study is the first attempt to define the NAP from space, and its spatial variability, and how it contributes to refine the phytoplankton carbon biomass estimation. We estimate the backscattering coefficient associated with the NAP fraction that does not covary with chlorophyll from the satellite particulate backscattering coefficient and chlorophyll (bbpNAP). Our main results evidence a geographical variability of bbpNAP from northern to southern oceans with two distinct regimes: one associated with the productive areas in which bbpNAP and biomass are anticorrelated and another in which bbpNAP high values are in regions dominated by inorganic origin. We demonstrate that the spatial variability of bbpNAP should not be ignored.

TI  - Colicin F<sub>Y</sub> inhibits pathogenic <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> in mice
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yersiniosis belongs to the common foodborne diseases around the world, and frequently manifests as diarrhea that can be treated with probiotics. Colicin F-Y is an antibacterial agent produced by bacteria and it is capable of specific growth inhibition of Yersinia enterocolitica, the causative agent of gastrointestinal yersiniosis. In this study, recombinant E. coli producing colicin F-Y were constructed, using both known probiotic strains EcH22 and EcColinfant, and the newly isolated murine strains Ec1127 and Ec1145. All E. coli strains producing colicin FY inhibited growth of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica during co-cultivation in vitro. In dysbiotic mice treated with streptomycin, E. coli strains producing colicin F-Y inhibited progression of Y. enterocolitica infections. This growth inhibition was not observed in mice with normal gut microflora, likely due to insufficient colonization capacity of E. coli strains and/or due to spatial differences in intestinal niches. Isogenic Y. enterocolitica producing colicin F-Y was constructed and shown to inhibit pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in mice with normal microflora. Evidence of in vivo antimicrobial activity of colicin F-Y may have utility in the treatment of Y. enterocolitica infections.

TI  - Global Validation of MODIS Near-Surface Air and Dew Point Temperatures
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This analysis is the first global validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived near-surface air temperature and dew point estimates, which both serve as crucial input data in models of energy, water, and carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. By hypsometrically interpolating the MOD07 Level-2 atmospheric profile product to surface pressure level, we obtained near-surface air temperature and dew point observations at 5 km pixel resolution. We compared these daily data, retrieved over a 14-year record, to corresponding measurements from 109 ground meteorological stations (FLUXNET). Our results show strong agreement between satellite and in situ near-surface air temperature measurements (R-2 = 0.89, root-mean-square error = 3.47 degrees C, and bias = -0.19 degrees C) and dew point observations (R-2 = 0.76, root-mean-square error = 5.04 degrees C, and bias = 0.79 degrees C) with insignificant differences in error across climate zones. This validation is among the earliest assessments of the reprocessed, crosstalk-corrected Collection 6.1 Terra MODIS data and provides support for widespread applications of near-surface atmospheric data.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Impacts of Wildfires on Regional Atmosphere Composition and the Shortwave Radiative Forcing: A Multiple Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions of aerosols and trace gases from wildfires and their direct shortwave radiative forcing (DSRF) at the top of atmosphere were studied using satellite observations from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System on Aqua, and Ozone Monitoring Instrument on Aura. The dominant fuel types of the selected fire cases in the northeast of China (NEC), Siberia (Russia), and California (USA) are cropland, mixed forest, and needle-leaf forest, respectively. For the cropland fire case in NEC, the fire radiative power-based emission coefficients (Ce) of aerosol is 20.51 +/- 2.55 g/MJ, half that of the forest fire cases in Siberia (40.01 +/- 9.21 g/MJ) and California (45.23 +/- 8.81 g/MJ), and the carbon monoxide (CO) Ce (23.94 +/- 11.83 g/MJ) was about one third and half that of the forest fire cases in Siberia and California, respectively. However, the NOx (NO2 + NO) Ce (2.76 +/- 0.25g MJ(-1)) of the cropland fire in NEC was nearly 3 times that of those forest fire cases. Ratios of NO, to aerosol, HCHO, and CO in the cropland case in NEC show much higher values than those in the forest fire cases. Despite the differences of the Ce and the composition ratios, the DSRF efficiency of smoke aerosol at the top of atmosphere showed similar values among those fire cases. Our results highlight the large variability of emission rate and relative chemical composition but similar DSRF efficiencies among wildfires, which would provide valuable information for understanding the impact of fire on air quality and climate.

TI  - Satellite-Based Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimates During Fire Seasons in Colorado
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The western United States has experienced increasing wildfire activities, which have negative effects on human health. Epidemiological studies on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfires are limited by the lack of accurate high-resolution PM2.5 exposure data over fire days. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data can provide additional information in ground PM2.5 concentrations and has been widely used in previous studies. However, the low background concentration, complex terrain, and large wildfire sources add to the challenge of estimating PM2.5 concentrations in the western United States. In this study, we applied a Bayesian ensemble model that combined information from the 1km resolution AOD products derived from the Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations, and ground measurements to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations over fire seasons (April to September) in Colorado for 2011-2014. Our model had a 10-fold cross-validated R-2 of 0.66 and root-mean-squared error of 2.00g/m(3), outperformed the multistage model, especially on the fire days. Elevated PM2.5 concentrations over large fire events were successfully captured. The modeling technique demonstrated in this study could support future short-term and long-term epidemiological studies of wildfire PM2.5.Key Points

TI  - An updated version of a gap-free monthly mean zonal mean ozone database
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - An updated and improved version of a global, vertically resolved, monthly mean zonal mean ozone database has been calculated - hereafter referred to as the BSVertOzone (Bodeker Scientific Vertical Ozone) database. Like its predecessor, it combines measurements from several satellite-based instruments and ozone profile measurements from the global ozonesonde network. Monthly mean zonal mean ozone concentrations in mixing ratio and number density are provided in 5 degrees latitude bins, spanning 70 altitude levels (1 to 70 km), or 70 pressure levels that are approximately 1 km apart (878.4 to 0.046 hPa). Different data sets or "tiers" are provided: Tier 0 is based only on the available measurements and therefore does not completely cover the whole globe or the full vertical range uniformly; the Tier 0.5 monthly mean zonal means are calculated as a filled version of the Tier 0 database where missing monthly mean zonal mean values are estimated from correlations against a total column ozone (TCO) database. The Tier 0.5 data set includes the full range of measurement variability and is created as an intermediate step for the calculation of the Tier 1 data where a least squares regression model is used to attribute variability to various known forcing factors for ozone. Regression model fit coefficients are expanded in Fourier series and Legendre polynomials (to account for seasonality and latitudinal structure, respectively). Four different combinations of contributions from selected regression model basis functions result in four different Tier 1 data sets that can be used for comparisons with chemistry-climate model (CCM) simulations that do not exhibit the same unforced variability as reality (unless they are nudged towards reanalyses). Compared to previous versions of the database, this update includes additional satellite data sources and ozonesonde measurements to extend the database period to 2016. Additional improvements over the previous version of the database include the following: (i) adjustments of measurements to account for biases and drifts between different data sources (using a chemistry-transport model, CTM, simulation as a transfer standard), (ii) a more objective way to determine the optimum number of Fourier and Legendre expansions for the basis function fit coefficients, and (iii) the derivation of methodological and measurement uncertainties on each database value are traced through all data modification steps. Comparisons with the ozone database from SWOOSH (Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized data set) show good agreement in many regions of the globe. Minor differences are caused by different bias adjustment procedures for the two databases. However, compared to SWOOSH, BSVertOzone additionally covers the troposphere.

TI  - Multiple Factors Explaining the Deficiency of Cloud Profiling Radar on Detecting Oceanic Warm Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) detecting efficiency on low-level clouds is affected by many situations, including surface clutter, spatial resolution, and radar sensitivity. These factors can uniquely or jointly result in missed detections of oceanic single-layer warm clouds. Fifty-seven percent of missed detections are attributed to a single factor, and the rest are attributed to two or more factors that are indistinguishable. For missed warm clouds above 1km, 30% result from the nonovercast effect, while the CPR range resolution is the major cause for the overcast ones. In particular, 18.4% are attributed exclusively to specific cloud microphysics, which is characterized by droplet effective radius (DER) and cloud optical thickness (COT). Compared to COT, the CPR detection is more dependent on DER, with a critical value standing around 10m. It is only for larger DER that the effects from COT turn to arise. Given liquid water path, clouds with larger DER and smaller COT are more likely to generate sufficient reflectivity and be detected than their counterpart. For clouds with the same DER and COT, opposite detecting results are primarily determined by the different droplet size distributions that lead to a variable reflectivity across the CPR detecting limit. Over global oceans, total miss rate of cloud occurrences approaches 0.73, while the loss rate of cloud water mass is 0.42 due to the smaller liquid water path of CPR-missed clouds. The CPR-missed detections also lead to uncertainties in cloud radiative forcing estimations. A notable overestimation of shortwave cloud forcing at 160% is found at bottom and top of atmosphere.Key Points

TI  - Comparison of Daytime Low-Level Cloud Properties Derived From GOES and ARM SGP Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale satellite data are critical for both verifying and improving general circulation model parameterizations of clouds and radiation for climate prediction. For reliable application of satellite data sets in cloud processes and climate models, it is important to have a reasonable estimate of the errors in the derived cloud properties. The daytime single-layered low-level cloud properties retrieved by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES) are compared with ground-based observations and retrievals over the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility from June 1998 to December 2006. The GOES retrievals are made via the Visible-Infrared Solar-infrared Split-window Technique. They are spatially averaged within a 0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees box centered on the ARM SGP site, and the ARM surface observations are temporally averaged +/- 15 min around the GOES scans to produce collocated pairs. Comparisons are made for monthly means, diurnal means, and one-to-one GOES and ARM collocated pairs. GOES T-eff is highly correlated with ARM T-top cloud temperature, having an R-2 value of 0.75, though GOES exhibits a cold bias. GOES-retrieved tau and liquid water path have very good agreement with ARM retrievals with R(2)s of 0.45 and 0.47, while r(e) (GOES), on average, is about 2 mu m greater than ARM r(e). An examination of solar and viewing geometry has shown that GOES-retrieved mean r(e) and tau values are impacted by solar zenith angle and especially scattering angle, which is not unexpected and needs to be accounted for by users.

TI  - Effects of a large-scale late spring frost on a beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) dominated Mediterranean mountain forest derived from the spatio-temporal variations of NDVI
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Increased intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures such as late spring frosts and heat waves represent the main drivers affecting forest ecosystem structure and composition in the Mediterranean region.Aims The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a late spring frost disturbance, which occurred during spring 2016 in southern Italy, through the assessment of the spatial pattern of the damage to the beech forest canopy associated with the peak decrease in normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the analysis of the NDVI temporal recovery after this frost disturbance.Methods The forest areas affected by frost were detected through the NDVI differencing technique based on Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) imagery time series. The influence of local geomorphic factors (i.e., aspect, elevation, and slope) on forest NDVI patterns was assessed by means of a generalized additive model (GAM).Results A rather counterintuitive NDVI patterns emerged according to the forest exposition, with NDVI significantly higher on the north facing areas than the southerly ones. The main canopy damage occurred at about 1250 m and reached up to 1500 m asl, representing the altitudinal range affected by the frost disturbance. Finally, the full canopy recovery occurred within 3 months of the frost event.Conclusion The analysis of seasonal Landsat 8 image time series related to local geomorphic factors, such as aspect, slope, and altitude, and plant phenology on a frost event date, contributed to highlight the NDVI spatio-temporal variation and canopy recovery of a Mediterranean mountain beech forest.

TI  - A New Picture of Fire Extent, Variability, and Drought Interaction in Prescribed Fire Landscapes: Insights From Florida Government Records
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Florida, United States, government records provide a new resource for studying fire in landscapes managed with prescribed fire. In Florida, most fire area (92%) is prescribed. Current satellite fire products, which underpin most air pollution emission inventories, detect only 25% of burned area, which alters airborne emissions and environmental impacts. Moreover, these satellite products can misdiagnose spatiotemporal variability of fires. Overall fire area in Florida decreases during drought conditions as prescribed fires are avoided, but satellite data do not reflect this pattern. This pattern is consistent with prescribed fire successfully reducing overall fire risk and damages. Human management of prescribed fires and fuels can, therefore, break the conventional link between drought and wildfire and play an important role in mitigating rising fire risk in a changing climate. These results likely apply in other regions of the world with similar fire regimes.Plain Language Summary Wildfires and prescribed (i.e., controlled) fires are major sources of air pollution, greenhouse gases, and aerosols. Accurately estimating emissions from fires is critical to understanding their impacts on the environment and for designing sound fire management policies. We show that for Florida, United States, current satellites-the primary tools for identifying the extent, location, and time of these fires-dramatically underestimate the amount of fire, poorly identify its variation in space and time and can mischaracterize its relationship to drought. Using government records of fires, where available, can overcome some satellite shortcomings and provide a more accurate picture of fire extent and variability. In Florida, these records show that land area consumed by fire decreases during drought conditions due to less prescribed burning, but this pattern is not detected by satellites. Similar results may be expected in other parts of the world with similar fire characteristics, including agricultural and savanna regions of South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Using prescribed fire can help land managers adapt to climate-driven changes in wildfire activity.

TI  - The prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer: a systematic review protocol
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited cancer syndrome, which predisposes individuals to a number of different cancers, principally colorectal and endometrial cancer. The early diagnosis of Lynch syndrome enables colorectal surveillance, which has been shown to save lives through the detection and removal of premalignant polyps and earlier detection of invasive disease. Endometrial cancer, which is often the sentinel cancer in women, provides an opportunity to diagnose Lynch syndrome and thus enable colorectal surveillance as well as the cascade testing for Lynch syndrome in other family members. These potential benefits have led to a call for the universal screening of women with endometrial cancer for Lynch syndrome, a practice that is now commonplace in colorectal cancer. Healthcare providers and clinicians are however restricted by insufficient knowledge about the prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer, with estimates varying as widely as 1-10%. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review with a meta-analysis of the current literature base in order to estimate the prevalence of Lynch syndrome among women with endometrial cancer to inform this discussion.Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, NHS Health and Technology Assessment Database and the Web of Science will be systematically searched for relevant studies via the Ovid platform. Two authors will review the titles and abstracts independently, with discrepancy settled by a third author. Data extraction will be completed to record demographic, pathological and clinical data, as well as the diagnostic methods used for estimating the prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. Bias will be assessed and recorded using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and that of the International Cochrane Collaboration. Dependent on the heterogeneity of the data, we aim to produce a cumulative incidence in addition to subgroup analyses as to investigate secondary outcomes.Discussion: The aim of this systematic review is to provide a robust estimate of the prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. This will enable resource allocation and decision-making regarding the appropriateness of screening all women, or certain women, with endometrial cancer for Lynch syndrome. Such a policy could enable the earlier diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in women and, through the application of colorectal cancer surveillance, improve their survival outcomes.

TI  - A Comparison of Model-Based Ionospheric and Ocean Tidal Magnetic Signals With Observatory Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observed tidal geomagnetic field variations are due to a combination of electric currents in the ionosphere, ocean, and their induced counterparts. Using these variations to constrain subsurface electrical conductivity in oceanic regions is a promising frontier; however, properly separating the ionospheric and oceanic tidal contributions of the magnetic field is critical for this. We compare semidiurnal lunar tidal magnetic signals (i.e., the signals due to the M-2 tidal mode) estimated from 64 global observatories to physics-based forward models of the ionospheric M-2 magnetic field and the oceanic M-2 magnetic field. At ground level, predicted ionospheric M-2 amplitudes are strongest in the horizontal components, whereas the predicted oceanic amplitudes are strongest in the vertical direction. There is good agreement between the predicted and estimated M-2 phases for the Y component; however, the F and X components experience deviations that may be indicative of unmodeled ionospheric processes or unmodeled coastal effects. Overall, we find that the agreement between the physics-based model predictions and the observations is very encouraging for electromagnetic sensing applications, especially since the predicted ionospheric vertical component is very weak.Plain Language Summary Both Earth's oceans and upper atmosphere produce electric current and electromagnetic ( EM) fields. Tides caused by the gravitational interaction between Earth, the Sun, and Moon create reliable, easily constrained EM signals in both the ocean and upper atmosphere. Geophysicists are interested in using these ocean tidal EM signals to study the electrical conductivity of Earth's interior; however, this requires a solid understanding of the upper atmosphere's contribution to the EM signal. This study uses a physics-based model to estimate the relative EM tidal signals of the ocean versus the upper atmosphere to immediately address this concern. We also compare the model predictions with the EM tidal signals constrained from 64 global observatories. Considering the level of complexity of the upper atmosphere's EM tidal signals, we find remarkable agreement between the observed and modeled EM tidal signals. Some of the discrepancies may be of interest to those in upper atmospheric/space physics because they may be due to unmodeled physical processes. Our results are also very encouraging for geophysicists aiming to use EM tidal signals to study Earth's interior since they suggest a small upper atmosphere contribution to the EM tidal signal generally used.

TI  - Heterogeneity in Warm-Season Land-Atmosphere Coupling Over the US Southern Great Plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneity in warm-season (May-August) land-atmosphere (LA) coupling is quantified with the long-time, multiple-station measurements from the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite remote sensing at the Southern Great Plains (SGP). We examine the coupling strength at seven additional locations with the same surface type (i.e., pasture/grassland) as the ARM SGP central facility (CF). To simultaneously consider multiple factors and consistently quantify their relative contributions, we apply a multiple linear regression method to correlate the surface evaporative fraction (EF) with near-surface soil moisture (SM) and leaf area index (LAI). The observations show moderate to weak terrestrial segment LA coupling with large heterogeneity across the ARM SGP domain in warm season. Large spatial variabilities in the contributions from SM and LAI to the EF changes are also found. The coupling heterogeneities appear to be associated with differences in land use, anthropogenic activities, rooting depth, and soil type at different stations. Therefore, the complex LA interactions at the SGP cannot be well represented by those at the CF/E13 based on the metrics applied here. Overall, the LAI exerts more influence on the EF than does the SM due to its overwhelming impacts on the latent heat flux. This study complements previous studies based on measurements only from the CF and has important implications for modeling LA coupling in weather and climate models. The multiple linear regression provides a more comprehensive measure of the integrated impacts on LA coupling from several different factors.Key Points

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of inherent optical properties in oligotrophic northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems provide numerous economic and environmental benefits to society. However, increasing anthropogenic activities and developmental pressure may stress these areas and hamper their ecosystem services. Satellite remote sensing could be used as a tool for monitoring water quality parameters, including inherent optical properties (IOP) in coastal regions. Spatio-temporal information on IOP variability will help in understanding the dynamics of the water quality of estuaries. The objective of this research was to develop a novel hybrid model by combining and parameterizing existing quasi analytical and semi-analytical algorithms to estimate IOPs in four oligotrophic northern Gulf of Mexico Florida estuaries. The hybrid model was applied to above surface remote sensing reflectance data representing the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Sentinel-Ss Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OCLI) bands. The hybrid model produced a root means squared error (RMSE) of 0.32 m(-1) (13.95% NRMSE) for total absorption (a(t)), 0.21 m(-1) (7.61% NRMSE) for detritus-gelbstoff absorption (a(dg)), and 0.09 m(-1) (22.77% NRMSE) for phytoplankton pigment absorption (a(phi)). Results showed that absorption by detritus and gelbstoff (a(dg)) dominates the water in these estuaries. Monthly IOP variability in 2010 revealed that compared to other estuaries, magnitudes of IOPs was the highest in Pensacola Bay and therefore the highest attenuation. Findings also indicated that river discharge and precipitation predominantly govern the IOP variations in all four estuaries, showing an increase in IOP values following the high flow period. The hybrid model improved IOP retrieval in these low chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estuaries where the existing spectral decomposition models did not perform satisfactorily.

TI  - Dynamic ecological observations from satellites inform aerobiology of allergenic grass pollen
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Allergic diseases, including respiratory conditions of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma, affect up to 500 million people worldwide. Grass pollen are one major source of aeroallergens globally. Pollen forecast methods are generally site-based and rely on empirical meteorological relationships and/or the use of labour-intensive pollen collection traps that are restricted to sparse sampling locations. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the grass pollen sources themselves, however, have received less attention. Here we utilised a consistent set of MODIS satellite measures of grass cover and seasonal greenness (EVI) over five contrasting urban environments, located in Northern (France) and Southern Hemispheres (Australia), to evaluate their utility for predicting airborne grass pollen concentrations. Strongly seasonal and pronounced pollinating periods, synchronous with satellite measures of grass cover greenness, were found at the higher latitude temperate sites in France (46-50 degrees N. Lat.), with peak pollen activity lagging peak greenness, on average by 2-3 weeks. In contrast, the Australian sites (34-38 degrees S. Lat.) displayed pollinating periods that were less synchronous with satellite greenness measures as peak pollen concentrations lagged peak greenness by as much as 4 to 7 weeks. The Australian sites exhibited much higher spatial and inter-annual variations compared to the French sites and at the Sydney site, broader and multiple peaks in both pollen concentrations and greenness data coincided with flowering of more diverse grasses including subtropical species. Utilising generalised additive models (GAMs) we found the satellite greenness data of grass cover areas explained 80-90% of airborne grass pollen concentrations across the three French sites (p < 0.001) and accounted for 34 to 76% of grass pollen variations over the two sites in Australia (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate the potential of satellite sensing to augment forecast models of grass pollen aerobiology as a tool to reduce the health and socioeconomic burden of pollen-sensitive allergic diseases.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different concentrations of a glyphosate formulation, Roundups (R) Full II (66.2% glyphosate) were tested in culture peripheral blood of armadillo Chaetophractus villosus with cytogenetic biomarkers like mitotic index (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and cell proliferation kinetics (CPK) by means of replication index. Adults animals of both sexes were exposed to RU at four concentrations ranging from 0.026 mL RU solution to 0.379 mL RU daily in oral treatment with the same volume (0.2 mL) during 7 days. We analyzed the induced damage at different times considering TO as control value, one (T1), seven (T7) and 30 days (T30). One day after, only the higher concentration shows MI significant differences (p < 0.05), at T7 the frequency increases and at T30 it decreases reaching TO values. The analysis of CA frequencies shows that only 0.106 mL RU/day exhibit significant differences vs TO values. A great variability is expressed in the values of standard deviation (SD) and in the wide confidence intervals of the media. One day after treatments (T1) all four concentrations shows significant differences in SCE vs TO values. Replication Index (RI) does not show significant differences. The dose-response behavior was not observed in either CA or SCE. The consistency of the findings obtained with the same biomarkers in vitro support the idea of expanding studies in order to characterize the risk doses for these mammals.

TI  - Spatial and temporal shifts in the diet of the barnacle <i>Amphibalanus</i> <i>eburneus </i>within a subtropical estuary
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of many sessile invertebrates in marine benthic communities is linked to their ability to efficiently remove suspended organic matter from the surrounding water column. To investigate the diet of the barnacle Amphibalanus eburneus, a dominant suspension feeder within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of central Florida, we compared the stable isotopes ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of barnacle tissue to those of particulate organic matter (POM). Collections were carried out quarterly for a year from 29 permanent sites and at sites impacted by an Aureoumbra lagunensis bloom. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of Amphibalanus eburneus varied across sites, but delta N-15 was more stable over time. There was a range of delta N-15 values of Amphibalanus eburneus tissue from 6.0%o to 10.5%o across sites. Because land-based sources such as sewage are generally enriched in N-15, this suggests a continuum of anthropogenic influence across sites in the IRL. Over 70% of the variation in delta N-15 values of Amphibalanus eburneus across sites was driven by the delta N-15 values of POM, supporting a generalist feeding strategy on available sources of suspended organic matter. The dominance of this generalist consumer in the IRL may be linked to its ability to consume spatially and temporally variable food resources derived from natural and anthropogenic sources, as well as Aureoumbra lagunensis cells. Generalist consumers such as Amphibalanus eburneus serve an important ecological role in this ecosystem and act as a sentinel species and recorder of local, site-specific isotopic baselines.

CP  - Conference on Emergence and Evolution of Indian Foreland Basin
CL  - Panjab Univ, Dept Geol, Chandigarh, INDIA
AB  - Understanding the processes of ravine formation and estimates of Specific Sediment Yields (SSY) of these regions help in formulating mitigation policies significantly. Upto now, in the Ganga Plain, the work done on ravine formation, erosion and SSY estimates has been speculative. Here, utilizing (i) high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) prepared from Real Time Kinematic (RTK) survey and CARTOSAT images of ravined zones and (ii) luminescence chronology, we provide the first estimate of SSY from the ravines. The results indicate that SSY in the Marginal Ganga Plain (MGP) ravines may range between 600 +/- 100 t/km(2)/yr and 1600 +/- 200 t/km(2)/Yr.The correspondence between the orientations of fractures and that of first order ravine suggests that the ravine growth is genetically related to extensional stress regime of the peripheral forebulge. Further, the clay sedimentology indicates that besides regional tectonics, action of swelling clays may have accelerated development of the badlands. The geomorphic relationship between the length of ravined catchments and incision in the trunk channels indicates that the river-incision associated base level change is not playing an overarching role in the ravine formation in the MGP.

TI  - Objective measures for sentinel surveillance in network epidemiology
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW E
M3  - Article
AB  - Assume one has the capability of determining whether a node in a network is infectious or not by probing it. Then problem of optimizing sentinel surveillance in networks is to identify the nodes to probe such that an emerging disease outbreak can be discovered early or reliably. Whether the emphasis should be on early or reliable detection depends on the scenario in question. We investigate three objective measures from the literature quantifying the performance of nodes in sentinel surveillance: the time to detection or extinction, the time to detection, and the frequency of detection. As a basis for the comparison, we use the susceptible-infectious-recovered model on static and temporal networks of human contacts. We show that, for some regions of parameter space, the three objective measures can rank the nodes very differently. This means sentinel surveillance is a class of problems, and solutions need to chose an objective measure for the particular scenario in question. As opposed to other problems in network epidemiology, we draw similar conclusions from the static and temporal networks. Furthermore, we do not find one type of network structure that predicts the objective measures, i.e., that depends both on the data set and the SIR parameter values.

TI  - Analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth Variation Characteristics for 10 years in Urumqi Based on MODIS_C006
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MYD04_L2_C006 dataset gained from Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer MODIS Level 2 at 10 km resolution of NASA's EOS (Earth Observing System) from 2006 to 2015, the aerosol optical depths (AODs) for 10 years under the condition of mild above atmospheric pollution (including mild) were analyzed for Urumqi City. The results showed that the average AODs in Urumqi were unimodally distribution over the 10 years. From January to April, the AODs gradually increased. During a year, the annual peak of 0.37 +/- 0.19 was in April, and the lowest value of 0.22 +/- 0.20 was in October. Owing to the frequent occurrence of dust weather conditions in spring, the largest seasonal variation of AOD was in spring, as the air pollution in the entire area was very serious, followed by summer and winter, with the smallest in autumn. In addition, the urban area was the high AOD value area in Urumqi, as its air pollution was more severe than that in the suburbs. The average value of AOD during the 10 years was 0.293. The highest value of AOD was 0.33 in 2006, and the lowest value of 0.24 was in 2008, which declined to 23.3% of that in 2007. The annual change in AOD in Urumqi over the 10 years rose steadily. Compared with previous studies, the lowest and highest values were both higher to different degrees. Despite the deduction trend in 2015, air pollution in Urumqi was serious in the studied decade, and thus control of such needs to be strengthened.

TI  - 3-D ionospheric tomography from dense GNSS observations based on an improved two-step iterative algorithm
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT) can image 3-D ionospheric variations from ground Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations. However, due to the sparse and inhomogeneous ground GNSS observations, the prior information from the empirical models (e.g., IRI-2012 and NeQuick 2) have to be used, which affect the reconstructed results in the CIT, particularly the peak parameters of the F2 layer, namely foF2 and M(3000)F2. In this paper, an improved two-step CIT algorithm is developed to image the ionospheric electron density (IED) distribution up to 2000 km over Japan using dense GNSS Earth Observation Network (GEONET) observations operated by the Geospatial Information Authority (GSI) of Japan. Firstly, we update the IRI-2012 using the ground-based GNSS observations. The NeQuick-2 is used to provide the vertical ionospheric profile, and foF2 and M(3000)F2 derived from CCIR model in NeQuick 2 are improved by the B-spline modeling methods. Secondly, the updated IRI-2012 is input as a prior value and the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) is implemented to reconstruct the IED distribution. The reconstructed results are validated by the simulation and observation results from ground-based GNSS, GNSS Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) observations and ionosonde measurements. The results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our new method. The standard deviations of TEC residual errors from the updated NeQuick 2 are at least 20% less than those from the original NeQuick 2 model, and the updated NeQuick 2 has better performance for the ionospheric correction.

TI  - Mapping rootable depth and root zone plant-available water holding capacity of the soil of sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In rainfed crop production, root zone plant-available water holding capacity (RZ-PAWHC) of the soil has a large influence on crop growth and the yield response to management inputs such as improved seeds and fertilisers. However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled georeferenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km(3)) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km(3) are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km(3) due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km(3), aluminium toxicity by 600 km(3), porosity by 120 km(3) and alkalinity by 20 km(3). The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available.

TI  - Satellite views of cross-strait sediment transport in the Taiwan Strait driven by Typhoon Morakot (2009)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - After landing on Taiwan Island, Typhoon Morakot crossed the Taiwan Strait and made a second landfall on the western coast of the strait. In this study, we investigated the impact of Typhoon Morakot on the marine environment and explored the dynamic mechanism for enhanced cross-strait sediment transport based on remote sensing data of sea surface temperature (SST) and total suspended matter (TSM) as well as wind vector data. The results showed that the SST significantly decreased along the typhoon path, while the TSM dramatically increased, with a tongue-shaped high-TSM water extending from coasts to the middle strait during the typhoon processes. The distributions of wind and the Ekman volume transport, calculated based on the wind stress, also revealed that the typhoon process was favorable for cross-strait sediment transport.The strong cyclonic wind stress associated with the typhoon could change the existing currents pattern and destroy the water stratification, which restricts sediment resuspension, and result in significant resuspension of seabed sediments, thereby increasing suspended particle concentration and mass transport flux in waters. Moreover, the cyclonic wind stress could produce typhoon-induced currents, leading to the redistribution of particles in the strait. Comparative analysis revealed that typhoon processes crossing either the Taiwan Strait or passing over the northern strait could significantly impact the pattern of sediment transport in the strait and increase the cross-strait transport of sediments, which are important to the formation of the mud belt in the middle of the Taiwan Strait.

TI  - The Lake Urmia environmental disaster in Iran: A look at aerosol pollution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia (LU) once was the second largest hypersaline lake in the world, covering up to 6000 km(2), but has undergone catastrophic desiccation in recent years resulting in loss of 90% of its area and extensive coverage by playas and marshlands that represent a source of salt and dust. This study examines daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2001 and 2015 over northwestern Iran, which encompasses LU. Intriguingly, salt emissions from the LU surface associated with ongoing desiccation do not drive the study region's AOD profile, whereas pollution transported from other regions and emissions around LU are more important. Signatures of increasing local crustal emissions are most evident outside of the peak dust season (January, February, and October) and on the periphery of LU. AOD has generally increased in the latter half of the study period with the onset of the AOD ramp-up starting a month earlier in the spring season when comparing 2009-2015 versus earlier years. Results indicate that suppression of emissions on the LU border is critical as the combined area of salt and salty soil bodies around LU have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past two decades, and disturbing these areas via activities such as grazing and salt harvesting on the lake surface can have more detrimental impacts on regional pollution as compared to benefits. These results have important implications for public health, climate, the hydrological cycle, and pollution control efforts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selection of passerine birds as bio-sentinel of persistent organic pollutants in terrestrial environment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A broad suite of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, were analyzed in pectoral muscle of eight terrestrial passerine bird species from an extensive e-waste recycling site in South China. Concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs, and DDTs in bird samples ranged from 1260-279,000, 121-14,200, and 31-7910 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. Insectivorous birds had significantly higher levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and DDTs than those in granivorous birds. Concentrations of POPs in resident insectivorous birds were significantly greater than those in migrant insectivorous birds. PCBs were the predominant pollutants in all bird species from the e-waste site, followed by PBDEs and DDTs, indicating that PCBs were mainly derived from e-wastes. The granivorous birds had higher proportions of hepta-CBs in total PCBs and higher proportions of octa-to deca-BDEs in total PBDEs compared with the insectivorous birds. The various dietary sources, migration behavior, and possible biotransformation were suspected as reasons of the distinct profiles of POPs in different bird species. The delta N-15 values were significantly and positively correlated with concentrations of POPs in resident insectivorous birds, but not in other passerine bird species, suggesting the influence of trophic levels on bioaccumulation of POPs in resident insectivorous birds. The resident insectivorous birds seem to be promising bio-sentinel of POPs in terrestrial environment around the e-waste sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of highway construction on land surface energy balance and local climate derived from LANDSAT satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive construction of highways has a major impact on the landscape and its structure. They can also influence local climate and heat fluxes in the surrounding area. After the removal of vegetation due to highway construction, the amount of solar radiation energy used for plant evapotranspiration (latent heat flux) decreases, bringing about an increase in landscape surface temperature, changing the local climate and increasing surface run-off. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the D8 highway construction (Central Bohemia, Czech Republic) on the distribution of solar radiation energy into the various heat fluxes (latent, sensible and ground heat flux) and related surface functional parameters (surface temperature and surface wetness). The aim was to describe the severity of the impact and the distance from the actual highway in which it can be observed. LANDSAT multispectral satellite images and field meteorological measurements were used to calculate surface functional parameters and heat balance before and during the highway construction. Construction of a four-lane highway can influence the heat balance of the landscape surface as far as 90 m in the perpendicular direction from the highway axis, i.e. up to 75 m perpendicular from its edge. During a summer day, the decrease in evapotranspired water can reach up to 43.7m(3) per highway kilometre. This means a reduced cooling effect, expressed as the decrease in latent heat flux, by an average of 29.7 MWh per day per highway kilometre and its surroundings. The loss of the cooling ability of the land surface by evaporation can lead to a rise in surface temperature by as much as 7 degrees C. Thus, the results indicate the impact of extensive line constructions on the local climate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: The magnetic technique using a magnetic tracer and handheld magnetometer was successfully evaluated in breast surgery. Residual tracer at the injection site can cause susceptibility artefacts on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), therefore for lesion localization a solid marker would be preferable. Four magnetic markers were developed for localization to evaluate its clinical applicability.Methods: Comparison was made of the maximum magnetic counts and artefact-volume on MRI.Results: All markers were successfully detected, the spring marker showed the highest mean magnetic counts (627.8 +/- 400.2, mean +/- SD) with unequal variances (p < .001) and the butterfly marker showed the smallest mean artefact-volume (11.1 +/- 2.3 cm(3)) with a significant difference between markers (p = .049).Conclusion: Localization using a magnetic marker is feasible and further evaluation is required within a clinical trial.

TI  - Filling the missing data gaps of daily MODIS AOD using spatiotemporal interpolation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol is an important component of the atmosphere that affects the environment, climate, and human health. Remote sensing is an efficient observation method for monitoring global aerosol distribution and changes over time. The daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level-2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) (Collection 6) product (10 km resolution) is often used to study climate change and air pollution. However, the product is prone to yielding large amounts of data gaps due to the unfeasibility of retrieving reliable estimates under cloudy conditions, and these data gaps inevitably affect the results and analysis of the product's application. In this study, a geostatistical data interpolation framework based on the spatiotemporal kriging method was implemented to interpolate satellite AOD products in Beijing, China. Compared to the ordinary kriging method for filling data gaps, the spatiotemporal interpolation not only utilizes spatial autocorrelation but also considers the temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelations between different locations. In the study region, the completeness of the spatiotemporal-interpolated AOD product reaches 67.73%, which is significantly superior to the completeness of the original MODIS product (14.27%) and that of the spatial kriging-interpolated AOD product (33.3%). The cross-validation results show that the mean absolute error of the spatiotemporal kriging results (0.07) is lower than that of the ordinary kriging (0.09). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Common Bean Subtelomeres Are Hot Spots of Recombination and Favor Resistance Gene Evolution
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtelomeres of most eukaryotes contain fast-evolving genes usually involved in adaptive processes. In common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), the Co-2 anthracnose resistance (R) locus corresponds to a cluster of nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich-repeat (NL) encoding sequences, the prevalent class of plant R genes. To study the recent evolution of this R gene cluster, we used a combination of sequence, genetic and cytogenetic comparative analyses between common bean genotypes from two distinct gene pools (Andean and Mesoamerican) that diverged 0.165 million years ago. Co-2 is a large subtelomeric cluster on chromosome 11 comprising from 32 (Mesoamerican) to 52 (Andean) NL sequences embedded within khipu satellite repeats. Since the recent split between Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools, the Co-2 cluster has experienced numerous gene-pool specific NL losses, leading to distinct NL repertoires. The high proportion of solo-LTR retrotransposons indicates that the Co-2 cluster is located in a hot spot of unequal intra-strand homologous recombination. Furthermore, we observe large segmental duplications involving both Non-Homologous End Joining and Homologous Recombination double-strand break repair pathways. Finally, the identification of a Mesoamerican-specific subtelomeric sequence reveals frequent interchromosomal recombinations between common bean subtelomeres. Altogether, our results highlight that common bean subtelomeres are hot spots of recombination and favor the rapid evolution of R genes. We propose that chromosome ends could act as R gene incubators in many plant genomes.

TI  - Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria in Nepal
T2  - TROPICAL DISEASES TRAVEL MEDICINE AND VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe national treatment guidelines of Nepal have adopted Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2004. Emergence of Artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) and beyond may become a threat for Nepal as well. The main objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drug artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated P. falciparum infected patients at health centers/hospitals treated over the period of 2 years (2013-2014).MethodsGiemsa stained thick and thin smears, prepared from uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients who visited the selected sentinel sites in Nepal during 2013 to 2014 and met the inclusion criteria that included parasitemia (1000-10,000 /mu L of blood), were evaluated until 28 days after ACTs treatment, following a World Health Organization (WHO) therapeutic efficacy protocol. Based on the re-occurrence of fever and resurge in parasitemia, the study patients were classified as resistant or susceptible. Blood specimens on filter papers were further analyzed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), specifically for the K13 propeller gene mutation (a recently identified molecular marker for ACT resistance).ResultsA total of 56,013 suspected malaria cases were screened for this study. Of which, 120 (0.21%) were infected with falciparum malaria. Out of 120, 28 cases of P. falciparum (28/120; 23.33%) were enrolled in the study, of which 24 cases completed the post-treatment follow up for 28 days. Only one case out of 24 (4%) was identified as a late treatment failure (LTF). K13 mutation, a proxy indicator for ACT resistance in parasites, was not detected on the day 1, which indicates resistance had not yet reached the molecular level.ConclusionOnly one case of late treatment failure was identified in this study. ACT combination using artemether-lumefantrine was still effective for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nepal. A close monitoring and supervision for ACT resistance is essential for future malaria treatment in Nepal.

T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Here a method for estimating the land-fast ice (LFI) extent from dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR mosaics of an Arctic study area over the Kara and Barents seas is presented. The method is based on temporal cross-correlation between adjacent daily SAR mosaics. The results are compared to the LFI of the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) ice charts. Two versions of the method were studied: in the first version (FMI-A) the overall performance was optimized, and in the second version (FMI-B) the target was a low LFI misdetection rate. FMI-A detected over 73% of the AARI ice chart LFI, and FMI-B a little over 50% of the AARI ice chart LFI. During the winter months the detection rates were higher than during the melt-down season for both the studied algorithm versions. An LFI time series covering the time period from October 2015 to the end of August 2017 computed using the proposed methodology is provided on the FMI ftp server. The time series will be extended twice annually.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal variations of aerosols over China from two decades of multi-satellite observations - Part 1: ATSR (1995-2011) and MODIS C6.1 (2000-2017)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) patterns and interannual and seasonal variations over China are discussed based on the AOD retrieved from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2, 1995-2002), the Advanced ATSR (AATSR, 2002-2012) (together ATSR) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite (2000-2017). The AOD products used were the ATSR Dual View (ADV) v2.31 AOD and the MODIS/Terra Collection 6.1 (C6.1) merged dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) AOD product. Together these datasets provide an AOD time series for 23 years, from 1995 to 2017. The difference between the AOD values retrieved from ATSR-2 and AATSR is small, as shown by pixel-by-pixel and monthly aggregate comparisons as well as validation results. This allows for the combination of the ATSR-2 and AATSR AOD time series into one dataset without offset correction.ADV and MODIS AOD validation results show similar high correlations with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD (0.88 and 0.92, respectively), while the corresponding bias is positive for MODIS (0.06) and negative for ADV (-0.07). Validation of the AOD products in similar conditions, when ATSR and MODIS/Terra over-passes are within 90 min of each other and when both ADV and MODIS retrieve AOD around AERONET locations, show that ADV performs better than MODIS in autumn, while MODIS performs slightly better in spring and summer. In winter, both ADV and MODIS underestimate the AERONET AOD.Similar AOD patterns are observed by ADV and MODIS in annual and seasonal aggregates as well as in time series. ADV-MODIS difference maps show that MODIS AOD is generally higher than that from ADV. Both ADV and MODIS show similar seasonal AOD behavior. The AOD maxima shift from spring in the south to summer along the eastern coast further north.The agreement between sensors regarding year-to-year AOD changes is quite good. During the period from 1995 to 2006 AOD increased in the southeast (SE) of China. Between 2006 and 2011 AOD did not change much, showing minor minima in 2008-2009. From 2011 onward AOD decreased in the SE of China. Similar patterns exist in year-to-year ADV and MODIS annual AOD tendencies in the overlapping period. However, regional differences between the ATSR and MODIS AODs are quite large. The consistency between ATSR and MODIS with regards to the AOD tendencies in the overlapping period is rather strong in summer, autumn and overall for the yearly average; however, in winter and spring, when there is a difference in coverage between the two instruments, the agreement between ATSR and MODIS is lower.AOD tendencies in China during the 1995-2017 period will be discussed in more detail in Part 2 (a following paper: Sogacheva et al., 2018), where a method to combine AOD time series from ADV and MODIS is introduced, and combined AOD time series are analyzed.

TI  - Community involvement in design, implementation and evaluation of nutrition interventions to reduce chronic diseases in indigenous populations in the US: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Indigenous peoples of the United States disproportionately experience chronic diseases associated with poor nutrition, including obesity and diabetes. While chronic disease related health disparities among Indigenous people are well documented, it is unknown whether interventions adequately address these health disparities. In addition, it is unknown whether and to what extent interventions are culturally adapted or tailored to the unique culture, worldview and nutrition environments of Indigenous people. The aim of this review was to identify and characterize nutrition interventions conducted with Indigenous populations in the US, and to determine whether and to what degree communities are involved in intervention design, implementation and evaluation.Methods: Peer-reviewed articles were identified using MEDLINE. Articles included were published in English in a refereed journal between 2000 and 2015, reported on a diet-related intervention in Indigenous populations in the US, and reported outcome data. Data extracted were program objectives and activities, target population, geographic region, formative research to inform design and evaluation, partnership, capacity building, involvement of the local food system, and outcomes. Narrative synthesis of intervention characteristics and the degree and type of community involvement was performed.Results: Of 1060 records identified, 49 studies were included. Overall, interventions were successful in producing changes in knowledge, behavior or health (79%). Interventions mostly targeted adults in the Western region and used a pre-test, post-test design. Involvement of communities in intervention design, implementation, and evaluation varied from not at all to involvement at all stages. Of programs reporting significant changes in outcomes, more than half used at least three strategies to engage communities. However, formative research to inform the evaluation was not performed to a great degree, and fewer than half of the programs identified described involvement of the local food system.Conclusions: The extent of use of strategies to promote community engagement in programs reporting significant outcomes is notable. In planning interventions in Indigenous groups, researchers should consider ways to involve the community in intervention design, execution and evaluation. There is a particular need for studies focused on Indigenous youth in diverse regions of the US to further address diet-related chronic conditions.

TI  - An update on global atmospheric ice estimates from satellite observations and reanalyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the global distribution of mean atmospheric ice mass from current state-of-the-art estimates and its variability on daily and seasonal timescales. Ice water path (IWP) retrievals from active and passive satellite platforms are analysed and compared with estimates from two reanalysis data sets, ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5, ECMWF) and MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications 2). Large discrepancies in IWP exist between the satellite data sets themselves, making validation of the model results problematic and indicating that progress towards a consensus on the distribution of atmospheric ice has been limited. Comparing the data sets, zonal means of IWP exhibit similar shapes but differing magnitudes, with large IWP values causing much of the difference in means. Diurnal analysis centred on A-Train overpasses shows similar structures in some regions, but the degree and sign of the variability varies widely; the reanalyses exhibit noisier and higher-amplitude diurnal variability than borne out by the satellite estimates. Spatial structures governed by the atmospheric general circulation are fairly consistent across the data sets, as principal component analysis shows that the patterns of seasonal variability line up well between the data sets but disagree in severity. These results underscore the limitations of the current Earth observing system with respect to atmospheric ice, as the level of consensus between observations is mixed. The large-scale variability of IWP is relatively consistent, whereas disagreements on diurnal variability and global means point to varying microphysical assumptions in retrievals and models alike that seem to underlie the biggest differences.

TI  - Who will win where and why? An ecophysiological dissection of the competition between a tropical pasture grass and the invasive weed Bracken over an elevation range of 1000 m in the tropical Andes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical agriculture, the vigorously growing Bracken fern causes severe problems by invading pastures and out-competing the common pasture grasses. Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian Andes, the planted forage grass Setaria sphacelata and the weed Bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum). With increasing elevation, the competitive power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m. The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria, the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation. Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its cellular UV screen.

TI  - Heterogeneous changes in the surface area of lakes in the Kangerlussuaq area of southwestern Greenland between 1995 and 2017
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has increased temperatures and precipitation in the Arctic throughout the past thirty years. Lakes across the Arctic have demonstrated spatially and temporally variable trends in size and number because of these climate changes. Modifications in the hydrological budget and surface hydrology of Arctic regions have important implications for aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Since 1960 the ice-free region of southwestern Greenland (between Sisimiut, Kangerlussuaq, and the ice margin) has experienced temperature increases, while precipitation has risen at the coast at Sisimiut and has fallen inland at Kangerlussuaq. However, it remains unknown whether the lakes in this region have responded to these temperature and precipitation changes. Therefore, the surface area of 186 lakes was calculated from Landsat imagery for 1995, 2002, 2015, 2016, and 2017 to establish whether lakes in this region have changed in size during a twenty-two-year period. Lake surface area decreased by 855,449 m(2) between 1995 and 2017. The greatest lake surface area changes occurred between 2002 and 2015, with large variations also between 2015 and 2016. Lakes close to Kangerlussuaq (area 1) demonstrated the greatest loss in lake surface area (-1.40 km(2)). It is proposed that this trend reflects high evaporation totals as a result of increasing temperatures and longer ice-free periods in this area. Lakes close to Sisimiut at the coast (area 2) exhibit a net increase in lake surface area, which could reflect the increase in precipitation experienced in this area during the study period. However, not all lakes in the study areas responded in a uniform manner. These heterogeneous changes in lake surface area may reflect how changes in regional climate are interacting with catchment geomorphology, and highlight the importance of individual catchment and lake characteristics in determining lake response to climatic change in this region.

TI  - Net radiative effects of dust in the tropical North Atlantic based on integrated satellite observations and in situ measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we integrate recent in situ measurements with satellite retrievals of dust physical and radiative properties to quantify dust direct radiative effects on shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation (denoted as DRESW and DRELW, respectively) in the tropical North Atlantic during the summer months from 2007 to 2010. Through linear regression of the CERES-measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux versus satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals, we estimate the instantaneous DRESW efficiency at the TOA to be -49.7 +/- 7.1 W m(-2) AOD(-1) and -36.5 +/- 4.8 W m(-2) AOD(-1) based on AOD from MODIS and CALIOP, respectively. We then perform various sensitivity studies based on recent measurements of dust particle size distribution (PSD), refractive index, and particle shape distribution to determine how the dust microphysical and optical properties affect DRE estimates and its agreement with the above-mentioned satellite-derived DREs. Our analysis shows that a good agreement with the observation-based estimates of instantaneous DRESW and DRELW can be achieved through a combination of recently observed PSD with substantial presence of coarse particles, a less absorptive SW refractive index, and spheroid shapes. Based on this optimal combination of dust physical properties we further estimate the diurnal mean dust DRESW in the region of -10 W m(-2) at TOA and -26 W m(-2) at the surface, respectively, of which similar to 30% is canceled out by the positive DRELW. This yields a net DRE of about -6.9 and -18.3 W m(-2) at TOA and the surface, respectively. Our study suggests that the LW flux contains useful information on dust particle size, which could be used together with SW observations to achieve a more holistic understanding of the dust radiative effect.

TI  - Intra-annual variations of regional aerosol optical depth, vertical distribution, and particle types from multiple satellite and ground-based observational datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic and health effects of aerosols are strongly dependent on the intra-annual variations in their loading and properties. While the seasonal variations of regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been extensively studied, understanding the temporal variations in aerosol vertical distribution and particle types is also important for an accurate estimate of aerosol climatic effects. In this paper, we combine the observations from four satellite-borne sensors and several ground-based networks to investigate the seasonal variations of aerosol column loading, vertical distribution, and particle types over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). In all three regions, column AOD, as well as AOD at heights above 800 m, peaks in summer/spring, probably due to accelerated formation of secondary aerosols and hygroscopic growth. In contrast, AOD below 800 m peaks in winter over WEU and ECC regions because more aerosols are confined to lower heights due to the weaker vertical mixing. In the EUS region, AOD below 800 m shows two maximums, one in summer and the other in winter. The temporal trends in low-level AOD are consistent with those in surface fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations. AOD due to fine particles (< 0.7 mu m diameter) is much larger in spring/summer than in winter over all three regions. However, the coarse mode AOD (> 1.4 mu m diameter), generally shows small variability, except that a peak occurs in spring in the ECC region due to the prevalence of airborne dust during this season. When aerosols are classified according to sources, the dominant type is associated with anthropogenic air pollution, which has a similar seasonal pattern as total AOD. Dust and sea-spray aerosols in the WEU region peak in summer and winter, respectively, but do not show an obvious seasonal pattern in the EUS region. Smoke aerosols, as well as absorbing aerosols, present an obvious unimodal distribution with a maximum occurring in summer over the EUS and WEU regions, whereas they follow a bimodal distribution with peaks in August and March (due to crop residue burning) over the ECC region.

TI  - Utilizing Pacific Methodologies as Inclusive Practice
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - For academics embarking on research with Pacific people for the benefit of Pacific communities or issues, what is paramount is the need for Pacific methodologies to be adopted as well as adapted, to improve communication and rapport with prospective participants. When one thinks of research of a Pacific nature, it is not until existing Pacific methodologies are known that one ponders on the type of methodology best suits one's research practice. Since Smith's research on the importance for the decolonization process to be more at the fore regarding research undertaken about, for, and with indigenous groups, there has been a growing shift away from Eurocentric frameworks. Movement away enables improved understanding and communication with Pacific people and issues; it also confirms the appropriateness of Pacific methodologies to enhance research in general. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has similar elements found in Pacific methodologies; positive outcomes between both researcher and stakeholders are key during planning and implementation stages. By working alongside community partners, researchers work toward implementing research data collection and collation methods with the assistance of indigenous (in this case, Pacific experts and leaders of Pacific communities) to benefit and advance social change and social justice (Holkup et al., 2004; Minkler, 2004; Petrucka et al., 2012; Walters et al., 2009). It may be time consuming at research commencement stage, but worthwhile pursuing to ensure all stakeholders involved in the research are aware of expectations and benefit from the outcomes of research pursued.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the reasons for the fluctuations in the percentage of outpatient or emergency visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) during the Spring Festival and National Day in 2014-2018 surveillance season. Methods: ILI surveillance data was collected during the period of Spring Festival and National Day in mainland China, and downloaded from Chinese Influenza Surveillance Information System, during the 2014-2018 surveillance season. Results: There was no significant difference noticed in the number of ILI reports in the festival week with weeks before or after in both the southern and northern provinces. The number of outpatient visits was much less than that of the week before and after, but the number of emergency visits was statistically significantly increased. Conclusion: In the holiday peak of ILI%, the major causes was the impact of holiday-off at sentinel hospitals, resulting in a large reduction in the number of outpatient visits in the consulting room during the festivals.

TI  - Objective Lagrangian Vortex Detection in the Solar Photosphere
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vortices in the solar photosphere can be linked to a wide range of events, such as small-scale solar eruptions, wave excitation, and heating of the upper part of the solar atmosphere. Despite their importance in solar physics, most of the current studies on photospheric vortices are based on methods that are not invariant under time-dependent translations and rotations of the reference frame and are Eulerian; i.e., they are based on single snapshots of a velocity field and, therefore, do not convey information on the true long-term motion of fluid particles on a time-varying field. Another issue with methods for vortex detection is that typically they provide false identifications in highly compressible flows. This Letter presents a novel criterion that effectively removes wrong detections based on the geometry of the streamlines of the displacement vector of fluid elements and can be readily applied to other astrophysical flows. The new criterion is applied to the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation (LAVD), which is a recently developed frame invariant vortex detection method. The advantage of LAVD is that it delimits the vortices' outer boundaries precisely by following up the trajectories of fluid elements in space and time. The proposed method is compared with two other techniques using horizontal velocity fields extracted from Hinode satellite data.

TI  - NPP VIIRS Data Fast Atmospheric Correction and Accuracy Evaluation Based on 6S Model
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A fast atmospheric correction method is used to eliminate the effects of the atmosphere on electromagnetic wave transmission. Aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction look-up tables are constructed based on the atmospheric radiation transmission model. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is derived by the dark target algorithm. The atmospheric correction parameters are calculated by the pixels. Using the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) data on a new polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite, we analyze the difference of vegetation reflectance and water reflectance, and the change of normalized difference vegetation index before and after atmospheric correction. In addition, the results of the fast atmospheric correction are also verified by the measured spectral data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface albedo data. The verified results show that the spectral curve of ground object after the atmospheric correction is closer to the measured spectral curve. Compared with MODIS surface reflectance products, the fast atmospheric correction is of high accuracy, and the error is less than +/- 0.04, so it has more quantitative applications of remote sensing data.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of influenza in Guangdong province, during the winter of 2017-2018, to provide evidence for response to the diversity of influenza, in different seasonal patterns. Methods: Data on weekly influenza surveillance from January 2016 to April 2018, were collected in Guangdong. Information on patients with Influenza-like illness (ILI), on influenza virus positive rates and on outbreaks during the winter of 2017 to 2018, was analyzed and compared with those in spring of 2016 and summer of 2017. chi(2) test and Fisher exact test were used. Results: In the above said winter, the average percentage of visits for ILI in 28 hospitals where sentinel surveillance program had been set, was 4.99% (157 235/3 149 656), which was above the level of the same period in the previous five years. The positive rates of influenza virus among samples collected from ILI outpatients and hospitalized cases under severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were 28.33% (2 137/7 543) and 14.93% (256/1 715), with the proportions of B (Yamagata) as 70.43% (1 505/2 137) and 73.05% (187/256) respectively. A total of 257 influenza outbreaks were reported in the winter period, with 82.49% (212/257) occurred in elementary schools. Cases aged 6-14 years occurred in winter and spring appeared of having higher positive rate than those seen in summer (P<0.05) whereas elderly cases aged 60 and above showed higher positive rate in summer than those in winter and spring two seasons (P<0.05).

TI  - Factors associated with severe neurologic complications in patients with either hand-foot-mouth disease or herpangina: A nationwide observational study in South Korea, 2009-2014
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2009, a nationwide sentinel surveillance for hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (HA) with neurologic complications was initiated in South Korea. We used this surveillance system to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with either HFMD or HA with neurologic complications, with the aim of determining risk factors for severe neurologic complications.MethodsA retrospective review of medical records was conducted on all cases of HFMD and HA with neurologic complications that were reported in the national system between April 1,2009 and December 31,2014. A severe case was defined as having HFMD or HA with encephalitis, polio-like syndrome, or cardiopulmonary failure, and less-severe cases were defined as having HFMD or HA with aseptic meningitis.ResultsA total of 138 cases (less-severe: 90/138, 65.2%; severe: 48/138, 24.8%) were included from 28 hospitals; 28 ineligible cases were excluded. Of 48 severe cases, 27 (56.2%) had encephalitis; 14 (29.2%) had polio-like syndrome; and seven (14.6%) had cardiopulmonary syndrome. The median patient age was 36 months (IQR: 18-60) and 63 (45.7%) patients were female. Most patients completely recovered, except for seven cases that were fatal or resulted in long-term symptoms (5.1%, 3 patients with neurologic sequelae and 4 deaths). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, lethargy (OR = 4.67, 95% CI: 1.37-15.96, P = 0.014), female sex (OR = 3.51,95% CI: 1.17-10.50, P = 0.025), and enterovirus A71 (OR = 3.55, 95% CI: 1.09-11.57, P = 0.035) were significantly associated with severe neurologic complications in HFMD and HA patients.ConclusionIn patients with HFMD and HA, lethargy, female, and enterovirus A71 may predict severe neurologic complications.

TI  - On the improved stability of the version 7 MIPAS ozone record
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) was an infrared limb emission spectrometer on the Envisat platform. From 2002 to 2012, it performed pole-to-pole measurements during day and night, producing more than 1000 profiles per day. The European Space Agency (ESA) recently released the new version 7 of Level 1B MIPAS spectra, in which a new set of time-dependent correction coefficients for the nonlinearity in the detector response functions was implemented. This change is expected to reduce the long-term drift of the MIPAS Level 2 data. We evaluate the long-term stability of ozone Level 2 data retrieved from MIPAS v7 Level 1B spectra with the IMK/IAA scientific level 2 processor. For this, we compare MIPAS data with ozone measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, ozonesondes and ground-based lidar instruments. The ozonesondes and lidars alone do not allow us to conclude with enough significance that the new version is more stable than the previous one, but a clear improvement in long-term stability is observed in the satellite-data-based drift analysis. The results of ozonesondes, lidars and satellite drift analysis are consistent: all indicate that the drifts of the new version are less negative/more positive nearly everywhere above 15 km. The 10-year MIPAS ozone trends calculated from the old and the new data versions are compared. The new trends are closer to old drift-corrected trends than the old uncorrected trends were. From this, we conclude that the nonlinearity correction performed on Level 1B data is an improvement. These results indicate that MIPAS data are now even more suited for trend studies, alone or as part of a merged data record.

TI  - Multiple PDE5Is use as a marker of decreased overall men's health: A real-life study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) is considered a sentinel marker for poor general men's health status. Severe ED has been associated with poor response to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5ls) therapy. We sought to assess the association of multiple PDE5ls prescription with the overall patients' health status. Socio-demographic and clinical variables from 939 consecutive white-European, heterosexual, sexually-active men seeking medical help for ED at same tertiary-referral academic outpatient clinic were analyzed. Health-significant comorbidities were scored with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Patients have been stratified into naive and non-naive according to their history of previous prescriptions of any PDE5I. Every patient completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Logistic regression models tested the association between patients' baseline characteristics (thus including previous PDE5ls prescriptions) and the overall health status. Overall, 328 (35%) patients were non-naive for PDE5ls. Of them, 172 (52%), 99 (30%), and 57 (17%) had been prescribed with 1, 2 or 3 different PDE5ls, respectively. Naive and non-naive patients did not differ in terms of age, BMI, baseline ED severity; conversely, non-naive patients had a higher CCI score. At logistic MVA, the number of PDE5ls prescriptions emerged as an independent predictor of a higher burden of comorbidities regardless of ED severity; the higher the number of PDE5ls prescriptions, the higher the CCI score (OR 1.69, 2.49, and 2.90 for 1, 2 or 3 previous PDE5ls, respectively), after accounting for age, BMI, baseline ED severity and cigarette smoking. More than a third of patients seeking medical help for ED at a single tertiary-referral center were non-naive for PDE5ls. The increasing number of previous prescriptions of PDE5ls emerged as a worrisome marker of a poorer overall men's health status regardless of ED severity.

TI  - Highly Ionized Calcium Argon X-Ray Spectra from a Large Solar Flare
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - X-ray lines of helium-like calcium (Ca XIX) between 3.17 and 3.21 A and associated Ca XVIII dielectronic satellites have previously been observed in solar flare spectra, and their excitation mechanisms are well established. Dielectronic satellites of lower-ionization stages (Ca XVII-Ca XV) are not as well characterized. Several spectra during a large solar flare in 2001 by the DIOGENESS X-ray spectrometer on the CORONAS-F spacecraft show the Ca XVII and Ca XVI satellites, as well as lines of ionized argon (Ar XVII, Ar XVI), including dielectronic satellites. The DIOGENESS spectra are compared with spectra from a synthesis code developed here based on an isothermal assumption with various atomic sources including dielectronic satellite data from the Cowan Hartree-Fock code. Best-fit comparisons are made by varying the temperature as the code's input (Ar/Ca abundance ratio fixed at 0.33); close agreement is achieved, although with adjustments to some ion fractions. The derived temperature is close to that derived from the two GOES X-ray channels, T-GOES. Some lines are identified for the first time. Similar spectra from the P78-1 spacecraft and the Alcator C-Mod tokamak have also been analyzed and similar agreements were obtained. The importance of blends of calcium and argon lines is emphasized, affecting line ratios used for temperature diagnostics. This analysis will be applied to the Solar Maximum Mission Bent Crystal Spectrometer archive and to X-ray spectra expected from the ChemiX instrument on the Sun-orbiting Interhelioprobe spacecraft, while the relevance to X-ray spectra from non-solar sources is indicated.

TI  - Optical Concealment Depth Estimation Algorithm Based on Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to obtain the optical concealment depth of underwater submersible by satellite remote sensing data inversion and realize large scale measurement in time and space, we propose an optical concealment depth remote sensing inversion method based on the quasi analytical algorithm (QAA). At the same time, it is a new way for underwater vehicle equipped with the optical concealment depth measuring device. According to the optical depth concealment model, Aqua-MODIS and Terra-MODIS satellite remote sensing reflectance data is used on the grid. After preprocessing the data, the remote sensing reflectance cross calibration data quality control is completed, and the Terra and Aqua satellite data is cross-corrected. According to quasi analytical algorithm and Doron algorithm, the optical concealment depth remote sensing inversion model is established. The optical depth concealment fusion product for specific sea area is made. Three bands remote sensing reflectance data of 443 nm, 488 nm, and 555 nm is inputted for the model. The data level is L3m, and spatial resolution is 4 km. The longitude range of data is from 100 degrees E to 125 degrees E, and the latitude range is from 10 degrees N to 38 degrees N. The results show that, based on quasi analytical algorithm, optical concealment depth remote sensing inversion technology is a feasible path. A new method to obtain optical depth concealment is developed. The method provides a calibration method for underwater vehicle equipped with the optical concealment depth measuring device, and it also provides important technical support for underwater optical depth detection and anti-detection and other military applications.

TI  - Downscaling of SMAP Soil Moisture Using Land Surface Temperature and Vegetation Data
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) sensor is currently provided at a 9-km grid resolution. Although valuable, some applications in weather, agriculture, ecology, and watershed hydrology require soil moisture at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, a passive microwave soil moisture downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia theory was improved for use with SMAP and applied to a data set collected at a field experiment. This algorithm utilizes a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) modulated relationship between daytime soil moisture and daily temperature change modeled using output variables from the land surface model of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and remote sensing data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The reference component of the algorithm was developed at the NLDAS grid size (12.5 km) to downscale the SMAP Level 3 radiometer-based 9-km soil moisture to 1 km. The downscaled results were validated using data acquired in Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15) that included in situ soil moisture and Passive Active L-band System (PALS) airborne instrument observations. The resulting downscaled SMAP estimates better characterize soil moisture spatial and temporal variability and have better overall validation metrics than the original SMAP soil moisture estimates. Additionally, the overall accuracy of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture is comparable to the PALS high spatial resolution soil moisture retrievals. The method demonstrated in this study downscales satellite soil moisture to produce a 1-km product that is not site specific and could be applied to other regions of the world using the publicly available NLDAS/Global Land Data Assimilation System data.

TI  - Description and applications of a mobile system performing on-road aerosol remote sensing and in situ measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of ground-based aerosols observations are limited to fixed locations, narrowing the knowledge on their spatial variability. In order to overcome this issue, a compact Mobile Aerosol Monitoring System (MAMS) was developed to explore the aerosol vertical and spatial variability. This mobile laboratory is equipped with a micropulse lidar, a sun photometer and an aerosol spectrometer. It is distinguished from other transportable platforms through its ability to perform on-road measurements and its unique feature lies in the sun photometer's capacity for tracking the sun during motion. The system presents a great flexibility, being able to respond quickly in case of sudden aerosol events such as pollution episodes, dust, fire or volcano outbreaks. On-road mapping of aerosol physical parameters such as attenuated aerosol backscatter, aerosol optical depth, particle number and mass concentration and size distribution is achieved through the MAMS. The performance of remote sensing instruments on-board has been evaluated through intercomparison with instruments in reference networks (i.e. AERONET and EARLINET), showing that the system is capable of providing high quality data. This also illustrates the application of such a system for instrument intercomparison field campaigns. Applications of the mobile system have been exemplified through two case studies in northern France. MODIS AOD data was compared to ground-based mobile sun photometer data. A good correlation was observed with R-2 of 0.76, showing the usefulness of the mobile system for validation of satellite-derived products. The performance of BSC-DREAM8b dust model has been tested by comparison of results from simulations for the lidar-sun-photometer derived extinction coefficient and mass concentration profiles. The comparison indicated that observations and the model are in good agreement in describing the vertical variability of dust layers. Moreover, on-road measurements of PM10 were compared with modelled PM10 concentrations and with ATMO Hauts-de-France and AIRPARIF air quality in situ measurements, presenting an excellent agreement in horizontal spatial representativity of PM10. This proves a possible application of mobile platforms for evaluating the chemistry-models performances.

TI  - A global synthesis inversion analysis of recent variability in CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes using GOSAT and in situ observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise contribution of the two major sinks for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, terrestrial vegetation and the ocean, and their location and year-to-year variability are not well understood. Top-down estimates of the spatiotemporal variations in emissions and uptake of CO2 are expected to benefit from the increasing measurement density brought by recent in situ and remote CO2 observations. We uniquely apply a batch Bayesian synthesis inversion at relatively high resolution to in situ surface observations and bias-corrected GOSAT satellite column CO2 retrievals to deduce the global distributions of natural CO2 fluxes during 2009-2010. The GOSAT inversion is generally better constrained than the in situ inversion, with smaller posterior regional flux uncertainties and correlations, because of greater spatial coverage, except over North America and northern and southern high-latitude oceans. Complementarity of the in situ and GOSAT data enhances uncertainty reductions in a joint inversion; however, remaining coverage gaps, including those associated with spatial and temporal sampling biases in the passive satellite measurements, still limit the ability to accurately resolve fluxes down to the sub-continental or subocean basin scale. The GOSAT inversion produces a shift in the global CO2 sink from the tropics to the north and south relative to the prior, and an increased source in the tropics of similar to 2 PgC yr(-1) relative to the in situ inversion, similar to what is seen in studies using other inversion approaches. This result may be driven by sampling and residual retrieval biases in the GOSAT data, as suggested by significant discrepancies between posterior CO2 distributions and surface in situ and HIPPO mission aircraft data. While the shift in the global sink appears to be a robust feature of the inversions, the partitioning of the sink between land and ocean in the inversions using either in situ or GOSAT data is found to be sensitive to prior uncertainties because of negative correlations in the flux errors. The GOSAT inversion indicates significantly less CO2 uptake in the summer of 2010 than in 2009 across northern regions, consistent with the impact of observed severe heat waves and drought. However, observations from an in situ network in Siberia imply that the GOSAT inversion exaggerates the 2010-2009 difference in uptake in that region, while the prior CASA-GFED model of net ecosystem production and fire emissions reasonably estimates that quantity. The prior, in situ posterior, and GOSAT posterior all indicate greater uptake over North America in spring to early summer of 2010 than in 2009, consistent with wetter conditions. The GOSAT inversion does not show the expected impact on fluxes of a 2010 drought in the Amazon; evaluation of posterior mole fractions against local aircraft profiles suggests that time-varying GOSAT coverage can bias the estimation of interannual flux variability in this region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and arabmoxylooligosacchandes (AXOS) could be used to selectively favor growth of certain gut bacterial groups. The objective of this research was to understand how the structural differences of XOS and AXOS influenced the growth of Bacteroides species commonly found in the intestine. We report that the specific structural details of XOS and AXOS dictate the differential growth of Bacteroides species in the intestine. We also investigated the expression of two polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in a strain of Bacteroides ovatus upon growth on AXOS using three different susC transcripts as sentinel reporter genes 2(3)-alpha-L-Arabinofuranosyl-xylotnose (A4) was shown to upregulate small xylan PUL gene expression, while 2(3),3(3)-di-alpha-L-arabmofuranosyl-xylotnose (A6) decreased expression of this PUL. These results reveal new details about the potentially very specific structure-function relationship of XOS and AXOS that could be used in targeted alteration of the microbial population in the gut through dietary interventions to maintain health.

Here, we address a critical aspect of this inquiry by investigating how people consider the socio-relational nature of their own agency, particularly the influence of others on their perceived control over their decisions and actions. Specifically, in a series of studies using contrastive vignettes, we examine public attitudes about when external influences on everyday decisions are perceived as "undue" - that is, as undermining the control conditions for these decisions to be considered autonomous - vs. when they are perceived as appropriate and even supportive of autonomous decision-making. We found that the influence of preauthorized agents - individuals and institutions with whom we share a worldview was judged to be less undue than non-preauthorized agents, even after controlling for the familiarity of the agent. These effects persisted irrespective of the extent to which respondents identified as communitarian or individualistic, and were consistent across two distinct scenarios. We also found that external influences that were rational were perceived as less undue than those that were arational. Our study opens new avenues of inquiry into the "folk conception" of autonomy, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the ethics of public policies designed to influence decisions and for information sharing in social networks.

TI  - Development of method for active alignment of multiple time delay and integration detectors in the optically butted focal plane assembly of high-resolution spaceborne imaging systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time delay and integration (TDI) detectors are preferred image sensors for high-resolution spaceborne imaging systems for cartographic applications as they provide higher sensitivity by integrating charges over multiple TDI stages in push broom mode. Large swath requirements are met using multiple TDI detectors in optical butting configuration in the focal plane assembly (FPA) to form a single image line on the ground. These detectors need to be aligned with subpixel accuracy to avoid motion smear and errors in the image mosaicking process. Alignment of the multiple TDI detectors in the FPA is a challenging task and is accomplished using custom methods and setups. Passive alignment techniques rely on very high-resolution microscopes for achieving desired accuracies. Active method requires TDI detectors to be operated in staring mode, which is architecturally and functionally not supported by TDI detectors. We developed a scheme for operating the TDI detectors in staring mode without any smear effects to aid in the active alignment process. Based on this, we propose an active alignment approach. The proposed approach is highly advantageous as it can be used throughout the imaging system development phase to demonstrate stability of the alignment and also helps in cross validation with the passive alignment. The developed method was test validated on qualification model FPA, and alignment accuracy of the order of 0.4 mu m in tilt and 1.2 mu m in line shift has been demonstrated, against the requirements of +/- 1.5 mu m. This method has been extensively used in Cartosat-25 series imaging systems and will be very useful for upcoming high-resolution missions of the Indian Space Research Organisation.

T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality globally and are vaccine preventable. The WHO-coordinated Global Rotavirus and Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Networks support surveillance systems across WHO regions to provide burden of disease data for countries to make evidence-based decisions about introducing vaccines and to demonstrate the impact of vaccines on disease burden. These surveillance networks help fill the gaps in data in low and middle-income countries where disease burden and risk are high but support to sustain surveillance activities and generate data is low. Through a series of country case studies, this paper reviews the successful use of surveillance data for disease caused by pneumococcus and rotavirus in informing national vaccine policy in Bangladesh, Armenia and The Gambia. The case studies delve into ways in which countries are leveraging and building capacity in existing surveillance infrastructure to monitor other diseases of concern in the country. Local institutions have been identified to play a critical role in making surveillance data available to policymakers. We recommend that countries review local or regional surveillance data in making vaccine policy decisions. Documenting use of surveillance activities can be used as advocacy tools to convince governments and external funders to invest in surveillance and make it a priority immunization activity.

TI  - Haemolytic uremic syndrome surveillance in children less than 15 years in Belgium, 2009-2015
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is the most severe manifestation of infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). In Belgium, the surveillance of paediatric HUS cases is conducted by a sentinel surveillance network of paediatricians called Pedisurv. In this article, we present the main findings of this surveillance from 2009 to 2015 and we describe an annual incidence of HUS.Methods: For each case of HUS < 15 years notified by the paediatricians, clinical, microbiological and epidemiological data were collected by a questionnaire. National hospital discharge data with ICD-9 code 283.11 were used to calculate the incidence of HUS in children < 15 years.Results: From 2009 to 2015, 110 cases were notified to the Pedisurv network with a mean annual notification rate of 0. 8/100,000 in children < 15 years. Death occurred in 2.5% of all patients and the median number of days of hospitalization was 10 days. One third (35.4%) of the HUS cases were confirmed positive STEC, with a majority of STEC O157. The mean annual incidence based on the hospital discharge data was 3.2/100,000 in children < 15 years and 4.5/100,000 in children < 5 years.Conclusion: The incidence of paediatric HUS in Belgium is high compared to other European countries. Its surveillance in Belgium is quite comprehensive and, although less effective than monitoring all STEC infections to detect the emergence of outbreaks, is important to better monitor circulation of the most pathogenic STEC strains. In this context, efforts are still needed to send samples and STEC strains from HUS cases to the National Reference Centre.

TI  - Assessing the Use of Area- and Time-Averaging Based on Known De-correlation Scales to Provide Satellite Derived Sea Surface Temperatures in Coastal Areas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are often used as a proxy for in situ water temperatures, as they are readily available over large spatial and temporal scales. However, contamination of satellite images can prohibit their use in coastal areas. We compared in situ temperatures to SST foundation (similar to 10 m depth) at 31 sites inshore of the East Australian Current (EAC), the dynamic western boundary current of the south Pacific gyre, using an area averaging approach to overcome coastal contamination. Varying across- and along-shelf distances were used to area average SST measurements and de-correlation time scales were used to gap fill data. As the EAC is typically anisotropic (dominant along-shore flow) the choice of across-shelf distances influenced the correlation with in situ temperatures more than along-shelf distances. However, the "optimal" distances for both measurements were within known de-correlation length scales. Incorporating both SST area and time averaging (based on de-correlation time scales) produced data for an average of 96% of days that in situ loggers were deployed, compared to 27% (52%) without (with) area averaging. Temperature differences between the in situ data and SSTs varied depending on time of year, with higher differences in the austral summer when daily in situ temperatures can range by up to 4.20 degrees C. The differences between the in situ and SST measurements were, however, significant with or without area averaging (t-test: p-values < 0.05). Nevertheless, when using the area averaging approaches SSTs were only an average of similar to 1.05 degrees C different from in situ temperatures and less than in situ temperature fluctuations. Linear mixed models revealed that latitude, distance to the coast and nearest estuary did not influence the difference between the in situ and satellite data as much as the water depth. This study shows that using de-correlation length and time scales to inform how to process satellite data can overcome contamination and missing data thereby greatly increasing the coverage and utility of SST data, particularly in coastal areas.

TI  - Epidemiological aspects of travel-related systemic endemic mycoses: a GeoSentinel analysis, 1997-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: International travel has increased in the past few decades, placing more travellers at risk of acquiring systemic endemic mycoses. There are limited published data on systemic endemic mycoses among international travellers. We report epidemiological characteristics of non-migrant, international travellers who acquired systemic endemic mycoses during travel.Methods: We analysed records of non-migrant international travellers with a confirmed diagnosis of histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis or talaromycosis reported from 1997 through 2017 to GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network now consisting of 70 travel or tropical medicine centres in 31 countries.Results: Sixty-nine records met the inclusion criteria. Histoplasmosis was most frequently reported; the 51 travellers with histoplasmosis had the lowest median age (30 years; range: 8-85) and shortest median duration of travel (12 days; range: 5-154). Coccidioidomycosis was reported in 14 travellers; travellers with coccidioidomycosis were older (median 62 years; range: 22-78) and had the longest median number of days between return from travel and presentation to a GeoSentinel site (55 days; range: 17-273). Almost all travellers with coccidioidomycosis were exposed in the USA. Other systemic endemic mycoses were less frequently reported, including blastomycosis (three travellers) and talaromycosis (one traveller).Conclusions: Although relatively rare, systemic endemic mycoses should be considered as potential travel-related infections in non-migrant international travellers. Epidemiological exposures should be used to guide diagnostic evaluations and treatment.

TI  - Iodine deficiency in pregnant women after the adoption of the new provincial standard for salt iodization in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Zhejiang has achieved the goal of elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) via the implementation of universal salt iodization (USI) since 2011. Iodine content in household table salt decreased from the national standard (35 ppm) to the Zhejiang provincial standard (25 ppm) in 2012. It is crucial to periodically monitor iodine status in pregnant women because IDD in pregnancy have adverse effects on fetal neurodevelopment.Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study between April 2014 and September 2015 in the eight sentinel surveillance counties across Zhejiang Province, where IDD was previously known to be endemic. A total of 1304 pregnant women participated and provided a random spot urine sample and a household table salt sample. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was determined using arsenic-cerium catalytic spectrophotometry. Iodine content in salt was measured using a titration method with sodium thiosulphate.Results: Overall, the median UIC of the total study population of pregnant women was 129.3 mu g/L, with a higher UIC in inland (152.54 mu g/L) and a lower UIC in coastal counties (107.54 mu g/L). Household coverage of iodized salt was 94.6% and the rate of adequately iodized salt was 89.9%.Conclusions: Our results indicate deficient iodine status in the pregnant population of Zhejiang, according to the lower cut-off value of optimal iodine nutrition (150 mu g/L) recommended by the World Health Organization. In addition to sustaining USI, more efforts are urgently needed to improve iodine intake in women during pregnancy, especially those residing in the coastal counties.

TI  - The importance of considering sub-grid cloud variability when using satellite observations to evaluate the cloud and precipitation simulations in climate models
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite cloud observations have become an indispensable tool for evaluating general circulation models (GCMs). To facilitate the satellite and GCM comparisons, the CFMIP (Cloud Feedback Model Inter-comparison Project) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been developed and is now increasingly used in GCM evaluations. Real-world clouds and precipitation can have significant sub-grid variations, which, however, are often ignored or oversimplified in the COSP simulation. In this study, we use COSP cloud simulations from the Super-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM5) and satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CloudSat to demonstrate the importance of considering the sub-grid variability of cloud and precipitation when using the COSP to evaluate GCM simulations. We carry out two sensitivity tests: SPCAM5 COSP and SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP. In the SPCAM5 COSP run, the sub-grid cloud and precipitation properties from the embedded cloud-resolving model (CRM) of SPCAM5 are used to drive the COSP simulation, while in the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run only grid-mean cloud and precipitation properties (i.e., no sub-grid variations) are given to the COSP. We find that the warm rain signatures in the SPCAM5 COSP run agree with the MODIS and CloudSat observations quite well. In contrast, the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run which ignores the sub-grid cloud variations substantially overestimates the radar reflectivity and probability of precipitation compared to the satellite observations, as well as the results from the SPCAM5 COSP run. The significant differences between the two COSP runs demonstrate that it is important to take into account the sub-grid variations of cloud and precipitation when using COSP to evaluate the GCM to avoid confusing and misleading results.

TI  - Impact of magnetic storms on the global TEC distribution
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study is focused on the analysis of total electron content (1'LC) variations during six geomagnetic storms of different intensity: from Dst(min) = -46 nT to Dst(min) = -223 nT. The values of TEC deviations from its 27-day median value (delta TEC) were calculated during the periods of the storms along three meridians: American, Euro-African and Asian-Australian. The following results were obtained. For the majority of the storms almost simultaneous occurrence of delta TEC maximums was observed along all three meridians at the beginning of the storm. The transition from a weak storm to a superstorm (the increase of magnetic activity) almost does not affect the intensity of the 8 TEC maximum. The seasonal effect was most pronounced along the Asian-Australian meridian, less often along the Euro-African meridian and was not revealed along the American meridian. Sometimes the seasonal effect can penetrate to the opposite hemisphere. The character of average 8 TEC variations for the intense storms was confirmed by GOES satellite data. Though there are some common features of TEC variation revealed during each storm phase, in general no clear dependence of TEC responses on the storm phases was found: the effects were different during each storm at different locations. The behavior of the correlation coefficient (R) between delta TEC values along the three meridians was analyzed for each storm. In general, R > 0.5 between delta TEC values averaged along each meridian. This result is new. The possible reasons for the exceptions (when R < 0.5) were provided: the complexity of phenomena during the intense storms and discordance in local time of the geomagnetic storm beginning along different meridians. Notwithstanding the complex dependence of R on the intensity of magnetic disturbance, in general R decreased with the growth of storm intensity.

TI  - A low-cost, battery-powered acoustic trap for surveilling male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> during rear-and-release operations
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a primary vector of several serious arboviruses throughout the world and is therefore of great concern to many public health organizations. With vector control methodology pivoting towards rearing and releasing large numbers of genetically modified, sterilized, or Wolbachia-mfecied male mosquitoes to control vector populations, economical surveillance methods for release tracking becomes increasingly necessary. Previous work has identified that male Ae. aegypti are attracted to female wingbeat frequencies and can be captured through artificial playback of these frequencies, but the tested systems are cost-prohibitive for wide-scale monitoring. Thus, we have developed a simple, low-cost, battery-powered, microcontroller-based sound lure which mimics the wingbeat frequency of female Ae. aegypti, thereby attracting males. We then tested the efficacy of this lure in combination with a passive (non-powered) gravid Aedes trap (GAT) against the current gold-standard, the Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap, which requires main power (household power) and costs several times what the GAT does. Capture rates of male Ae. aegypti in sound-baited GATs (Sound-GATs) in these field tests were comparable to that of the BGS with no inhibitory effects of sound playback on female capture. We conclude that the Sound-GAT is an effective replacement of the costly BGS for surveillance of male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, particularly in the developing countries where funding is limited, and has the potential to be adapted to target males of other medically important species.

TI  - Congenital Rubella Syndrome in The African Region - Data from Sentinel Surveillance.
T2  - Journal of immunological sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rubella is a mild febrile rash illness caused by the rubella virus. The most serious consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which occurs if the primary rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, with subsequent infection of the placenta and the developing fetus.METHODS: WHO supported countries to set up sentinel surveillance for CRS using standard case definitions, protocols, and case classification scheme. This descriptive analysis summarises the data from 5 countries which have been regularly reporting.RESULTS: A total of 383 suspected cases of CRS were notified from the 5 countries as of December 2016, of which 52 cases were laboratory confirmed and 67 were confirmed on clinical grounds.The majority (43%) of confirmed CRS cases were in the age group 6 - 11 months. The most common major clinical manifestation (Group A) among the confirmed cases is congenital heart disease (72%) followed by cataracts (32%) and glaucoma (10%).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The number of years of reporting from these sentinel sites is too short to describe trends in CRS occurrence across the years. However, the limited surveillance data has yielded comparable information with other developing countries prior to introduction of rubella vaccine. As more countries introduce rubella vaccine into their immunisation programs, there is a need to ensure that all rubella outbreaks are thoroughly investigated and documented, to expand sentinel surveillance for CRS in more countries in the Region, and to complement this with retrospective record reviews for CRS cases in selected countries.

TI  - Modeling soil organic matter and texture from satellite data in areas affected by wildfires and cropland abandonment in Aragon, Northern Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes create the need for regular monitoring of soil properties. Modern technology and data sources offer possibilities to perform it. In this context, the objective of the study is to explore the possibility of predicting soil organic matter (SOM) content and texture from the spectral information of the three last generation satellites [Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)]. Soil samples (113) were collected in areas affected by wildfires and cropland abandonment in Aragon, Northern Spain. Reflectance spectra of soils were obtained in controlled laboratory conditions using the analytical spectral device Fieldspec4 spectroradiometer (spectral range 350 to 2500 nm). Reflectances simulated for Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and EnMAP bands were used as predictors in multivariate models developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and step-down variable selection algorithm (SD). Modeling of all soil variables was performed simultaneously. The EnMAP models employed few predictors (10 to 58 of 244) and demonstrated good fit (R-cal(2) > 0.8 and R-val(2) similar to 0.8), especially for SOM (R-cal(2) and R-val(2) = 0.9; RMSEP similar to 1.6). Landsat models showed the least reliable estimates (R-cal(2) 0.54 to 0.77 and R-val(2) 0.42 to 0.80), whereas Sentinel-2 models showed R(cal)(2)of 0.70 to 0.81 and R-val(2) between 0.67 (clay) and 0.79 (SOM). The results confirm high potential of spectral data from multispectral and hyperspectral satellites for soil monitoring. Application of PLSR combined with SD results in sparser and better-fit models. SOM and soil texture can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy from EnMAP and Sentinel-2 data enabling soil status monitoring in areas of wildfire burns and cropland abandonment.

TI  - Retrieval of absorption coefficients for a drinking water source using a green-red band quasianalytical algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a green-red band quasianalytical algorithm, QAA-GRI, and evaluates its performance using an in situ dataset from Lake Qiandaohu, a drinking water source, in China. First, by shifting the reference wavelength from 555 to 510 nm, a green-red index (GRI) can be calculated from remote sensing reflectance at 510, 560, and 620 nm, and the index was then used to retrieve the total absorption coefficients at the reference band, a(510). Second, a semianalytical model based on a (510) and the GRI was deduced to establish the QAA-GRI, replacing the empirical model in quasianalytical algorithm version 5 (QAA-v5). The QAA-GRI was applied to retrieve absorption coefficients from an in situ dataset of Lake Qiandaohu, and the QAA-GRI's performance was compared with that of QAA-v5 and another red-green QAA-based approach (QAA-RGR). The results demonstrate that, for this dataset, the QAA-GRI exhibited better performance (R-2 = 0.81, mean absolute percentage error, MAPE = 15.7%), which indicated a clear improvement in the accuracy of absorption coefficient retrieval, compared with QAA-v5 (R-2 = 0.56, MAPE = 21.2%) and QAA-RGR (R-2 = 0.67, MAPE = 22.6%). In addition, to illustrate the QAA-GRI's assumptions and its applicability, the QAA-GRI was also applied to an in situ dataset from Taihu Lake, a highly turbid and eutrophic water source. As predicted, when applied to Taihu Lake, the QAA-GRI did not perform as well as it did when applied to Lake Qiandaohu because of the former's extremely high turbidity, which can cause greater uncertainty with regard to backscattering coefficients. This study suggests that the QAA-GRI is better suited to the retrieval of absorption coefficients from drinking water resources. Our algorithm will also have potential applications to satellite data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer or Ocean and Land Color Instrument. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Reconstruction of spatiotemporal change of Hoz-e-Sultan playa
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hoz-e-Sultan playa is one of the lowest points in the center of Iran, and its size and shape rely on the amount of inlet and outlet discharged water in different seasons of the year. The temperature fluctuations are the significant variations in the surface of the playa that increases the maximum salinity and saline layer level. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the spatial-temporal changes and salinity rate obtained from 11 sedimentary cores in the study area by principal component analysis, Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) method. The results indicated that the level of playa decreased about 33.598 km(2) during 26 years. The spatial changes occurred in the eastern margin in the south of playa. Finally, a significant relationship was observed between the SI and the real salinity, and the NDSI and LST also increase the salinity rate related to temperature decrease. (c) The Authors.

TI  - Segmentation model based on convolutional neural networks for extracting vegetation from Gaofen-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) models achieve state-of-the-art performance for natural image semantic segmentation. An approach for extracting vegetation from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing imagery based on the CNN model is presented. We constructed a convolutional encoder neural networks (CENN) consisting of two layers. The first layer has two sets of convolutional kernels for extracting the features of farmland and woodland, respectively. The second layer consists of two encoders that use nonlinear functions to encode the learned features and map the encoding results to the corresponding category number. In the training stage, samples of farmland, woodland, and other lands are categorically used to train the CENN. After training is accomplished, the CENN would acquire enough ability to accurately extract farmland and woodland from GF-2 imagery. The CENN was trained on 36 GF-2 images and tested on three other GF-2 images. We compared the proposed method to a deep belief network, a fully convolutional network, and a DeepLab model using the same images. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves upon the accuracy of existing approaches. The average precision, recall, and kappa coefficient of the proposed approach were 0.91, 0.87, and 0.86, respectively. Thus, the proposed approach is proven to effectively extract vegetation from GF-2 imagery. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

TI  - Effect of the Temporal Gradient of Vegetation Indices on Early-Season Wheat Classification Using the Random Forest Classifier
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season area estimation of the winter wheat crop as a strategic product is important for decision-makers. Multi-temporal images are the best tool to measure early-season winter wheat crops, but there are issues with classification. Classification of multi-temporal images is affected by factors such as training sample size, temporal resolution, vegetation index (VI) type, temporal gradient of spectral bands and VIs, classifiers, and values missed under cloudy conditions. This study addresses the effect of the temporal resolution and VIs, along with the spectral and VIs gradient on the random forest (RF) classifier when missing data occurs in multi-temporal images. To investigate the appropriate temporal resolution for image acquisition, a study area is selected on an overlapping area between two Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) paths. In the proposed method, the missing data from cloudy pixels are retrieved using the average of the k-nearest cloudless pixels in the feature space. Next, multi-temporal image analysis is performed by considering different scenarios provided by decision-makers for the desired crop types, which should be extracted early in the season in the study areas. The classification results obtained by RF improved by 2.2% when the temporally-missing data were retrieved using the proposed method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that when the temporal resolution of Landsat-8 is increased to one week, the classification task can be conducted earlier with slightly better overall accuracy (OA) and kappa values. The effect of incorporating VIs along with the temporal gradients of spectral bands and VIs into the RF classifier improved the OA by 3.1% and the kappa value by 6.6%, on average. The results show that if only three optimum images from seasonal changes in crops are available, the temporal gradient of the VIs and spectral bands becomes the primary tool available for discriminating wheat from barley. The results also showed that if wheat and barley are considered as single class versus other classes, with the use of images associated with 162 and 163 paths, both crops can be classified in March (at the beginning of the growth stage) with an overall accuracy of 97.1% and kappa coefficient of 93.5%.

TI  - Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the native rabbits in Middle Egypt
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Native rabbits in smallholder system are considered as important genetic resources, and the present study was aimed to study the genetic and phenotypic characterization and detection of the maternal origin of the native rabbit populations located at the Middle of Egypt.Materials and Methods: A survey of native rabbit populations was conducted in three governorates (Fayum [FY], Beni Suef [BN], and El Menia [MN]). The phenotypic characterization of rabbits included the profile body of the head, ears, eyes, neck, and legs and the coat colors. The blood samples were collected for genetic characterization based on mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and the microsatellite markers.Results: The phenotypic characterization of the body parts in the three populations was almost similar. The body weight of the mature rabbits in MN government was significantly heaviest, and the measurements for the main body parts (body length, chest circumference, and abdominal girth) were the highest compared to the two populations. The results of mitochondrial (cytochrome b) analysis revealed that the rabbits from the three governments belonged to lineage A except one animal was recorded as lineage G from MN's rabbit population. The results of the microsatellite markers revealed that the genetic diversity between the three populations showed genetic interferences; however, a closer genetic relationship was observed between BN and MN than FY. The majority of the genetic diversity was the individual variability.Conclusion: The mitochondrial lineage A is the major lineage in rabbit populations in the area of the Middle Egypt understudy. The genetic populations' structure is the interferences among the three populations. A large-scale survey should be done on native rabbit populations for the sustainable management and conservation of the local breeds' genetic resources.

TI  - Spatiotemporal drought evaluation of Hyrcanian deciduous forests and semi-steppe rangelands using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer time series in Northeast Iran
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced MODIS data have provided diverse products for assessing and monitoring natural vegetation affected by droughts. Between 2000 and 2016, we estimated monthly precipitation anomalies in the deciduous forests and semi-steppe rangelands of northeastern Iran using kriging models, and analyzed 16-day vegetation anomalies using vegetation greenness and water content indicesincluding the enhanced vegetation index, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Vegetation anomalies showed high positive responses to interseasonal precipitation anomalies over the 17-year period, and low positive responses to monthly precipitation deficits during critical droughts. Forest and rangeland anomalies recorded higher Moran's coefficients based on the NDVI (I=0.253 +/- 0.102) and NDWI (I=0.284 +/- 0.087) with interseasonal precipitation anomalies, respectively. Throughout critical droughts, the NDWI anomalies showed higher coefficients with monthly precipitation deficits for both forests (I=0.0716 +/- 0.059) and rangelands (I=0.125 +/- 0.0615). Nevertheless, there were only significant differences between the Moran's coefficients of the three vegetation indices for rangelands (F=2.873; p<0.05). BiLISA maps indicated that sparse forests show higher spatial associations with drought conditions (High-high cluster), whereas dense forests experienced lower stresses by severe droughts (High-low outlier) during drought periods. Meanwhile, some severe vegetation stresses occurred at locations with low droughts (Low-high outlier), which indicate the impact of other significant climate-induced disturbances on vegetation anomalies.

TI  - Rainfall-vegetation interaction regulates temperature anomalies during extreme dry events in the Horn of Africa
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-vegetation interaction can be perturbed by human activities through deforestation and natural extreme climatic events. These perturbations can affect the energy and water balance, exacerbating heat stress associated with droughts. Such phenomena are particularly relevant in the Horn of Africa, given its economic and social vulnerability to environmental changes. In this paper, we used 16-year time series (2001-2016) of remotely sensed environmental data with the objective of 1) clarifying how rainfall-vegetation interaction affects land surface temperature (LST) seasonality across the Horn of Africa, and 2) evaluating how this interaction affects LST anomalies during forest loss and drought events. Our results showed that vegetation seasonality follows rainfall modality patterns in 81% of the region. On the other hand, seasonality of daytime LST was negatively related to vegetation greenness patterns across ecoregions, and rainfall modality. LST varied more strongly in grasslands and shrublands than over other vegetation classes. Comparison of LST before and after forest loss in three selected areas (two in Ethiopia and one in Kenya) revealed an annual average increase in LST of 0.7 degrees C, 1.8 degrees C, and 0.2 degrees C after climate variability correction, respectively. The average increase in LST was relatively high and consistent during dry months (1.5 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 0.6 degrees C). As expected, the rainfall anomalies during droughts (2010/2011, 2015, and 2016) were positively correlated with vegetation greenness anomalies. Nonetheless, the degree with which vegetation cover is affected by extreme rainfall events has a strong influence in regulating the impact of droughts on temperature anomalies. This highlights the importance of vegetation resilience and land cover management in regulating the impact of extreme events.

TI  - Evaluation of Water Indices for Surface Water Extraction in a Landsat 8 Scene of Nepal
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and frequent updates of surface water have been made possible by remote sensing technology. Index methods are mostly used for surface water estimation which separates the water from the background based on a threshold value. Generally, the threshold is a fixed value, but can be challenging in the case of environmental noise, such as shadow, forest, built-up areas, snow, and clouds. One such challenging scene can be found in Nepal where no such evaluation has been done. Taking that in consideration, this study evaluates the performance of the most widely used water indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) in a Landsat 8 scene of Nepal. The scene, ranging from 60 m to 8848 m, contains various types of water bodies found in Nepal with different forms of environmental noise. The evaluation was conducted based on measures from a confusion matrix derived using validation points. Comparing visually and quantitatively, not a single method was able to extract surface water in the entire scene with better accuracy. Upon selecting optimum thresholds, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kappa) was improved, but not satisfactory. NDVI and NDWI showed better results for only pure water pixels, whereas MNDWI and AWEI were unable to reject snow cover and shadows. Combining NDVI with NDWI and AWEI with shadow improved the accuracy but inherited the NDWI and AWEI characteristics. Segmenting the test scene with elevations above and below 665 m, and using NDVI and NDWI for detecting water, resulted in an OA of 0.9638 and kappa of 0.8979. The accuracy can be further improved with a smaller interval of categorical characteristics in one or multiple scenes.

TI  - Empirical assessment of the role of geospatial technology in delivering governance and strengthening democracy in Nigeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examined the concept of development in line with the role of geospatial technology applications in governance and geospatial management in Nigeria. It also evaluates the previous efforts made by successive governments in managing governance process through geospatial technology initiatives using Lagos State as a proof-of-concept. It empirically demonstrates the role of monitoring spatial development initiatives using Landsat multi-dates satellite images 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 5005, 2010 and 2016 and Geographic Information System technique. The paper then identified, mapped and examined the settlement growth of Lagos using Ikorodu Division as an empirical proof-of-concept. The study reveals a geometric increase in uncoordinated human activities resulting from sporadic spatial development (builtup area) from 27.67 sq km (7.7%) in 1985-313.02 sq km (87.3%) spatial coverage in 2016. Based on the regression line, the study reveals a strong correlation between increasing settlement development and time. Low level of community involvement and lack of sense of ownership of development project initiatives in developing a local "vision" and strategy are identified as a problem. The paper re-emphasized that sustaining democratic processes as well as the fight against poverty will be won or lost mostly in the rural and less in the urban areas. The rural area is home to about 70% of the world's poor due to lack or inadequate government services and basic amenities. The study suggest that making the future better for the yet unborn requires appreciable fundamental dataset, technologies, human resources and reliable government structures.

TI  - "For Every Illness There is a Cure": Attitudes and Beliefs of Moroccan Muslim Women Regarding Health, Illness and Medicine
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to provide adequate health care, it is important to be well aware of the views and attitudes of the health seeker regarding health, illness and medicine. In the Belgian context, the views of Muslim women, particularly of middle-aged and elderly Moroccan women, have been understudied. The aim of this article is twofold. First, we seek to bring forward the attitudes and beliefs of middle-aged and elderly Moroccan Muslim women living in Antwerp (Belgium) towards health, illness and medicine. Second, we seek to explore which role religion plays in their views and attitudes regarding health, illness and medicine. Qualitative empirical research was conducted with a sample of middle-aged and elderly Moroccan Muslim women living in Antwerp (Belgium) (n = 30) and with experts in the field (n = 15). In-depth interviews and participant observations were conducted to reveal their perceptions regarding health, illness and medicine. This study reveals that religion plays a crucial role in how Muslim women perceive and deal with illness. Theological considerations that centre on God's omnipotence, the belief in the afterlife and religious virtues take up a central position. A holistic approach is adopted in the search for healing, i.e. an interplay between calling upon medicine and turning to God. Religious beliefs seem to be a powerful source in coping with illness.

M3  - Article
AB  - Snowcover dynamics and associated accumulation and depletion of snowcover along with its spatial and temporal scale mainly constitute hydrological phenomena of the given basin and are mostly controlled by the local climate variables. Snow accumulation and melting time and duration determine the cyclic volume of water resources and downstream availability. In this study, snowcover area (SCA) was extracted from remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products (MOD10A2) for the period 2000-2016. Data for hydro-meteorological parameters was obtained from relevant departments acquired through their field stations. The analysis of 16-year satellite data shows that there is a slight increase in cryospheric area at high altitude. In Astore basin, the study concluded that 15-20% of the basin area is covered by glacier and snowcover may reach around 90-95% of the basin area due to accumulation of seasonal snow from the westerly wind circulation. Analysis of hydro-meteorological parameters showed significant correlation between temperatures (T-max, T-min) and river runoff while no significant correlation was observed between river runoff and rainfall. Similarly, significant inverse correlation was found between river runoff and Astore mean snowcover. At sub-altitudinal zone level (zones 1, 2, 3), river runoff has significant correlation with snowcover. Analysis of 20-year climate data along with river runoff depicts that river runoff is a general phenomenon of snowmelt when minimum temperature starts to rise above 4 A degrees C during mid of April. The study highlights the importance and interdependence of meteorological parameters and snowcover dynamics in determining the hydrological characteristics of Astore Basin.

AB  - In earthquake-prone areas, identifying patterns of ground deformation is important before they become latent risk factors. As one of the severely damaged areas due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, Urayasu City in Chiba Prefecture has been suffering from land subsidence as a part of its land was built by a massive land-fill project. To investigate the long-term land deformation patterns in Urayasu City, three sets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired during 1993-2006 from European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1/-2 (C-band)), during 2006-2010 from the Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar onboard the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS PALSAR (L-band)) and from 2014-2017 from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) were processed by using multitemporal interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques. Leveling survey data were also used to verify the accuracy of the InSAR-derived results. The results from the ERS-1/-2, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data processing showed continuing subsidence in several reclaimed areas of Urayasu City due to the integrated effects of numerous natural and anthropogenic processes. The maximum subsidence rate of the period from 1993 to 2006 was approximately 27 mm/year, while the periods from 2006 to 2010 and from 2014 to 2017 were approximately 30 and 18 mm/year, respectively. The quantitative validation results of the InSAR-derived deformation trend during the three observation periods are consistent with the leveling survey data measured from 1993 to 2017. Our results further demonstrate the advantages of InSAR measurements as an alternative to ground-based measurements for land subsidence monitoring in coastal reclaimed areas.

TI  - Evidence for Tear Faulting from New Constraints of the 23 October 2011 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Van, Turkey, Earthquake Based on InSAR, GPS, Coastal Uplift, and Field Observations
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 23 October 2011 M-w 7.1 Van earthquake in eastern Turkey took place on a previously unknown thrust fault, causing over 600 fatalities and extensive damage mainly in Van city and the northern town of Ercis. Several coseismic models have already been published after the earthquake using the available seismological and geodetic data. These studies generally agree on a coseismic rupture on a north-dipping east-west-trending blind-thrust fault comprising one or two subparallel segments and the existence of a shallow slip deficit. Here, by introducing an additional coseismic pixel-offset dataset from the TerraSAR-X satellite, we conclude that a NNE-SSW-trending left-lateral tear fault that bounds the rupture to the east also slipped both during and after the mainshock, which is in agreement with both field observations and postseismic Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. This has important implications for the seismic hazard analysis of the region as the extent and geometry of the rupture that we infer differ significantly from those previously proposed.

TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of cervical sentinel lymph node biopsy after mapping with indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) for imaging early-stage oral cancer.Patients and methods: A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed during a selective neck dissection (SND) in 20 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC, cTl or cT2, N0 status). The sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were identified using an infrared video camera after ICG injection. Lymph nodes were examined histologically. The endpoint of this study was to investigate the rate of false-negative results in SLNB.Results: Sentinel lymph nodes could be detected after 8.1 min (range 1-22 min). In eight out of 20 cases, lymph node metastases were found during histopathological evaluation of the neck dissection specimen. In four cases a metastasis could be found in the detected SLN (sensitivity 50%). In the other four cases metastases were found in different lymph nodes. Specificity was 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 75%.Conclusion: In this study, reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy after ICG imaging could not be verified, as there were false-negative results in 50% of the cases. Therefore, SND can still be recommended as for patients with cT1 or cT2 OSCC, and a N0 neck status. (C) 2018 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A novel spectrum enhancement technique for multi-temporal, multi-spectral data using spatial-temporal filtering
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-sequence remote sensing images are usually captured under varying acquisition conditions due to atmospheric differences, lighting condition, humidity etc. Comparing the spectral values of the well-registered images taken at a different time is a complicated issue due to the non-linear spectrum distortion caused by these effects. Atmospheric correction can eliminate part of the errors, while precisely removing it requires many other in-situ data such as the weather condition and optical aerosol depth. We propose an algorithm that performs spatial-temporal inferences that correct the spectral values through a data-driven approach - we developed a simple 3D spatiotemporal filtering method that uses the time-sequence imagery themselves to homogenize the spectral property of similar objects while being heterogeneous to objects with significant differences. We have performed extensive experiments using medium resolution Landsat dataset and high-resolution Planet imagery, by evaluating the classification results from both classic machine learning (sample selected from the current image) and transfer learning (samples selected from one dataset and applied to the other dataset). The experiments results show that the proposed 3D spatiotemporal filter can improve the accuracy of classification using transfer learning by approximate to 5%, approximate to 15%, and = approximate to 2%. We have also demonstrated that the enhanced time-sequence image offers much better change detection outputs using just a simple image differencing method. The improved results in typical remote sensing tasks indicate our proposed method being effective for time-sequence data preprocessing.

TI  - The late Neoproterozoic Pan-African low-grade metamorphic ophiolitic and island-arc assemblages at Gebel Zabara area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt: Petrogenesis and remote sensing - Based geologic mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The late Neoproterozoic Pan-African basement rocks of the Gebel Zabara area, Central Eastern Desert of Egypt is of particular interest where the medium-grade Hafafit gneisses juxtapose the low-grade ophiolitic and island-arc assemblages along major structural contacts. The area comprises important mineral deposits including gold, base metal vein-type deposits as well as emerald and talc. In the current work, various image processing algorithms including Principal Component Analyses (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Decorrelation Stretch (DS) were proposed and applied on Landsat-8, ASTER and Sentinel-2 data to delineate and discriminate the different rock units. Several ASTER mineral indices are successfully used in the mapping process to detect the alteration zones, which are mainly confined to the NNW-SSE and N-S trending structures. The petrogenesis studies for the different rock unites in the study area indicate that the ophiolitic assemblage include serpentinite-talc carbonate, metagabbros complex and metabasalts. Serpentinite rocks represent the hydrated low temperature form of a harzburgite precursor, while the talcose serpentinites evolved via SiO2 aqueou metasomatic alteration. Geochemically, the ophiolitic rocks exhibit N-MORB tholeiitic affinity and imply a back-arc setting. The island-arc rock assemblages encompass calc-alkaline meta-andesite, metadacite and metarhyolite, which imply a normal continental island-arc setting, i.e. less mature than the proper active continental margin. Apart from serpentinites, the ophiolitic and island-arc assemblages experienced regional greenschist facies metamorphism. The ophiolitic metagabbros exhibit the metamorphic assemblage: actinolite + albite (An < 5%)/oligoclase (An 19-20%) + chlorite + epidote + quartz. The coexistence of albite and oligoclase may indicate either: (1) disequilibria association, or (2) a possible greenschist-amphibolite facies transition. The P-T metamorphic condition of the metagabbros was constrained at about 5 kbar and 430 to 452 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Inventory of Glaciers in the Shaksgam Valley of the Chinese Karakoram Mountains, 1970-2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shaksgam Valley, located on the north side of the Karakoram Mountains of western China, is situated in the transition zone between the Indian monsoon system and dry arid climate zones. Previous studies have reported abnormal behaviors of the glaciers in this region compared to the global trend of glacier retreat, so the region is of special interest for glacier-climatological studies. For this purpose, long-term monitoring of glaciers in this region is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the relationships between glacier changes and local climate variations. However, accurate historical and up-to-date glacier inventory data for the region are currently unavailable. For this reason, this study conducted glacier inventories for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2014 (i.e., a similar to 10-year interval) using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. The remote sensing data used included Corona KH-4A/B (1965-1971), Hexagon KH-9 (1980), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) (1990/1993), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) (2000/2001), and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) (2014/2015) multispectral satellite images, as well as digital elevation models (DEMs) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), DEMs generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images (2005-2014), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D 30 m mesh (AW3D30). In the year 2014, a total of 173 glaciers (including 121 debris-free glaciers) (>0.5 km(2)), covering an area of 1478 +/- 34 km(2) (area of debris-free glaciers: 295 +/- 7 km(2)) were mapped. The multi-temporal glacier inventory results indicated that total glacier area change between 1970-2014 was not significant. However, individual glacier changes showed significant variability. Comparisons of the changes in glacier terminus position indicated that 55 (32 debris-covered) glaciers experienced significant advances (similar to 40-1400 m) between 1970-2014, and 74 (32 debris-covered) glaciers experienced significant advances (similar to 40-1400 m) during the most recent period (2000-2014). Notably, small glaciers showed higher sensitivity to climate changes, and the glaciers located in the western part of the study site were exhibiting glacier area expansion compared to other parts of the Shaksgam Valley. Finally, regression analyses indicated that topographic parameters were not the main driver of glacier changes. On the contrary, local climate variability could explain the complex behavior of glaciers in this region.

TI  - A generic remote sensing approach to derive operational essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) for conservation planning
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The open access availability of satellite images from new sensors characterized by various spatial and temporal resolutions provides new challenges and possibilities for biodiversity conservation. Methodologies aiming at characterizing vegetation type, phenology, and function can now benefit from metric spatial resolution imagery combined with an improved revisit capability. Here, we test hybrid methods and data fusion, using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) sensors in different complex landscapes encompassing three French biogeographical regions.2. The methodological approach presented herein has a generic value in response to national conservation targets based on the concept of essential biodiversity variables accessed by remote sensing (RS-enabled EBVs). We focused on deriving five RS-enabled EBVs from natural and seminatural open ecosystems: (1) ecosystem distribution, (2) land cover, (3) heterogeneity, (4) primary productivity and (5) vegetation phenology. The challenge was to develop a method that would be technically feasible, economically viable, and sustainable in time.3. We demonstrated that it is possible to derive key parameters required to develop a set of EBVs from remote sensing (RS) data. The combined use of remote sensing data sources with various spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions is essential to obtain different indicators of natural habitats.4. One major current challenge for an improved contribution of RS to conservation is to strengthen multiple collaborative frameworks among remote sensing scientists, conservation biologists, and ecologists in order to increase the efficiency of methodological exchange and draw benefits for successful conservation planning strategies.

TI  - Circulating rotavirus G and P strains post rotavirus vaccination in Eastern Mediterranean Region
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To detect changes in circulating strains of rotavirus in the Eastern Mediterranean Region post rotavirus immunization drive.Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library and specific database website (Nutrition and Food Sciences) for relevant articles. Our search included websites of a number of relevant organizations in addition to gray literature search. Of the 2198 articles found, we included only 35 studies after excluding irrelevant, ineligible, duplicated, and very low-quality papers.Results: Thirty pre-vaccination studies reported frequent rotavirus strains among children below 5 years of age. G1P[8] has been identified as the most dominant type prior to vaccination in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Five post-vaccination studies conducted in 3 countries (Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Yemen) illustrated that G1P[8] is the most prevalent strain in Saudi Arabia, and the incidence of G2P[4] has increased from 21.6% to 33.3%. In Yemen, G1P[4] is the most prevalent strain (87.5%), followed by G9P[8] (57%) and G1P[8] (18.5%). Furthermore, in Yemen, G9P[8] were the most prevalent strains accounting to 57% and 14% in G9P[4], post vaccination. Finally, in Morocco, G1P[8] was not reported 3 years post vaccination; however, incidence of G9P[8] was reported at 67% and G2P[4] at 33%.Conclusions: Rotavirus circulating strain prevalence in EMR countries has changed post vaccination, and G9P[8], G2P[4], and G9P[4] have become more dominant. Proportion of rotavirus strains in these countries after vaccination has significantly reduced. There is an increase in circulating strain G2P[4] in the post-vaccination period, which needs further monitoring.

TI  - PRODUCTION OF TEN VARIETIES OF ALFALFA (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BEING ESTABLISHED
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the forage species most commonly used to feed dairy cattle in Mexico. The objective of this study was to evaluate the production of ten varieties of alfalfa, harvested at cutting intervals defined seasonally. The varieties were distributed in 40 plots (9 x 7 m), and the experimental design was completely randomized with four repetitions. The study was performed at the Colegio de Postgraduados, Campus Montecillo, Texcoco, Mexico, from September 2011 to September 2012. The variables evaluated were forage yield (FY), botanical and morphological composition (BMC), leaf: stem ratio (R: L/S), population density of stems (SD) and plant density (PD). The Jupiter variety showed the higher values for FY (14 510 kg DM ha(-1)), R: L/S (1.8), SD (578 stems m(-2)) and PD (18 plants m(-2)), and San Miguelito the lower values for FY (7890 kg DM ha(-1)), SD (282 stems m(-2)) and PD (8 plants m-2). The average FY was (3508 kg DM ha(-1)) higher in summer and fall, and lower in winter (2214 kg DM ha(-1) average). In fall and winter they presented higher R: L/S, SD and PD (1.5, 546 stems m(-2) and 20 plants m(-2) in average). In contrast, in springsummer, R: L/S, SD and PD were lower (1.0, 371 stems m(-2) and 12 plants m(-2) in average). The annual FY was 56 %. The undergrowth had the highest contribution (43 %) and the dead material (9 %), the lowest. Jupiter was the most productive variety and summer contributed most to the annual FY. The age of the grassland caused a higher invasion of undergrowth and a lower presence of alfalfa.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning to Classification of Volcanic Deformation in Routinely Generated InSAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent improvements in the frequency, type, and availability of satellite images mean it is now feasible to routinely study volcanoes in remote and inaccessible regions, including those with no ground-based monitoring. In particular, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data can detect surface deformation, which has a strong statistical link to eruption. However, the data set produced by the recently launched Sentinel-1 satellite is too large to be manually analyzed on a global basis. In this study, we systematically process >30,000 short-term interferograms at over 900 volcanoes and apply machine learning algorithms to automatically detect volcanic ground deformation. We use a convolutional neutral network to classify interferometric fringes in wrapped interferograms with no atmospheric corrections. We employ a transfer learning strategy and test a range of pretrained networks, finding that AlexNet is best suited to this task. The positive results are checked by an expert and fed back for model updating. Following training with a combination of both positive and negative examples, this method reduced the number of interferograms to similar to 100 which required further inspection, of which at least 39 are considered true positives. We demonstrate that machine learning can efficiently detect large, rapid deformation signals in wrapped interferograms, but further development is required to detect slow or small deformation patterns which do not generate multiple fringes in short duration interferograms. This study is the first to use machine learning approaches for detecting volcanic deformation in large data sets and demonstrates the potential of such techniques for developing alert systems based on satellite imagery.

AB  - Melanoma is an aggressive cutaneous malignancy with rapidly rising incidence. Diagnosis of controversial melanocytic lesions, correct prognostication of patients, selection of appropriate adjuvant and systemic therapies, and prediction of response to a given therapy remain very real challenges. Despite these challenges, multiple high throughput, nucleic-acid based biomarkers have been developed that can be assayed from histologic tissue specimens. FISH, CGH, Decision-Dx, and other multi-marker assays have been combined to improve overall predictability. This review discusses some of the most promising nucleic acid based assays that can be obtained from tissue specimens to assist with diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of treatment response.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node identification in urologic cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MINERVA UROLOGICA E NEFROLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) represents the most accurate and reliable staging procedure for the detection of lymph node invasion in prostate cancer and bladder cancer. However, the procedure is not devoid of complications. In this field, Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification is an emerging and promising technique, as accurate staging of urologic cancer could be enhanced by a thorough evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes. Aim of the present review is to analyze available evidence and perform a metanalysis on ICG-guided SLN detection for urologic malignancies.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review to assess the clinical value of Indocyanine green for the identification of sentinel lymphatic drainage for bladder, prostate, kidney and penile cancers was undertaken, with a meta-analysis to generate pooled detection rate concerning patients (clinical sensitivity) and nodes basin (technical sensitivity) separately. Studies reporting on the use of Indocyanine green for the detection of SLNs from the bladder, prostate and penile cancers were included.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 10 clinical trials were included. Using the fixed effects model and the random effects model, the pooled patient detection rates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 0.88 (0.82-0.92) and 0.92 (0.84-0.96), respectively. The pooled nodes detection rates were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68-0.74) using the fixed effect model and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.56-0.87) using the random effect model. Significant heterogeneities existed among studies for patients and for nodes (I-2=0.66, P<0.001 and I-2=0.96, P<0.001, respectively). Significant publication bias was found in patient detection rate (P<0.001) and in nodes detection rate (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: SLN mapping in bladder and prostate cancer is a method with a high detection rate, although its specificity to predict LN invasion remains poor. Large, well-constructed trails are needed to assess the impact of ICG-fluorescence guided SLN dissection on uro-oncologic surgery.

TI  - Zinc isotopes as tracers of anthropogenic sources and biogeochemical processes in contaminated mangroves
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent work has shown that variations in zinc (Zn) isotope ratios enable us to identify contamination sources in the terrestrial environment and uptake processes in higher plants. Here in this study, we demonstrate that this also holds true for mangrove forests, which play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metals in tropical coastal ecosystems and that are seriously threatened by anthropogenic pollution. To this end, we determined zinc concentration and isotope composition (expressed using the delta Zn-66 notation relative to the JMC 3-0749 L standard) in sediments and tree leaves collected from a mangrove close to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The delta Zn-66(JMC) values of sediments vary between + 0.36 and + 0.84 parts per thousand and fall on a mixing line between detrital terrestrial sources (characterized with delta Zn-66(JMC) = + 0.28 +/- 0.12 parts per thousand, 2 sigma) and metallurgical ore sources (delta Zn-66(JMC) = + 0.86 parts per thousand +/- 0.15 parts per thousand, 2 sigma). Leaves of Laguncularia racemose, in contrast, showed delta Zn-66(JMC) values ranging between + 0.08 and + 0.23 parts per thousand, suggesting that processes including uptake, translocation and bioavailability in the rhizosphere control the isotope composition of zinc in the mangrove plant.

TI  - Management of melanoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
T2  - LEUKEMIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is significantly more common and is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with an underlying B-cell malignancy. This study reports on the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and a subsequent diagnosis of melanoma. In the Wilmot Cancer Institute CLL cohort, which includes 470 patients followed for 2849 person-years, 18 patients (3.8%) developed 22 melanomas. Fourteen melanomas were invasive, a significantly higher rate as compared with the age and sex matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 6.32 (95% CI 3.45; 10.60). Melanomas were most often detected (n = 15; 68.2%) through active surveillance in a dermatology clinic. Most melanomas (n = 17; 77.3%) were detected at a non-advanced stage (pathological stage grouping < III). The most common management was wide local excision without sentinel lymph node biopsy (n = 13, 59.1%). Management for the 4 (18.2%) patients with metastatic disease included the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab (n = 1), systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine (n = 1), and palliative care (n = 2). The patient treated with ICI is in sustained remission of her melanoma after 23 cycles of therapy while her TP53 disrupted CLL continues to respond to ibrutinib therapy. We conclude that patients with CLL may benefit from active surveillance for melanoma leading to early excision of locally-manageable disease. In patients with metastatic melanoma, combined treatment with targeted kinase inhibitors and ICIs can be successful and tolerable. Larger prospective studies should be considered to further evaluate these approaches.

TI  - Wave Attenuation Through an Arctic Marginal Ice Zone on 12 October 2015: 2. Numerical Modeling of Waves and Associated Ice Breakup
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many processes that affect ocean surface gravity waves in sea ice give rise to attenuation rates that vary with both wave frequency and amplitude. Here we particularly test the possible effects of basal friction, scattering by ice floes, and dissipation in the ice layer due to dislocations, and ice breakup by the waves. The possible influence of these processes is evaluated in the marginal ice zone of the Beaufort Sea, where extensive wave measurements were performed. The wave data includes in situ measurements and the first kilometer-scale map of wave heights provided by Sentinel-1 SAR imagery on 12 October 2015, up to 400 km into the ice. We find that viscous friction at the base of an ice layer gives a dissipation rate that may be too large near the ice edge, where ice is mostly in the form of pancakes. Further into the ice, where larger floes are present, basal friction is not sufficient to account for the observed attenuation. In both regions, the observed narrow directional wave spectra are consistent with a parameterization that gives a weak effect of wave scattering by ice floes. For this particular event, with a dominant wave period around 10 s, we propose that wave attenuation is caused by ice flexure combined with basal friction that is reduced when the ice layer is not continuous. This combination gives realistic wave heights, associated with a 100-200 km wide region over which the ice is broken by waves, as observed in SAR imagery.

TI  - Modeling the exposure of wild fish to endocrine active chemicals: Potential linkages of total estrogenicity to field-observed intersex
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Decades of studies on endocrine disruption have suggested the need to manage the release of key estrogens from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, the proposed thresholds are below the detection limits of most routine chemical analysis, thereby restricting the ability of watershed managers to assess the environmental exposure appropriately. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of a mechanistic model to address the data gaps on estrogen exposure. Concentrations of the prominent estrogenic contaminants in wastewaters (estrone, estradiol, and ethinylestradiol) were simulated in the Grand River in southern Ontario (Canada) for nine years, including a period when major WWTP upgrades occurred. The predicted concentrations expressed as total estrogenicity (E2 equivalent concentrations) were contrasted to a key estrogenic response (i.e., intersex) in rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum), a wild sentinel fish species. A predicted total estrogenicity in the river of >= 10 ng/L E2 equivalents was associated with high intersex incidence and severity, whereas concentrations <0.1 ng/L E2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression. Exposure to a predicted river concentration of 0.4 ng/ L E2 equivalents, the environmental quality standard (EQS) proposed by the European Union for estradiol, was associated with 34% (95% CI:30-38) intersex incidence and a very low severity score of 0.6 (95% CI:0.5-0.7). This exposure is not predicted to cause adverse effects in rainbow darter. The analyses completed in this study were only based on the predicted presence of three major estrogens (El, E2, EE2), so caution must be exercised when interpreting the results. Nevertheless, this study illustrates the use of models for exposure assessment, especially when measured data are not available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A New SEBAL Approach Modified with Backtracking Search Algorithm for Actual Evapotranspiration Mapping and On-Site Application
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration is one of the most important component for efficient water management and planning. Until recently, evapotranspiration computations and measurements have been performed locally. But, in recent years, actual evapotranspiration computations can be calculated regionally thanks to improvements on remote sensing discipline and satellites. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) is one of the most commonly preferred technics for actual evapotranspiration mapping. However, this algorithm has some difficulties such as mismatch with Landsat 8 and hot-wet pixel selection which require expert knowledge. In this paper, a novel SEBAL based approach (SEBAL-BSA), which can use Landsat 8 images as data and can automatically perform hot-wet pixel selection using Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) with ground control points, has been proposed. SEBAL-BSA was developed and tested using January 22-2015, April 28-2015 and July 01-2015 dated Landsat 8 images in Akarsu Irrigation Water User Association command area in the cukurova Region of Turkey and actual evapotranspiration mapping was realized without albedo measurements. Accuracy of SEBAL-BSA has been examined by comparing values of predefined ground truth points and values obtained from proposed approach. According to results of parametric matched pairs T test and nonparametric Wilcoxon sign rank test, SEBAL-BSA is highly successful. Applications also show that the SEBAL-BSA is a user-friendly approach for institutions and organizations related to water authorization and management.

TI  - Synergetic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Soil Moisture Mapping at Plot Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an approach for retrieval of soil moisture content (SMC) by coupling single polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data at the plot scale in vegetated areas. The study was carried out at five different sites with dominant vegetation cover located in Kenya. In the initial stage of the process, different features are extracted from single polarization mode (VV polarization) SAR and optical data. Subsequently, proper selection of the relevant features is conducted on the extracted features. An advanced state-of-the-art machine learning regression approach, the support vector regression (SVR) technique, is used to retrieve soil moisture. This paper takes a new look at soil moisture retrieval in vegetated areas considering the needs of practical applications. In this context, we tried to work at the object level instead of the pixel level. Accordingly, a group of pixels (an image object) represents the reality of the land cover at the plot scale. Three approaches, a pixel-based approach, an object-based approach, and a combination of pixel- and object-based approaches, were used to estimate soil moisture. The results show that the combined approach outperforms the other approaches in terms of estimation accuracy (4.94% and 0.89 compared to 6.41% and 0.62 in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R-2), flexibility on retrieving the level of soil moisture, and better quality of visual representation of the SMC map.

TI  - Modelling the effects of phosphor converted LED lighting to the night sky of the Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the current level of light pollution in the night sky at the Haleakala Observatory on the island of Maui in Hawaii. This is accomplished with a numerical model that was tested in the first International Dark Sky Reserve located in Mont-Megantic National Park in Canada. The model uses ground data on the artificial light sources present in the region of study, geographical data, and remotely sensed data for (1) The nightly upward radiance, (2) The terrain elevation, and 3) The ground spectral reflectance of the region. The results of the model give a measure of the current state of the sky spectral radiance at the Haleakala Observatory. Then, using the current state as a reference point, multiple light conversion plans are elaborated and evaluated using the model. We can thus estimate the expected impact of each conversion plan on the night sky radiance spectrum. A complete conversion to white light emitting diodes (LEDs) with correlated colour temperature of 4000 and 3000K are contrasted with a conversion using phosphore-convertred amber LEDs. We include recommendations concerning the street lamps to be used in sensitive areas like the cities of Kahului and Kihei, and suggest best lighting practices related to the colour of lamps used at night.

TI  - The adoption of automated phenotyping by plant breeders
T2  - EUPHYTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenomics or automated phenotyping (AP) is an emerging approach, identified as a priority for future crop breeding research. This approach promises to provide accurate, precise, fast, large-scale, and accumulated phenotyping data which when integrated with corresponding genomic and environmental data is expected to trigger a great leap forward in plant breeding. However, despite promising applications, AP adoption in plant breeding is still in its infancy. It is unclear to many plant breeders how or if much of the enormous volume, diversity, and velocity of imaging and remote-sensing data generated by AP is going to be usefully integrated into breeding programs. This paper develops an economical model of heterogeneous breeders' decision-making to examine adoption decisions regarding whether to adopt AP or continue using conventional phenotyping. The results of this model indicate that many interlocking factors, including genetic gain/expected return, variable and sunk costs, subsequent rate of technology improvement, and breeders' level of aversion to AP, are at work as breeders determine whether to adopt AP. This study also provides a numerical example to show the impact of breeders' aversion toward the adoption of a new technology (e.g., AP) on the expected return generated from breeding a new wheat variety.

TI  - Assessment of aerosol optical properties using remote sensing over highly urbanised twin cities of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ability of aerosols to attenuate solar radiation can be measured in terms of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) or Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), which can be accurately monitored from ground-based stations using ambient air samplers. However, such methods are very expensive and spatially incomplete whereas, satellite-based remote sensing of AOD can be used effectively to quantify the effects of atmospheric aerosols. Developing countries like Pakistan need to enhance usage of such techniques (i.e. ambient air samplers). Currently, Lahore and Karachi are the only two cities in Pakistan where ground-based stations i.e. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are available for air quality measurements. Therefore, this is the first ever study to monitor AOD of Pakistan for cities other than Lahore and Karachi. This study uses AOD simultaneously from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and a handheld sun photometer in densely populated twin (adjoining) cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. It is found that MODIS (Terra and Aqua) can reveal the distribution of aerosols over these cities with 80% of agreement to handheld sun photometer. Mean AOD calculated from green (508 nm) and red (625 nm) channels of handheld sun photometer is 0.49 and 0.37 respectively, with MODIS retrieved AOD found to be 0.40 in green channel. A standard deviation of 0.29 was observed in MODIS 0.26 in green and 0.20 in red channel of the sun photometer in monthly average measurements. There was good agreement between AOD from MODIS and handheld sun photometer with a Slope of 0.87, MAE of 0.15 and RMSE of 0.19 for green channel. However, there was a slightly more than unity slope of 1.14, MAE of 0.12, RMSE of 0.17 for red channel. The area is abundant in medium sized aerosols. Results of the study will be helpful in establishing a baseline for the accuracy assessment of AOD retrieved from satellite over Rawalpindi/Islamabad. Further, it will also help policy makers to measure the impacts of spatiotemporal variations of size and nature of aerosols on air quality and health of the region.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing method is helpful in spatially monitoring shallow water habitat conditions over a wide area. This study aimed to analyze the extent of changes in shallow water habitat of Kaledupa Island, Wakatobi National Park (WNP), for 14 years, from 2002 to 2016. The data of the research were Landsat 8 OLI (2016), Landsat 5TM (2009), and Landsat 7ETM(+) (2002), combined with in-situ and WNP data. Mahalanobis classification was used to produce shallow water habitat maps (live coral, dead coral, seagrass, and sand) and detect their changes. The results obtained that the changes occurred from 2002 to 2016 are live coral cover declines from 2217 ha to 2039 ha; dead coral cover goes down from 3327 ha to 2108 ha; sand area increases from 1201 ha to 1346 ha; and the area of seagrass habitat grows up from 4130 ha to 5294 ha. This method is a good analytical tool to assess the effectiveness of coral reef and seagrass ecosystem protection in Kaledupa Island waters and can be applied to three other main islands in TNW and small islets in Indonesia.

TI  - Urban morphology and landscape structure effect on land surface temperature: Evidence from Shiraz, a semi-arid city
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization process contributes to more urban climate changes specifically the land surface temperature (LST). Higher LST of urban areas compared to the surroundings is regarded as the side effect of urban morphology and landscape structure features. In this study, spectral and landscape indices and morphological variables (parcel density, housing density, road density, floor area ratio, mass-space proportion, land use pattern, and distance to CBD) are applied to investigate the correlation of urban morphology with LST. Landscape and morphological variables are provided from Landsat 5, statistical center of Iran and Shiraz's master plan and also gathered at the census district level. The results found that variables had relatively strong correlations with LST. While SHDI, DIVISION, FRAC, LSI, and road density had positive correlation coefficient, NDBI, housing and parcel density, FAR and mass-space proportion were negatively correlated. Moreover, examining land use pattern and its relation to LST revealed that bare lands, industrial and green spaces had a remarkable negative effect on LST. Also residential areas with moderate and high building density alleviated the surface temperature. Alongside that, dense gardens, lower road density, and more developed districts declined LST in Shiraz, a semi-arid urban environment in Iran.

AB  - BackgroundThe primary purpose of this study was to identify the prognostic role of primary dermal melanoma and tumor mitotic rate in melanomas of the head and neck.MethodsA retrospective review of the histopathologic, clinical, and demographic data of 256 patients was performed to investigate the impact of primary dermal melanoma and tumor mitotic rate on sentinel lymph node positivity, recurrence, and 5-year overall and disease-free survival.ResultsIncreased tumor mitotic rate, but not primary dermal melanoma, is a significant predictor of sentinel lymph node positivity and higher likelihood of recurrence. Survival analysis demonstrated that both increased tumor mitotic rate and primary dermal melanoma decreased the 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates of patients with head and neck melanoma lesions.ConclusionTumor mitotic rate and primary dermal melanoma may have prognostic significance for both overall and disease-free survival in patients with head and neck melanoma. A larger prospective study is warranted to further elucidate prognostic factors for melanoma in the head and neck region.

TI  - Battery State Estimation for Lead-Acid Batteries under Float Charge Conditions by Impedance: Benchmark of Common Detection Methods
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Impedance or admittance measurements are a common indicator for the condition of lead-acid batteries in field applications such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. However, several commercially available measurement units use different techniques to measure and interpret the battery impedance. This paper describes common measurement methods and compares their indication for the state of health (SoH) to those of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For this analysis, two strings consisting each of 24 valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries with a rated voltage of 12 V and about 7 Ah capacity were kept under standard UPS conditions in float charge for over 560 days. They were monitored continuously with a LEM Sentinel 2 and went into regular check-ups with impedance measurements by a Hioki BT3554 as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements with an impedance meter (mu EIS). Today it is widely expected that solely the relative increase of the impedance reading is sufficient for the estimation of the available capacity. However, it can be shown that the measured relative increase deviates for different frequencies and therefore the choice of the excitation signal and measurement frequency does make a difference for the calculation of the available capacity. Finally, a method for a more decisive monitoring in field applications is suggested.

AB  - Background Surgical procedure for breast cancer is not without its side effects and one such side effect is axillary web syndrome (AWS), characterized by palpable fibrotic-like cords in the operated arm. As physical evaluation is the only gold standard method used, our study aims to assess the incidence and early detection of AWS with a self-assessment questionnaire.Methods From July 2013 to July 2014, 370 breast cancer patients were enrolled. AWS incidence was 51.1%, with 94.1% onset in the first 4 weeks after surgery; 43.5% of the patients did not recover in the first 8 weeks. Univariate analysis showed that BMI (P < 0.001), age (P < 0.001), educational level (P = 0.01), and exercise frequency in the eighth week of follow-up (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the AWS detection, and multivariate analyses confirmed that younger patients (age < 50) have significantly higher AWS detection (OR = 2.38 (95%CI 1.53, 3.71) and that BMI is associated with AWS, with normal weight patients (BMI <= 25) having a significantly greater AWS detection with an odds ratio of 2.11 (95%CI 1.33, 3.36).Conclusion Our findings indicated that the incidence of AWS is high in breast cancer patients, particularly in the first month after surgery. Not all patients achieved recovery during our 8 week follow-up, suggesting that evaluation and treatment should be longer. Double AWS detection was found for patients who were younger (age < 50) and with normal weight.

TI  - Detection of Frozen Soil Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR data (C-band) for monitoring agricultural frozen soils. First, investigations were conducted from simulated radar signal data using a SAR backscattering model combined with a dielectric mixing model. Then, Sentinel-1 images acquired at a study site near Paris, France were analyzed using temperature data to investigate the potential of the new Sentinel-1 SAR sensor for frozen soil mapping. The results show that the SAR backscattering coefficient decreases when the soil temperature drops below 0 degrees C. This decrease in signal is the most important for temperatures that ranges between 0 and -5 degrees C. A difference of at least 2 dB is observed between unfrozen soils and frozen soils. This difference increases under freezing condition when the temperature at the image acquisition date decreases. In addition, results show that the potential of the C-band radar signal for the discrimination of frozen soils slightly decreases when the soil moisture decreases (simulated data were used with soil moisture contents of 20 and 30 vol%). The difference between the backscattering coefficient of unfrozen soil and the backscattering coefficient of frozen soil decreases by approximately 1 dB when the soil moisture decreases from 30 to 20 vol%). Finally, the results show that both VV and VH allow a good detection of frozen soils but the sensitivity of VH is higher by approximately 1.5 dB. In conclusion, this study shows that the difference between a reference image acquired without freezing and an image acquired under freezing conditions is a good tool for detecting frozen soils.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations of Soil Active Layer Thickness in Chinese Boreal Forests from 2000 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil active layer in boreal forests is sensitive to climate warming. Climate-induced changes in the active layer may greatly affect the global carbon budget and planetary climatic system by releasing large quantities of greenhouse gases that currently are stored in permafrost. Ground surface temperature is an immediate driver of active layer thickness (ALT) dynamics. In this study, we mapped ALT distribution in Chinese boreal larch forests from 2000 to 2015 by integrating remote sensing data with the Stefan equation. We then examined the changes of the ALT in response to changes in ground surface temperature and identified drivers of the spatio-temporal patterns of ALT. Active layer thickness varied from 1.18 to 1.3 m in the study area. Areas of nonforested land and low elevation or with increased air temperature had a relatively high ALT, whereas ALT was lower at relatively high elevation and with decreased air temperatures. Interannual variations of ALT had no obvious trend, however, and the ALT changed at a rate of only -0.01 and 0.01 m year(-1). In a mega-fire patch of 79,000 ha burned in 2003, ALT (ALT(i) - ALT(2002), where 2003 i 2015) was significantly higher than in the unburned area, with the influence of the wildfire persisting 10 years. Under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5), an increase of 2.6-4.8 degrees C in mean air temperature would increase ALT into 1.46-1.55 m by 2100, which in turn would produce a significant positive feedback to climate warming.

AB  - Dr. Donald L. Morton was clearly the pioneer of the sentinel node biopsy, which was a major advance in oncology that has improved the management of cancer patients worldwide. He conducted a series of practice-changing clinical trials to validate the important staging role of the sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma, and also spawned other studies that demonstrated its staging value in multiple other cancer types, most notably in breast cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. His many contributions in this field have provided a unique opportunity to study host/tumor relationships, since the sentinel lymph node is the first location were the host immune defenses are confronted with metastasis arising from the primary cancer.

TI  - Robust Forest Cover Indices for Multispectral Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees occur in many land cover classes and provide significant ecosystem services. Remotely sensed multispectral images are often used to create thematic maps of land cover, but accurately identifying trees in mixed land-use scenes is challenging. We developed two forest cover indices and protocols that reliably identified trees in World View-2 multispectral images. The study site in Maryland included coniferous and deciduous trees associated with agricultural fields and pastures, residential and commercial buildings, roads, parking lots, wetlands, and forests. The forest cover indices exploited the product of either the reflectance in red (630 to 690 nm) and red edge (705 to 745 nm) bands or the product of reflectance in red and near infrared (770 to 895 nm) bands. For two classes (trees versus other), overall classification accuracy was >77 percent for the four images that were acquired in each season of the year. Additional research is required to evaluate these indices for other scenes and sensors.

TI  - Ensemble Kalman filter analysis of magnetic field models during the CHAMP-Swarm gap
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Between the de-orbiting of CHAMP in September 2010 and the launch of Swarm in November 2013, there was a lack of satellite vector magnetic field data to use for main field modelling. During this period the difference between field models derived at the time and retrospective analysis (using data both before and after the vector gap) rose to around 20 nT root-mean-square (RMS). We use Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) to combine models of steady flow at the outer core surface with magnetic field models derived from the period when no vector satellite data were available. Since we find that the field models produced during periods without vector satellite data are just as good as the annual predictions from a flow model, there appears, at present, to be no overall benefit to using EnKF to improve field forecasting. This will remain the case until flow modelling can better forecast secular variation.

TI  - Benefits and implications of competing on process excellence: Evidence from California hospitals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the healthcare industry is in the midst of a shift to value-based payment models, hospitals face increasing pressure to balance strategic priorities and to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of care delivery. To confront these challenges, hospitals are placing an increased emphasis on process excellence. We use process excellence to denote a hospital's ability to, on average, treat a patient in the most effective and efficient manner. We use actual improvements in cost per discharge (CPD), average length of stay (ALOS), and conformance quality (ConfQual), to assess changes in a hospital's level of process excellence. In this paper, we investigate empirically the association between process excellence and overall measures of hospital performance, including market share and profitability. To this end, we leverage secondary data sources and regression analysis to track over time the performance of 288 short-term acute care hospitals located in California. Our analysis leads to several important implications. First, we find that a hospital's focus on improving CPD and ALOS, is associated with higher inpatient market share, whereas improvements in ConfQual are negatively associated with market share. Second, improvements in CPD are associated with higher profitability while there is no direct relationship between improvements in both ALOS and ConfQual and profitability. Third, CPD is found to mediate the relationship between both ALOS and ConfQual and hospital performance. We further discuss the implications of this study for theory and practice.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Notable land use change and land degradation are occurring in Iran as a result of demographic pressure and consecutive droughts. Landscape indicators are efficient quantitative metrics to assess and monitor the status of the landscape in a general description and can provide the more accurate understanding of land use and land cover. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the usefulness of landscape metrics in the context of land degradation. In this study, land use changes in the Ardabil region of Iran and in two periods of 1987 to 2014 were analyzed and compared. LU/LC maps were obtained from Landsat satellite images by using supervised maximum likelihood classification method coupled with GIS analysis and based on landscape metrics, and finally, structural and functional relations were compared. The results showed that the land use in the studied area has undergone significant changes from 1987 to 2011, half of the rangelands and forest has changed for the benefit of abandoned lands and agricultural lands since 1987. According the results, MNN metrics have declined in all land uses, which indicates the most changes have happened in the land use frontier. Also, the PSSD metrics show an increase in some land uses indicating a disproportionate size of land use classes in the landscape. The IJI metrics have increased in some land uses that indicates an increase in the dispersion of the intended land use at the regional level. The MSI index has risen in residential land use that indicates an increase in irregularity in land use form. MNN index increases in forest land use. This suggests that there is a difference between the remaining patches that have been affected by the deforestation phenomenon. All these changes are evidence of the fact that the structure of landscape goes fragmented and fine-grained under human intervention along with climate change.

TI  - Building Footprint Extraction From VHR Remote Sensing Images Combined With Normalized DSMs Using Fused Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic building extraction and delineation from high-resolution satellite imagery is an important but very challenging task, due to the extremely large diversity of building appearances. Nowadays, it is possible to use multiple high-resolution remote sensing data sources, which allow the integration of different information in order to improve the extraction accuracy of building outlines. Many algorithms are built on spectral-based or appearance-based criteria, from single or fused data sources, to perform the building footprint extraction. But the features for these algorithms are usually manually extracted, which limits their accuracy. Recently developed fully convolutional networks (FCNs), which are similar to normal convolutional neural networks (CNN), but the last fully connected layer is replaced by another convolution layerwith a large "receptive field," quickly became the state-of-the-art method for image recognition tasks, as they bring the possibility to perform dense pixelwise classification of input images. Based on these advantages, i.e., the automatic extraction of relevant features, and dense classification of images, we propose an end-to-end FCN, which effectively combines the spectral and height information from different data sources and automatically generates a full resolution binary building mask. Our architecture (FUSED-FCN4S) consists of three parallel networks merged at a late stage, which helps propagating fine detailed information from earlier layers to higher levels, in order to produce an output with more accurate building outlines. The inputs to the proposed Fused-FCN4s are three-band (RGB), panchromatic (PAN), and normalized digital surface model (nDSM) images. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion of several networks is able to achieve excellent results on complex data. Moreover, the developed model was successfully applied to different cities to show its generalization capacity.

TI  - Suboptimal Compliance With National Comprehensive Cancer Network Melanoma Guidelines <i>Who Is at Risk</i>?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) melanoma treatment guidelines are based on best available literature. We evaluated NCCN excision margin and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) guideline adherence to identify patient populations at risk for suboptimal care.Methods: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent operation for invasive melanoma from January 2005 to 2015.Results: In total, 865 patients underwent operation for 522 thin (60.3%), 268 intermediate-thickness (31.0%), and 75 thick (8.7%) melanomas. Tumor location was 349 extremity (40.4%), 348 trunk (40.2%), and 168 head/neck (19.4%). SLNB was performed in 422 patients (48.8%); 75 (17.8%) were positive, and 67 (15.9%) underwent therapeutic lymphadenectomy. A total of 154 lesions (17.8%) were ulcerated; 444 had mitotic rate Z1 (51.3%). In total, 788 patients (91.1%) fulfilled both NCCN guidelines. Recommended surgical margins were achieved in 837 patients (96.8%) and SLNB was performed as appropriate in 806 patients (93.2%); 10 patients (1.2%) were deficient for both. Deficient margins and lack of SLNB were associated with increased invasion depth and head/neck location; deficient SLNB was associated with age 80 and above (P < 0.0001). Overall recurrence was 7.1%: 15 local (1.7%), 23 regional (2.7%), and 23 distant (2.7%) failures. Local recurrence was associated with head/neck location (P = 0.031); all recurrence types were associated with increased tumor thickness.Conclusions: NCCN excision and SLNB guidelines were almost always met. Patients at risk for not meeting criteria included the elderly and those with head/neck tumors. Failure to meet NCCN criteria was not associated with increased disease recurrence. Surgeons must carefully balance the risks of not pursuing NCCN guidelines with treatment goals.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To determine the validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with ICG in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the factors associated with poor mapping or false negative.Methods. We reviewed all patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial carcinoma with SLN mapping using ICG followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy from February 2014 to December 2015. SLNs were ultrastaged on final pathology. Patients' demographics, surgical approach and histopathological factors were prospectively collected. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and univariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with failed bilateral detection of SLNs.Results. A total of 119 patients were included. The overall and bilateral detection rates were 93% and 74%. Sensitivity and NPV were 100% in patients with bilateral detection; 95% and 99% respectively in cases with at least unilateral detection. Advanced FIGO stage (III or IV) was the only factor related to failed bilateral detection (p = 0.01). In 14 hemi-pelvis, the specimen labelled as SLN did not contain nodal tissue on final pathology (only lymphatic channels), which represented 37% of the "failed detection" cases. One false negative occurred in a patient with an ipsilateral clinically suspicious enlarged lymph node.Conclusion. ICG is an excellent tracer for SLN mapping in endometrial cancer. Advanced FIGO stage correlated with failed bilateral detection (p = 0.01). Suspicious lymph nodes should be removed regardless of the mapping. Care should be taken to ensure that SLN specimen actually contains nodal tissue and not only swollen lymphatic channels, as this represents a significant cause of failed SLN mapping.

TI  - High sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in a retrospective early stage oral cavity cancer cohort in the Northern Netherlands
T2  - CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: In cT1-2N0, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) occult metastases are detected in 23%-37% of cases. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced in head and neck cancer as a minimally invasive alternative for an elective neck dissection in neck staging. Meta-analyses of SLNB accuracy show heterogeneity in the existing studies for reference standards, imaging techniques and pathological examination. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the SLNB in detecting occult metastases in cT1-2N0 OSCC in a well-defined cohort.Design: Retrospective study. The SLNB procedure consisted of lymphoscintigraphy, SPECT/CT-scanning and gamma probe detection. Routine follow-up was the reference standard for the SLNB negative neck. Histopathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) consisted of step serial sectioning, haematoxylin-eosin and cytokeratin AE1/3 staining.Setting: Two comprehensive oncology centres.Participants: A total of 91 consecutive patients with primary cT1-2N0 OSCC treated by primary resection and neck staging by SLNB procedure between 2008 and 2016.Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and negative predictive value.Results: In all cases, SLNs were harvested. A total of 25 (27%) patients had tumour-positive SLNs. The median follow-up was 32months (range 2-104). Four patients were diagnosed with an isolated regional recurrence in the SLNB negative neck side resulting in an 85% sensitivity and a 94% NPV.Conclusion: In our cohort, the SLNB detected occult metastases in early OSCC with 85% sensitivity and 94% NPV. This supports that SLNB is a reliable procedure for surgical staging of the neck in case of oral cT1-2N0 SCC.

TI  - Evidence of vegetation greening at alpine treeline ecotones: three decades of Landsat spectral trends informed by lidar-derived vertical structure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in vegetation at high-latitude and alpine treeline ecotones is critical for characterizing changes to carbon and energy budgets, plant species richness, and habitat suitability and is often considered a bellwether of a changing climate. Herein, we used transects of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to identify alpine treeline ecotones in the Yukon Territory of Canada, and assessed changes in vegetation greenness using a time-series of Landsat imagery over a 30 year period from 1985 to 2015. Specifically, we calculated the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from annual Landsat composites and assessed temporal trends within 500mof detected forest-lines (i.e., transition point from continuous forest into treeline ecotones) using Theil-Sen's nonparametric regression. Across 74 detected treeline ecotones, 27.5% of Landsat pixels displayed a significant positive trend in EVI and 5.6% of pixels displayed a significant negative trend (p < 0.05). By using ALS data to determine vegetation structural class, we found that non-treed pixels had the highest percentage of significant positive trends in vegetation greenness (40.8%), followed by shrubs (30.5%), with lower percentages in sparse forests (18.9%) and open/dense forests (13.3%). These results suggest herbaceous and shrub vegetation types are undergoing the most significant changes in greenness, likely due to increases in shrub cover and herbaceous biomass in areas associated with these alpine treeline ecotones. The limited increases in EVI in forests likely indicates that vegetation cover is changing less rapidly in forests than in shrub and herbaceous vegetation types. Moreover, EVI may not be capturing increased height growth in forests near the treeline. Combining ALS data and Landsat time-series data provides a useful approach to locate and characterize alpine treeline ecotones, and enables the direct assessment of which vegetation structural classes are experiencing the greatest greening trends, thereby providing new insights to ecosystem change.

TI  - Temporal evaluation of evapotranspiration for sugar cane, planted forest and native forest using landsat 8 images and a two-source energy balance
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that vegetation needs a certain amount of water to grow and develop. However, it can be difficult to know the actual water requirement of a specific crop. To quantify the hydric balance in hydrographic basins, detailed knowledge of the components of the hydrological cycle is necessary, especially regarding evapotranspiration (ET). Knowledge of ET of crops and forests, in general, is important at all stages of production management of the vegetation cover. Many studies have been developed with the aim of obtaining these values spatially, but temporal variability remains largely uncertain. Thus, the present study had the objective of utilizing a hybrid Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB), adjusted to integrate hourly, monthly and yearly ET data, aiming at obtaining ET for two years of study, for areas with sugar cane, planted forest and native forest. How evapotranspiration behaves temporally could then be evaluated. Therefore, after analyzing monthly, seasonal and annual results it could be concluded that sugar cane consumes less water than planted forest and native forest with the same rainfall and environment for all uses.

TI  - Use of the SAR Shadowing Effect for Deforestation Detection with Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To detect deforestation using Earth Observation (EO) data, widely used methods are based on the detection of temporal changes in the EO measurements within the deforested patches. In this paper, we introduce a new indicator of deforestation obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which relies on a geometric artifact that appears when deforestation happens, in the form of a shadow at the border of the deforested patch. The conditions for the appearance of these shadows are analyzed, as well as the methods that can be employed to exploit them to detect deforestation. The approach involves two steps: (1) detection of new shadows; (2) reconstruction of the deforested patch around the shadows. The launch of Sentinel-1 in 2014 has opened up opportunities for a potential exploitation of this approach in large-scale applications. A deforestation detection method based on this approach was tested in a 600,000 ha site in Peru. A detection rate of more than 95% is obtained for samples larger than 0.4 ha, and the method was found to perform better than the optical-based UMD-GLAD Forest Alert dataset both in terms of spatial and temporal detection. Further work needed to exploit this approach at operational levels is discussed.

TI  - Slavery from Space: Demonstrating the role for satellite remote sensing to inform evidence-based action related to UN SDG number 8
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most recent Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 40.3 million people enslaved globally. The UN's Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goal number 8, section 8.7 specifically refers to the issue of forced labour: ending modern slavery and human trafficking, including child labour, in all forms by 2025. Although there is a global political commitment to ending slavery, one of the biggest barriers to doing so is having reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on slavery activity. The lack of these data compromises evidence-based action and policy formulation. Thus, to meet the challenge of ending modern slavery new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on efficient use of resources (including financial) are needed. This paper demonstrates the fundamental role of remote sensing as a source of evidence. We provide an estimate of the number of brick kilns across the 'Brick Belt' that runs across south Asia. This is important because these brick kilns are known sites of modern-day slavery. This paper reports the first rigorous estimate of the number of brick kilns present and does so using a robust method that can be easily adopted by key agencies for evidence-based action (i.e. NGOs, etc.) and is based on freely available and accessible remotely sensed data. From this estimate we can not only calculate the scale of the slavery problem in the Brick Belt, but also calculate the impact of slavery beyond that of the enslaved people themselves, on, for example, environmental change and impacts on ecosystem services this links to other Sustainable Development Goals. As the process of achieving key Sustainable Development Goal targets will show, there are global benefits to ending slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener, more prosperous, and more equal. This is termed here a Freedom Dividend. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Perception of Candomble Practitioners About Herbal Medicine and Health Promotion in Ceara, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Candomble, a Brazilian religion of African origin that worships Orishas, promotes "healing" assistance during its worship rituals using therapy with plants and beliefs. From its ancestry tradition, the respect and beware with nature are expressed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the perception of ethnoecology and health promotion among Candomble practitioners from a Candomble temple in the state of Ceara, Brazil. The ethnography was designed to allow greater immersion into the current mystique. This immersion results in the breaking of existing prejudices and admiration for their worldview. Thus, it can be observed that people seek Candomble to get rid of "bad" health difficulties, such as insomnia, depression, eyesight problems among others, which are commonly treated with herbal preparations, baths, and teas, using plants native to the region; however, their indications are not always in accordance with scientific evidence. In parallel with biomedicine, their hospitable and healthcare practices are considered by most as the equivalent to traditional healthcare actions, but greater recognition of biomedicine is necessary. Based on this perspective, the use of native plants in Candomble is examples of memory, hospitality, and humanization for the community wellness.

TI  - Ammonia emissions from biomass burning in the continental United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantifies ammonia (NH3) emissions from biomass burning from 2005 to 2015 across the continental US (CONUS) and compares emissions from biomass burning with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI), the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). A statistical regression model was developed in order to predict NH3 emissions from biomass burning using a combination of fire properties and meteorological data. Satellite data were used to evaluate the annual fire strength and frequency as well as to calculate the total NH3 emissions across the CONUS. The results of this study showed the total fire number has decreased, while the total yearly burn area and the average fire radiative power has increased. The average annual NH3 emissions from biomass burning from this study, on a national scale, were approximately 5.4e8 +/- 3.3e8 kg year(-1). When comparing the results of this study with other emission inventories, it was found that ammonia emissions estimated by the NEI were approximately a factor of 1.3 lower than what was calculated in this study and a factor of 1.1 lower than what was modeled using the statistical regression model for 2010-2014. The calculated NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.9 and a factor of 13.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. The modeled NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.0 and a factor of 11.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. As the climate continues to change, the pattern (frequency, intensity and magnitude) of fires across the US will also change, leading to changes in NH3 emissions. The statistical regression model developed in this study will allow prediction of NH3 emissions associated with climate change.

TI  - Inconsistent relationships between annual tree ring-widths and satellite- measured NDVI in a mountainous subarctic environment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent climate warming has intensified efforts to understand patterns of vegetation productivity at northern high latitudes. Remotely-sensed and dendrochronological measurements have indicated significant changes in aboveground vegetation production in these regions, but the relationship between the two indicators remains unclear. We examined the relationship between remotely-sensed data, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and annual ring-width indices obtained from trees and shrubs in the boreal mountains of southwest Yukon. A 24-year (1990-2013) trend in annual maximum NDVI was generated from two Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) datasets: the Alaska Composite NDVI (1 km), and the third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS(3g)) NDVI (8 km). Twenty sites were systematically selected for dendrochronological sampling and chronologies were developed for the dominant coniferous (Picea glauca and Picea mariana) and deciduous (Salix glauca, Alnus crispa, and Populus tremuloides) species at each site. NDVI trends indicated low-level greening across much of the region during the 24-year period. However, ring-width trends varied in direction and magnitude and the agreement with annual maximum NDVI was low. Correlations between annual ring-width indices and biweekly NDVI values were also low, although eight coniferous chronologies did show significant positive correlations with GIMMS(3g) biweekly data, suggesting that radial growth may be reflected in NDVI at some point during the growing season. Reasons for the inconsistent relationships between ring-width and NDVI remain unclear. Future studies should examine the role of climatic variables on the ring-width-NDVI relationship, especially when multiple datasets and various resolutions are being used. Investigating the relative contributions of plant growth, establishment of new plants, and changes in plant resource allocation to NDVI trends are critical to achieve a more functional understanding of the changes occurring in mountainous boreal ecosystems.

TI  - Overcoming the Problem With Solving Business Problems: Using Theory Differently to Rejuvenate the Case Method for Turbulent Times
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A questioning of the neoliberal consensus in the global economic order is creating turbulence in Western democracies. Long regarded as the only viable capitalist model, neoliberalism is now subjected to increasing scrutiny. Management education that has been aligned to a neoliberal worldview must now respond to this shifting landscape in order to retain its legitimacy. One core element of management education undergoing revision as a result is the case method of teaching. The case method's traditionally narrow focus on training students to solve business problems is increasingly problematic in an environment where the structure of the capitalist system in which firms operate is now a topic of debate. To address this, we argue for a reconceptualization of the case method's relationship with theory. This has conventionally taken two forms: a hostility to any inclusion of theory in the analytical process and an approach that uses theory as an instrument for profit maximization. We propose an alternative third approach that encourages students to engage in a critical questioning of business-as-usual capitalism from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including managers, employees, unions, not-for-profit organizations, government, and the natural environment.

TI  - A comparison of multispectral aerial and satellite imagery for mapping intertidal seaweed communities
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Habitat- forming seaweeds are vital components of marine ecosystems, supporting immense diversity and providing ecosystem services. Reports of major changes in the distribution and abundance of large brown seaweeds in the north- east Atlantic are an increasing cause for concern, but a lack of consistent monitoring over time is a key impediment in obtaining reliable evidence of change. There is an urgent need to recognize change rapidly and efficiently in marine communities, which are increasingly affected by pressures of human population growth, climate change, and ocean acidification. 2. Here, the potential for remote monitoring of seaweed habitats is investigated using freely available, high- resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Three sources of imagery were used: ( i) Channel Coastal Observatory ( CCO) aerial imagery; ( ii) aerial images from the Bing webmap server; and ( iii) RapidEye multispectral satellite data. 3. The study area, the Thanet Coast, is an area of chalk outcrop in south- east England of high conservation status, and includes three Marine Conservation Zones. Eight habitat classes, including brown, red, and green algal zones, were recognized based on ground- truthing surveys. 4. A multi- class classification model was developed to predict habitat classes based on the chromatic signature derived from the aerial images. The model based on the high- resolution CCO imagery gave the best outcome ( with a kappa value of 0.89). 5. Comparing predictions for images in 2001 and 2013 revealed habitat changes, but it is unclear as to what extent these are natural variability or real trends. This study demonstrates the potential value for long- term monitoring with remote- sensing data. Repeated, standardized coastal aerial imaging surveys, such as those performed by CCO, permit the rapid assessment and re- assessment of habitat extent and change. This is of value to the conservation management of protected areas, particularly those defined by the presence or extent of specific habitats.

AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm (SLN-A) on the staging in high-risk endometrial cancer (EC) compared to SLN plus selective lymphadenectomy (S-LND).Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the database from a multicenter collaboration that included women with high risk features who underwent primary surgical staging.Results. One-hundred and seventy-one women were identified (171), 66 in the SLN-A and 105 in the S-LND group, respectively. Pelvic LD was performed on 115 patients (67.2%) and aortic dissection was performed in 54/105 of the women in the S-LND group (51%). The 5-year comparison did not show a significant difference in the strategy adopted for nodal staging, regarding disease-free survival (DFS) [HR: 0.82; 95% CI 0.53-1.28; p = 0.390].Conclusions. In this study focusing on women with EC in the HR groups, we did not find a difference in the 5 year DFS when comparing the SLN-A strategy with S-LND. The SLN strategy did not seem to compromise the prognosis of patients with a higher risk of recurrence. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Coordinated Nanoscale Compositional and Oxidation State Measurements of Lunar Space-Weathered Material
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space weathering on airless bodies includes a number of processes, such as micrometeorite impacts and solar wind bombardment, which leads to a variety of microscale to nanoscale alteration features, including vapor deposited layers on grain and rock surfaces and creation of nanophase opaque inclusions. The nanophase inclusions cause reddening and darkening of the visible to near-infrared spectra of space weathered material, features associated with increasing space exposure of many airless body regoliths. On the Moon, most nanophase inclusions are metallic iron (npFe(0)), but recent work using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy has provided evidence of oxidized nanoparticles in space weathered lunar soil grains. We examined three different lunar soils in order to confirm the finding of oxidized nanophase inclusions and to provide detailed elemental and mineralogical information about the surrounding material. Our data show that substrate and rim composition are key factors in determining whether highly localized oxidation occurs; for example, nanophase inclusions in rims on low Fe substrates are more prone to oxidation. Detailed understanding of the phases and features present in these samples is necessary for the correct interpretation of remotely sensed data as well as extrapolation from processes on the lunar surface to those on other airless bodies.Plain Language Summary The Moon and asteroids are being constantly altered by interactions with the space environment, a process known as space weathering. These interactions, such as with solar wind ions and micrometeoroids, can be studied by examining samples from the Moon and analyzing the nanoscale features present in surface coatings or rims on small lunar dust grains. Using techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope, we are able to image and measure the composition and oxidation state of the nanoscale inclusions and layers in these rims. These data provide evidence of complex material interactions, such as formation of metallic iron inclusions at a variety of sizes contained within specific sublayers, and oxidation to magnetite of some of those inclusions. From this information, we can better interpret spacecraft and telescopic data of the Moon and asteroids that can be significantly influenced by space weathering and the presence of nanoscale inclusions. We can also compare these data to samples that have been experimentally space weathered in the laboratory using pulsed laser or ion irradiation in order to gain a better understanding of the conditions necessary to create observed features.

TI  - Burned area estimations derived from Landsat ETM plus and OLI data: Comparing Genetic Programming with Maximum Likelihood and Classification and Regression Trees
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Every year, large areas of savannas and woodlands burn due to natural conditions and land management practices. Given the relevant level of greenhouse gas emissions produced by biomass burning in tropical regions, it is becoming even more important to clearly define historic fire regimes so that prospective emission reduction management strategies can be well informed, and their results Measured, Reported, and Verified (MRV). Thus, developing tools for accurately, and periodically mapping burned areas, based on cost advantageous, expedite, and repeatable rigorous approaches, is important. The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of novel Genetic Programming (GP) methodologies for classifying burned areas in satellite imagery over savannas and tropical woodlands and to assess if they can improve over the popular and currently applied methods of Maximum Likelihood classification and Classification and Regression Tree analysis. The tests are performed using three Landsat images from Brazil (South America), Guinea-Bissau (West Africa) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Central Africa). Burned areas were digitized on-screen to produce mapped information serving as surrogate ground-truth. Validation results show that all methods provide an overestimation of burned area, but GP achieves higher accuracy values in two of the three cases. GP is the most versatile machine learning method available today, but still largely underused in remote sensing. This study shows that standard GP can produce better results than two classical methods, and illustrates its versatility and potential in becoming a mainstream method for more difficult tasks involving the large amounts of newly available data.

AB  - An alternative technique for shadow detection and abundance is presented for high spatial resolution imagery acquired under clear sky conditions from airborne/spaceborne sensors. The method, termed Scattering Index (SI), uses Rayleigh scattering principles to create a diffuse skylight vector as a shadow reference. From linear algebra, the proportion of diffuse skylight in each image pixel provides a per pixel measure of shadow extent and abundance. We performed a comparative evaluation against two other methods, first valley detection thresholding (extent) and physics-based unmixing (extent and abundance). Overall accuracy and F-score measures are used to evaluate shadow extent on both Worldview-3 and ADS40 images captured over a common scene. Image subsets are selected to capture objects well documented as shadow detection anomalies, e.g., dark water bodies. Results showed improved accuracies and F-scores for shadow extent and qualitative evaluation of abundance show the method is invariant to scene and sensor characteristics. SI avoids shadow misclassifications by avoiding the use of pixel intensity and the associated limitations of binary thresholding. The method negates the need for complex sun-object-sensor corrections, it is simple to apply, and it is invariant to the exponential increase in scene complexity associated with higher-resolution imagery.

TI  - Global Estimation of Biophysical Variables from Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a processing chain for the derivation of global Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Canopy water content (CWC) maps from 15-years of MODIS data exploiting the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reflectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R = 0.42 and R = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product definitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.

TI  - A Multibaseline InSAR Phase Unwrapping Method Using Designed Optimal Baselines Obtained by Motion Compensation Algorithm
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multibaseline (MB) interferometric synthetic aperture radar phase unwrapping (PU) has the advantage of using the baseline diversity to increase the ambiguity intervals of the interferometric phases and overcome the limitation of the phase continuity assumption. One major challenge of the MB PU is that the performance of PU greatly depends on the baseline configuration. In this letter, the motion compensation algorithm is used to modify the baselines of the interferograms. Therefore, optimal baseline configuration can be used in the MB PU to improve the PU performance. Real ALOS/PALSAR data over Himalayan mountain area have been used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the MB PU with modified baselines becomes more reliable.

TI  - Assessment and Assimilation of FY-3 Humidity Sounders and Imager in the UK Met Office Global Model
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - China's FengYun 3 (FY-3) polar orbiting satellites are set to become an important source of observational data for numerical weather prediction (NWP), atmospheric reanalyses, and climate monitoring studies over the next two decades. As part of the Climate Science for Service Partnership China (CSSP China) program, FY-3B Microwave Humidity Sounder 1 (MWHS-1) and FY-3C MWHS-2 observations have been thoroughly assessed and prepared for operational assimilation. This represents the first time observations from China's polar orbiting satellites have been used in the UK's global NWP model. Since 2016, continuous data quality monitoring has shown occasional bias changes found to be correlated to changes in the energy supply scheme regulating the platform heating system and other transient anomalies. Nonetheless, MWHS-1 and MWHS-2 significantly contribute to the 24-h forecast error reduction by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, and the combination of both instruments is shown to improve the fit to the model background of independent sounders by up to 1%. The observations from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) also are a potentially significant source of benefits for NWP models, but a solar-dependent bias observed in the instrument half-orbits has prevented their assimilation. This paper presents the bases of a correction scheme developed at the Met Office for the purpose of a future assimilation of MWRI data.

TI  - Older Adult Falls in Emergency Medicine - A Sentinel Event
T2  - CLINICS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Standing-level falls represent the most frequent cause of trauma-related death in older adults and a common emergency department presentation. However, these patients rarely receive guideline-directed screening and interventions during or following an episode of care. Reducing injurious falls in an aging society begins with prehospital evaluations and continues through risk assessments and interventions that occur after emergency department care. Although obstacles to emergency department-initiated, evidence-based older adult fall reduction strategies include the absence of a compelling emergency medicine evidence basis, innovations underway include validation of screening instruments and incorporation of contemporary technology, such as smartphones, to improve fall detection rates.

TI  - Performance of biomarkers metallothionein and ethoxyresorufin <i>O</i>-deethylase in aquatic environments: A meta-analytic approach
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The preservation of natural environments guarantees the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Biomonitoring programs in preserved sites can be carried out using molecular biomarkers, which reflect possible stresses that exist in the monitored location. The metallothionein (MT) proteins and isoenzyme Cytochrome P4501A (CYP4501A) are among the most used biomarkers and reflect the detoxification of metal and organic xenobiotics, respectively. This study aimed to assess the performance of these biomarkers in natural aquatic environments using a meta-analytic approach. The data search was conducted in ISI Web of Science (TM), considering papers published until August 2016. Studies included in this research needed to compare reference or control sites and sites under stress and be conducted in situ. In general, both biomarkers were useful when comparing control sites with sites under stress. Moreover, when the data were categorized into groups of organisms, mainly bivalves and fishes, there were differences between the groups and between the monitored environments, marine or freshwater. The use of these biomarkers in fish is suitable for freshwater environments, and bivalves are suitable for marine environments. We concluded that the concomitant use of vertebrate and invertebrate bioindicators is useful to develop an effective biomonitoring program and to avoid biases due the physiology of the selected bioindicator.

TI  - Land Surface Albedo Derived on a Ten Daily Basis from Meteosat Second Generation Observations: The NRT and Climate Data Record Collections from the EUMETSAT LSA SAF
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo determines the splitting of downwelling solar radiation into components which are either reflected back to the atmosphere or absorbed by the surface. Land surface albedo is an important variable for the climate community, and therefore was defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Within the scope of the Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis (LSA SAF) of EUMETSAT (European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), a near-real time (NRT) daily albedo product was developed in the last decade from observations provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument on board the geostationary satellites of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) series. In this study we present a new collection of albedo satellite products based on the same satellite data. The MSG Ten-day Albedo (MTAL) product incorporates MSG observations over 31 days with a frequency of NRT production of 10 days. The MTAL collection is more dedicated to climate analysis studies compared to the daily albedo that was initially designed for the weather prediction community. For this reason, a homogeneous reprocessing of MTAL was done in 2018 to generate a climate data record (CDR). The resulting product is called MTAL-R and has been made available to the community in addition to the NRT version of the MTAL product which has been available for several years. The retrieval algorithm behind the MTAL products comprises three distinct modules: One for atmospheric correction, one for daily inversion of a semi-empirical model of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function, and one for monthly composition, that also determines surface albedo values. In this study the MTAL-R CDR is compared to ground surface measurements and concomitant albedo products collected by sensors on-board polar-orbiting satellites (SPOT-VGT and MODIS). We show that MTAL-R meets the quality requirements if MODIS or SPOT-VGT are considered as reference. This work leads to 14 years of production of geostationary land surface albedo products with a guaranteed continuity in the LSA SAF for the future years with the forthcoming third generation of European geostationary satellites.

TI  - Geometric Controls on Tidewater Glacier Retreat in Central Western Greenland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier terminus changes are one of the hallmarks of worldwide glacier change, and thus, there is significant focus on the controls and limits to retreat in the literature. Here we use the observational record of glacier terminus change from satellite remote sensing data to characterize glacier retreat in central West Greenland with a focus on the last 30years. We compare terminus observations of retreat to glacier/fjord geometry from available bed and bathymetry data and find that glacier retreat accelerates through wide, overdeepened parts of the bed characterized by retrograde bed slopes. We find that the morphology of the overdeepening can be used as a predictive measure for the length of retreat and that short regions (less than twice the seasonal change in terminus position) of the bed with prograde bed slopes are not sufficient to stop a retreating terminus. Even narrow overdeepenings can control glacier retreat, likely because they focus subglacial runoff, which entrains warm water in the fjords when it emerges at the grounding line and melts the terminus, creating enhanced local retreat. Future retreat of these glaciers is assessed given upstream fjord geometry.Plain Language Summary Glaciers that reach the marine margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet are experiencing increases in mass loss over time. These losses are greater than land-terminating glaciers and are spatially variable. Even glaciers that drain into the same fjord system can experience different amounts, rates, and durations of retreat and thinning. To explain this, we examined retreat over an approximate to 30-year record derived from satellite images of Greenland and compared it to the submarine fjord and subglacial topography across a region containing 15 glaciers. We find good correspondence between glacier retreat and the length of an overdeepened reach of the fjord behind the glacier terminus.

TI  - Sensitivity of mangrove range limits to climate variability
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Correlative distribution models have been used to identify potential climatic controls of mangrove range limits, but there is still uncertainty about the relative importance of these factors across different regions. To provide insights into the strength of climatic control of different mangrove range limits, we tested whether temporal variability in mangrove abundance increases near range limits and whether this variability is correlated with climatic factors thought to control large-scale mangrove distributions.Location: North and South America.Time period: 1984-2011.Major taxa studied: Avicennia germinans, Avicennia schuaeriana, Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa.Methods: We characterized temporal variability in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) at mangrove range limits using Landsat satellite imagery collected between 1984-2011. We characterized greening trends at each range limit, examined variability in EVI along latitudinal gradients near each range limit, and assessed correlations between changes in EVI and temperature and precipitation.Results: Spatial variability in mean EVI was generally correlated with temperature and precipitation, but the relationships were region specific. Greening trends were most pronounced at range limits in eastern North America. In these regions variability in EVI increased toward the range limit and was sensitive to climatic factors. In contrast, EVI at range limits on the Pacific coast of North America and both coasts of South America was relatively stable and less sensitive to climatic variability.Main conclusions: Our results suggest that range limits in eastern North America are strongly controlled by climate factors. Mangrove expansion in response to future warming is expected to be rapid in regions that are highly sensitive to climate variability (e.g. eastern North America), but the response in other range limits (e.g. South America) is likely to be more complex and modulated by additional factors such as dispersal limitation, habitat constraints, and/or changing climatic means rather than just extremes.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall variability and its relationship with land surface phenology in central east Argentina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition zones between dry and humid climates are highly sensitive areas where small changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall may have vast consequences on vegetation development. Rainfall regimes are expected to change worldwide and predictions include variations in total annual precipitation and timing of rain events. In this context, evaluating the relationship between vegetation activity and rainfall variability along transition zones is particularly relevant. In this study, 54 years (1961-2013) of gridded monthly rainfall data (Climatic Research Unit Time-Series Version 3.22 [CRU TS3.22]) were used to analyse annual and inter-annual rainfall variability. Land surface phenology (LSP) metrics (2000-2013) were derived from MODIS 16-day composites Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (MOD13Q1 product) and relationship between rainfall variability and LSP metrics was assessed. Annual rainfall showed a strong seasonality in the northeast of the study area that diminishes towards the southwest. Inter-annual rainfall variability, which showed a significant 8-year cycle periodicity after 1980, was stronger in the southwest of the region. For most of the study area, summer rainfall (November-January) showed significant negative correlation with August-October Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) average, although this connection was not reflected in annual precipitation totals. Regarding vegetation response to rainfall variability, two main areas were identified where differences in LSP metrics between wet and dry years were larger than the average. The first one was a zone within the humid to semi-arid transition belt, where NDVI maximum, NDVI amplitude and NDVI integral showed higher values during wet years. The second one was the central north area, which showed higher NDVI amplitude values during dry years. In the study area, water availability is a sensitive issue for natural ecosystems, agriculture and cattle-raising. These results provide a better understanding of the relationship between rainfall variability and vegetation changes, which is useful information for the development of future management policies.

TI  - Fog and Low Cloud Frequency and Properties from Active-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of fog and low cloud properties and distribution is performed using satellite-based LiDAR. Recent years have seen great progress in the remote sensing of fog and low clouds using passive satellite-based sensors. On this basis, maps of fog distribution and frequency as well as baseline climatologies have been constructed. However, no information on fog altitude and vertical extent is available in this way, and fog/low cloud below other clouds cannot be detected in most cases. In this study, ten years of observations by the LiDAR aboard the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Pathfinder Satellite Observations) platform are used to construct a map and statistical evaluations of fog/low cloud distribution and properties. For the purpose of evaluation, a comparison is made to an evaluation of fog/low cloud distribution in Europe, derived from Meteosat measurements using the Satellite-Based Operation Fog Observation Scheme (SOFOS). Both maps show good agreement in spatial patterns in this region with very diverse fog formation mechanisms. It is found that fog/low cloud layers display distinct spatial differences in terms of geometrical thickness and detection accuracy. The number of fog/low cloud instances missed by passive-sensor retrievals due to multi-layer cloud situations is considerable, with clear regional differences.

TI  - Annual Urban Expansion Extraction and Spatio-Temporal Analysis Using Landsat Time Series Data: A Case Study of Tianjin, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a new method of extracting urban land expansion using annual Landsat time series data and then analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method includes two major stages, i.e., one-class classification and subsequent spatio-temporal refinement. A one-class classification method, one-class support vector machine, was first adopted to classify Landsat image of each year, producing initial urban land classification results. These initial classification results constitute a time sequence of urban land. A spatio-temporal refinement method was then applied to improve the initial urban classification results (and urban land sequence) and to obtain a more accurate urban expansion result. The proposed method was evaluated using Landsat images over Tianjin area, China, from 1990 to 2014. Results showed that the proposed spatio-temporal refinement method significantly improved initial classification results for all 25 years, with increases in overall accuracy from 4.3% to 11.7%. Compared to an existing method, the proposed method achieved both higher classification accuracies for individual years and higher accuracy of urban expansion. The spatio-temporal analysis of the results revealed that Tianjin area experienced an accelerating double-centric urban expansion process during 1990-2014. The main urban expansion type was edge-expansion and urban expansion was spatially concentrated along railways and the coastline.

M3  - Article
AB  - Tatun Volcanic Group (TVG) in the northernmost tip of Taiwan is an active volcano area with the possible magnitude of volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 4 which can devastate the Taipei metropolitan area if eruption occurs. To integrate Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing for exploring geothermal energy and monitoring volcanic activity in TVG, Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery is used to retrieve the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Radiative Hcat Flux (RHF); MODIS 8-day average LST products are adopted for monitoring Jinshan fault zone of TVG. Validated results show that occurrences of hot springs and fumaroles conform to LST anomaly distribution and the overall temperature in E-W ridge is higher than the SW-NE ridge in TVG. Thermal anomaly patterns indicate that distributions of higher LST areas appear correlating with the development of Jinshan fault; for further verification, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was applied for decomposing MODIS 8-day average LST time series (2002 - 2016) in Jinshan fault zone. Possible related physical processes underneath Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) components based on HHT were also elaborated. The inference that LST component with average period around a month (EEMD component 1, i.e., C1) has irregular spikes which is likely associated with earthquakes in TVG has been investigated in detail. Finally, HHT comparison analysis with three active volcanoes in Philippines and Indonesia is performed for assessing the eruption potential of TVG. Preliminary results show that the regular C4 annual cycle from TVG's LST time series implies the TVG's current status is calm and resting with no sign of eruption for future decades.

TI  - Evaluation of Particle Resuspension and Single-layer Rates with Exposure Time and Friction Velocity for Multilayer Deposits in a Turbulent Boundary Layer
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work deals with the resuspension of small nondeformable particles from multilayer deposits in a turbulent boundary layer. A kinetic force-balance approach was adopted to model particle motion at the point of detachment, whereby intermolecular interactions were modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential. The rate of change of the number of particles was estimated for each discrete layer based on existing kinetic models. In particular, the kinetic equations of Lazaridis and Drossinos (1998), LD, and Friess and Yadigaroglu (2001), FY, were implemented and compared using lattice arranged deposits. The influence of exposure time and friction velocity was investigated through the obtained resuspension rates. It was found that the single-layer resuspension rates were substantially affected by the layer position within the deposit as well as considerably influenced by both the exposure time and the friction velocity. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate that the LD kinetic estimates higher resuspension rates compared to the FY kinetic only for short exposures to the flow, predominantly due to a different expression for the fraction of exposed particles. In addition, the present study recognized the time dependence (i.e., a short-term vs. long-term regime) of the resuspension rate observed both experimentally (Wu et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2012) and by model predictions (Lazaridis and Drossinos, 1998; Friess and Yadigaroglu, 2001; Reeks and Hall, 2001) and confirmed the inverse dependence of the resuspension rate with time in long-term regime. Two regimes were also identified while evaluating the resuspension rate for a range of friction velocities, viz., a low-friction regime in which the resuspension rate increases with friction and a high-friction regime in which the opposite behaviour was observed.

TI  - The social economy facing emerging economic concepts: social innovation, social responsibility, collaborative economy, social enterprises and solidary economy
T2  - CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades and prominently since the economic crisis and the crisis of legitimacy of the prevailing economic model based on for profit private businesses, a plurality of terms and notions have emerged in the academic field and in the economic and political world. They are concepts such as the social enterprises, the solidarity economy, the collaborative economy, the circular economy, the economy of the common good, the fourth sector, the social innovation and the corporate social responsibility. The objective of this paper is to explain this new wave of notions, to study their meanings and to identify their differences and commonalities in relation to the consolidated concept of social economy. This work is based on the study carried recently for the European Economic and Social Committee (Monzon & Chaves, 2017).Within the framework of the Kuhn's theory of the scientific revolutions, in this paper we have proposed that in the social sciences, major changes in paradigms or scientific revolutions, and with them, changes in the language and concepts that generate a new worldview, are produced simultaneously to the great crisis and socio-economic transformations. In this framework, for the recent history, we have identified two periods of scientific revolutions in the field of the social economy / third sector, which we have called 'conceptual waves' and, between them, a period of normal science. The first wave of concepts appeared in the late seventies and eighties, with the oil crisis. During this first wave, the concepts of the social economy and of the nonprofit emerged. As rival approaches they coexisted as mainstream normal science until the second wave. The second wave of notions came out during the current economic crisis and the legitimization of the prevailing economic model. Other explanatory factors, linked to the sociology of the social scientist and of sociopolitical type, may also have influenced this proliferation of notions, such as the scientist pressure for differentiation and originality, and the positioning of some institutions in favor of some terms and against others.The social economy concept continues to be, with that of nonprofit organizations, the mainstream paradigm to refer to the 'space between the public economy and the private for profit economy'. It has a broad scientific and political consensus regarding its definition, it is well institutionalized and quantified and it has a strong scientific and social notoriety. It is a concept based on structural criteria, such as its social aims, its participatory and democratic decisional criterion and its profit distributive criterion based on the prevalence of people and labor factor over capital. Finally, it is not reduced to a few classical legal forms. Between these two main concepts of the "first wave" there are significant differences in terms of their scope and their structural criteria, as well as in terms of their systemic functions. Their main differences focus on the importance given to the social mission and the democratic criterion in the social economy approach and on the relevance of the distributive criterion, based on the non-distribution constraint, in the second approach.The following conclusions have been obtained from a detailed analysis of the different emerging concepts. First, given its novelty, there is still no broad consensus regarding their definitions. Terminological inflation is then joined by a semantic inflation. Secondly, these notions present are still in an incipient institutionalization process, if we attend their inclusion in official documents or position papers of the European institutions. Thirdly, they still present a low level of academic and social notoriety, measured by their presence in specialized academic search engines, such as Dialnet and Google Scholar. From its semantic comparative analysis with that of the social economy, it can be seen that they are not rival concepts with the latter, but rather complementary and even revitalizing concepts of the social economy concept itself. This conclusion has been reached using the following typology of these concepts:Group 1, notions linked to the main challenges/fields of the system crisis and transformation; Group 2, notions linked to the reorientation of the objectives and governance of organizations and economies, both at the micro and macro level, with new assess and incentive mechanisms; and finally, Group 3, notions linked to new ways of understanding entrepreneurship.In the first group are included the concepts of social innovation, collaborative economy and circular economy, which refer to areas of system transformation such as, respectively, innovation, the digital revolution and the environment. They are transversal areas to the public, business private for-profit sector and third sector, and these paradigms constitute new approaches, both micro and macro, to face the challenges. In the second group are the notions of corporate social responsibility and the common good economy, which refer to the need to establish new mechanisms for evaluating economic performance and new incentive mechanisms that prioritize the social dimension. They are also transversal to the public, for-profit sector and third sector. Finally, the notions of social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, fourth sector and solidary economy are integrated in the third group. These last notions refer to specific entities and enterprises. In the case of social enterprises and the solidarity economy, their proximity to the social economy is maximum, to the point of being considered part of the latter. The importance of the participatory and deliberative dimension of the solidary economy concept has undoubtedly contributed to the emergence in Europe of another new term, integrating both: the 'social and solidarity economy'.In summary, the new notions that have emerged in the context of the crisis of legitimacy of the hegemonic economic model must be considered complementary and even revitalizing with respect to the concept of the social economy.

TI  - Identifying Establishment Year and Pre-Conversion Land Cover of Rubber Plantations on Hainan Island, China Using Landsat Data during 1987-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the stand age of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations is vitally important for best management practices, estimations of rubber latex yields, and carbon cycle studies (e.g., biomass, carbon pools, and fluxes). However, the stand age (as estimated from the establishment year of rubber plantation) is not available across large regions. In this study, we analyzed Landsat time series images from 1987-2015 and developed algorithms to identify (1) the establishment year of rubber plantations; and (2) the pre-conversion land cover types, such as old rubber plantations, evergreen forests, and cropland. Exposed soil during plantation establishment and linear increases in canopy closure during non-production periods (rubber seedling to mature plantation) were used to identify the establishment year of rubber plantations. Based on the rubber plantation map for 2015 (overall accuracy = 97%), and 1981 Landsat images since 1987, we mapped the establishment year of rubber plantations on Hainan Island (R-2 = 0.85/0.99, and RMSE = 2.34/0.54 years at pixel/plantation scale). The results show that: (1) significant conversion of croplands and old rubber plantations to new rubber plantations has occurred substantially in the northwest and northern regions of Hainan Island since 2000, while old rubber plantations were mainly distributed in the southeastern inland strip; (2) the pattern of rubber plantation expansion since 1987 consisted of fragmented plantations from smallholders, and there was no tendency to expand towards a higher altitude and steep slope regions; (3) the largest land source for new rubber plantations since 1988 was old rubber plantations (1.26 x 10(5) ha), followed by cropland (0.95 x 10(5) ha), and evergreen forests (0.68 x 10(5) ha). The resultant algorithms and maps of establishment year and pre-conversion land cover types are likely to be useful in plantation management, and ecological assessments of rubber plantation expansion in China.

TI  - On-orbit test to FY-4A AGRI and generating RBG image
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - After launching FengYun-4 (FY-4), the on-orbit test to the satellite is done, the MTF of the solar reflectance bands is better than 0.14, 0.17 and 0.22, that is better than the designed capability. The noise test is based on the black-body on the apparatus, the noise for all the infrared bands is less than 0.2 K@300 K, the noise of the best band is about 0.06 K@300 K. The calibration precession of infrared band is validated by the GSICS algorithm, the bias of all the infrared bands are less than 1K comparing to IASI, the bias of the best band is about 0.3 K@290 K. The RGB image carries more information than the gray image, although the AGRI has 6 solar reflectance bands, there are no real red, green and blue bands of human beings, a new algorithm generating RGB image for AGRI is suggested, based on the character of 0.82 band, a very beautiful RGB image which is good to human beings is generated, that improves the multi band use for AGRI.

TI  - Species Discrimination of Plantations in Subtropical China Using 4-Band VHR Imagery and an Operational Image Analysis Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species information of forest plantations is of central interest to forest managers, especially under the current pressing demand for more structurally and functionally healthy and diverse plantations in China. In this study, five evergreen forest types were discriminated using a 4-band very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite image with an operational image analysis framework which particularly involves a two-step feature selection (TSFS) method and image textural orientations. Two hundred and twenty-five object-based spectral and textural features were retrieved as candidates for the TSFS method to select the most influential feature subsets. Five schemes using random forest classification with optimal user-defined parameters were tested and compared. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment results indicated that the best scheme is the integration of spectral and textural features with individual orientations. The feature selection rate as low as 4% for the optimal scheme reflected the high effectiveness of the TSFS. The geometric intersections showed that many archive even-aged pure coniferous plantations were in fact mixed with nonconiferous species with different proportions (8.05-16.02%) and spatial aggregation patterns over very rugged terrain. Special management strategies are needed to perform the transition of pure coniferous plantations into more structurally balanced coniferous-broadleaved mixed woodland in subtropical China.

TI  - A New Method for Mapping Aquatic Vegetation Especially Underwater Vegetation in Lake Ulansuhai Using GF-1 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to accurately identify and extract bodies of water and underwater vegetation from satellite images using conventional vegetation indices, as the strong absorption of water weakens the spectral feature of high near-infrared (NIR) reflected by underwater vegetation in shallow lakes. This study used the shallow Lake Ulansuhai in the semi-arid region of China as a research site, and proposes a new concave-convex decision function to detect submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and identify bodies of water using Gao Fen 1 (GF-1) multi-spectral satellite images with a resolution of 16 meters acquired in July and August 2015. At the same time, emergent vegetation, Huangtai algae bloom, and SAV were classified simultaneously by a decision tree method. Through investigation and verification by field samples, classification accuracy in July and August was 92.17% and 91.79%, respectively, demonstrating that GF-1 data with four-day short revisit period and high spatial resolution can meet the standards of accuracy required by aquatic vegetation extraction. The results indicated that the concave-convex decision function is superior to traditional classification methods in distinguishing water and SAV, thus significantly improving SAV classification accuracy. The concave-convex decision function can be applied to waters with SAV coverage greater than 40% above 0.3 m and SAV coverage 40% above 0.1 m under 1.5 m transparency, which can provide new methods for the accurate extraction of SAV in other regions.

TI  - Urban Damage Level Mapping Based on Co-Polarization Coherence Pattern Using Multitemporal Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate detection and identification of destructed urban areas are essentially important for rescue planning after a large-scale natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, tsunami). Space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide quick response and huge area monitoring to mitigate the further loss. Due to the layover, speckle effect, multiple scattering, etc., accurate mapping of urban damage conditions with SAR is even challenging. Fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand urban damage conditions from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. Polarimetric coherence is an important source for PolSAR data investigation. This paper focuses on the hidden signature exploration of co-polarization coherence in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight for urban damage investigation. A damage index is proposed based on the interpretation tool of co-polarization coherence pattern. It can successfully discriminate urban patches with various damage levels. Then, a damage level inversion relationship and an urban damage level mapping approach are established. The study case is the great 3.11 East Japan earth-quake and tsunami using multitemporal ALOS/PALSAR PolSAR data. Experimental studies validate the efficiency of the proposed co-polarization coherence pattern technique and the mapping approach.

T2  - COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 hadn't received much attention until 2013 when people started to understand its dreadful impacts to human health. According to the meteorological monitoring data of PM2.5 from September 9, 2016 to September 9, 2017 in Fuling district, Chongqing, this paper analyzed the impact of temperature, humidity and the power of wind on PM2.5. Using the mathematical model of BP neural networks, a prediction model based on satellite remote sensing data for the pollutant concentration in regional scale was explored, and the forecast for Fuling 3-h PM2.5 concentration was realized. The algorithm effectively establishes the correlation between AOD and PM2.5 concentration, and it suppresses the overfitting phenomenon very well, as well as it makes up the limitation of machine learning for single site prediction.

TI  - Analysis of recent changes in natural habitat types in the Apuseni Mountains (Romania), using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery (1986-2015)
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the dynamics of natural habitat types in the last 30 years, in the three largest Natura 2000 sites in the Apuseni Mountains area in Romania. The Apuseni Mountains area records one of the highest percentages of protected areas among Romanian mountains, exceeding 50%, characterised by high biodiversity with faunal and floral endemics and rare species across distinctive karstic landscapes. Habitat type maps were derived from Landsat satellite images acquired in 1986, 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2015 using an object-based classification. Based on habitat type maps, 18 landscape metrics at the class level and 16 metrics at the landscape level have been derived to quantify the structure, composition and spatial pattern of the landscape, correlating them with habitat type area changes. Results indicate that in the last 30 years, the deciduous and coniferous forests continuously improved in the Apuseni-Vladeasa Mountains, but surprisingly deteriorated after the site was declared a Special Protection Area (SPA) in 2007. The mixed forest habitat type has recorded a tendency of deterioration since 1986, however, this trend stopped in 2007, probably due to the decrease of human interventions. In this site, the pastures and meadows habitat type deteriorated until 2000 due to agriculture development (before 1993) and natural growth of vegetation, improving considerably after that with a surprising atenuation after 2007. The deciduous forests habitats within the Defileul MureNOT AVAILABLEului Inferior - Dealurile Lipovei site deteriorated until 2007, but it appears that human interventions have diminished after the site was declared a SPA, while within the Drocea-Zarand site the deciduous forests have not suffered deterioration. In these two sites, pastures recorded a constant deterioration in the last three decades, mainly due to land abandonment. Results are potentially useful for authorities to improve management and to develop appropriate strategies for habitat conservation.

TI  - Isolated Contralateral Axillary Lymph Node Involvement in Breast Cancer Represents a Locally Advanced Disease Not Distant Metastases
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - A retrospective review was conducted to determine if isolated contra lateral axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients represents a systemic spread or a locoregional spread. Our finding and the review of the literature indicate that patients with isolated contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis should be classified as N3 in the TNM system rather than MI for appropriate staging and treatment.Background: Breast cancer metastases to an ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node is assigned a N3 status in the TNM system and thus classified as stage III disease in the American Joint Commission on Cancer staging manual. Breast cancer metastatic to contralateral axillary lymph node (CAM) without metastases to any other distant organ is currently assigned M1 status (stage IV) instead of N3 (stage III). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of breast cancer patients diagnosed with CAM for their clinical presentation, pathologic diagnoses, treatment, and follow-up data. Patients who had distant metastases at the time of CAM diagnosis were excluded from the study. Results: We report 12 breast cancer patients who developed CAM but no evidence of metastases in any other distant organ documented with extensive imaging workup. Imaging studies and thorough pathologic evaluation of the prophylactic total mastectomy specimen did not reveal a primary in the breast to account for the metastases in the axillary node. Conclusion: Findings of our study as well as previous studies support that lymph node metastases in the contralateral axilla represents a locoregional spread of the tumor from the index breast via lymphatics rather than hematogenous spread. Therefore, isolated CAM in breast cancer patients should not be classified as stage IV disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation in precision agriculture: A review
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.

TI  - Usefulness of national respiratory virus surveillance data for clinicians who manage adult patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) provides weekly respiratory virus (RV) surveillance reports on its website (the KCDC data). Clinicians in clinical settings wherein the use of PCR for RVs is not a routine laboratory test for adult patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI) may question the clinical utility of such a national RV surveillance dataset in predicting RV outbreaks among their adult patients. We compared the KCDC data to the RV PCR data of adult patients who visited a tertiary care center. During a period of 108 weeks, a total of 6955 (5598 pediatric and 1257 adult) patients underwent RV PCR tests for ARI; most of these tests were administered while the patients were admitted (n=6,920; 99.5%). From the KCDC website, we collected the RV PCR test results of 22540 patients. Three graphs of weekly positivity rates were made for adults, children, and the KCDC data per each RV, and these graphs were then compared with one another. Whereas RV outbreaks were coincident between the KCDC and the adult graph with respect to influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus, the same was not true for human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. However, a negative predictive value of the KCDC data in the prediction of the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult graph was high for the respective eight RVs (85-100%). A national RV surveillance dataset may be useful in identifying RV outbreaks in adult patients with severe ARI.

T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To verify the validity of a semiautomated surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance system using electronic screening algorithms in 38 categories of surgery.Design: A cohort study for validation of semiautomated SSI surveillance system using screening algorithms.Setting: A 1,989-bed tertiary-care referral center in Seoul, Republic of Korea.Methods: A dataset of 40,516 surgical procedures in 38 categories stored in the conventional SSI surveillance registry at the Samsung Medical Center between January 2013 and December 2014 was used as the reference standard. In the semiautomated surveillance system, electronic screening algorithms flagged cases meeting at least 1 of 3 criteria: antibiotic prescription, microbial culture, and infectious disease consultation. Flagged cases were audited by infection preventionists. Analyses of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were conducted for the semiautomated surveillance system, and its effect on reducing the workload for chart review was evaluated.Results: A total of 575 SSI events (1.42%) were identified by conventional SSI surveillance. The sensitivity of the semiautomated SSI surveillance was 96.7%, and the PPV of the screening algorithms alone was 4.1%. Semiautomated SSI surveillance reduced the chart review workload of the infection preventionists from 1,283 to 482 person hours per year (a 62.4% decrease).Conclusions: Compared to conventional surveillance, semiautomated surveillance using electronic screening algorithms followed by chart review of selected cases can provide high-validity surveillance results and can significantly reduce the workload of infection preventionists.

M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the major environmental problems, affecting the living conditions of millions of people all across the world. Inventory and monitoring of the desertification status are the primary requirement in preparation of mitigation plans to combat desertification. The objective of the present paper is, therefore, to prepare spatial inventory of desertification status that provides information on the spatial extent of the area under desertification, its type and severity. Multi-season Landsat data of 30 m spatial resolution, pertaining to the years 1991, 2000 and 2016, have been analysed to prepare desertification status map (DSM) at 1: 25,000 scale for Jaitran Taluka, Pali district, Rajasthan state in western India. Monitoring and assessment of desertification has been carried out for a period of 25 years. Area under desertification in the Jaitran taluka has increased from 13080.22 ha to 15376.37 ha during the past 25 years. Preparation of desertification combating plans, which can be implemented in the field, requires DSM at cadastral scale. Therefore, DSM were also prepared on 1:10,000 scale using very high spatial resolution data of Resourecesat-2 LISS-IV. Spatial information on land use, desertification status (extent, type and severity) extracted from the above DSM and the information on topography and morphology, inferred from Cartosat-1 images (2.5-m spatial resolution, panchromatic stereo) were used to suggest local specific actions for combating desertification.

TI  - Analysis of optimal thresholds for identification of open water using MODIS-derived spectral indices for two coastal wetland systems in Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information on the extent of open water surfaces and wetland dynamics can be useful for decision makers to rapidly respond to flood or drought events and improve our understanding of large scale eco-hydrological variability. Episodic inundation is an important factor for biological and ecosystem processes and sustains a wealth of ecosystem services. This study tests 14 spectral indices and their appropriate thresholds for water mapping, using 500 m resolution MODIS surface reflectance data for two coastal sites in Mexico. The fraction of water within each MODIS pixel was estimated using 30 m Landsat-derived water masks. The error introduced by upscaling to coarser resolutions as well as the error associated with each index threshold was analyzed through an omission-commission error space. The lowest cost according to a hyperbolic function, and the lowest area difference relative to the reference water area served as criteria for definition of optimal fractions and identification of the most appropriate indices and their optimal thresholds. Our study shows that the normalized difference between the MODIS green (band 4) and short wave infrared (band 6) "MNDWI6" consistently performed best at mapping of water. MNDWI6 showed little variations of the optimal index value (-0.14 +/- 0.05) and a low sensitivity to changes in the threshold value. Other useful indices for water extraction identified in this study are the MNDWI5, MSAVI2 and Tasseled Cap Wetness Indices.

TI  - Influence of Spatial Aggregation on Prediction Accuracy of Green Vegetation Using Boosted Regression Trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data aggregation is a necessity when working with big data. Data reduction steps without loss of information are a scientific and computational challenge but are critical to enable effective data processing and information delineation in data-rich studies. We investigated the effect of four spatial aggregation schemes on Landsat imagery on prediction accuracy of green photosynthetic vegetation (PV) based on fractional cover (FCover). To reduce data volume we created an evenly spaced grid, overlaid that on the PV band and delineated the arithmetic mean of PV fractions contained within each grid cell. The aggregated fractions and the corresponding geographic grid cell coordinates were then used for boosted regression tree prediction models. Model goodness of fit was evaluated by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Two spatial resolutions (3000 m and 6000 m) offer good prediction accuracy whereas others show either too much unexplained variability model prediction results or the aggregation resolution smoothed out local PV in heterogeneous land. We further demonstrate the suitability of our aggregation scheme, offering an increased processing time without losing significant topographic information. These findings support the feasibility of using geographic coordinates in the prediction of PV and yield satisfying accuracy in our study area.

TI  - Selection of Optimal Object Features in Object-Based Image Analysis Using Filter-Based Algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in spatial resolution of recent sensors, object-based image analysis (OBIA) has gained importance for producing detailed land use maps. One of the main advantages of OBIA is that a variety of spectral, spatial and textural features can be extracted for the segmented image objects that are later utilized in classification. However, using a large number of features not only increases the required computational time, but also requires a large number of ground samples, which is unavailable in most cases. For these reasons, feature selection (FS) has become an important research topic for OBIA based classification studies. In this study, three filter-based FS algorithms namely, Chi square, information gain and ReliefF were applied to determine the most effective object features that ensure high separability among landscape features. For this purpose, importance degree (i.e. ranks) of 110 input object features were firstly estimated by the algorithms, and correlation-based merit function was then applied to determine optimum feature subset size. Multi-resolution segmentation algorithm was applied for segmenting a WorldView-2 image. Support vector machine, random forest and nearest neighbour classifiers were all utilized to classify segmented image objects using the selected object features. Results revealed that the FS algorithms were effective for selecting the most relevant features. Also, the classifiers produced the highest performances with 24 out of 110 features selected by the information gain (IG) algorithm. Particularly, the support vector machine classifier produced the highest overall accuracy (92.00%) with 24 selected features determined by the IG algorithm. A significant improvement of about 4% was achieved by applying FS procedures that was found statistically significant in terms of Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.

TI  - Gulf Stream rings as a source of iron to the North Atlantic subtropical gyre
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial amounts of nitrogen fixation occur in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, due to the activity of cyanobacteria with high iron requirements. Iron is delivered to this region by dust from the Sahara Desert. However, this dust deposition is typically localized and episodic. Therefore, other sources of iron may also be important. Here, we report observations of dissolved iron concentrations in a Gulf Stream cold-core ring, which transported iron-rich water from near the continental slope into the subtropical gyre. We find that iron concentrations were elevated in the ring compared with subtropical waters, reflecting its source waters. Using iron data from these source waters and the identification of ring activity in satellite data, we estimate that cold-core rings provide a net flux of 0.3 +/- 0.17 x 10(8) mol Fe yr(-1) across the northwestern gyre edge, on the order of 15% of our median estimates of gyre-wide supply of iron by dust deposition. We suggest that iron supply from cold-core rings is an important source of iron to the northwestern gyre edge. We conclude that mesoscale ocean circulation features may play an important role in subtropical nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB  - The availability of a large amount of remote sensing data made Earth Observation increasingly accessible and detailed. High temporal and spatial resolution sensors are responsible for making available data sets of time series in unprecedented proportions. Within this context, the use of efficient segmentation algorithms of remote sensing imagery represents an important role in this scenario, because they provide homogeneous regions in space-time and hence simplify the data set. In addition, the spatio-temporal segmentation can bring a new way of interpreting data by means of analyzing contiguous regions in time. This letter describes a method for image segmentation applied to time series of the Earth Observation data. We adapted the traditional region growing method to detect homogeneous regions in space and time. Study cases were conducted by considering the dynamic time warping algorithm as the homogeneity criterion to grow regions. Tests on high temporal resolution image sequences from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager vegetation indices and comparisons with other distance measurements provided satisfactory outcomes.

TI  - Endometrial cancer with an <i>EML4-ALK</i> rearrangement
T2  - COLD SPRING HARBOR MOLECULAR CASE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - An 85-yr-old woman was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type. Imaging studies showed a large tumor distending the endometrial canal without evidence of local invasion or extrauterine disease. A hysterectomy was performed, followed by microscopic examination of longitudinal tissue sections. Histopathological review showed only focal myometrial invasion, equivocal lymphovascular invasion, and negative bilateral sentinel lymph nodes (FIGO stage IA). A sample of the tumor was submitted for molecular testing (massively parallel sequencing on OncoPanel) and was found to harbor an inversion on Chromosome 2 resulting in an EML4-ALK gene fusion. Confirmatory immunohistochemistry showed ALK overexpression in just a portion of the tumor. Additional genomic characterization on a region of the tumor lacking ALK overexpression by immunohistochemistry was highly congruous with the genomic profile of the ALK-positive portion, showing similar patterns of copy-number variation and mutations in TP53 and KDM5C, with no evidence for an EML4-ALK gene fusion, confirming that EML4-ALK rearrangement had occurred as a sub-clonal process. EML4-ALK fusions are driver events in 2%-5% of non-small-cell lung cancers; crizotinib is an approved targeted therapy for these patients. EML4-ALK rearrangements have not previously been reported in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss Is Not a Sentinel Event for Acute Myocardial Infarction
T2  - OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:Given ongoing debate about the suggested association, the primary objective was to determine if idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) was a sentinel event for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in adults.Study Design:Case-control study.Setting:United States MarketScan administrative health claims database.Patients:Aged 18 years or older, had a diagnosis of ISSNHL on or after January 1st, 2011 and had sufficient follow-up data available to assess for AMI occurrence.Intervention:N/A.Main Outcome Measures:Incidence rates (per 1,000 patient years) of AMI for cases and controls were computed. Adjusted and unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models were created to explore possible associations between ISSNHL and initial AMI.Results:A total of 10,749 ISSNHL cases and 10,749 matched controls were included. There were no significant differences in the incidence rate of AMI between ISSNHL cases (8.29events/1,000 person-years) and controls (9.25events/1,000 person-years), nor were there differences within age groups, sex, or comorbidity status (overall incidence rate ratio 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.15 p=0.39). The unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models did not demonstrate an association between ISSNHL and initial AMI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.70-1.15; HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67-1.10, respectively).Conclusions:ISSNHL is not a predictor of an initial AMI in adult patients from the United States. Considerable inconsistencies in associations between cardiovascular risk factors and ISSNHL exist in the literature. Further work is needed to confirm or refute direct associations between cardiovascular disease risk factors and ISSNHL before definitive mechanistic conclusions can be made.

TI  - Targeted Grassland Monitoring at Parcel Level Using Sentinels, Street-Level Images and Field Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of high-resolution Sentinels combined with the use of high-quality digital agricultural parcel registration systems is driving the move towards at-parcel agricultural monitoring. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has introduced the concept of CAP monitoring to help simplify the management and control of farmers' parcel declarations for area support measures. This study proposes a proof of concept of this monitoring approach introducing and applying the concept of markers'. Using Sentinel-1- and -2-derived (S1 and S2) markers, we evaluate parcels declared as grassland in the Gelderse Vallei in the Netherlands covering more than 15,000 parcels. The satellite markersrespectively based on crop-type deep learning classification using S1 backscattering and coherence data and on detecting bare soil with S2 during the growing seasonaim to identify grassland-declared parcels for which (1) the marker suggests another crop type or (2) which appear to have been ploughed during the year. Subsequently, a field-survey was carried out in October 2017 to target the parcels identified and to build a relevant ground-truth sample of the area. For the latter purpose, we used a high-definition camera mounted on the roof of a car to continuously sample geo-tagged digital imagery, as well as an app-based approach to identify the targeted fields. Depending on which satellite-based marker or combination of markers is used, the number of parcels identified ranged from 2.57% (marked by both the S1 and S2 markers) to 17.12% of the total of 11,773 parcels declared as grassland. After confirming with the ground-truth, parcels flagged by the combined S1 and S2 marker were robustly detected as non-grassland parcels (F-score = 0.9). In addition, the study demonstrated that street-level imagery collection could improve collection efficiency by a factor seven compared to field visits (1411 parcels/day vs. 217 parcels/day) while keeping an overall accuracy of about 90% compared to the ground-truth. This proposed way of collecting in situ data is suitable for the training and validating of high resolution remote sensing approaches for agricultural monitoring. Timely country-wide wall-to-wall parcel-level monitoring and targeted in-season parcel surveying will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring and implementing agricultural policies.

TI  - Development of a simple, practice-based tool to assess quality of paediatric emergency care delivery in resource-limited settings: identifying critical actions via a Delphi study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Provision of timely, high-quality care for the initial management of critically ill children in African hospitals remains a challenge. Monitoring the completion of critical actions during resuscitations can inform efforts to reduce variability and improve outcomes. We sought to develop a practice-based tool based on contextually relevant actions identified via a Delphi process. Our goal was to develop a tool that could identify gaps in care, facilitate identification of training and standardised assessment to support quality improvement efforts.Design Six sentinel conditions were selected based on disease epidemiology and mortality at rural and urban African emergency departments. Potential critical actions were identified through focused literature review. These actions were evaluated within a three-round modified Delphi process. A set of logistical filters was applied to the candidate list to derive a practice-based tool.Setting and participants Attendees at an international emergency medicine conference comprised an expert panel of 25 participants, with 84% working primarily in African settings. Consensus rounds allowing novel responses were conducted via online and in-person surveys.Results The expert panel generated 199 actions that apply to six conditions in emergently ill children. Application of appropriateness criteria refined this to 92 candidate actions across the following seven categories: core skills, active seizure, altered mental status, diarrhoeal illness, febrile illness, respiratory distress and polytrauma. From these, we identified 28 actions for inclusion in a practice-based tool contextually relevant to the initial management of critically ill children in Africa.Conclusions A group consensus process identified critical actions for severely ill children with select sentinel conditions in emergency paediatric care in an African setting. Absence of these actions during resuscitation might reflect modifiable gaps in quality of care. The resulting practice-based tool is context relevant and can serve as a foundation for training and quality improvement efforts in African hospitals and emergency departments.

TI  - Mapping the timing of cropland abandonment and recultivation in northern Kazakhstan using annual Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the world's temperate grasslands have been converted to croplands, yet these trends can reverse in some regions. This is the case for the steppes of northern Kazakhstan, where the breakdown of the Soviet Union led to widespread cropland abandonment, creating restoration opportunities. Understanding when abandonment happened and whether it persists is important for making use of these opportunities. We developed a trajectory-based change detection approach to identify cropland abandonment between 1988 and 2013 and recultivation between 1991 and 2013. Our approach is based on annual time series of cropland probabilities derived from Landsat imagery and resulted in reliable maps (89% overall accuracy), with abandonment being detected more accurately (user's accuracy of 93%) than recultivation (73%). Most of the remaining uncertainty in our maps was due to low image availability during the mid-1990s, leading to abandonment in the 1990s sometimes only being detected in the 2000s. Our results suggest that of the similar to 4.7 million ha of cropland in our study area in 1985, roughly 40% had been abandoned by 2013. Knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for deeper insights into what drives these dynamics: recultivation after 2007 happened preferentially on those lands that had been abandoned most recently, suggesting that the most productive croplands were abandoned last and recultivated first. Likewise, knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for more precise estimates of the environmental impacts of abandonment (e.g., soil organic carbon sequestration estimated at 16.3 Mt. C compared to 24.0 Mt. C when assuming all abandonment happened right after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, with the uncertainty around emission estimates decreasing by 63%). Overall, our study emphasizes the value of the Landsat archive for understanding agricultural land-use dynamics, and the opportunities of trajectory-based approaches for mapping these dynamics.

TI  - UAV Multispectral Imagery Can Complement Satellite Data for Monitoring Forest Health
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of methods that can accurately detect physiological stress in forest trees caused by biotic or abiotic factors is vital for ensuring productive forest systems that can meet the demands of the Earth's population. The emergence of new sensors and platforms presents opportunities to augment traditional practices by combining remotely-sensed data products to provide enhanced information on forest condition. We tested the sensitivity of multispectral imagery collected from time-series unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imagery to detect herbicide-induced stress in a carefully controlled experiment carried out in a mature Pinus radiata D. Don plantation. The results revealed that both data sources were sensitive to physiological stress in the study trees. The UAV data were more sensitive to changes at a finer spatial resolution and could detect stress down to the level of individual trees. The satellite data tested could only detect physiological stress in clusters of four or more trees. Resampling the UAV imagery to the same spatial resolution as the satellite imagery revealed that the differences in sensitivity were not solely the result of spatial resolution. Instead, vegetation indices suited to the sensor characteristics of each platform were required to optimise the detection of physiological stress from each data source. Our results define both the spatial detection threshold and the optimum vegetation indices required to implement monitoring of this forest type. A comparison between time-series datasets of different spectral indices showed that the two sensors are compatible and can be used to deliver an enhanced method for monitoring physiological stress in forest trees at various scales. We found that the higher resolution UAV imagery was more sensitive to fine-scale instances of herbicide induced physiological stress than the RapidEye imagery. Although less sensitive to smaller phenomena the satellite imagery was found to be very useful for observing trends in physiological stress over larger areas.

T2  - MUSCULOSKELETAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Myoelectric activity and range of motion during ULNT1 were recorded in 62 breast cancer (BC) survivors who had axillary lymph node dissection (n = 30) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (n = 32) within the previous 18 months, and 63 age-matched healthy women. BC survivors' symptoms were reproduced by ULNT1 and exhibited greater myoelectric activity in the biceps brachii than healthy women (MD (95% CI): 21,26 (10,83-31,70)). No differences between the axillary lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy groups (MD (95% CI): 8,47 (- 7,84-24,79)) were found. Myoelectric activity in the triceps brachii was greater in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (MD (95% CI): 2,70 ( - 2,06-7,60)). BC survivors exhibited less shoulder and elbow range of motion during ULNT1 than healthy women. Increased upper limb nerve mechanosensitivity in BC survivors was associated with a greater protective muscle response during ULNT1.

TI  - Enhanced Safety Surveillance of Seasonal Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines in English Primary Care: Interim Analysis
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) requires vaccine manufacturers to conduct enhanced safety surveillance (ESS) of seasonal influenza vaccines including a near real-time evaluation of collected data. The objective was to identify whether the use of passive surveillance or active surveillance provides different results of reported adverse events of interest (AEIs) by specified age strata and AEI type. We report the weekly incidence rates of AEIs within 7 days following seasonal influenza vaccination using passive and active surveillance.AEIs were collected within 7 days of vaccination from ten general practices predominantly administering inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4, Fluarix Tetra, GSK). Vaccinees completed an adverse drug reaction (ADR) card. ADR card and medically attended AEIs data were recorded in practice electronic health records. We report the outcome of the first 5 weeks of safety surveillance (September 12, 2016-October 16, 2016); in an exploratory analysis, rates of AEI for IIV4 are compared to those passively reported through a sentinel network.Practices vaccinated 13.1% (12,864/98,091) of their registered population; 5.6% (95% CI 5.20-6.00) of them reported AEIs, none serious. The most frequent were respiratory 2.60% (95% CI 2.33-2.88), musculoskeletal 1.82% (95% CI 1.59-2.05) and neurological 1.05% (95% CI 0.88-1.23). AEIs were more frequently reported for adults than for children; 5.91% (95% CI 5.49-6.34) compared to 1.49% (95% CI 0.69-2.29); 47.18% of the adults reported AEI using the ADR card, none were returned for subjects < 18 years old. The frequency of AEIs reporting was higher, 6.88% (95% CI 6.35-7.42) vs. 3.30% (95% CI 2.68-3.96, 100/3028, p < 0.000), through ESS than passive surveillance.The ESS did not reveal any safety signal and we demonstrated the feasibility of conducting ESS following EMA recommendations. The use of a customised ADR card led to a doubling of AEIs reports over passive surveillance in adults.GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA, Wavre, Belgium.

TI  - Incidence of household transmission of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in a primary care sentinel network (1992-2017): cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a highly transmissible condition. Determining characteristics of household transmission will facilitate development of prevention strategies and reduce the burden of this disease. We are carrying out this study to describe household transmission of medically attended AGE, and explore whether there is an increased incidence in households with young children.Methods and analysis This study used the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network, comprising data from 1 750 167 registered patients (August 2017 database). We conducted a novel analysis using a 'household key', to identify patients within the same household (n=811 027, mean 2.16 people). A 25-year repeated cross-sectional study will explore the incidence of medically attended AGE overall and then a 5-year retrospective cohort study will describe household transmission of AGE. The cross-sectional study will include clinical data for a 25-year period1 January 1992 until the 31 December 2017. We will describe the incidence of AGE by age-band and gender, and trends in incidence. The 5-year study will use Poisson and quasi-Poisson regression to identify characteristics of individuals and households to predict medically attended AGE transmitted in the household. This will include whether the household contained a child under 5 years and the age category of the first index case (whether adult or child under 5 years). If there is overdispersion and zero-inflation we will compare results with negative binomial to handle these issues.Ethics and dissemination All RCGP RSC data are pseudonymised at the point of data extraction. No personally identifiable data are required for this investigation. The protocol follows STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology guidelines (STROBE). The study results will be published in a peer-review journal, the dataset will be available to other researchers.

TI  - Integrating local knowledge and remote sensing for eco-type classification map in the Barotse Floodplain, Zambia
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This eco-type map presents land units with distinct vegetation and exposure to floods (or droughts) in three villages in the Barotseland, Zambia. The knowledge and eco-types descriptions were collected from participatory mapping and focus group discussions with 77 participants from Mapungu, Lealui, and Nalitoya. We used two Landsat 8 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken in March 24th and July 14th, 2014 (path 175, row 71) to calculate water level and vegetation type which are the two main criteria used by Lozi People for differentiating eco-types. We calculated water levels by using the Water Index (WI) and vegetation type by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. We excluded burned areas in 2014 and built areas to reduce classification error. Control points include field data from 99 farmers' fields, 91 plots of 100 m2 and 65 waypoints randomly selected in a 6 km radius around each village. We also used Google Earth Pro to create control points in areas flooded year-round (e.g., deep waters and large canals), patches of forest and built areas. The eco-type map has a classification accuracy of 81% and a pixel resolution of 30 m.The eco-type map provides a useful resource for agriculture and conservation planning at the landscape level in the Barotse Floodplain.

TI  - Development of an attract-and-infect system to control <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i> with the entomopathogenic fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDA new Beauveria bassiana-based attract and infect device (AID) to control Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was developed. The virulence and persistence of the fungal formulation used in the AID were evaluated in the laboratory. Semi-field and field trials were carried out to validate the results and establish the potential of this device as a control tool.RESULTSIn laboratory conditions, a 50% lethal time (LT50) of 4.33 days was obtained when adults (7-10 days old) were exposed to the inoculation tunnel (IT) containing 1 x 10(10) conidia g(-1) in an oil-based fungal formulation. This formulation maintained conidium viability at 50% for up to 2 months. Moreover, when adults were exposed to 2.5-month field-aged ITs, mortality still reached 50% 40 days after exposure. In addition, no differences were observed between ITs aged in early spring and those aged in summer, suggesting that the fungal formulation is not strongly affected by environmental factors in Mediterranean basin conditions. Semi-field assays showed that the device allowed an easy transit of weevils through the IT, which were effectively attracted and infected. Using the AIDs in 4-ha plot field trials, a reduction of >50% in the percentage of infested sentinel palms was obtained.CONCLUSIONBased on the results obtained in terms of the efficacy and persistence of this new AID in the field and its potential in reducing R. ferrugineus populations and palm infestation, this device could become a key tool for the management of R. ferrugineus.

TI  - An analysis of lightweight-drone-assisted mapping accuracy in tropical forest plot
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate coordinate position is a prerequisite for combining drone-assisted remotely sensed data and ground survey data. However, in the practice of surveying forests, many factors prevent accurate measurement of coordinate position and inaccurate coordinates may lead to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, researchers must pay attention to factors effecting accuracy of position. In this study, we compared location error of ground control points (GCPs), model error of photogrammetric point cloud (estimated by Photoscan software) and reprojection error of camera exposure position. First, we found that real time kinematic (RTK) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) cannot locate position in tropical forest with high accuracy. The root mean square error (RAISE) of GCPs in canopy gaps were 0.167 +/- 0.158 m and 0.297 +/- 0.170 m in the horizontal and vertical axes respectively. In comparison, RMSE of GCPs within forests were 0.392 +/- 0.368 m and 0.657 +/- 0.412 m respectively for horizontal and vertical axes. Second, the number and measurement accuracy of GCPs influenced model error of photogrammetric point cloud. Third, reprojection error of camera exposure position (18.434 +/- 5.252 m and 34.042 +/- 6.920 m in horizontal and vertical axes respectively) was much greater than location error of GCPs when the drone acquired position with a single-station GPS system. Fourth, standard deviation of difference between estimated digital terrain model (DTMestimated) and measured digital terrain model (DTMmeasured) was positively correlated with mean canopy height (r = 0.713, P < 0.05). DTMestimated was better estimated at 20 ha scale than at 1 ha scale. Based on these results, we suggest that uniform distribution and sufficient numbers of GCPs can improve drone-assisted mapping accuracy. Lightweight-drone-based photogrammetry has an advantage in requiring fewer equipment and enabling creation of accurate DSM (digital surface model), but remains incapable of estimating ground elevation. Researchers should consider these factors related to accuracy before using drones for surveys.

TI  - Comparison of the dynamics of Japanese encephalitis virus circulation in sentinel pigs between a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis is mainly considered a rural disease, but there is growing evidence of a peri-urban and urban transmission in several countries, including Cambodia. We, therefore, compared the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia. We monitored two cohorts of 15 pigs and determined the force of infection-rate at which seronegative pigs become positive-in two study farms located in a peri-urban and rural area, respectively. We also studied the mosquito abundance and diversity in proximity of the pigs, as well as the host densities in both areas. All the pigs seroconverted before the age of 6 months. The force of infection was 0.061 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.034-0.098) in the peri-urban cohort and 0.069 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.047-0.099) in the rural cohort. Several differences in the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between both study sites were highlighted. The later virus amplification in the rural cohort may be linked to the later waning of maternal antibodies, but also to the higher pig density in direct proximity of the studied pigs, which could have led to a dilution of mosquito bites at the farm level. The force of infection was almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied, which shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus. This study is a first step in improving our understanding of Japanese encephalitis virus ecology in different environments with distinct landscapes, human and animal densities.

TI  - Shifts in Growing Season of Tropical Deciduous Forests as Driven by El Nino and La Nina during 2001-2016
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of tropical deciduous forest including dry dipterocarp forest (DDF) and mixed deciduous forest (MDF) and its phenological changes in responses to El Nino and La Nina during 2001-2016. Based on time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS) were derived. In absence of climatic fluctuation, the SOS of DDF commonly started on 106 +/- 7 DOY, delayed to 132 DOY in El Nino year (2010) and advanced to 87 DOY in La Nina year (2011). Thus, there was a delay of about 19 to 33 days in El Nino and an earlier onset of about 13 to 27 days in La Nina year. The SOS of MDF started almost same time as of DDF on the 107 +/- 7 DOY during the neutral years and delayed to 127 DOY during El Nino, advanced to 92 DOY in La Nina year. The SOS of MDF was delayed by about 12 to 28 days in El Nino and was earlier about 8 to 22 days in La Nina. Corresponding to these shifts in SOS and LOS of both DDF and MDF were also induced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

TI  - SIDDIES Corridor: A Major East-West Pathway of Long-Lived Surface and Subsurface Eddies Crossing the Subtropical South Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - South Indian Ocean eddies (SIDDIES), originating from a high evaporation region in the eastern Indian Ocean, are investigated by tracking individual eddies from satellite data and co-located Argo floats. A subsurface-eddy identification method, based on its steric dynamic height anomaly, is devised to assign Argo profiles to surface eddies (surfSIDDIES) or subsurface eddies (subSIDDIES). These westward-propagating, long-lived features (>3 months) prevail over a preferential latitudinal band, forming a permanent structure linking the eastern to the western Indian Ocean, that we call the 'SIDDIES Corridor'. Key features have been revealed in the mean thermohaline vertical structure of these eddies. Anticyclonic SIDDIES are characterized by positive subsurface salinity anomalies, with subSIDDIES not exhibiting negative surface anomalies, as opposed to surfSIDDIES. Cyclonic subSIDDIES also occur, but their related salinity anomalies are weaker. SubSIDDIES exhibit two cores of different temperature polarities in their surface and subsurface levels. Cyclonic subSIDDIES have their cores at around 150-200 m depth along the 25.4-25.8 kg m(-3) potential density layer with anticyclonic subSIDDIES having their cores at 250-300 m along the 26-26.4 kg m(-3) density layer. The SIDDIES corridor acts as a zonal pathway for both eddy-types to advect water masses and biogeochemical properties across the basin. This study provides a new insight on heat/salt fluxes, showing that 58% (32%) of the total heat eddy-flux is ascribed to cyclonic (anticyclonic) subSIDDIES, respectively, in the eastern South Indian Ocean. Anticyclonic subSIDDIES have also been found to be the sole high-saline water eddy-conveyor toward the western Indian Ocean.Key Points

TI  - Potential value of combining ALOS PALSAR and Landsat-derived tree cover data for forest biomass retrieval in Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) requires detailed insight into how the forest biomass is measured and distributed. Studies so far have estimated forest biomass stocks using rough assumptions and unreliable data. High-resolution data and robust methods are required to capture the spatial variability of forest biomass with sufficient precision. Here we aim to improve on previous approaches by using radar satellite ALOS PALSAR (25-m resolution) and optical Landsat-derived tree cover (30-m resolution) observations to estimate forest biomass stocks in Madagascar, for the years 2007-2010. The radar signal and in situ biomass were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.71) and the root mean square error was 30% (for biomass ranging from 0 to 500 t/ha). Using our map at 25-m resolution for the entire island of Madagascar, we estimated the total above-ground forest carbon for the four years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 to be 1.1173 +/- 0.0304, 1.1029 +/- 0.0303, 1.0916 +/- 0.0301 and 1.0773 +/- 0.0298 PgC, respectively. Carbon stocks were found to have decreased constantly over this period due to anthropogenic deforestation and likely also to climate change. The results are expected to serve as a more accurate benchmark for monitoring progress on REDD and to provide strong supports for current and future spaceborne missions such as ALOS-2, SAOCOM and BIOMASS.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Ground Deformation Monitoring in Shanghai Based on SBAS and MSBAS InSAR Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shanghai has experienced the greatest land subsidence in China in the past sixty years and produced undesirable environmental impact. However, horizontal ground deformation has not been understood yet. Therefore ground deformation monitoring together with the analysis of its driving forces are critical for geo-hazards early-warning, city planning and sustainable urbanization in Shanghai. In this paper, two-dimensional ground deformation monitoring was performed in Shanghai with SBAS and MSBAS InSAR methods. Twenty-nine Multi-Look Fine 6 (MF6) Radarsat-2 SLC data acquired during 2011-2013 were used to derive vertical ground deformation. Meanwhile, six descending Multi-Look Fine 6 (MF6) and four ascending Multi-Look Fine 2 (MF2) spanning April to August, 2008, were used to derive vertical and horizontal ground deformation during the observation period. The results indicate that vertical and horizontal deformations in 2008 were not homogeneously distributed in different districts ranging from 0-2 cm/year. Vertical deformation rate during 2011-2013 were decreased to less than 1 cm/year in most district of Shanghai area. Activities from groundwater exploitation and rapid urbanization are responsible for most of the ground deformation in Shanghai. Thus, future ground deformation in vertical and horizontal directions should be warranted.

TI  - Influence of Snow on the Magnitude and Seasonal Variation of the Clumping Index Retrieved from MODIS BRDF Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The foliage Clumping Index (CI) is an important vegetation structure parameter that allows for the accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in a canopy. The CI and its seasonality are critical for global Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimating and ecological modelling. However, the cover of snow tends to reduce the reflectance anisotropy of the vegetation canopy and thus probably influences CI estimates. In this paper, we investigate the influence of snow on the magnitude and seasonal variation of the CI retrieved from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) products based on field-measured CI and statistics from the global MODIS CI product. We find that the backup algorithm can effectively correct abnormally large CI values and obtain more reasonable CI retrievals than the main algorithm without any constraints in snow-covered areas. Validation indicates that the time-series CI product shows the potential in investigating the trajectories of the clumping effect in snow seasons. For evergreen forests, the clumping effect is relatively stable throughout the year; however, for deciduous vegetation types, CI values tend to display significant seasonal variations. This study suggests that the latest version of the global MODIS CI product, in which the backup algorithm is used to process the snow-covered pixels, has improved accuracy for CI retrievals in snow-covered areas and thus is probably more suitable as the input parameter for ecological and meteorological models.

TI  - Liberation through Seeing: Screening <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The text known in English as The Tibetan Book of the Dead is arguably the principle source for popular understandings of Tibetan Buddhist conceptions of death. First translated into English in 1927, subsequent translations have read it according to a number of interpretive frameworks. This paper examines two recent films that take The Tibetan Book of the Dead as their inspiration: Bruce Joel Rubin's Jacob's Ladder (1990) and Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void (2009). Neither of these films overtly claim to be depicting The Tibetan Book of the Dead, but the directors of both have acknowledged that the text was an influence on their films, and both are undeniably about the moment of death and what follows. The analysis begins with the question of how, and to what degree, each of the films departs from the meaning and purpose of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, before moving on to examine the reasons, both practical and ideological, for these changes. Buddhist writer Bruce Joel Rubin wrote a film that sought to depict the death experience from a Tibetan Buddhist perspective, but ultimately audience expectation and studio pressure transformed the film into a story at odds with Tibetan Buddhism. Gaspar Noe wrote and directed a film that is based on a secular worldview, yet can be seen to be largely consistent with a Tibetan Buddhist reading. Finally, I consider if, and to what extent, these films function to express or cultivate an experiential engagement with Tibetan Buddhist truths and realization, concluding that Jacob's Ladder does not, while Enter the Void largely succeeds, despite the intention of its creator.

AB  - Objective To determine the frequency of occult trauma in children with oral injury evaluated for physical abuse.Design This was a retrospectively planned secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study.Setting Emergency departments supported by 20 US child abuse teams in the Examining Siblings to Recognize Abuse (ExSTRA) network.Patients Children <120 months old evaluated for physical abuse.Interventions Analysis of index children with oral injury on initial examination.Main outcome measures Rates of physician-recognised oral injury, as well as frequency and results of occult injury testing. Perceived abuse likelihood was described on a 7-point scale (7=definite abuse).Results Among 2890 child abuse consultations, 3.3% (n=96) of children had oral injury. Forty-two per cent were 0-12 months old, 39% 1-3 years old and 18% >3 years old. Oral injury was the primary reason for evaluation for 32 (33%). Forty-three per cent (42/96) had frenum injuries. Skeletal surveys were obtained for 84% and 25% of these identified occult fractures. Seventy-five per cent had neuroimaging; 38% identified injuries. Forty-one per cent of children with oral injuries had retinal examinations; 24% of exams showed retinal haemorrhages. More occult injuries were found in children with oral injuries than other ExSTRA subjects. A high level of concern for abusive injury was present in 67% of children with oral injury versus 33% without.Conclusions Children with oral injury are at high risk for additional occult abusive injuries. Infants and mobile preschoolers are at risk. Young children with unexplained oral injury should be evaluated for abuse.

TI  - Spatio-temporal non-uniformity of urban park greenness and thermal characteristics in a semi-arid region
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal characteristics of urban parks often vary city-wide due to different landscape properties of parks themselves or their surrounding environments. Understanding such heterogeneity is critical for strategic use of urban forest elements to mitigate extreme heat and provide various ecological amenities; however, relatively few studies to date have assessed such variability at the whole-city scales and across different seasons. This study investigated seasonal variation, statistical association and local spatial clustering in satellite image-based proxies of vegetation greenness and surface temperature (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and at-sensor surface brightness temperature (T-b), respectively) among 135 parks in a part of California, USA on ten different-season dates in 2014. Both metrics varied among parks and dates and exhibited a significant negative linear relationship which was stronger on warmer-season dates. Regressions with NDVI explained 2-17% more variance in T-b when they also included the proportion of woody plant cover (negative effect on T-b) or the proportion of grass cover (positive effect on T-b) on all dates, and park area on some dates (negative effect on T-b). The analysis of spatial variation in park properties revealed several significant local clusters of parks with higher T-b that persisted among warmer dates and had significantly smaller area and warmer neighborhoods than did significant clusters of greener or cooler parks. These results highlight potential under-provisioning of park microclimatic benefits in the associated neighborhoods and calls for further research on environmental and social implications of these results to inform mitigation of urban heat in this region and similar climates.

TI  - Characteristics of Sand Dune Pattern and Fluvial-aeolian Interaction in Horqin Sandy Land, Northeast Plain of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between fluvial and aeolian processes can significantly change surface morphology of the Earth. Taking the Horqin Sandy Land as the research area and using Landsat series satellite remote sensing images, this study utilizes geomorphology and landscape ecology to monitor and analyze the aeolian geomorphology characteristics of the Horqin Sandy Land. Results show that the sand dunes of the Horqin Sandy Land are mainly distributed on alluvial plains along the banks of the mainstream and tributaries of the Western Liao River, and the sand dune types tend to simplify from west to east and from south to north. The aeolian geomorphology coverage tend to be decreasing in the past 40 years, with an average annual change rate of 0.31%. While the area of traveling dunes decreased, the area of fixed and semi-fixed dunes increased. The fractal dimensions of various types of sand dune have all remained relatively constant between 1.07 and 1.10, suggesting that they are experiencing a relatively stable evolutionary process. There is a complex interaction between fluvial and aeolian processes of the Horqin Sandy Land, which plays a central role in surface landscape molding. Sand dunes on both sides of different rivers on the Horqin Sandy Land present certain regularity and different characteristics in terms of morphology, developmental scale, and spatial pattern. There are six fluvial-aeolian interaction modes in this area: supply of sand sources by rivers for sand dune development, complete obstruction of dune migration by rivers, partial obstruction of dune migration by rivers, influence of river valleys on dune developmental types on both sides, influence of river valleys on dune developmental scale on both sides, and river diversion due to obstruction and forcing by sand dunes. This study deepens our understanding of the surface process mechanism of the interaction between fluvial and aeolian processes in semi-arid regions, and provides a basis for researches on regional landscape responses in the context of global environmental change.

TI  - Assessing global surface water inundation dynamics using combined satellite information from SMAP, AMSR2 and Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to assess global land surface water (fw) inundation dynamics was developed by exploiting the enhanced fw sensitivity of L-band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The L-band fw (fw(LBand)) retrievals were derived using SMAP H-polarization brightness temperature (T-b) observations and predefined L-band reference microwave emissivities for water and land end-members. Potential soil moisture and vegetation contributions to the microwave signal were represented from overlapping higher frequency T-b observations from AMSR2. The resulting fw(LBand) global record has high temporal sampling (1-3 days) and 36-km spatial resolution. The fw(LBand) annual averages corresponded favorably (R = 0.85, p-value < 0.001) with a 250-m resolution static global water map (MOD44W) aggregated at the same spatial scale, while capturing significant inundation variations worldwide. The monthly fw(LBand) averages also showed seasonal inundation changes consistent with river discharge records within six major US river basins. An uncertainty analysis indicated generally reliable fw(LBand) performance for major land cover areas and under low to moderate vegetation cover, but with lower accuracy for detecting water bodies covered by dense vegetation. Finer resolution (30-m)fw(LBand) results were obtained for three sub-regions in North America using an empirical downscaling approach and ancillary global Water Occurrence Dataset (WOD) derived from the historical Landsat record. The resulting 30-m fw(LBand) retrievals showed favorable spatial accuracy for water (commission error 31.46%, omission error 30.20%) and land (commission error 0.87%, omission error 0.96%) classifications and seasonal wet and dry periods when compared to independent water maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery. The new fw(LBand) algorithms and continuing SMAP and AMSR2 operations provide for near real-time, multi-scale monitoring of global surface water inundation dynamics and potential flood risk.

TI  - Radiance-based validation of land surface temperature products derived from Collection 6 MODIS thermal infrared data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important climate variable related to surface energy and water balance. The LST products retrieved from Terra-/Aqua-MODIS thermal infrared data have been widely used in climatological, hydrological, meteorological, and ecological applications. The newest collection (C6) MODIS LST products have been freely available for the user community since 2016. It is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST products prior to their application. In this study, the C6 MODIS LST products were validated using a radiance-based (R-based) method. We selected 38 validation sites worldwide over eight land cover types, i.e., in-land water, forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, urban, snow, and bare soil surfaces. Except for the results for grassland sites during the daytime and night-time and the bare soil sites during the daytime, the C6 MODIS LST products are in good agreement with the R-based LST values, with bias and root mean square error (RMSE) values of less than 1 K for all sites during the daytime and night-time. Large LST discrepancies over grassland sites are caused by misclassification in the MODIS land cover type products, which can lead to large uncertainties in the determination of surface emissivity. We also compared the accuracies of the C5 and C6 MODIS LST products. Results indicate that there are no significant accuracy discrepancies between the C5 and C6 MODIS LST products for all sites, with the exception of bare soil sites. Compared with the C5 MODIS LST products, significant accuracy improvement in the C6 MODIS LST products over most bare soil sites can be found. The absolute bias values are reduced from approximately 1.4-3.0 K for C5 to approximately 0.3-0.8 K for C6, and the RMSE values from approximately 1.4-3.1 K for C5 to approximately 0.5-0.8 K for C6. However, further overestimation in the C6 MODIS LST products can be found over two bare soil sites due to the poor emissivity adjustment provided by the emissivity adjustment model incorporated into the C6 split window algorithm.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Determination in the Town of Mostar Area
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Review
AB  - The article presents the most critical factors that affect the soil temperature, such as the effects of the canyon, anthropogenic heat, greenhouse effect, effective reflectivity, evaporating reduction and turbulent transfer of heat. Most of these factors can be found in the town of Mostar area. The simplest and the most widely used method of land surface temperature determination is processing of thermal channels satellite scenes. Landsat is the longest and most widely used satellite mission with open data. For the purposes of this study Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite scenes were used and open meteorological data from which the atmospheric correction was calculated, and then land surface temperature (LST) for the Mostar area. Three winter scenes were used (occurred in the colder part of year) and three summer scenes (occurred in the warmest part of the year). From all processed data can be concluded that Mostar can be considered as one of the warmest towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and wider.

T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: We investigated factors associated with Care Home (CH) discharge following stroke using routinely collected data in unselected patients and assessed the relevance of previous research findings to such patients seen in routine clinical practice.Design: Retrospective analysis of data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme using univariate analysis and logistic regression.Setting: A large acute and rehabilitation UK stroke unit with access to early supported discharge.Subjects: All patients with stroke treated from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2017.Main measures: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS).Results: Of 2584 patients (median age 78years, interquartile range (IQR) 69-86; 50.6% male; 86.7% infarcts; median admission NIHSS 4, IQR 2-9), 401 (15.5%) died in hospital and 203 patients (7.9%) were permanently discharged to CH for the first time. Most had pre-discharge mRS scores of 4/5. Factors (odds ratios; 95% confidence intervals) associated with CH discharge included age (1.07; 1.05-1.10), incontinence (11.5; 7.13-19.25), dysphagia (2.13; 1.39-3.29), severe weakness (1.93; 1.28-2.92), pneumonia (1.68; 1.13-2.50), urinary tract infection (UTI) (1.70; 1.04-2.75) and depression (1.65; 1.00-2.72). In a subgroup of all patients with a pre-discharge mRS of 4/5, age (1.04; 1.02-1.06), incontinence (4.87; 2.39-11.02), UTI (2.0; 1.09-3.71) and pneumonia (1.59; 1.02-2.50) were the only factors associated with CH discharge.Conclusion: Potentially modifiable variables like incontinence, UTI and pneumonia were associated with CH discharge, particularly in the severely disabled.

TI  - Comparison of geomorphological field mapping and 2D-InSAR mapping of periglacial landscape activity at Nordnesfjellet, northern Norway
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to continuously monitor the dynamic response of periglacial landforms in a climate change context is of increasing scientific interest. Satellite radar interferometry provides information on surface displacement that can be related to periglacial processes. Here we present a comparison of two-dimensional (2D) surface displacement rates and geomorphological mapping at periglacial landform and sediment scale from the mountain Nordnesfjellet in northern Norway. Hence, 2D Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results stem from a 2009-2014 TerraSAR-X dataset from ascending and descending orbits, decomposed into horizontal displacement vectors along an east-west plane, vertical displacement vectors and combined displacement velocity. Geomorphological mapping was carried out on aerial imagery and validated in the field. This detailed landform and sediment type mapping revealed an altitudinal distribution dominated by, weathered bedrock blockfields, surrounded primarily by slightly, to non-vegetated solifluction landforms at the mountain tops. Below, an active rockslide and associated rockfall deposits are located on the steep east-facing side of the study area, whereas glacial sediments dominate on the gentler western side. We show that 2D InSAR correctly depicts displacement rates that can be associated with typical deformation patterns for flat-lying or inclined landforms, within and below the regional permafrost limit, for both wet and dry areas. A net lowering of the entire landscape caused by general denudation of the periglacial landforms and sediments is here quantified for the first time using radar remote sensing.

TI  - The Significance of Land Cover Delineation on Soil Erosion Assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to evaluate the significance of land cover delineation on soil erosion assessment. To that end, RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) was implemented at the Upper Acheloos River catchment, Western Central Greece, annually and multi-annually for the period 1965-92. The model estimates soil erosion as the linear product of six factors (R, K, LS, C, and P) considering the catchment's climatic, pedological, topographic, land cover, and anthropogenic characteristics, respectively. The C factor was estimated using six alternative land use delineations of different resolution, namely the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) project (2000, 2012 versions) (1:100,000), a land use map conducted by the Greek National Agricultural Research Foundation (NAGREF) (1:20,000), a land use map conducted by the Greek Payment and Control Agency for Guidance and Guarantee Community Aid (PCAGGCA) (1:5,000), and the Landsat 8 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (30 m/pixel) (two approximations) based on remote sensing data (satellite image acquired on 07/09/2016) (1:40,000). Since all other factors remain unchanged per each RUSLE application, the differences among the yielded results are attributed to the C factor (thus the land cover pattern) variations. Validation was made considering the convergence between simulated (modeled) and observed sediment yield. The latter was estimated based on field measurements conducted by the Greek PPC (Public Power Corporation). The model performed best at both time scales using the Landsat 8 (Eq. 13) dataset, characterized by a detailed resolution and a satisfactory categorization, allowing the identification of the most susceptible to erosion areas.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover Changes (LULCC) has impacts on a wide range of environmental and landscape attributes including the quality of land, water and air. The main objective of this study was to analysis the impact of anthropogenic activities and LULCC on weather (rainfall and temperature) and vegetation in the study area over a period of 28 years. The study has employed temporal LANDSAT sensors data to identify the changes in LULC and Vegetation Indices through anthropogenic influence. Moreover, statistical analysis of temperature and rainfall data (1985-2015) has also been done of Bambasi station. It has been found that the average temperature has been increased approximately 2.2 A degrees C and the average rainfall amount was declined throughout the period. The drastic changes have been noticed in LULC, vegetation health and its area through NDVI during the first interval (1987-2001) but the land change growth was less in second interval (2001-2015). The increasing population, urbanization and resettlement scheme for refugees were the responsible factors for changes. This case study indicates that the impact of anthropogenic activities leads the change in LULC and the climate has been influenced or vice versa over the time period in this semi-arid region of Ethiopia.

T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - It is not new to recognize that data from remote sensing platforms is transforming the way we characterize and analyse our environment. The ability to collect continuous data spanning spatial scales now allows geomorphological research in a data rich environment and this special issue [coming just eight years after the 2010 special issue of Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (ESPL) associated with the remote sensing of rivers] highlights the considerable research effort being made to exploit this information, for studies of geomorphic form and process. The 2010 special issue on the remote sensing of rivers noted that fluvial remote sensing articles made up some 14% of the total river related articles in ESPL. A similar review of articles up to 2017 reveals that this figure has increased to around 25% with a recent proliferation of articles utilizing satellite-based data and structure from motion photogrammetry derived data. It is interesting to note, however that many studies published to date are proof of concept, concentrating on confirming the accuracy of the remotely sensed data at the expense of generating new insights and ideas on fluvial form and function. Data is becoming ever more precise and researchers should now be concentrating on analysing these early data sets to develop increased geomorphic insight, to challenge existing paradigms and to advance geomorphic science. The prospect of this occurring is increased by the fact that many of the new remote sensed platforms allow accurate spatial data to be collected cheaply and efficiently, reducing the need for substantial research funding to advance river science. Fluvial geomorphologists have never before been in such a liberated position. As techniques and analytical skills continue to improve it is inevitable that the prediction that remotely sensed data will revolutionize our understanding of geomorphological form and process will prove true, altering our ideas on the very nature of system functioning in the process.

TI  - Review of Novel Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Techniques in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer patients who present with nodal metastasis receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with increasing frequency and can have complete pathologic response after treatment. In this clinical scenario, sentinel node mapping and biopsy are gaining acceptance instead of axillary dissection to avoid morbidity. Biopsy proven positive lymph nodes must be reliably excised and examined after NAC to further decrease the false negativity rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery. The standard method for axillary staging in breast cancer patients even after NAC is SLN biopsy (SLNB) with a radioisotope, blue dye, or both (dual technique). Currently, preoperative axillary staging with ultrasound and biopsy, along with placement of an image-detectable marker to be removed at the time of definitive surgery is recommended. In this study, we evaluated some methods of SLNB for patients treated with NAC like indocyanine green fluorescence, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, indigocarmine blue dye, contrast-enhanced ultrasound using microbubbles, and tattooing. Some methods are also needed to ensure that the initially biopsy proven positive node is removed at the time of surgery to be carefully evaluated for residual disease after chemotherapy like clip placement to the suspected or involved nodes before NAC, and removing the clipped node with the guidance of 125I-labeled radioactive seed or guide wires.

TI  - Machine vision smart sprayer for spot-application of agrochemical in wild blueberry fields
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An essential part of the wild blueberry cropping system is the proper management of agrochemical inputs including herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. A machine vision system was developed and mounted on the rear sprayer boom 0.18 m in front of the sprayer nozzles capable of targeting the agrochemical application on an as-needed basis. The three-point hitch mounted sprayer featured 27 nozzles over a 13.7 m boom width and a storage tank capacity of 1135 l. Nine digital color cameras continually take images in real-time while computer software processes the images in 0.15 s to determine the target locations where the nozzles open and spray at speeds up to 1.77 m s(-1). Two wild blueberry fields in central Nova Scotia were selected for smart sprayer performance testing with spot-application (SA) of agrochemical as compared to control and uniform application techniques. Chateau(A (R)) herbicide was applied in a field with an infestation of hair cap moss. Spray droplet comparison showed moss patches were properly targeted using the smart sprayer. SA provided the same coverage performance as compared to uniform on the moss targets with herbicide application savings of 78.5% using the smart sprayer. Harvestable yield results were similar for all application tracks. TruPhos Magnesium and ZincMax foliar fertilizers were tank mixed with Bravo(A (R)) and Proline(A (R)) fungicides and applied to compare the difference of SA, control and uniform application. Results showed SA of foliar fertilizer and fungicide led to less premature leaf drop and increased the blueberry stem height, number of branches, stem diameter and fruit buds. SA of foliar fertilizer and fungicide also increased the percent of healthy wild blueberry plants by 57.8% and the harvestable yield by 137.8%. Fungicide application savings using the smart sprayer for SA were 11.6%.

TI  - Can animals predict earthquakes?: Bio-sentinels as seismic sensors in communist China and beyond
T2  - STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the international research on abnormal animal behavior prior to earthquakes, with a focus on Chinese seismology during the Cultural Revolution. China experienced a series of powerful earthquakes in the 1960s and 1970s; in response, its scientists developed approaches to earthquake prediction, including the use of bio-sentinels. The paper demonstrates that Chinese seismology did not treat an earthquake simply as a geophysical event, but rather as an amalgam of environmental phenomena, including sensory experiences. Hence, distributive experience and sensory networks of humans and bio-sentinels constituted an important component of studying the environment. This historical case suggests insights into bio-monitoring of the global environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - MODIS detection of vegetation changes and investigation of causal factors in Poyang Lake basin, China for 2001-2015
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, vegetation has shown an overall greening trend in response to rising global temperatures. At the same time, vegetation browning is still worthy of attention, particularly in humid regions with dense vegetation coverage. This study used 15 years (2001-2015) of Terra Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data in an effort to detect the overall trends and abrupt changes in vegetation activity over the Poyang Lake basin, which is a typical humid region that contains the largest freshwater lake in China. MODIS NDVI data showed a vegetation greening trend over 94.9% of the basin land. Although the basin has been extensively afforested since the 1980s, there was still a vegetation browning trend over 5.1% of the basin land area, primarily as a result of urbanization. Abrupt vegetation decreases were observed over 7.9% of the basin land area from 2004 to 2012. Most of the decreases were likely caused by the nationwide snow storms in early 2008 and the widespread insect outbreaks as a result of abnormal hydrometeorological conditions. Abrupt vegetation increases were observed over 1.6% of the basin land area in the same period. Most of the increases were likely attributed to the continued efforts of afforestation that transformed large woody savanna lands to mixed forests. The results provided spatial details, time nodes and causal factors of vegetation changes, particularly vegetation decreases, which will benefit government organizations when taking remedial measures.

AB  - While there is no doubt that regional lymph node metastases are an enormously important factor in melanoma staging and treatment, the biology behind this significance and its precise implications for treatment planning have been a leading controversy in melanoma and other solid tumors for over a century. Recent clinical data, including data from prospective randomized clinical trials have refined our understanding of the process of nodal metastases and the advantages and disadvantages of different clinical management strategies. This review presents two points of view in this debate and discusses the results of new data analyses as well as pivotal clinical trials informing the discussion.

TI  - On the Potential of the RST-FLARE Algorithm for Gas Flaring Characterization from Space
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective characterization of gas flaring is hampered by the lack of systematic, complete and reliable data on its magnitude and spatial distribution. In the last years, a few satellite methods have been developed to provide independent information on gas flaring activity at global, national and local scale. Among these, a MODIS-based method, aimed at the computation of gas flared volumes by an Italian plant, was proposed. In this work, a more general version of this approach, named RST-FLARE, has been developed to provide reliable information on flaring sites localization and gas emitted volumes over a long time period for the Niger Delta region, one of the top five gas flaring areas in the world. Achieved results showed a good level of accuracy, in terms of flaring sites localization (95% of spatial match) and volume estimates (mean bias between in 16% and 20%, at annual scale and 2-9% in the long period) when compared to independent data, provided both by other satellite techniques and national/international organizations. Outcomes of this work seem to indicate that RST-FLARE can be used to provide, at different geographic scales, quite accurate data on gas flaring, suitable for monitoring purposes for governments and local authorities.

TI  - Using synthetic data to evaluate the benefits of large field plots for forest biomass estimation with LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the maturation of methods for estimating aboveground forest biomass by remote sensing, researchers increasingly need test data, particularly ground reference data, that are large enough to fine-tune existing approaches and test their robustness under diverse conditions. In this context, realistic synthetic datasets present an interesting alternative to costly and limited field data. Here, we present a new approach to simulate realistic canopy height and cover type data by combining an individual-tree forest simulator with real LiDAR point clouds of individual trees.We demonstrate the utility of our approach by re-examining the influence of field plot size on the predictive power of remote-sensing models for biomass estimation. Our approach with a complete (wall-to-wall) field reference dataset and matching synthetic remote sensing data allowed us to not only perform internal cross-validations with field plots that were used to fit the model (as in studies with real data), but to also consider the quality of model predictions to a standardized spatial grid or to the entire region.Our results confirm earlier reports of smaller predictive errors with increased field plot sizes under internal model validation (RMSE of 125 t/ha at 10 m field plot size and RMSE of 40 t/ha for 50 m field plots). However, we show that this is mainly an artifact of comparing the models with the same data they were fit, thus with validation data of different scales. When validating on a grid with standardized scale, smaller field plots performed almost equally well as larger field plots (small RMSE decrease between 4 t/ha and 7 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots), and even outperformed them if we assumed that increasing the plot size means that fewer field plots can be obtained (small RMSE increase between 9 t/ha and 12 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots).We conclude that synthetic remote sensing datasets are a useful tool for method testing. The suggested approach may be used to reexamine our current methodological understanding, which is often based on tests with real data of very limited sizes, as well as to optimize workflows, model choices and data collection. A wider use of synthetic data could be instrumental in improving remote sensing methodology.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Sensible and Latent Heat Flux in the City of Basel (Switzerland)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban surfaces are a complex mixture of different land covers and surface materials; the relative magnitudes of the surface energy balance components therefore vary widely across a city. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements provide the best estimates of turbulent heat fluxes but are restricted to the source area. Land surface modeling with earth observation (EO) data is beneficial for extrapolation of a larger area since citywide information is possible. Turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes are calculated by a combination of micrometeorological approaches (the aerodynamic resistance method, ARM), EO data, and GIS techniques. Input data such as land cover fractions and surface temperatures are derived from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS, urban morphology was calculated from high-resolution digital building models and GIS data layers, and meteorological data were provided by flux tower measurements. Twenty-two Landsat scenes covering all seasons and different meteorological conditions were analyzed. Sensible heat fluxes were highest for industrial areas, railway stations, and areas with high building density, mainly corresponding to the pixels with highest surface-to-air temperature differences. The spatial distribution of latent heat flux is strongly related to the saturation deficit of vapor and the (minimum) stomatal resistance of vegetation types. Seasonal variations are highly dependent on meteorological conditions, i.e., air temperature, water vapor saturation deficit, and wind speed. Comparison of measured fluxes with modeled fluxes in the weighted source area of the flux towers is moderately accurate due to known drawbacks in the modeling approach and uncertainties inherent to EC measurements, particularly in urban areas.

TI  - Projection of land surface temperature considering the effects of future land change in the Taihu Lake Basin of China
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important environmental parameter that is significantly affected by land use and landscape composition. Despite the recent progress in LST retrieval algorithms and better knowledge of the relationship between LST and land coverage indices, predictive studies of future LST patterns are limited. Here, we project LST patterns in the Taihu Lake Basin to the year 2026 based on projected land use pattern and simulated land coverage indices that include normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). We derived the spatiotemporal LST patterns in the Taihu Lake Basin from 1996 to 2026 using thermal infrared data from Landsat imagery. A CA-Markov model was applied to project the 2026 land use pattern in the basin based on spatial driving factors, using the 2004 land use as the initial state. We simulated the NDBI, NDVI and NDWI indices for 2026 using the projected land use patterns, and then generated the 2026 LST in the study area. Our results showed that LST has been increasing and the warming areas have been expanding since 1996, especially in the Su-Xi-Chang urban agglomeration. The mean LST in Su-Xi-Chang has increased from < 30 degrees C in 1996 to > 31 degrees C in 2004 and has risen to about 33 degrees C in 2016, and the projection suggests that LST will reach about 35 degrees C in 2026. Our results also suggest that mean LST increased by 2 degrees C per decade in this highly urbanized area between 1996 and 2026. We present a preliminary method to produce future LST patterns and provide reasonable LST scenarios in the Taihu Lake Basin, which should help develop and implement management strategies for mitigating the effects of urban heat island.

TI  - Monitoring and forecasting heat island intensity through multi-temporal image analysis and cellular automata-Markov chain modelling: A case of Babol city, Iran
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island is one of the most vital environmental risks in urban areas. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial-temporal patterns of land use changes and heat island intensity for the city of Babol, Iran, between 1985 and 2015 and to predict likely future heat island intensity variations. Multi-temporal Landsat images were acquired and analysed in this study. First, single channel algorithms were used to calculate the land surface temperature (LST), and a Maximum Likelihood Algorithm was utilized to classify images. Second, land use changes (LUCs) and LST were examined, and the relationship between the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and land-use changes was analysed using the normalized land surface temperature. By using the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized thermal images, the area was divided into five thermal categories: very low, low, medium, high and very high. Then, by applying the heat island intensity index, the heat island changes in the studied period were investigated. Possible future land use changes were investigated using a cellular automata-Markov model, and the heat island intensity changes were anticipated. The results indicate that the area of built-up land increased by 92% between 1985 and 2015, and that the area of agricultural land noticeably decreased. The built-up land changes trend has an inverse relationship with the trend of FVC changes and follows the same trend as the normalized surface temperature changes. Most changes in the surface temperature of the area are located within 0-800 m of a built-up area. The main reason for these changes could be the conversion of agricultural and green space land areas into built-up land. The largest area of the temperature categories in all years is the medium temperature category, which covers the suburban land areas. The low- and very low temperature categories, which follow a decreasing trend, are related to land areas far from the city. In addition, the high- and very high-temperature categories, whose areas increased annually, are adjacent to the city core and the exits from the city. The average surface temperature in all land uses increased during the studied period. Nevertheless, the rate of temperature rise is higher in the built-up uses. The index ratio of the heat island during this period shows an increasing trend, and its value changed from 0/5 in 1985 to 0/67 in 2015. An increase in the heat island intensity has a direct relationship with the area population growth and, thus, the increase in the built-up land area. Anticipation of land use changes and the process of heat island intensity variations for the studied area show alarming results that call for decision-makers to address this important challenge.

TI  - Evaluating the Best Spectral Indices for the Detection of Burn Scars at Several Post-Fire Dates in a Mountainous Region of Northwest Yunnan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote mountainous regions are among the Earth's last remaining wild spots, hosting rare ecosystems and rich biodiversity. Because of access difficulties and low population density, baseline information about natural and human-induced disturbances in these regions is often limited or nonexistent. Landsat time series offer invaluable opportunities to reconstruct past land cover changes. However, the applicability of this approach strongly depends on the availability of good quality, cloud-free images, acquired at a regular time interval, which in mountainous regions are often difficult to find. The present study analyzed burn scar detection capabilities of 11 widely used spectral indices (SI) at 1 to 5 years after fire events in four dominant vegetation groups in a mountainous region of northwest Yunnan, China. To evaluate their performances, we used M-statistic as a burned-unburned class separability index, and we adapted an existing metric to quantify the SI residual burn signal at post-fire dates compared to the maximum severity recorded soon after the fire. Our results show that Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) are always among the three best performers for the detection of burn scars starting 1 year after fire but not for the immediate post-fire assessment, where the Mid Infrared Burn Index, Burn Area Index, and Tasseled Cap Greenness were superior. Brightness and Wetness peculiar patterns revealed long-term effects of fire in vegetated land, suggesting their potential integration to assist other SI in burned area detection several years after the fire event. However, in general, class separability of most of the SI was poor after one growing season, due to the seasonal rains and the relatively fast regrowth rate of shrubs and grasses, confirming the difficulty of assessment in mountainous ecosystems. Our findings are meaningful for the selection of a suitable SI to integrate in burned area detection workflows, according to vegetation type and time lag between image acquisitions.

TI  - Optimal range of injection rates for a lymphatic drug delivery system
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymphatic drug delivery system (LDDS) is a new technique that permits the injection of drugs into a sentinel lymph node (SLN) at an early stage of tumor metastasis, thereby treating metastasis in the SLN and its secondary lymph nodes (LNs). The quantity of drug required for a LDDS is much smaller than that needed for systemic chemotherapy. However, the relationship between the rate of drug injection into a SLN and the amount of drug reaching the secondary LNs has not been investigated. In this study, we used an MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mouse model to show that the optimal rate for the injection of a fluorescent dye by a LDDS was 10 to 80 mu L/min. An injection rate of 10 to 80 mu L/min was able to fill the downstream LN. However, an injection rate of 100 mu L/min drove the fluorescent dye into the efferent lymphatic vessels and thoracoepigastric vein, decreasing the amount of dye retained in the downstream LN. Bolus injection (defined as an injection rate of 2400 mu L/min) was unable to deliver fluorescent dye into the downstream LN. These results agree with the impulse values calculated from the injection pressures in the upstream LN. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate the development of a LDDS for use in the clinic.

TI  - Axillary Surgery for Early-Stage, Node-Positive Mastectomy Patients and the Use of Postmastectomy Chest Wall Radiation Therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined axillary surgery in mastectomy patients with tumor-positive nodes and how the type of axillary surgery impacted use of postmastectomy chest wall radiation therapy (PMRT).Using the National Cancer Data Base, we selected patients with AJCC cT1/T2c N0 breast cancer with one to three tumor-positive lymph nodes treated between 2013 and 2014. Type of axillary surgery was analyzed using the FORDS scope of regional lymph node surgery variable. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to identify independent predictors associated with SNB alone and the use of PMRT.Of 8089 patients, 2482 (30.7%) underwent SNB alone, 1339 (16.6%) underwent axillary dissection (ALND) alone, and 4268 (52.7%) underwent SNB followed by ALND. Fifty-seven percent of patients with micrometastases underwent SNB alone compared with 22.6% of patients with macrometastases. Independent predictors of SNB alone for patients with micrometastases were African American race, number of nodes positive, and PMRT. For patients with macrometastases, age, facility type and location, and PMRT were independent predictors for SNB alone. Of 2449 patients who underwent SNB alone, 1538 (62.8%) had no PMRT, 261 (10.7%) had PMRT alone, and 650 (26.5%) had PMRT with regional nodal irradiation. Patients undergoing SNB alone were 1.70 times [96% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-2.00] more likely to undergo PMRT than upfront ALND and 1.51 times (96% CI 1.34-1.71) more likely than SNB followed by ALND.Surgeons are omitting completion ALND in a third of early-stage, node-positive mastectomy patients. SNB alone patients are more likely to undergo PMRT than patients undergoing ALND.

TI  - Focusing on the Nonreligious Reveals Secular Mechanisms Underlying Well-Being and Prosociality
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater attention to secular and nonreligious individuals has provided much-needed balance as well as alternative interpretations of commonly held assumptions regarding religiosity/spirituality (R/S). Contrary to the theory that R/S provides unique benefits in areas such as prosociality and mental health, analogous secular mechanisms exist. The conflation of effects attributed to R/S together with secular effects represents a congruence fallacy. Studies often lack proper controls found in other areas of psychology (e.g., dismantling or placebo designs) that could detect when religion is acting as a proxy for more basic underlying influences. For example, an increased focus on the nonreligious has revealed that religious belief has often been confounded with factors such as strong worldview conviction, social engagement, and normative cultural fit. R/S differences co-occur with demographic, personality, cognitive, and epistemic variables that exert causal influence independent of any religious content. Fxperimental and treatment outcome studies featuring effects attributed to R/S often have not included equivalent secular conditions or stimuli. The association between spirituality and well-being has been artificially inflated because of conceptual blurring on assessment measures, leading to the miscategorization of some nonreligious individuals into the spirituality domain. In sum, a more specified and critical approach is needed in order to validate assumptions that religiosity and spirituality exert unique effects.

TI  - ECOLOGY OF BIRDS ACCORDING TO THE INHABITANTS OF PEDRA BRANCA, SANTA TERESINHA (BAHIA, NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL)
T2  - Hornero
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds have been present in the life of humans, either as pets, food source, in folk medicine, as well as participants in the worldview of many human groups; thus, they are key elements of legends, myths and superstitions. In this study, we recorded the knowledge of the inhabitants of the town of Pedra Branca (Santa Teresinha, Bahia, northeastern Brazil) about the ecology of birds and their association with the etymology of common names. We recorded data through open, semi-structured interviews and projective tests. Forty eight people of different ages were interviewed. A total of 124 bird species were recorded. Common names adopted by the villagers were associated with the habitat, vocalization and foraging and reproductive behaviour of the species. Vocalization of birds were associated with local legends. In relation to reproductive aspects, we recorded information on sexual dimorphism, moult, reproductive season, parental care and nest construction. The inhabitants made reference to the main eating habits of the birds, identifying carnivorous, insectivorous, scavenger, granivorous, nectarivorous, fruit-eating, fish-eating and omnivorous species. The informants identified four environments for birds in the region: forests, capueras, wetlands and villages. The detailed knowledge of the interviewees on the ecology of birds and their relationship with the etymology of names, obtained by the transmission of knowledge and years of contact and observations, constitute important contributions to ethno-ornithology and ornithology.

TI  - A BP-NN based cloud detection method for FY-4 remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, normalized difference cloud moving index (NDCMI) is put forward by analyzing the remote sensing data every 15 minutes. By applying NDCMI, the detection of low cloud, thin cloud and the edge of moving cloud can be enhanced. We proposed a dynamic threshold method with NDCMI for preliminary cloud detection, and then through the preliminary results, we proposed a novel cloud detection method based on back propagation neural network (BP-NN). The experimental results show that the proposed method can eliminate the subjectivity in threshold selection, and can achieve better cloud detection results for remote sensing image in complex situations.

TI  - The early care environment and DNA methylome variation in childhood
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prenatal adversity shapes child neurodevelopment and risk for later mental health problems. The quality of the early care environment can buffer some of the negative effects of prenatal adversity on child development. Retrospective studies, in adult samples, highlight epigenetic modifications as sentinel markers of the quality of the early care environment; however, comparable data from pediatric cohorts are lacking. Participants were drawn from the Maternal Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study, a longitudinal cohort with measures of infant attachment, infant development, and child mental health. Children provided buccal epithelial samples (mean age = 6.99, SD = 1.33 years, n = 226), which were used for analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation and genetic variation. We used a series of linear models to describe the association between infant attachment and (a) measures of child outcome and (b) DNA methylation across the genome. Paired genetic data was used to determine the genetic contribution to DNA methylation at attachment-associated sites. Infant attachment style was associated with infant cognitive development (Mental Development Index) and behavior (Behavior Rating Scale) assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 36 months. Infant attachment style moderated the effects of prenatal adversity on Behavior Rating Scale scores at 36 months. Infant attachment was also significantly associated with a principal component that accounted for 11.9% of the variation in genome-wide DNA methylation. These effects were most apparent when comparing children with a secure versus a disorganized attachment style and most pronounced in females. The availability of paired genetic data revealed that DNA methylation at approximately half of all infant attachment-associated sites was best explained by considering both infant attachment and child genetic variation. This study provides further evidence that infant attachment can buffer some of the negative effects of early adversity on measures of infant behavior. We also highlight the interplay between infant attachment and child genotype in shaping variation in DNA methylation. Such findings provide preliminary evidence for a molecular signature of infant attachment and may help inform attachment-focused early intervention programs.

TI  - The geospatial relationship of pterygium and senile cataract with ambient solar ultraviolet in tropical Ecuador
T2  - PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Ecuador presents a unique climate in which we study the relationship between the ambient levels of solar ultraviolet radiation and eye disease in the absence of a latitudinal gradient. The national distribution of surface ultraviolet, taking into account MODIS and OMI satellite observation of aerosol, ozone, surface albedo, local elevation and cloud fractions measured during 2011, was compared with the national pterygium (WHO ICD H11) and senile cataract (WHO ICD H25) incidence projected from the 2010 National Institute of Statistics and Census (Ecuador). Public Health Ministry projections for age categories 0 to 39, 40 to 59 and 60+ years were compared to surface ultraviolet irradiance data in 1040 parishes. Correlations drawn between modelled surface ultraviolet and eye disease incidence show a significant increase in both pterygium and senile cataract in the highest ambient exposure regions of the Pacific coast and western lowlands with incidence rates of 34.39 and 16.17 per 100000 residents respectively. The lowest rates of incidence for pterygium (6.89 per 100000) and senile cataract (2.90 per 100000) were determined in high altitude sites and are attributed here to increased daily cloud fraction for parishes located in the Andean mountain range. The South American Andes experience the highest solar UV exposures on Earth and report frequent high incidence of keratinocyte cancer. Our results show the high Andes to be the location of the lowest eye disease incidence suggesting that both pterygium and senile cataract are the result of cumulative exposure to solar ultraviolet. These findings have clear implications for the agricultural workers and fishermen of the lowland districts of Ecuador, contrary to conventional understanding that greater risks are faced in locations of high altitude.

TI  - Wave Evolution in Off-Ice Wind Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of the sea ice coverage increases the importance of wind waves in the Arctic. Updates to the standard spectral wave models in recent years have included many aspects of wave-ice interaction. Here we use high-resolution wave parameters retrieved from TerraSAR-X images and in situ SWIFT buoy observations to evaluate the performance of WAVEWATCH III (R) in ice-free waters in the western Arctic over a 7-week period including the fall freeze-up. About two thirds of the analyzed data sets show a good agreement between observations and model results. In other cases, more accurate representation of the wind input fields and the ice coverage could improve the model predictions. Two data sets with larger discrepancy are discussed in more detail. In these two cases of low model skill, with off-ice wind conditions, we show that the model wind-sea growth is too weak to match TerraSAR-X observations, and this situation is improved only slightly by including the effects of atmospheric stability using existing methods. Application of an effective fetch parameterization, which allows for reduced wave generation within the marginal ice zone prior to the open ocean, provides the best estimation of wave growth during off-ice winds.

TI  - Automatic delineation algorithm for site-specific management zones based on satellite remote sensing data
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the increasing demand for food production, climate change challenges for agriculture, and economic pressure, precision farming is an ever-growing market. The development and distribution of remote sensing applications is also growing. The availability of extensive spatial and temporal data-enhanced by satellite remote sensing and open-source policies-provides an attractive opportunity to collect, analyze and use agricultural data at the farm scale and beyond. The division of individual fields into zones of differing yield potential (management zones (MZ)) is the basis of most offline and map-overlay precision farming applications. In the process of delineation, manual labor is often required for the acquisition of suitable images and additional information on crop type. The authors therefore developed an automatic segmentation algorithm using multi-spectral satellite data, which is able to map stable crop growing patterns, reflecting areas of relative yield expectations within a field. The algorithm, using RapidEye data, is a quick and probably low-cost opportunity to divide agricultural fields into MZ, especially when yield data is insufficient or non-existent. With the increasing availability of satellite images, this method can address numerous users in agriculture and lower the threshold of implementing precision farming practices by providing a preliminary spatial field assessment.

TI  - Breast cancer-related lymphedema: risk factors, precautionary measures, and treatments
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a negative sequela of breast cancer treatment, and well-established risk factors include axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional lymph node radiation (RLNR). BCRL affects approximately 1 in 5 patients treated for breast cancer, and it has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life after breast cancer treatment, serving as a reminder of previous illness. This paper is a comprehensive review of the current evidence regarding BCRL risk factors, precautionary guidelines, prospective screening, early intervention, and surgical and non-surgical treatment techniques. Through establishing evidence-based BCRL risk factors, researchers and clinicians are better able to prevent, anticipate, and provide early intervention for BCRL. Clinicians can identify patients at high risk and utilize prospective screening programs, which incorporate objective measurements, patient reported outcome measures (PROM), and clinical examination, thereby creating opportunities for early intervention and, accordingly, improving BCRL prognosis. Innovative surgical techniques that minimize and/or prophylactically correct lymphatic disruption, such as axillary reverse mapping (ARM) and lymphatic-venous anastomoses (LVAs), are promising avenues for reducing BCRL incidence. Nonetheless, for those patients with BCRL who remain unresponsive to conservative methods like complete decongestive therapy (CDT), surgical treatment options aiming to reduce limb volume or restore lymphatic flow may prove to be palliative or corrective. It is only through a strong team-based approach that such a continuum of care can exist, and a multidisciplinary approach to BCRL screening, intervention, and research is therefore strongly encouraged.

TI  - Geology and Physical Properties Investigations by the InSight Lander
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Although not the prime focus of the InSight mission, the near-surface geology and physical properties investigations provide critical information for both placing the instruments (seismometer and heat flow probe with mole) on the surface and for understanding the nature of the shallow subsurface and its effect on recorded seismic waves. Two color cameras on the lander will obtain multiple stereo images of the surface and its interaction with the spacecraft. Images will be used to identify the geologic materials and features present, quantify their areal coverage, help determine the basic geologic evolution of the area, and provide ground truth for orbital remote sensing data. A radiometer will measure the hourly temperature of the surface in two spots, which will determine the thermal inertia of the surface materials present and their particle size and/or cohesion. Continuous measurements of wind speed and direction offer a unique opportunity to correlate dust devils and high winds with eolian changes imaged at the surface and to determine the threshold friction wind stress for grain motion on Mars. During the first two weeks after landing, these investigations will support the selection of instrument placement locations that are relatively smooth, flat, free of small rocks and load bearing. Soil mechanics parameters and elastic properties of near surface materials will be determined from mole penetration and thermal conductivity measurements from the surface to 3-5 m depth, the measurement of seismic waves during mole hammering, passive monitoring of seismic waves, and experiments with the arm and scoop of the lander (indentations, scraping and trenching). These investigations will determine and test the presence and mechanical properties of the expected 3-17 m thick fragmented regolith (and underlying fractured material) built up by impact and eolian processes on top of Hesperian lava flows and determine its seismic properties for the seismic investigation of Mars' interior.

TI  - Phyto- and protozooplankton assemblages and hydrographic variability during an early winter survey in the Southern Brazilian Continental Shelf
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of phytoplankton and protozooplankton assemblages in relation to hydrographic variability across the southern Brazilian continental shelf were studied based on data collected during early winter (June/2012), complemented with MODIS-Aqua satellite imagery. The in situ data set was comprised by water column structure properties, dissolved inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), phytoplankton and protozooplankton composition and biomass [chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and carbon content]. Phytoplankton assemblages were assessed by both microscopy and HPLC-CHEMTAX approaches. A canonical correspondence analysis associating physical, chemical and phytoplankton composition data at surface revealed a tight coupling between the phytoplankton community and hydrographic conditions, with strong environmental gradients across three different domains: the pelagic, outer shelf Tropical Water (TW); the mid shelf domain under influence of Subtropical Shelf Water (STSW); and the inner shelf domain, mainly under influence of riverine outflow of the La Plata River Plume Water (PPW). Results showed that diatoms dominated the phytoplankton assemblages throughout the study region, but other groups were also important and varied according to the different water masses at surface. The low salinity and nutrient-rich PPW stimulated a high phytoplankton biomass and diversity of diatoms and dinoflagellates within the inner shelf region, with enhanced Chi a levels (> 1.3 mg m(-3)) and a great abundance of large and medium-sized diatoms (some of these appeared exclusively in PPW), as well as ciliates, dinoflagellates, raphidophyceans and cryptophytes. Conversely, smaller diatoms (e.g. Rhizosolenia clevei), picoplanktonic species (prochlorophytes and cyanobacteria) and a noticeable contribution of dinoflagellates and other flagellates, associated with lower CM a levels (< 0.93 mg m(-3)), characterized the TW domain, where low nutrient concentrations and deep upper mixed layers were found. The transitional mid shelf domain showed intermediate levels of both nutrients and Chl a (ranging 1.06-1.59 mg m(-3)), and phytoplankton showed a diversity of diatoms and dinoflagellates similar to PPW, and was mainly composed by those two groups. Considerably diverse and abundant phytoplankton communities were observed in early winter at that section of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, particularly in areas under fresh water influence. In addition, the observed biomass levels of protozooplankton suggest their important role on top-down control processes in the region.

TI  - Automated extraction of various vegetative and water body indices from multisensor satellite data: a MATLAB approach
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remote sensing imageries with different spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric characteristics expands the horizon of our choices in imageries and vegetation mapping. Among the various techniques in vegetation mapping the use of vegetative indices confiscates the simplest and easiest one to understand and calculate. This work proposes automatic extraction of different vegetation and water indices from ResourceSat-1(IRS-P6) images. The concept paves to calculate indices for any ResourceSat image prearranged to the program which is written in MATLAB 2013a. The effortlessly accessible images from its onboard sensors as Medium Resolution Linear Imaging Self-Scanner (LISS-III) and Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) were considered to calculate six major indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index, Ratio Vegetation Index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Green Red Vegetation Index, and Normalized Difference Water Index automatically. The program was written for any ResourceSat (LISS-III and AWiFS) data so that further analysis as well as calculation of more indices can be done by any individual within MATLAB. The user-friendly and time preserving feature makes MATLAB more powerful that any common user can deal with the analysis without the presence of any GIS experts that other softwares do.

TI  - On the Connection Between the Spatial Behavior of the Total Electron Content of the Ionosphere on the GPS Signal Path and the Ionospheric Artificial Airglow in the 630 nm Line
T2  - RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results of simultaneous measurements of the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere on the GPS signal path and the ionospheric artificial airglow in the atomic oxygen red line ( = 630 nm) during HF pumping of the ionosphere by the Sura facility radiation. It is very likely that when the navigation satelliteGPS receiver path of a signal crosses the artificial airglow spot, the maximum brightness of the latter on the line of sight of the optical device at the navigation satellite was observed in the region of the TEC minimum.

TI  - Increasing expansion of large-scale crop production onto deforested land in sub-Andean South America
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of high commodity crop prices, rising global food demand, and technological advances has transformed the scale of global crop production. Farming in South America is a prime example, where large-scale cash crops, such as soy, have transformed the land use dynamics at the forest frontier. We evaluate this transformation in sub-Andean South America by estimating crop and forest cover and detecting individual cropland field parcels using Landsat imagery in 5 year intervals over a 24 year period. From 1990 to 2014, cropland expansion onto deforested land was increasingly driven by large fields (>50 ha), whose contribution increased from 32% to 48% (+16% increase), while the contribution of smaller fields (<20 ha) declined from 36% to 26% (-10% decrease). This shift toward large-scale farming replacing cleared land across the region has important implications for food security and biodiversity conservation. Policy efforts will need to target different actors and transcend national borders in order to tackle the changing nature of South American deforestation.

TI  - Integrating Drone Imagery into High Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Assessments of Estuarine Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution satellite imagery (5 m resolution) has become available on a spatial and temporal scale appropriate for dynamic wetland management and conservation across large areas. Estuarine wetlands have the potential to be mapped at a detailed habitat scale with a frequency that allows immediate monitoring after storms, in response to human disturbances, and in the face of sea-level rise. Yet mapping requires significant fieldwork to run modern classification algorithms and estuarine environments can be difficult to access and are environmentally sensitive. Recent advances in unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS, or drones), coupled with their increased availability, present a solution. UAS can cover a study site with ultra-high resolution (<5 cm) imagery allowing visual validation. In this study we used UAS imagery to assist training a Support Vector Machine to classify WorldView-3 and RapidEye satellite imagery of the Rachel Carson Reserve in North Carolina, USA. UAS and field-based accuracy assessments were employed for comparison across validation methods. We created and examined an array of indices and layers including texture, NDVI, and a LiDAR DEM. Our results demonstrate classification accuracy on par with previous extensive fieldwork campaigns (93% UAS and 93% field for WorldView-3; 92% UAS and 87% field for RapidEye). Examining change between 2004 and 2017, we found drastic shoreline change but general stability of emergent wetlands. Both WorldView-3 and RapidEye were found to be valuable sources of imagery for habitat classification with the main tradeoff being WorldView's fine spatial resolution versus RapidEye's temporal frequency. We conclude that UAS can be highly effective in training and validating satellite imagery.

TI  - Greening and Browning of the Hexi Corridor in Northwest China: Spatial Patterns and Responses to Climatic Variability and Anthropogenic Drivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The arid region of northwest China provides a unique terrestrial ecosystem to identify the response of vegetation activities to natural and anthropogenic changes. To reveal the influences of climate and anthropogenic factors on vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), climate data, and land use and land cover change (LUCC) maps were used for this study. We analyzed the spatiotemporal change of NDVI during 2000-2015. A partial correlation analysis suggested that the contribution of precipitation (PRE) and temperature (TEM) on 95.43% of observed greening trends was 47% and 20%, respectively. The response of NDVI in the eastern section of the Qilian Mountains (ESQM) and the western section of the Qilian Mountains (WSQM) to PRE and TEM showed opposite trends. The multiple linear regressions used to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic activity on the NDVI trend indicated that the ESQM and oasis areas were mainly affected by anthropogenic activities (26%). The observed browning trend in the ESQM was attributed to excessive consumption of natural resources. A buffer analysis and piecewise regression methods were further applied to explore the influence of urbanization on NDVI and its change rate. The study demonstrated that urbanization destroys the vegetation cover within the developed city areas and extends about 4 km beyond the perimeter of urban areas and the NDVI of buffer cities (counties) in the range of 0-4 km (0-3 km) increased significantly. In the range of 5-15 (4-10) km (except for Jiayuguan), climate factors were the major drivers of a slight downtrend in the NDVI. The relationship of land use change and NDVI trends showed that construction land, urban settlement, and farmland expanded sharply by 171.43%, 60%, and 10.41%, respectively. It indicated that the rapid process of urbanization and coordinated urban-rural development shrunk ecosystem services.

TI  - TOJOLABAL MAYAN ETHNO-ORNITHOLOGY: ORIGINS, SONGS AND OMENS OF BIRDS
T2  - Hornero
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds represent one of the most relevant animal group in the Mayan worldview, from pre-Columbian times to the present. The objective of this work is to analyze various Mayan Tojolabal conceptions about the creation myths of some birds, the knowledge about their songs and their connection with signs and omens as a form of divination and relationship with the environment. The fieldwork was carried out in Las Margaritas, Chiapas, Mexico. Ethnographic and ethnobiological methods were used that included participant observations, open and semi-structured interviews, as well as ethnobiological walks. Some of the origin myths of bird species are closely related to their biological characteristics, as well as to the abilities that are assigned to them culturally to announce specific events. These signs are given to a greater extent through the different types of bird songs, which is recognized accurately by the inhabitants even at linguistic level. Specific terms were found in the Tojol-ab'al language to designate particular bird songs that are linked with omens. Tojolabal knowledge about birds is complex and imbricates different themes of their worldview, in which the avifauna maintains a relevant place.

TI  - A Generalized Zero-Shot Learning Framework for PolSAR Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most supervised classification methods for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data rely on abundant labeled samples, and cannot tackle the problem that categorizes or infers unseen land cover classes without training samples. Aiming to categorize instances from both seen and unseen classes simultaneously, a generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL)-based PolSAR land cover classification framework is proposed. The semantic attributes are first collected to describe characteristics of typical land cover types in PolSAR images, and semantic relevance between attributes is established to relate unseen and seen classes. Via latent embedding, the projection between mid-level polarimetric features and semantic attributes for each land cover class can be obtained during the training stage. The GZSL model for PolSAR data is constructed by mid-level polarimetric features, the projection relationship, and the semantic relevance. Finally, the labels of the test instances can be predicted, even for some unseen classes. Experiments on three real RadarSAT-2 PolSAR datasets show that the proposed framework can classify both seen and unseen land cover classes with limited kinds of training classes, which reduces the requirement for labeled samples. The classification accuracy of the unseen land cover class reaches about 73% if semantic relevance exists during the training stage.

TI  - MODERN CYNICISM AS A FORM OF CRITICAL-REFLEXIVE WORLDVIEW
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the modern phenomenon of cynicism in the context of its interpretation as a critical-reflexive form of worldview. Analysis of the phenomenon is based on the concept of cynicism by Peter Sloterdijk. Sloterdijk defines cynicism as the dominant form of modern consciousness. Cynicism is considered as a meta-historical phenomenon of consciousness, showing its specificity depending on the social and cultural conditions of the era. The specificity of modern cynicism is associated with the historical experience of the 20th century, the change of two sociocultural dominants - modernity and postmodernity. The features of postmodern culture are considered. It is noted that the situation of postmodernity can be characterised as a situation of "cultural trauma" (Piotr Sztompka). This situation is characterised by an increase in negative expectations in anticipation of any social change and a lack of confidence in the ideas of progress. The situation of trauma characterises the social, historical and emotional context, which acts as a medium for the formation of the subject, with a specific type of world perception, the result of which is the formation of a cynical form of worldview and reaction to the world. Structurally, cynicism corresponds to the end of any epoch. Within the structure of postmodernism, cynicism manifested itself as a further radicalisation of critical thinking presented in the Enlightenment. The postmodern revision of the basic attitudes of the entire Western culture led to the question of the possibility of obtaining reliable knowledge and truth. An individual finds oneself in a situation of uncertainty and impossibility of finding a stable basis of existence. This leads the individual to the need to remain in the position of cynicism, as the only stable orientation of consciousness, allowing to evaluate and interpret events. On this basis, cynicism is interpreted as a form of a critical-reflexive worldview, based on doubt about the possibility of achieving value universals, whose main values are personal, selfish motives, denying the possibility of development of society, etc.

TI  - Vegetation Greening Despite Weakening Coupling Between Vegetation Growth and Temperature Over the Boreal Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The previously reported strong coupling between interannual variations in vegetation growth and mean growing season temperature in the extratropical (>25 degrees N) Northern Hemisphere (NH) has displayed trends of progressive weakening in recent decades. However, the spatiotemporal patterns and drivers of the weakening coupling and its impacts on vegetation growth across the NH remain poorly understood. Here we address these issues using the vegetation index retrieved from remote sensing, global ecosystem model simulations, and gridded climate data. Our results reveal marked fading of the positive coupling between the mean growing season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIGS) and mean growing season temperature. Areas with significant positive coupling have shrunk from 31.2% to 20.0% over the periods of 1982-1997 and 1997-2012 across the extratropical NH. Vegetation productivity simulations from global ecosystem models did not capture the above mentioned patterns. There shows a continuous vegetation greening, with a greening rate of 0.0007-0.001 NDVI/year, despite the weakening of the positive coupling in the extratropical NH during the past few decades. Our results highlight that a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes governing vegetation growth-climate coupling is urgently needed for accurate predictions of the future trajectories of the response of boreal terrestrial ecosystems to a warmer and more extreme climate regime.

TI  - Improvements in the Monthly Gravity Field Solutions Through Modeling the Colored Noise in the GRACE Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has achieved a quantum leap in knowledge of the Earth's gravity field. However, current gravity field solutions still cannot reach the prelaunch baseline accuracy. One of the reasons for that is the presence of colored noise in GRACE data, which is typically ignored in the classical dynamic approach to gravity field modeling. In this research, we propose to account for colored noise in the classical dynamic approach by applying the frequency-dependent data weighting (FDDW) scheme, so that enhanced estimates of gravity field solutions are produced. The monthly solutions are compared with those produced using the standard least squares adjustment without a data weighting scheme. The comparison is performed in both spectral and spatial domains, showing the positive effect of the FDDW scheme in all considered cases. For instance, the cumulative geoid height errors up to degree 96 are reduced by 18%. In the spatial domain, the FDDW scheme lowers noise level in mass changes over the oceans, Mississippi river basin, and Greenland by 20, 38, and 23%, respectively, when compared to the without a data weighting scheme. In addition, the consistency of mass changes over the Mississippi and Congo river basins with those inferred from the state-of-the-art hydrology model WaterGAP is substantially improved when the FDDW scheme is applied. These results indicate that modeling colored noise in the GRACE data allows to significantly improve the recovered monthly solutions. This finding is likely applicable also to the GRACE Follow-On mission.

TI  - Translational Model of Zika Virus Disease in Baboons
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus with devastating outcomes seen recently in the Americas due to the association of maternal ZIKV infection with fetal microcephaly and other fetal malformations not previously associated with flavivirus infections. Here, we have developed the olive baboon (Papio anubis) as a nonhuman primate (NHP) translational model for the study of ZIKV pathogenesis and associated disease outcomes to contrast and compare with humans and other major NHPs, such as macaques. Following subcutaneous inoculation of adult male and nonpregnant female baboons, viremia was detected at 3 and 4 days postinfection (dpi) with the concordant presentation of a visible rash and conjunctivitis, similar to human ZIKV infection. Furthermore, virus was detected in the mucosa and cerebrospinal fluid. A robust ZIKV-specific IgM and IgG antibody response was also observed in all the animals. These data show striking similarity between humans and the olive baboon following infection with ZIKV, suggesting our model is a suitable translational NHP model to study ZIKV pathogenesis and potential therapeutics.IMPORTANCE ZIKV was first identified in 1947 in a sentinel rhesus monkey in Uganda and subsequently spread to Southeast Asia. Until 2007, only a small number of cases were reported, and ZIKV infection was relatively minor until the South Pacific and Brazilian outbreaks, where more severe outcomes were reported. Here, we present the baboon as a nonhuman primate model for contrast and comparison with other published animal models of ZIKV, such as the mouse and macaque species. Baboons breed year round and are not currently a primary nonhuman primate species used in biomedical research, making them more readily available for studies other than human immunodeficiency virus studies, which many macaque species are designated for. This, taken together with the similarities baboons have with humans, such as immunology, reproduction, genetics, and size, makes the baboon an attractive NHP model for ZIKV studies in comparison to other nonhuman primates.

TI  - Long-Term Estimation of Diurnal Vertical E x B Drift Velocities Using C/NOFS and Ground-Based Magnetometer Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the development of a new mathematical expression to estimate local daytime (0700-1700 LT) vertical ExB drift in low latitudes using a combination of ground-based magnetometer measurements and Communications and Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite observations. The expression was developed over Jicamarca (11.8 degrees S, 77.2 degrees W; 0.8 degrees N geomagnetic) and validated with Jicamarca Unattended Long-Term studies of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) mode and incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements during the period 2008-2014. The obtained correlation coefficient (R) values computed using observed and derived vertical E x B drift velocities are 0.79 and 0.84 for ISR and JULIA, respectively when data are available during 2008-2014. Storm-time comparison between observed and derived vertical E x B drift velocities agreed well with R of 0.92 and 0.87 during 5-8 August 2011 and 8-11 March 2012 geomagnetic storm periods for ISR and JULIA observations, respectively. Overall, we found that the developed expression is applicable in estimating vertical E x B drift response during quiet and geomagnetic storm periods. Based on these findings, we suggest that it is possible to develop accurate daytime global vertical E x B drift model over the equatorial latitude regions using inexpensive magnetometer observations and available satellite data.

TI  - Understanding the Moon's internal structure through moonquake observations and remote sensing technologies
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Explorations for the interior structure of the Moon mainly involve three technologies: the early gravitational observations via circumlunar satellites, the moonquake observations during the Apollo period, and the recent high-resolution remote sensing observations. Based on these technologies, we divided the development of the moon's interior structure into three stages. The first stage is the discovery of high-density anomalous masses (mascons) on the lunar surface with the low-order gravitational field models, which were obtained by observing perturbations of the early lunar orbital satellites. The second stage is the preliminary understanding of the layer structure with the help of moonquake observations during the Apollo period. The third stage is the deep understanding of the structure of the lunar crust, mantle, and core, with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data and the reassessment of moonquake data from the Apollo's mission. This paper gave detailed introduction and comments on different observation technologies, gathered data, and data processing techniques used at the three stages. In addition, this paper analyzed the current issues in the researches on the Moon's internal structure and discussed the prospects for future explorations.

TI  - Panchromatic and multi-spectral image fusion for new satellites based on multi-channel deep model
T2  - MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch and rapid development of new satellites such as WorldView-3, the bands number of multi-spectral images from new satellites is greatly increased. However, the spectral matching between the panchromatic image and multi-spectral images is deteriorated with the existing image fusion methods. In this paper, a novel method based on the multi-channel deep model is proposed to fuse images for new satellites. The deep model is implemented by convolutional neural networks and trained on each band to reduce the impact of spectral range mismatch. The proposed method also preserves the detailed information in multi-spectral images, which is ignored by the traditional methods. It also effectively alleviates the inconvenience for obtaining the remote sensing images by the data augmentation processing. In addition, it reduces the randomness of manual setting parameters using the parameter self-learning. Visual and quantitative assessments of fusion results show that the proposed method clearly improves the fusion quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Investigation of SMAP Active-Passive Downscaling Algorithms Using Combined Sentinel-1 SAR and SMAP Radiometer Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper was to test the capabilities of the Sentinel-1 radar data in downscaling Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer data for high-resolution soil moisture estimation. Three different active-passive downscaling algorithms, including the brightness temperature-based downscaling algorithm (BTBDA), the soil moisture-based downscaling algorithm (SMBDA), and a change detection method (CDM), were analyzed using pairs of Sentinel-1 active and SMAP passive observations collected over a semiarid landscape in southeastern Australia from May 2015 to May 2016. While these algorithms have been tested previously, this is the first study to evaluate the three algorithms using real Sentinel-1 radar and SMAP radiometer data. The SMAP passive observations were disaggregated to 9-, 3-, and 1-km scales and then compared with ground soil moisture measurements. The results suggest that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in downscaled soil moisture at 9-km resolution was 0.057, 0.056, and 0.067 cm(3)/cm(3) for the BTBDA, SMBDA, and CDM, respectively. The accuracy of downscaling methods was generally decreased when applied at the finer spatial resolution. The SMBDA had overall better performance in terms of correctly detecting the soil moisture pattern and relatively lower RMSE values, and is, therefore, recommended for the combined Sentinel-1 radar and SMAP radiometer setup for soil moisture monitoring. The influence of incidence angle normalization of Sentinel-I SIR data on downscaled soil moisture was also investigated and found to be minimal.

TI  - Broken bridges: The isolation of Kilimanjaro's ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity studies of global change mainly focus on direct impacts such as losses in species numbers or ecosystem functions. In this study, we focus on the long-term effects of recent land-cover conversion and subsequent ecological isolation of Kilimanjaro on biodiversity in a paleobiogeographical context, linking our findings with the long-standing question whether colonization of African mountains mainly depended on long-distance dispersal, or whether gradual migration has been possible through habitat bridges under colder climates. For this, we used Orthoptera as bioindicators, whose patterns of endemism and habitat demands we studied on about 500 vegetation plots on Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru (Tanzania) since 1996. Land-cover changes in the same area were revealed using a supervised classification of Landsat images from 1976 to 2000. In 1976, there was a corridor of submontane forest vegetation linking Kilimanjaro with Mt. Meru, replaced by human settlements and agriculture after 2000. Until recently, this submontane forest bridge facilitated the dispersal of forest animals, illustrated by the large number of endemic submontane forest Orthoptera shared by both mountains. Furthermore, the occurrence of common montane endemics suggests the existence of a former forest corridor with montane vegetation during much earlier times under climatic conditions 2-7 degrees C cooler and 400-1,700mm wetter than today. Based on the endemicity patterns of forest Orthoptera, negative consequences are predicted due to the effects of isolation, in particular for larger forest animals. Kilimanjaro is becoming an increasingly isolated ecosystem with far reaching consequences for diversity and endemism. Forest bridges between East African mountains acted as important migratory corridors and are not only a prehistoric phenomenon during periods with other climatic conditions but also disappeared in some places recently due to increasing and direct anthropogenic impact.

TI  - Molecular fluorescence-guided surgery of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin: A narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal origin may undergo cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as a curative approach. One major prognostic factor that affects survival is completeness of cytoreduction. Molecular Fluorescence Guided Surgery (MFGS) is a novel intraoperative imaging technique that may improve tumor identification in the future, potentially preventing over- and under-treatment in these patients. This narrative review outlines a chronological overview of MFGS development in patients with PC of colorectal origin.

TI  - The impact of heat waves on surface urban heat island and local economy in Cluj-Napoca city, Romania
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The association between heat waves and the urban heat island effect can increase the impact on environment and society inducing biophysical hazards. Heat stress and their associated public health problems are among the most frequent. This paper explores the heat waves impact on surface urban heat island and on the local economy loss during three heat periods in Cluj-Napoca city in the summer of 2015. The heat wave events were identified based on daily maximum temperature, and they were divided into three classes considering the intensity threshold: moderate heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 90th percentile), severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature over the 95th percentile), and extremely severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 98th percentile). The minimum length of an event was of minimum three consecutive days. The surface urban heat island was detected based on land surface temperature derived from Landsat 8 thermal infrared data, while the economic impact was estimated based on data on work force structure and work productivity in Cluj-Napoca derived from the data released by Eurostat, National Bank of Romania, and National Institute of Statistics. The results indicate that the intensity and spatial extension of surface urban heat island could be governed by the magnitude of the heat wave event, but due to the low number of satellite images available, we should consider this information only as preliminary results. Thermal infrared remote sensing has proven to be a very efficient method to study surface urban heat island, due to the fact that the synoptic conditions associated with heat wave events usually favor cloud free image. The resolution of the OLI_TIRS sensor provided good results for a mid-extension city, but the low revisiting time is still a drawback. The potential economic loss was calculated for the working days during heat waves and the estimated loss reached more than 2.5 mil. EUR for each heat wave day at city scale, cumulating more than 38 mil. EUR for the three cases considered.

TI  - Object-Based Image Analysis for Sago Palm Classification: The Most Important Features from High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) is a palm tree species originating in Indonesia. In the future, this starch-producing tree will play an important role in food security and biodiversity. Local governments have begun to emphasize the sustainable development of sago palm plantations; therefore, they require near-real-time geospatial information on palm stands. We developed a semi-automated classification scheme for mapping sago palm using machine learning within an object-based image analysis framework with Pleiades-1A imagery. In addition to spectral information, arithmetic, geometric, and textural features were employed to enhance the classification accuracy. Recursive feature elimination was applied to samples to rank the importance of 26 input features. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to perform classifications and resulted in the highest overall accuracy of 85.00% after inclusion of the eight most important features, including three spectral features, three arithmetic features, and two textural features. The SVM classifier showed normal fitting up to the eighth most important feature. According to the McNemar test results, using the top seven to 14 features provided a better classification accuracy. The significance of this research is the revelation of the most important features in recognizing sago palm among other similar tree species.

TI  - Incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease in English primary care: a cross-sectional and follow-up study of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To describe incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), its risk factors, medication prescribed to treat CVD and predictors of CVD within a nationally representative dataset.Design Cross-sectional study of adults with and without CVD.Setting The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is an English primary care sentinel network. RCGP RSC is over 50 years old and one of the oldest in Europe. Practices receive feedback about data quality. This database is primarily used to conduct surveillance and research into influenza, infections and vaccine effectiveness but is also a rich resource for the study of non-communicable disease (NCD). The RCGP RSC network comprised 164 practices at the time of study.Results Data were extracted from the records of 1 275 174 adults. Approximately a fifth (21.3%; 95%CI 21.2% to 21.4%) had CVD (myocardial infarction (MI), angina, atrial fibrillation (AF), peripheral arterial disease, stroke/transientischaemic attack (TIA), congestive cardiac failure) or hypertension. Smoking, unsafe alcohol consumption and obesity were more common among people with CVD. Angiotensin system modulating drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and calcium channel blockers were the most commonly prescribed CVD medications. Age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence for AF was 28.2/10 000 (95% CI 27.8 to 28.7); stroke/TIA 17.1/10 000 (95% CI 16.8 to 17.5) and MI 9.8/10 000 (95%CI 9.5 to 10.0). Logistic regression analyses confirmed established CVD risk factors were associated with CVD in the RCGP RSC network dataset.Conclusions The RCGP RSC database provides comprehensive information on risk factors, medical diagnosis, physiological measurements and prescription history that could be used in CVD research or pharmacoepidemiology. With the exception of MI, the prevalence of CVDs was higher than in other national data, possibly reflecting data quality. RCGP RSC is an underused resource for research into NCDs and their management and welcomes collaborative opportunities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: In the lower Mekong River Basin, the watershed development, such as reclamation, has been rapidly erence water index (NDWI) were defined as going on.The reclamation is expected to cause many problems on this important watershed environment.Study Focus: The objective of this research is to quantitatively clarify the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower Mekong River Basin.New hydrological insights: The locations of reclamation areas were extracted using MNDWI, NDVI and NDSI derived by Landsat data. As a result, the 49 reclamation areas covering approximately 95% of all 52 reclamation areas determined by visual extraction, were extracted.Then, the multiple logistic regression model was constructed to find the tendency of the occurrence of reclamation and reproduce the occurrence of reclamation.The test of goodness of fit, such as Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Nagelkerke coefficient, shows high adaptability (R2=0.89) of the probability model.The probability of occurrence of reclamation could be explained by the distance from the Phnom Penh city and the distance from the river channels.Moreover, the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood-inundation model and total phosphorus transportation model changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading respectively.Consequently, the inundation water level increases about 3.8 m and total phosphorus concentration increases about 0.71 mg/L around Phnom Penh in case of the reclamation of 10% of all inundation areas of Phnom Penh and Kandal province.

TI  - Satellite derived photogrammetric bathymetry
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is being adopted as a cheaper and more spatially extensive method for bathymetric mapping than traditional acoustic surveys, with research being conducted by the Canadian Hydrographic Service under a Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) of the Canadian Space Agency. Established SDB methods involve either an empirical approach, where a regression between known depths and various colour indexes is developed; or a physics-based Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) approach, where light interactions through the water column are simulated. Both methods have achieved vertical accuracies of around 1 m. However, the empirical approach is limited to areas with existing in-situ depth data, and has limited applicability in heterogeneous benthic environments, while the physics-based approach requires precise atmospheric correction. This paper proposes a through-water photogrammetric approach which avoids these limitations, in heterogeneous seafloor environments, by using feature extraction and image geometry rather than spectral radiance to estimate bathymetry. The method is demonstrated in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, Canada using a WorldView-2 stereo pair. A standard photogrammetric extraction was performed on the stereo pair, including a blunder removal and noise reduction. Apparent depths were then calculated by referencing under-water points to the extracted elevation of the water-line. Actual in-image depths were calculated from apparent depths by applying a correction factor to account for the effects of refraction at the air-water boundary. A tidal reduction brought depths to local chart datum, allowing for validation with Canadian Hydrographic Service survey data showing a mean error of 0.031 m and an RMSE of 1.178 m. The method has a similar accuracy to the two established SDB methods, allowing for its use for bathymetric mapping in circumstances where the established methods are not applicable due to their inherent limitations.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of four-parameter diurnal land surface temperature cycle models under clear-sky
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) models are useful tools for generating continuous diurnal land surface temperature (LST) dynamics from temporally sparse satellite observations. Four-parameter DTC models (FPD) can be applied to tandem polar-orbiting satellite observations that sample the surface at least four times per day and, therefore, they have received especial attention. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the parameter number of DTC models to only four, but a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the published FPDs and their performance is lacking. In addition, it remains unclear whether there are even better parameter-reduction approaches (PRAs) for DTC modeling when only four observations per day are available. Consequently, we chose three semi-empirical DTC models (GOT01, INA08, and GOT09) and one quasi-physical DTC model (GEM) and obtained nine FPDs with PRAs (e.g., by fixing some of the DTC parameters as constants). Using in-situ thermal observations from the U.S. Climate Reference Network, as well as LSTs from the geostationary MSG and FY-2F satellites under clear sky, we compared the performances of these nine FPDs for 24 and 4 available LST observations per day. We obtained the following results: (1) The GOT09- and GEM-type models generally performed better than the other models with in-situ measurements, while the INA08-ts and GOT09-type models possessed high accuracies for the geostationary LSTs. (2) For the semi-empirical models, the PRA 't(s) = t(ss )- 1' (where t(s), and t(ss) are the onsets of nighttime cooling and sunset, respectively) is generally more accurate than the PRA 'delta T=0' (where delta T is the day-to-day change of residual temperature). The only exception is the GOT09-type model, for which the 't(s) = t(ss) - 1' strategy is less accurate. (3) GOT09-dT-tau, which fixes delta T as zero and the atmospheric optical thickness (tau) as 0.01 for parameter reduction, shows the best performance of the FPDs. The study gives an overview of commonly-used four-parameter DTC models, provides a foundation for generating spatio-temporally continuous LST products, and offers guidance for choosing four-parameter DTC models in various applications.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the coupled ionosphere-thermosphere system during the 17 January 2005 geomagnetic storm. Multiinstrument satellite data are utilized to track polar convection and flow channels (FCs) in the topside ionosphere to compute Poynting flux values approximating electromagnetic energy and to detect localized neutral density increases and also to signal FC signatures in the thermosphere. Our main aim is to identify energy input regions during various events when localized neutral density increases developed. Such events are illustrated in five scenarios covering both hemispheres. These scenarios demonstrate the development of a cusp enhancement above/within FC-1 associated with newly open field lines and polar cap enhancements above/within FC-2, FC-3, and FC-4 commonly associated with old open field lines. Localized Poynting flux intensifications within these FCs demonstrate energy deposition continuing along old open field lines in the polar cap. The close correlation of these Poynting flux intensifications with their respective cusp and polar cap enhancements, via their underlying FCs through which the electromagnetic energy was deposited, provide observational evidence that these enhancements were generated by their associated energy inputs. These observational results lead to the conclusions that a main region of high-latitude energy deposition was (i) the polar cap (> 78 degrees magnetic latitude) producing polar cap enhancements (scenarios 1-3), (ii) the prenoon auroral zone producing a cusp enhancement (scenario 4), and (iii) both the polar cap producing a polar cap enhancement and the auroral zone (scenario 5).

TI  - Assessment of forest damage caused by the August 2017 hurricane using Sentiel-2 satellite data
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods or fires become more and more common phenomena in Europe. In August 2017, strong wind accompanied by heavy thunderstorms caused severe damage over the large area in central and western Poland. According to rapid damage assessment prepared by the State Forests authorities a few days after the windthrow, ca 79.7 thousand hectares of forest was damaged and 9.8 million of cubic meters of wood was lost. Assessment of such a large-scale forest damage is difficult without using the remote sensed data. In this study, we examined the potential of the European satellite Sentinel-2 data for assessment of the forest damage caused by the windthrow. The assessment was performed using a difference between a normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) calculated based on the pre- and post-damage Sentinel-2 images. NDMI was calculated based on NIR (824 nm) and SWIR (1610 nm) bands. The result of this study showed the total damage area in forest is equal to 35.8 thousand hectares, of which 27.7 thousand hectares was damaged within the State Forests and 8.1 thousand hectares outside the State Forests administration. These figures are much lower than the estimates by the State Forests, regarding the forest damage within the State Forests and higher comparing to estimations in the non-state forest. In fact, these figures are comparable with the heavily damage areas assigned to clearance by the State Forests. The accurate comparison of the results was not possible due to the lack of up-to-date information on forest damage. Sentinel-2 data revealed to be perfect data for large scale damage assessment and post damage forest monitoring mainly due to the wide swath up to 290 km. The limitation of the optical sensors is the cloudiness. Unfortunately, in the case of this analysis, the first cloud free image was acquired 6 weeks after the windthrow. It reduces the potential of the single-source data for rapid assessment of damages.

TI  - An Evaluation of Forest Health Insect and Disease Survey Data and Satellite-Based Remote Sensing Forest Change Detection Methods: Case Studies in the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Remote Sensing (ORS) program leverages Landsat and MODIS data to detect forest disturbances across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The ORS program was initiated in 2014 as a collaboration between the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) and the Forest Health Assessment and Applied Sciences Team (FHAAST). The goal of the ORS program is to supplement the Insect and Disease Survey (IDS) and MODIS Real-Time Forest Disturbance (RTFD) programs with imagery-derived forest disturbance data that can be used to augment traditional IDS data. We developed three algorithms and produced ORS forest change products using both Landsat and MODIS data. These were assessed over Southern New England and the Rio Grande National Forest. Reference data were acquired using TimeSync to conduct an independent accuracy assessment of IDS, RTFD, and ORS products. Overall accuracy for all products ranged from 71.63% to 92.55% in the Southern New England study area and 63.48% to 79.13% in the Rio Grande National Forest study area. While the accuracies attained from the assessed products are somewhat low, these results are similar to comparable studies. Although many ORS products met or exceeded the overall accuracy of IDS and RTFD products, the differences were largely statistically insignificant at the 95% confidence interval. This demonstrates the current implementation of ORS is sufficient to provide data to augment IDS data.

TI  - Trends of photosynthetically active radiation over China from 1961 to 2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to reveal the long-term variation properties of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) over China. A series of reliable empirical PAR estimation equations suitable for all-sky conditions were developed using data measured in situ from 2005 to 2014, which were obtained from the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN). These equations were then combined with a hybrid model to reconstruct the PAR from 1961 to 2014 for 724 weather stations belonging to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). There was a decreasing linear trend in the PAR (with an amplitude of -0.009molm(-2) day(-1) year(-1)) from 1961 to 1981 and a steady low level of -0.003molm(-2) day(-1) year(-1) during 1981-2014 for all of China. The PAR over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region increased from 1961 to 1984; then, this linear trend slightly changed. The breakpoint years for the northwest China (NWC), southwest China (SWC), north China (NC), northeast China (NEC) and east China (EC) regions were 1985, 1981, 1996, 1998 and 1979, respectively. In addition, the aerosol optical depth, ozone column concentration, cloud cover and water vapour content attenuated the PAR that would otherwise have reached the earth's surface by approximately 7.59, 1.12, 18.13 and 6.20%, respectively.

TI  - Association between nighttime artificial light pollution and sea turtle nest density along Florida coast: A geospatial study using VIIRS remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial lighting at night has becoming a new type of pollution posing an important anthropogenic environmental pressure on organisms. The objective of this research was to examine the potential association between nighttime artificial light pollution and nest densities of the three main sea turtle species along Florida beaches, including green turtles, loggerheads, and leatherbacks. Sea turtle survey data was obtained from the "Florida Statewide Nesting Beach Survey program". We used the new generation of satellite sensor "Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)" (version 1 D/N Band) nighttime annual average radiance composite image data. We defined light pollution as artificial light brightness greater than 10% of the natural sky brightness above 45 degrees of elevation (>1.14 x 10(-11) Wm(-2)sr(-1)). We fitted a generalized linear model (GLM), a GLM with eigenvectors spatial filtering (GLM-ESF), and a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach for each species to examine the potential correlation of nest density with light pollution. Our models are robust and reliable in terms of the ability to deal with data distribution and spatial autocorrelation (SA) issues violating model assumptions. All three models found that nest density is significantly negatively correlated with light pollution for each sea turtle species: the higher light pollution, the lower nest density. The two spatially extended models (GLM-ESF and GEE) show that light pollution influences nest density in a descending order from green turtles, to loggerheads, and then to leatherbacks. The research findings have an implication for sea turtle conservation policy and ordinance making. Near-coastal lights-out ordinances and other approaches to shield lights can protect sea turtles and their nests. The VIIRS DNB light data, having significant improvements over comparable data by its predecessor, the DMSP-OLS, shows promise for continued and improved research about ecological effects of artificial light pollution.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spread into regional lymph node is the major route of metastasis in cervical cancer. Although lymph node status is not involved in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system of uterine cervical cancer, the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis provides important information for prognosis and treatment. In this review, we have attempted to focus on the incidence and patterns of lymph node metastasis, and the issues surrounding surgical assessment of lymph nodes. In addition, the preoperative prediction of lymph node status, as well as the intraoperative assessment by sentinel nodes will be reviewed. Finally, lymph node micrometastasis also will be discussed.

TI  - Accelerated RAPID Model Using Heterogeneous Porous Objects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To enhance the capability of three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer models at the kilometer scale (km-scale), the radiosity applicable to porous individual objects (RAPID) model has been upgraded to RAPID3. The major innovation is that the homogeneous porous object concept (HOMOBJ) used for a tree crown scale is extended to a heterogeneous porous object (HETOBJ) for a forest plot scale. Correspondingly, the radiosity-graphics-combined method has been extended from HOMOBJ to HETOBJ, including the random dynamic projection algorithm, the updated modules of view factors, the single scattering estimation, the multiple scattering solutions, and the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) calculations. Five cases of the third radiation transfer model intercomparison (RAMI-3) have been used to verify RAPID3 by the RAMI-3 online checker. Seven scenes with different degrees of topography (valleys and hills) at 500 m size have also been simulated. Using a personal computer (CPU 2.5 GHz, memory 4 GB), the computation time of BRF at 500 m is only approximately 13 min per scene. The mean root mean square error is 0.015. RAPID3 simulated the enhanced contrast of BRF between backward and forward directions due to topography. RAPID3 has been integrated into the free RAPID platform, which should be very useful for the remote sensing community. In addition, the HETOBJ concept may also be useful for the speedup of ray tracing models.

TI  - A Complex Fluviolacustrine Environment on Early Mars and Its Astrobiological Potentials
T2  - ASTROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chloride-bearing deposits and phyllosilicates-bearing units are widely distributed in the southern highlands of Mars, but these phases are rarely found together in fluviolacustrine environments. The study of the coexistence of these minerals can provide important insights into geochemistry, water activity, and ultimately the climate and habitability of early Mars. Here we use high-resolution compositional and morphological orbiter data to identify and characterize the context of diverse minerals in a Noachian fluviolacustrine environment west of Knobel crater (6.7 degrees S, 226.8 degrees W). The chlorides in this region are likely formed through the evaporation of brines in a closed topographic basin. The formation age of chlorides is older than 3.7 Ga, based on stratigraphic relationships identified and previously obtained crater retention ages. The timing of the alteration of basaltic materials to iron-magnesium smectites in relation to the chloride formation in this location is enigmatic and is unable to be resolved with currently available remote sensing data. Importantly, we find that this close relationship between these key minerals revealed by the currently available data details a complex and intimate history of aqueous activity in the region. Of critical importance are the evaporitic deposits as analogous terrestrial deposits have been shown to preserve ancient biosignatures and possibly even sustain microbial communities for hundreds of millions of years. These salts could have protected organic matter from ultraviolet radiation, or even allow modern habitable microenvironments in the shallow subsurface through periodic deliquescence. The high astrobiology potential of this site makes it a good candidate for future landed and sample return missions (e.g., the Chinese 2020 Mars mission).

TI  - Reconstructing Flood Inundation Probability by Enhancing Near Real-Time Imagery With Real-Time Gauges and Tweets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood inundation probability is critical for situation awareness, flood mitigation, emergency response, and postevent damage assessment. Current flood inundation mapping approaches can be categorized into real-time (RT) and near-RT (NRT) processes based on the timing of data acquisition. However, the intrinsic limitations of each category largely hamper their applications for flood mapping. Taking the 2015 South Carolina flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this paper proposes a flood inundation reconstruction model by enhancing the NRT normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from remote sensing imagery with the RT data including stream gauge readings and social media (tweets). Splitting into three modules: water height module, global enhancement module, and local enhancement module, the proposed model first incorporates the gauge readings and the NDWI image to reconstruct a macroscale flood probability layer, which is then locally enhanced using the verified flood-related tweets. The final output of the model matches well with the U.S. Geological Survey inundation map and its surveyed high-water marks. Results suggest that by enhancing NRT imagery with RT data sources, the proposed flood inundation probability reconstruction model renders a more robust, spatially enhanced flood probability index for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of urgent attention.

TI  - Application of an Improved ABC Algorithm in Urban Land Use Prediction
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientifically and rationally analyzing the characteristics of land use evolution and exploring future trends in land use changes can provide the scientific reference basis for the rational development and utilization of regional land resources and sustainable economic development. In this paper, an improved hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm based on the mutation of inferior solutions (MHABC) is introduced to combine with the cellular automata (CA) model to implement a new CA rule mining algorithm (MHABC-CA). To verify the capabilities of this algorithm, remote sensing data of three stages, 2005, 2010, and 2015, are adopted to dynamically simulate urban development of Dengzhou city in Henan province, China, using the MHABC-CA algorithm. The comprehensive validation and analysis of the simulation results are performed by two aspects of comparison, the visual features of urban land use types and the quantification analysis of simulation accuracy. Compared with a cellular automata model based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO-CA) algorithm, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MHABC-CA algorithm in the prediction field of urban land use changes.

T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: The need for studies from more countries on the relationship between urban green space and health has been emphasized. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between two types of measurement of urban green space and self-reported lifestyle-related disorders in Oslo, Norway. Methods: Self-reported measures on mental disorders, asthma, type 2 diabetes and musculoskeletal pain of 8638 participants in the Oslo Health Study (HUBRO) were linked to two types of green space variables: the vegetation cover greenness derived from satellite data, which shows the city's vegetation cover regardless of property boundaries, and the land use greenness derived from municipal plans showing information about publicly accessible vegetation-covered areas. Associations between greenness and health measures were analysed by logistic regression models controlling for possible individual and contextual confounders. Results: Increasing vegetation cover greenness was associated with fewer self-reported mental disorders for both men and women after controlling for possible confounders. The proportion of women who reported high levels of musculoskeletal pain increased with increasing degrees of both of the greenness measurements, but no significant association was observed for men. No association was found for asthma and diabetes type 2 for either men or women. Conclusions: Although there was a positive association between vegetation cover greenness and self-reported mental disorders, the main findings showed mixed results. The lack of clear associations between urban green space and lifestyle-related health disorders in Oslo might have been influenced by a large proportion of the inhabitants having easy access to green areas.

TI  - Tailoring insect biocontrol for high tunnels
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Augmentation biocontrol is an effective tool for managing greenhouse pests, but typically fails in open-field settings where dispersal and/or harsh environmental conditions prevent natural enemy establishment. Here, we provide the first experimental evaluation of biocontrol in high tunnels, a new and increasingly popular tool for season extension as part of the local food movement. High tunnels are a hybrid growth environment with characteristics of both greenhouse and field production; thus, the success of augmentation biocontrol in these structures is unclear. Using tomato and cucumber as focal crops, we tested the retention and effectiveness of four commercially available insect predators: Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Orius insidiosus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Podisus maculiventris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), and Chrysoperla rufilabris (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Further, two tactics were evaluated to reduce emigration: i) installing fine mesh screen to tunnel openings; and ii) incorporating flowers with herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) lures. Overall, predator recapture rates were relatively low (< 10% of released individuals) and failed to elicit strong impacts on sentinel prey, aphids (Aphis gossypii, Myzus persicae) or hornworm caterpillars (Manduca sexta). The two experimental treatments had contrasting effects on predator establishment. Flowers + HIPVs dramatically increased retention of O. insidiosus (ca. 10-20% recapture vs. 0-1% in control or screened tunnels). Screening, however, mostly failed to retain predators and likely increased mortality due to higher temperatures from reduced ventilation. The abundance of naturally occurring predators (e.g., berytids, syrphid flies, spiders) and parasitoids was highest in flower + HIPV tunnels, intermediate in controls, and lowest in the screened treatment. These data suggest that diversifying high tunnel vegetables with additional sources of nectar/pollen and providing an attractant can simultaneously enhance both augmentation and conservation biocontrol. Screening, on the other hand, may induce pest outbreaks and was not shown to increase retention of augmented natural enemies.

M3  - Article

CP  - 13th International Conference on Meteorology, Climatology and Atmospheric Physics (COMECAP)
CL  - Aristotle Univ Res Disseminat Ctr, Thessaloniki, GREECE
AB  - The seasonal variability of cloudiness in the Mediterranean region is studied, through the examination of the mean day-to-day intra-annual variation of gridded NCEP/NCAR total cloud cover for the period 1948-2014. A dimensionality reduction process is followed by using a multivariate statistical methodology and three main modes of seasonal variation are found. The first mode is characterized by a winter maximum and a summer minimum and prevails mainly over the Mediterranean and Black Sea areas; a weak see-saw teleconnection over the Alps represents the opposite intra-annual variation. The second mode presents maxima in early autumn and late spring and minima in late summer and winter and prevails over the SW Europe and NW Africa inland regions. The third mode shows a maximum in June and a minimum in October and prevails over the eastern part of central Europe. The main characteristics of these modes are attributed to the seasonal variation of: i) the temperature and humidity of the lower and the middle troposphere affecting static stability and ii) the intensity and the position of the main circulation systems affecting the region, as for example the Azores subtropical anticyclone and the Mediterranean depressions. The examination of inter-decadal changes in the seasonal variation of cloud cover in the above core regions reveals a long-term decrease of cloudiness during the 66-year period 1948-2014. A comparison with contemporary satellite MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface based European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA & D) station cloud cover data is carried out for the above core regions, evidencing a similarity among the data sets as to their seasonal variability, which supports the validity of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis cloud cover results.

TI  - Radiofrequency Ablation of Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, feasibility of RFA procedure and related safety and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) were examined. RFA in breast cancer is a safe and promising minimally invasive treatment for tumors <= 2 cm in diameter. Combination of ultrasound-guided RFA of breast cancer with concurrent sentinel lymph node biopsy could potentially become state-of-the-art breast-conservative therapy for early breast cancer.Purpose: To validate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of breast carcinomas. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted by the Breast Cancer Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy following approval from institutional review boards, and with the written informed consent of patients. A total of 386 patients with breast cancer treated with RFA at 10 institutions between July 2003 and June 2009 were identified and included in the analysis. Patients underwent a standard RFA procedure with ultrasound guidance and were followed up every 6 to 12 months. In this study, feasibility of RFA procedure and related safety and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) were examined. Fisher exact or chi(2) test evaluated associations between clinicopathological factors and IBTR, and local recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: RFA-related adverse events included local pain in 9 patients, skin burns in 15, and nipple retraction in 7. Patients were followed for a median of 50 months. IBTR was more frequently observed in patients with initial tumor sizes > 2 cm (3 of 30, 10%) than in those with initial tumors <= 2 cm (8 of 355, 2.3%; P = .015). IBTR-free rates 5 years after RFA were 97%, 94%, and 87% in patients with initial tumor sizes <= 1.0 cm, 1.1 to 2.0 cm, and > 2.0 cm, respectively. Conclusions: RFA in breast cancer is a safe and promising minimally invasive treatment for tumors <= 2 cm in diameter. Further studies are needed to optimize the technique and evaluate its future role as local therapy. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Land Change Detection and Effective Factors on Forest Land Use Changes: Application of Land Change Modeler and Multiple Linear Regression
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing forest covered areas and changing it to pasture, agricultural, urban and rural areas is performed every year and this causes great damages in natural resources in a wide range. In order to identify the effective factors on reducing the forest cover area, multiple regression was used from 1995 to 2015 in Mazandaran forests. A Multiple regressions can link the decline in forest cover (dependent variable) and its effective factors (independent variable) are well explained. In this study, Landsat TM data of 1995 and Landsat ETM+ data of 2015 were analyzed and classified in order to investigate the changes in the forest area. The images were classified in two classes of forest and non-forest areas and also forest map with spatial variables of physiography and human were analyzed by regression equation. Detection satellite images showed that during the studied period there was found a reduction of forest areas up to approximately 257331 ha. The results of regression analysis indicated that the linear combination of income per capita, rain and temperature with determined coefficient 0.4 as independent variables were capable of estimating the reduction of forest area. The results of this study can be used as an efficient tool to manage and improve forests regarding physiographical and human characteristics. Copyright (C) 2018 Jahanifar et al.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We explored the utilization of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for mapping of hydrothermal alteration zones. The region in and around the cities of Dungarpur and Udaipur of Rajasthan state in India was selected for this study. The rock types of Dungarpur and Udaipur are serpentinites, talc-carbonate, talc-schist, and quartzite of the Aravalli Supergroup. Hydrothermally altered zones and resultant hydrous minerals play an important role in the genesis of these rocks. We aimed to identify possible locations of hydrothermally altered zones in regional context around Dungarpur and Udaipur using Landsat-8 OLI data. False-color composite maps and band ratios were prepared from Landsat-8 bands. Band ratios such as band 6/band 7 (short-wave infrared 1 (SWIR1)/short wave infrared 2 (SWIR2)), band 4/band 3 (red/green), and band 5/band 6 (near infrared (NIR)/SWIR1) and visual interpretation techniques were used to identify the hydrothermally altered zones. Spectroscopic analyses of field rock samples were done to validate the hydrothermal alteration zones delineated from the analysis of Landsat-8 data. We present the combined results of Landsat-8 and field spectroradiometer analysis which brings out the hydrothermal alteration zones associated with hydrous minerals (antigorite, lizardite, montmorillonite, vermiculite, talc, and saponite). The study demonstrates the utility Landsat-8 OLI (with field spectroradiometer data) in the mapping of hydrothermally altered zones as a key in understanding geological processes.

TI  - GIS-based modelling of soil erosion processes using the modified-MMF (MMMF) model in a large watershed having vast agro-climatological differences
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study demonstrates a spatially distributed application of a field-scale annual soil loss model, the modified-MMF (MMMF), to a large watershed using hydrological routing techniques, remote sensing data and geospatial technologies. In this study, the MMMF model is implemented after incorporating the corrections suggested in recent literature along with appropriate modifications of the model to suit the agro-climatological conditions prevailing in most parts of India. Sensitivity analysis carried out through an Average Linear Sensitivity approach indicates that the model outputs are highly sensitive to soil moisture (MS), bulk density (BD), effective hydraulic depth (EHD), ground cover (GC) and settling velocity for clay (VSc). During calibration and validation, the performance evaluation statistics are mostly in the range of very good to satisfactory for both runoff and soil loss at the watershed outlet. Even spatial validation of the results of intermediate processes in the water phase and the sediment phase, although qualitative, seems to be reasonable and rational. Furthermore, the soil erosion severity analysis for different land-uses existing in the watershed indicates that about 90% of the watershed area, especially that occupied by agricultural lands, is vulnerable to the long-term effects of soil erosion.

TI  - What causes PM2.5 pollution? Cross-economy empirical analysis from socioeconomic perspective
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Is it true that, as the mainstream intuition asserts, urbanization and industrialization are the two main socioeconomic drivers of PM2.5? How do the two trends affect PM2.5 emission? This paper quantitatively analyzes the socioeconomic drivers of PM2.5 through assessment on Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STRIPAT), based on the panel data of 79 developing countries over 2001-2010. The average levels of PM2.5 pollution are calculated using remote sensing data, overcoming the difficulties that developing countries are in lack of PM2.5 monitors and that point data cannot reflect the overall level of PM2.5 pollution on a large scale. Squared terms of income and urbanization and their cross term are included in the regression models respectively to analyze the possible heterogeneous impacts on PM2.5 emissions in different development stages. The results show that income, urbanization and service sector have significant impact on PM2.5 pollution. Income has a positive effect on PM2.5 all the time but the effect decreases as the level of urbanization or income goes up. An inverted U relationship exists between urbanization and PM2.5, in which PM2.5 pollution positively correlates with a low level of income or urbanization but negatively at a high level. Policy recommendations from the perspective of macro-level social and economic regulation are provided for developing economies to reduce PM2.5 pollution.

TI  - Difference and Potential of the Upward and Downward Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence on Detecting Leaf Nitrogen Concentration in Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise detection of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is helpful for nutrient diagnosis and fertilization guidance in farm crops. Numerous researchers have estimated LNC with techniques based on reflectance spectra or active chlorophyll fluorescence, which have limitations of low accuracy or small scale in the field. Given the correlation between chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, the response of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to chlorophyll (Chl) content reported in a few papers suggests the feasibility of quantifying LNC using SIF. Few studies have investigated the difference and power of the upward and downward SIF components on monitoring LNC in winter wheat. We conducted two field experiments to evaluate the capacity of SIF to monitor the LNC of winter wheat during the entire growth season and compare the differences of the upward and downward SIF for LNC detection. A FluoWat leaf clip coupled with a ASD spectrometer was used to measure the upward and downward SIF under sunlight. It was found that three (FY687, FY687/FY739, and FY687/FY739) out of the six SIF yield (FY) indices examined were significantly correlated to the LNC (R-2 = 0.6, 0.51, 0.75, respectively). The downward SIF yield indices exhibited better performance than the upward FY indices in monitoring the LNC with the FY687/FY739 being the best FY index. Moreover, the LNC models based on the three SIF yield indices are insensitive to the chlorophyll content and the leaf mass per area (LMA). These findings suggest the downward SIF should not be neglected for monitoring crop LNC at the leaf scale, although it is more difficult to measure with current instruments. The downward SIF could play an increasingly important role in understanding of the SIF emission for LNC detection at different scales. These results could provide a solid foundation for elucidating the mechanism of SIF for LNC estimation at the canopy scale.

TI  - Examining impacts of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam construction on land-cover changes using multitemporal Landsat imagery
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many hydroelectric dams in the Brazilian Amazon have been constructed, but how dam construction influences land-cover change has not been fully examined. For our research, we selected Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, the third-largest dam in the world, to explore its impacts on major land-cover change. Multitemporal Landsat images between 2006 and 2017 were used. The maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify these Landsat images into primary forest, secondary forest, agropasture, man-made bare land, natural bare land, and water. The land-cover change was examined using the post-classification comparison approach based on different stages of dam construction, and was further examined along the upstream and downstream river buffer. The results indicate that overall classification accuracies of 89.7% and 92.3% were obtained for the 2011 and 2015 land-cover classification results, respectively. Primary forest decreased continuously from 47.8% in 2006 to 35.3% in 2017. Different stages of dam construction had various impacts, that is, before dam construction, deforestation and agropasture expansion were the major land-cover change categories; during dam construction, the increased area of man-made bare lands, the canal construction zone, and the increased area of natural bare lands downstream were obvious, in addition to deforestation and agropasture dynamics; when dam construction was complete, water bodies increased considerably upstream and decreased downstream. These big changes in water bodies may have long-term impacts on ecosystem functions and environments. This research provides new insights on the impacts of dam construction on land-cover changes, which is valuable for making better decisions about water and land resources.

TI  - The Transferability of Random Forest in Canopy Height Estimation from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height is an important forest structure parameter for understanding forest ecosystem and improving global carbon stock quantification accuracy. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide accurate canopy height measurements, but its application at large scales is limited. Using LiDAR-derived canopy height as ground truth to train the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and therefore predict canopy height from other remotely sensed datasets in areas without LiDAR coverage has been one of the most commonly used method in large-scale canopy height mapping. However, how variances in location, vegetation type, and spatial scale of study sites influence the RF modelling results is still a question that needs to be addressed. In this study, we selected 16 study sites (100 km(2) each) with full airborne LiDAR coverage across the United States, and used the LiDAR-derived canopy height along with optical imagery, topographic data, and climate surfaces to evaluate the transferability of the RF-based canopy height prediction method. The results show a series of findings from general to complex. The RF model trained at a certain location or vegetation type cannot be transferred to other locations or vegetation types. However, by training the RF algorithm using samples from all sites with various vegetation types, a universal model can be achieved for predicting canopy height at different locations and different vegetation types with self-predicted R-2 higher than 0.6 and RMSE lower than 6 m. Moreover, the influence of spatial scales on the RF prediction accuracy is noticeable when spatial extent of the study site is less than 50 km(2) or the spatial resolution of the training pixel is finer than 500 m. The canopy height prediction accuracy increases with the spatial extent and the targeted spatial resolution.

TI  - Optimizing Image Size of Convolutional Neural Networks for Producing Remote Sensing-based Thematic Map
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a methodology of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce thematic maps from remote sensing data. Optimizing the image size for CNNs was studied, since the size of the image affects to accuracy, working as hyper-parameter. The selected study area is Mt. Ung, located in Dangjin-si, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea, consisting of both coniferous forest and deciduous forest. Spatial structure analysis and the classification of forest type using CNNs was carried in the study area at a diverse range of scales. As a result of the spatial structure analysis, it was found that the local variance (LV) was high, in the range of 7.65 m to 18.87 m, meaning that the size of objects in the image is likely to be with in this range. As a result of the classification, the image measuring 15.81 m, belonging to the range with highest LV values, had the highest classification accuracy of 85.09%. Also, there was a positive correlation between LV and the accuracy in the range under 15.81 m, which was judged to be the optimal image size. Therefore, the trial and error selection of the optimum image size could be minimized by choosing the result of the spatial structure analysis as the starting point. This study estimated the optimal image size for CNNs using spatial structure analysis and found that this can be used to promote the application of deep-learning in remote sensing.

TI  - A Stepped Care Approach to Clinical Suicide Prevention
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the enormous humanitarian and economic toll of suicide, mental health systems of care are largely underprepared to work effectively with suicidal individuals and suicide is a leading "Sentinel Event" in U.S. health care settings (The Joint Commission, 2016). In response to these concerns, a recent policy initiative called "Zero Suicide" has advocated a systems-level response to the suicidal risk within health care and this policy initiative is yielding positive results (Hogan & Goldstein Grumet, 2016). Along these lines, a "stepped care" approach developed by Jobes (2016) has been adapted and used within the Zero Suicide curriculum as a model for systems-level care that is suicide-specific, evidence-based, least-restrictive, and cost-effective. The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is an example of one suicide-specific evidence-based clinical intervention that can be adapted and used across the full range of stepped care service settings (Jobes, 2016). This article describes various applications and uses of CAMS at all service levels and highlights CAMS-related innovations. It is argued that psychological services are uniquely poised to make a major difference in clinical suicide prevention through a systems-level approach using evidence-based care such as CAMS.

TI  - Grassland canopy cover and aboveground biomass in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia: Spatiotemporal estimates and controlling factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate and semiarid grasslands comprise 80% of the land area on the Mongolian Plateau and environs, which includes Mongolia (MG), and the province of Inner Mongolia (IM), China. Substantial land cover/use change in the last few decades, driven by a combination of post-liberalization socioeconomic changes and extreme climatic events, has degraded these water-limited grassland's structure and function. Hence, a precise estimation of canopy cover (CC, %) and aboveground biomass (AGB, g m(-2)) is needed. In this study, we analyzed > 1000 field observations with sampling during June, July and August (JJA) in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2016 in IM and 2010-2012 and 2014-2016 in MG. The field sampling was stratified by the dominant vegetation types on the plateau, including the meadow steppe, the typical steppe, and the desert steppe. Here we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived surface reflectance and vegetation indices optimized for low cover conditions to develop and test predictive models of CC and AGB using observed samples as training and validation data through rule-based regression tree models. We then used the predictive models to estimate spatially-explicit CC and AGB for the plateau over the last decade (2000-2016). Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of our predictive models in up-scaling ground observations to the regional scale across steppe types. Our results showed that model R-2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.74 (13.1%) and 0.62 (85.9 gm(-2)), respectively. The validation R-2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.67 (14.4%) and 0.68 (76.9 gm(-2)), respectively. The mean +/- SD for CC and AGB were 24.9 +/- 23.4% and 155.2 +/- 115.2 g m(-2), respectively. We also found that our scaled up estimates were significantly related to inter-annual climatic variability and anthropogenic drivers especially distance to urban/built-up areas and livestock density. In addition to their direct use in quantifying the spatiotemporal changes in the terrestrial carbon budget, results from these predictive models can help decision makers and rangeland managers plan sustainable livestock practices in the future.

TI  - Drivers of Landscape Changes in Coastal Ecosystems on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) is the largest delta in western North America and its productive coastal ecosystems support globally significant populations of breeding birds and a large indigenous population. To quantify past landscape changes as a guide to assessing future climate impacts to the YKD and how indigenous society may adapt to change, we photo-interpreted ecotypes at 600 points within 12 grids in a 2118 km(2) area along the central YKD coast using a time-series of air photos from 1948-1955 and 1980 and satellite images from 2007-2008 (IKONOS) and 2013-2016 (WorldView). We found that ecotype classes changed 16.2% (342 km(2)) overall during the similar to 62 years. Ecotypes changed 6.0% during 1953-1980, 7.2% during 1980-2007 and 3.8% during 2007-2015. Lowland Moist Birch-Ericaceous Low Scrub (-5.0%) and Coastal Saline Flat Barrens (-2.3%) showed the greatest decreases in area, while Lowland Water Sedge Meadow (+1.7%) and Lacustrine Marestail Marsh (+1.3%) showed the largest increases. Dominant processes affecting change were permafrost degradation (5.3%), channel erosion (3.0%), channel deposition (2.2%), vegetation colonization (2.3%) and lake drainage (1.5%), while sedimentation, water-level fluctuations, permafrost aggradation and shoreline paludification each affected <0.5% of the area. Rates of change increased dramatically in the late interval for permafrost degradation (from 0.06 to 0.26%/year) and vegetation colonization (from 0.03 to 0.16%/year), while there was a small decrease in channel deposition (from 0.05 to 0.0%/year) due largely to barren mudflats being colonized by vegetation. In contrast, rates of channel erosion remained fairly constant. The increased permafrost degradation coincided with increasing storm frequency and air temperatures. We attribute increased permafrost degradation and vegetation colonization during the recent interval mostly to the effects of a large storm in 2005, which caused extensive salt-kill of vegetation along the margins of permafrost plateaus and burial of vegetation on active tidal flats by mud that was later recolonized. Due to the combination of extremely flat terrain, sea-level rise, sea-ice reduction that facilitates more storm flooding and accelerating permafrost degradation, we believe the YKD is the most vulnerable region in the Arctic to climate warming.

TI  - Seasonal Trends in Surface pCO<sub>2</sub> and Air-Sea CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, From VIIRS Ocean Color
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries have been recognized as important sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere; however, contributions of these systems to regional and global carbon budgets are not well constrained due to limited information on seasonal and spatial variability. In this study, we use satellite remote sensing to obtain seasonal pCO(2) distribution and air-sea CO2 fluxes in Apalachicola Bay, a national estuarine research reserve located in the northern Gulf of Mexico that receives seasonally varying dissolved organic matter-rich waters from the Apalachicola River. A combination of time series (2005-2016) and seasonal field observations (2015-2016) of pH and biophysical variables were used to develop seasonal pH-pCO(2) relationships for obtaining surface pCO(2) estimates and air-sea CO2 fluxes from Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ocean color data. Monthly and seasonal maps of pCO(2) and air-sea CO2 fluxes showed a general trend of higher fluxes in winter and summer corresponding to high river flow and warm water temperatures. However, CO2 fixation via photosynthesis and low water temperatures contributed to lower fluxes to the atmosphere in spring and fall, respectively. Throughout the study period, Apalachicola Bay was a net source of CO2 with large seasonal and spatial variability and a mean annual CO2 flux to the atmosphere of 3.4 +/- 3.1 mol.m(-2).year(-1) (9.4 +/- 8.5 mmol.m(-2).day(-1)), consistent with fluxes reported for other estuaries. This study demonstrates the critical role that satellite observations can play to improve the estuarine contributions to the global carbon flux estimates. Plain Language Summary Despite having high productivity, coastal water bodies are known to emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Our study demonstrates the use of an ocean color satellite to estimate seasonal and annual rates of CO2 release to the atmosphere in Apalachicola Bay, Florida (United States). Due to a lack of carbon dioxide measurements in Apalachicola Bay, we adopted a different approach with advanced statistical techniques to estimate CO2 concentrations from water acidity (pH). Our study shows that Apalachicola Bay is a net source of CO2 throughout the year; however, the rate of CO2 emission varies among months and seasons, and even in different regions within the bay-likely due to the dominance of one or more controlling processes. The estimated rate of emission in Apalachicola Bay indicates that it is a weak source of CO2, which has an annual CO2 emission rate similar to 95% lower than an average value for the subtropical estuaries around the world. This study also suggests that accurate CO2 flux estimates for Apalachicola Bay and other estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico fill an important gap in current global carbon emission estimates.

TI  - Assessment of the water cycle impact by the Budyko curve on watershed hydrology using SWAT and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations derived from Terra MODIS GPP
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions from human activities continue to alter the climate and are likely to have significant impacts on watershed hydrological cycles and stream water quality. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate how CO2 impacts the hydrology of a watershed. The goal of this study is to evaluate how potential CO2 changes would impact the hydrologic components in the forest-dominant Seolma-cheon watershed (8.48 km(2)) in South Korea. Using an image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra, the CO2 flux was estimated as the sum of the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (Rec) following the method of Lloyd and Taylor (1994). To assess the water cycle impact, the SWAT results for certain hydrological components, such as total runoff (TQ), surface runoff (SQ), lateral runoff (LQ), soil water content (SW) and evapotranspiration (ET), were analysed to generate Budyko curves. In the field of watershed management, SWAT modelling using CO2 concentrations as an additional parameter provides a better understanding of the role of ET and soil moisture in ongoing and future climate changes.

TI  - Land cover classification analysis of volcanic island in Aleutian Arc using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) from Landsat imagery
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) mapping is an important research topic with many applications in remote sensing. Especially, for volcanic areas where direct field access is difficult, remote sensing data are needed to map LC. Volcanic areas are attractive targets for LC mapping because any spread of volcanic eruptions must be monitored. When creating LC maps, it is important to minimize errors because such errors compromise analyses using these maps. Here, we analyzed multispectral data from Mount Kanaga, Mount Fourpeaked, Mount Pavlof, and Mount Augustine using two different classifiers, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). To this end, we employed Landsat 8 imagery, which features four LC classes: outcrops (pyroclastic deposits, volcanic rock, sand, etc.), vegetation, water bodies, and snow. We found that the SVM was more accurate than the ANN. For Mount Kanaga, the SVM afforded the best classification accuracy (98.08%), 9.14% better than the ANN (88.94%); for the other volcanoes, the accuracy of the two methods did not differ significantly. Overall, both classifiers accurately distinguished products of volcanic eruption (outcrops) from other LC. Thus, both the ANN and SVM can be used for LC classification.

TI  - Fire in sub-Saharan Africa: The fuel, cure and connectivity hypothesis
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Past analyses of satellite-based fire activity in tropical savannas support the intermediate fire-productivity hypothesis (IFP), which posits a close correlation with estimates of total net primary productivity in drier savannas and declines towards the extremes. However, these analyses ignore the distinct roles played by herbaceous and woody vegetation in fire ignition and spread. We hypothesize that, as herbaceous vegetation provides the primary fuel, fire activity in African savannas is asymptotically correlated with herbaceous production. Conversely, woody production affects fires indirectly through effects on herbaceous production and its connectivity. In contrast to the IFP, we propose the fuel, cure and connectivity (FCC) conceptual model for tropical fire activity. The FCC model makes explicit the distinct role of herbaceous and woody fuels, avoiding the confounding interpretation of the role of total production, while providing opportunities to quantify fuel curability, effects of trees on herbaceous fuel growth and connectivity, and human management.Location: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).Time period: 2003-2015.Major taxa studied: Woody and herbaceous vegetation.Methods: We used boosted regression tree analysis to test competing models explaining fire activity: (a) aggregate fuel loads; and (b) partitioned woody and herbaceous fuel loads; both derived from MODIS leaf area index.Results: Herbaceous fuel load was consistently most influential, providing more explanatory power than overall biomass in fire activity. Fuel curability rated second, then human population density (HPD), and woody biomass was least important. We observed an asymptotic relationship between herbaceous fuel load and fire activity consistent with the FCC model; trees promote fires at low densites but suppress fires at higher densities; fires were rare in wetter regions, emphasizing the need for fuel to cure; and fires were concentrated in areas of low human population, underscoring the crucial role of land management.Conclusions: The proposed FCC framework provides a more nuanced understanding of fire activity in tropical ecosystems, where herbaceous biomass is the key determinant of fire activity.

TI  - A Cloud Removal Algorithm to Generate Cloud and Cloud Shadow Free Images Using Information Cloning
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main problems of optical remote sensing is clouds and cloud shadows caused by specific atmospheric conditions during data acquisition. These features limit the usage of acquired images and increase the difficulty in data analysis, such as normalized difference vegetation index values, misclassification, and atmospheric correction. Accurate detection and reliable cloning of cloud and cloud shadow features in satellite images are very useful processes for optical remote sensing applications. In this study, an automated cloud removal algorithm to generate cloud and cloud shadow free images from multitemporal Landsat-8 images is introduced. Cloud and cloud shadow areas are classified by using process-based rule set developed by using spectral and spatial features after applying simple linear iterative clustering superpixel segmentation algorithm to the image to find cloud pixel groups easily and correctly. Segmentation-based cloud detection method gives better results than pixel-based for detection of cloud and cloud shadow patches. After detection of clouds and cloud shadows, cloud-free images are created by cloning cloudless regions from multitemporal dataset. Spectral and structural consistency are preserved by considering spectral features and seasonal effects while cloning process. Statistical similarity tests are applied to find best cloud-free image to use for cloning process. Cloning results are tested with the structural similarity index metric to evaluate the performance of cloning algorithm.

TI  - Characteristics of recurrent fractures
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study, drawn from a sample of the Icelandic population, quantified high immediate risk and utility loss of subsequent fracture after a sentinel fracture (at the hip, spine, distal forearm and humerus) that attenuated with time.The risk of a subsequent osteoporotic fracture is particularly acute immediately after an index fracture and wanes progressively with time. The aim of this study was to quantify the risk and utility consequences of subsequent fracture after a sentinel fracture (at the hip, spine, distal forearm and humerus) with an emphasis on the time course of recurrent fracture.The Reykjavik Study fracture registration, drawn from a sample of the Icelandic population (n = 18,872), recorded all fractures of the participants from their entry into the study until December 31, 2012. Medical records for the participants were manually examined and verified. First sentinel fractures were identified. Subsequent fractures, deaths, 10-year probability of fracture and cumulative disutility using multipliers derived from the International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic fractures Study (ICUROS) were examined as a function of time after fracture, age and sex.Over 10 years, subsequent fractures were sustained in 28% of 1498 individuals with a sentinel hip fracture. For other sentinel fractures, the proportion ranged from 35 to 38%. After each sentinel fracture, the risk of subsequent fracture was highest in the immediate post fracture interval and decreased markedly with time. Thus, amongst individuals who sustained a recurrent fracture, 31-45% did so within 1 year of the sentinel fracture. Hazard ratios for fracture recurrence (population relative risks) were accordingly highest immediately after the sentinel fracture (2.6-5.3, depending on the site of fracture) and fell progressively over 10 years (1.5-2.2). Population relative risks also decreased progressively with age. The utility loss during the first 10 years after a sentinel fracture varied by age (less with age) and sex (greater in women). In women at the age of 70 years, the mean utility loss due to fractures in the whole cohort was 0.081 whereas this was 12-fold greater in women with a sentinel hip fracture, and was increased 15-fold for spine fracture, 4-fold for forearm fracture and 8-fold for humeral fracture.High fracture risks and utility loss immediately after fracture suggest that treatment given as soon as possible after fracture would avoid a higher number of new fractures compared with treatment given later. This provides the rationale for very early intervention immediately after a sentinel fracture.

TI  - Detailed Land Cover Mapping from Multitemporal Landsat-8 Data of Different Cloud Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed, accurate and frequent land cover mapping is a prerequisite for several important geospatial applications and the fulfilment of current sustainable development goals. This paper introduces a methodology for the classification of annual high-resolution satellite data into several detailed land cover classes. In particular, a nomenclature with 27 different classes was introduced based on CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 categories and further analysing various crop types. Without employing cloud masks and/or interpolation procedures, we formed experimental datasets of Landsat-8 (L8) images with gradually increased cloud cover in order to assess the influence of cloud presence on the reference data and the resulting classification accuracy. The performance of shallow kernel-based and deep patch-based machine learning classification frameworks was evaluated. Quantitatively, the resulting overall accuracy rates differed within a range of less than 3%; however, maps produced based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) were more accurate across class boundaries and the respective framework was less computationally expensive compared to the applied patch-based deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Further experimental results and analysis indicated that employing all multitemporal images with up to 30% cloud cover delivered relatively higher overall accuracy rates as well as the highest per-class accuracy rates. Moreover, by selecting 70% of the top-ranked features after applying a feature selection strategy, slightly higher accuracy rates were achieved. A detailed discussion of the quantitative and qualitative evaluation outcomes further elaborates on the performance of all considered classes and highlights different aspects of their spectral behaviour and separability.

TI  - Building Damage Characterization for the 2016 Amatrice Earthquake Using Ascending-Descending COSMO-SkyMed Data and Topographic Position Index
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The August 24, 2016, M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake in central Italy was one of the most destructive earthquakes in recent years, and it caused considerable human losses. The goal of this study is to distinguish between collapsed and standing buildings in the town of Amatrice using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired from the COSMO-SkyMed satellite. Data from both ascending and descending orbits in single HH polarization were evaluated separately. Two main representative change indices, SAR intensity (SI) and SAR coherence, were combined using multitemporal discriminant and fuzzy analyses. To enhance the contribution of SI in the discriminant analysis, the aggregate analysis, in a raster-based environment for each intensity dataset, was taken into account. By integrating the ascending and descending datasets, two models based on discriminant analysis and fuzzy logic were created, and different damage proxy maps (DPM) for the region were presented. The accuracy comparison of single-path discriminant analysis and the new integrated models indicates improvement, which implies that the combination of west-to-east and east-towest observations can reduce some limitations of SAR imagery (e.g., shapes of roofs, shadows) on building classification. In addition, topographic position index (TPI) analysis was conducted as a spatial-based scale-dependent approach, and it revealed more aspects of possible damage in the town. The results of DPM and TPI indicate that 55% of the collapsed buildings are located in valleys, which may have caused seismic wave amplification in this region.

TI  - Sequential SAR Coherence Method for the Monitoring of Buildings in Sarpole-Zahab, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used fifty-six synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the Sentinel-1 C-band satellite with a regular period of 12 days (except for one image) to produce sequential phase correlation (sequential coherence) maps for the town of Sarpole-Zahab in western Iran, which experienced a magnitude 7.3 earthquake on 12 November 2017. The preseismic condition of the buildings in the town was assessed based on a long sequential SAR coherence (LSSC) method, in which we considered 55 of the 56 images to produce a coherence decay model with climatic and temporal parameters. The coseismic condition of the buildings was assessed with 3 later images and normalized RGB visualization using the short sequential SAR coherence (SSSC) method. Discriminant analysis between the completely collapsed and uncollapsed buildings was also performed for approximately 700 randomly selected buildings (for each category) by considering the heights of the buildings and the SSSC results. Finally, the area and volume of debris were calculated based on a fusion of a discriminant map and a 3D vector map of the town.

TI  - Profiling Atheist World Views in Different Cultural Contexts: Developmental Trajectories and Accounts
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study, we look at atheist or secular identities in different religious landscapes: In the U.S., the majority of the population indicates a belief in God. In West Germany, one third of the population reports no religious affiliation and a quarter identifies as "not religious," and in East Germany most of the population explicitly identifies as atheist. Drawing on atheist worldview and identity literature from multiple disciplines, and using quantitative and qualitative data obtained in the U.S. and Germany during the "Bielefeld-based Cross-Cultural Study on the Semantics and Psychology of Spirituality," we examine self-identified atheists. First, self-identified atheist participants are portrayed quantitatively based on constructs expected to highlight differences between atheists and other "nones" and religious or spiritual persons: openness, a personality trait (NEO-FFI) documented to be higher in nonbelievers, positive relations a dimension of eudaimonic well-being as indicator of social integration, generativity, concern for the welfare of future generations, and experiences of transcendence or "mysticism." Second, four case studies are presented that illustrate the wide range of distinct atheist beliefs, biographical experiences and ideological positions by examining individuals' subjective definitions of "religion" and "spirituality" and personal interviews. The semistructured Faith Development Interview (FDI; Fowler, 1981) examines vettical and horizontal transcendence. By drawing on examples from our interviews, we show different descriptions of one's atheist worldview or "faith" in autobiographical remembering and reasoning. Thus we work from a nomothetic toward an idiographic comparative perspective.

TI  - Mapping Snow Depth Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite Images: Application to the Republic of Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we derive i) a function to estimate snow cover fraction (SCF) from a MODIS satellite image that has a wide observational area and short re-visit period and a function to determine snow depth from the estimated SCF map. The SCF equation is important for estimating the snow depth from optical images. The proposed SCF equation is defined using the Gaussian function. We found that the Gaussian function was a better model than the linear equation for explaining the relationship between the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and SCF. An accuracy test was performed using 38 MODIS images, and the achieved root mean square error (RMSE) was improved by approximately 7.7 % compared to that of the linear equation. After the SCF maps were created using the SCF equation from the MODIS images, a relation function between in-situ snow depth and MODIS-derived SCF was defined. The RMSE of the MODIS-derived snow depth was approximately 3.55 cm when compared to the in-situ data. This is a somewhat large error range in the Republic of Korea, which generally has less than 10 cm of snowfall. Therefore, in this study, we corrected the calculated snow depth using the relationship between the measured and calculated values for each single image unit. The corrected snow depth was finally recorded and had an RMSE of approximately 2.98 cm, which was an improvement. In future, the accuracy of the algorithm can be improved by considering more varied variables at the same time.

TI  - Seasonal and Look-directional Variation of X-band SAR Sigma Nought in Mongolian Land Surface
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents TerraSAR-X and KOMPSAT-5 sigma nought variation according to season and antenna observation configuration in Mongolia. Two types of landcover including bare surface and cropland were examined. The seasonal variation of sigma nought in cropland was about 7 dB and particularly a significant sigma nought reduction occurred after harvest. On the contrary, the Mongolia bare surface provides a consistent sigma nought values for several years with an annual variation less than 2.5 dB of standard deviation. However, the bare soil was relatively sensitive to look-direction (or ascending or descending mode) as well as incidence angle while the cropland was almost independent of antenna look-direction and small incidence angle changes. Although the look-directional variation of bare surface sigma nought was observed in this study, the look-direction anisotropic nature of the surface was not well examined. A further study would be required to account for this feature with various SAR observation configurations.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging with lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node biopsy in head and neck melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Head and neck melanoma is associated with a high false negative (FN) sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) rate. If techniques are developed that can decrease FN SLNBs, better prognostic information will be obtained, and it may be possible to improve overall survival as patients are assigned to the appropriate adjuvant management. Our group previously demonstrated that the combination of lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-based technology was feasible for SLNB in primary melanoma.Methods: Consecutive head and neck cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and ICG-based fluorescence imaging by the senior author (B.G.) from 2012 to 2015 were prospectively enrolled for analysis. Patients were followed postoperatively by the multidisciplinary melanoma team. Main outcome variables were FN rate of SLNB. Length of follow-up was date of surgery to the date of last follow-up/death.Results: There were 10 positive SLNBs, 51 true negative SLNBs, and one FN SLNB. False negative rate was 9.1%, false negative incidence was 1.6%, sensitivity was 91%, and specificity was 100%. Mean follow-up was 27.6, 17.6, and 16.5 mo for true negative, true positive, and FN patients, respectively.Conclusions: We report the largest cohort of patients with head and neck cutaneous melanoma undergoing SLNB using both a combination of radioactive tracer, gamma probe, and ICG-based fluorescence identification. Our results demonstrate that using concomitant gamma probe-based radioactivity detection and ICG-based fluorescence for SLN identification in head and neck melanoma is reliable, reproducible and, thus far, has produced a low rate of FN SLNB.

Summarize the changes to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Eighth Edition Melanoma Staging System. 2. List advances in genetic, molecular, and histopathologic melanoma diagnosis and prognostication. 3. Recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy and appropriate surgical margins based on individualized patient needs. 4. Recognize the currently available treatments for in-transit metastasis and advanced melanoma. 5. Describe current and future therapies for melanoma with distant visceral or brain metastases.Summary: Strides in melanoma surveillance, detection, and treatment continue to be made. The American Joint Committee on Cancer Eighth Edition Cancer Staging System has improved risk stratification of patients, introduced new staging categories, and resulted in stage migration of patients with improved outcomes. This review summarizes melanoma advances of the recent years with an emphasis on the surgical advances, including techniques and utility of sentinel node biopsy, controversies in melanoma margin selection, and the survival impact of time-to-treatment metrics. Once a disease manageable only with surgery, a therapeutic paradigm shift has given a more promising outlook to melanoma patients at any stage. Indeed, a myriad of novel, survival-improving immunotherapies have been introduced for metastatic melanoma and more recently in the high-risk adjuvant setting.

M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of selected pharmaceuticals to act as nontraditional endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment has been poorly documented. The widely prescribed antidiabetic metformin has the potential to accumulate and persist in water bodies, with unknown consequences for aquatic biota. This study reports the biological responses of a sentinel organism, common mussel Mytilus edulis, exposed to concentrations of metformin commonly found in the aquatic environment, coupled with heat stress. The results indicate that metformin has the potential to increase the vitellogenin mRNA expression, to inflict severe pathologies of the gonad and to destabilize the lysosomal membrane in the hemocytes. Overall, this article suggests that metformin should be considered an emerging contaminant of concern and further research should focus on its mechanisms of action.

TI  - Understanding Land Surface Temperature Differences of Local Climate Zones Based on Airborne Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zones (LCZ) scheme has attracted the interest of climate researchers as it enables the standardized study of urban heat islands by combining thermal and physical parameters of built and natural structures. Most recent work on LCZ has concentrated on understanding air temperature differences, adapting the scheme to different contexts and improving satellite-based classification methods. However, studies using very high-resolution imagery, including 3-D descriptors and analyzing their land surface temperature (LST) variability are scarcer. Since a correct delineation of LCZ implies significant temperature differences among classes, the aims of this study are 1) to test a GIS-based method for the classification of LCZ based on cut-off values valid to the Australian context; and 2) to examine the quality of classifications by analyzing the LST variability among LCZ using high-resolution airborne remote sensing data. Results show that diurnal and nocturnal mean LSTs significantly differ among most LCZs. Welch's ANOVA and subsequent post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that these differences prevail for 71.8% of zones during the daytime and 73.6% of zones at night. Overall, LCZs A, 8, and 3 are the most distinguishable zones during the daytime and LCZs D, G, 1, 4, and 5 are well differentiated at night. In contrast, LCZs 1 and 4 are the least distinguishable at daytime and LCZs 10, A, and E are not well differentiated at night. The present study has successfully validated the present airborne-based classification method which is contingent on further accuracy assessment and improvements.

TI  - Regional Scale Mapping of Grassland Mowing Frequency with Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland use intensity is a topic of growing interest worldwide, as grasslands are integral in supporting biodiversity, food production, and regulating of the global carbon cycle. Data available for characterizing grasslands management are largely descriptive and collected from laborious field campaigns or questionnaires. The recent launch of the Sentinel-2 earth monitoring constellation provides new possibilities for high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data covering large areas. This study aims to evaluate the potential of a time series of Sentinel-2 data for mapping of mowing frequency in the region of Canton Aargau, Switzerland. We tested two cloud masking processes and three spatial mapping units (pixels, parcel polygons and shrunken parcel polygons), and investigated how missing data influence the ability to accurately detect and map grassland management activity. We found that more than 40% of the study area was mown before 15 June, while the remaining part was either mown later, or was not mown at all. The highest accuracy for detection of mowing events was achieved using additional clouds masking and size reduction of parcels, which allowed correct detection of 77% of mowing events. Additionally, we found that using only standard cloud masking leads to significant overestimation of mowing events, and that the detection based on sparse time series does not fully correspond to key events in the grass growth season.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an effort to adapt the general principles, methodological tools, and equations of a widely used Mediterranean desertification and land use approach (MEDALUS approach) in order to detect environmental sensitive areas susceptible for land degradation in Cyprus. For this scope, different remote sensed data and products (Landsat multispectral imagery and ASTER Digital Elevation Model) were used as well as demographic information, taken from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. Four quality indices were calculated (Climate Quality Index, Demographic Index, Soil Quality Index, and Vegetation Quality Index) and combined in order to provide at final stage, the Environmental Sensitivity Area Index (ESAI) with which the environmental status is described. The use of remote sensed data of 30-m spatial resolution and the calculation of different indices to extract the environmental stress at regional scale can be considered as innovative characteristics of this study. According to this ESAI, it was found that 9.68% of the Cyprus Island is at environmental risk, strictly related to the land degradation potential. The spatial distribution of the ESAI values shows that the environmental risk is most significant in Paphos district and Limassol, following the Larnaca and the Famagusta districts. Nicosia and Kyrenia districts are found slightly less problematic. In addition, large parts of Troodos Mountain (especially in its low altitudes), which is one of the most vegetated areas of the Island, seem to be at notable environmental stress.

TI  - HPV infection and breast cancer. Results of a microarray approach
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives:: Human papilloma virus (HPV) has been implicated in several types of epithelial cancer. The role of HPV in breast carcinogenesis has been a matter of debate fueled by conflicting reports in recent years. The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of breast and cervical HPV infection in cancer patients by using a modern microarray approach.Materials and methods:: In the present prospective study, 201 breast cancer patients were included. For each patient a detailed medical history was taken and during the operation, under sterile conditions, samples were collected, from the tumour, the healthy adjacent breast tissue and any positive sentinel lymph nodes. In addition, for each patient a cervical sample was also collected. All samples were analysed for DNA of 24 types of HPV using a microarray technique.Results:: Despite the high sensitivity of the technique used, no HPV DNA was identified in any of the breast or lymph node samples. Our analysis showed that patients with HPV positive cervical samples (28 cases) were more likely to have tumors with positive progesterone receptors (p=0.041) and were also more likely to have two or three positive lymph nodes (p=0.002).Conclusion:: In the present study, a combination of careful sample collection and a very sensitive microarray approach showed no correlation between HPV and breast cancer. However some characteristics of the breast tumors were different among patients with HPV DNA in their cervical samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Subsidence Due to Groundwater Withdrawal in Kathmandu Basin Detected by Time-series PS-InSAR Analysis
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, subsidence due to excessive groundwater withdrawal is a major problem in the Kathmandu Basin. In addition, on 25 April 2015, the basin experienced large crustal displacements caused by Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. In this study, we applied StaMPS- Persistent Scatterer InSAR (StaMPS PS-InSAR) technique to estimate the spatio-temporal displacements in the basin after the mainshock. 34 Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data are used for measuring subsidence velocity during 2015-2017. We found the maximum subsidence velocity of about 9.02 cm/year and mean subsidence rate of about 8.06 cm/year in the line of sight direction, respectively, in the central part of the basin.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth variability over the Arabian Peninsula as inferred from satellite measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol abundance from widespread deserts over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) plays an important role in the regional climate and air quality. This study investigates the spatio-temporal variability of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) ranging from seasonal to inter-annual time scales during the period 2003-2016 using satellite retrievals from MISR and MODIS, together with ground-based observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) available during the period 2003-2012 over the AP. The MODIS AOD (MISR AOD) observations exhibit 0.81 and 0.85 (0.71 and 0.76) correlations with ground-based observations during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The correlations were also found to be significant with respect to the surface monitoring station at Solar village in Saudi Arabia. Our observational analysis reveals higher (lower) concentrations of AOD during dry (wet) seasons over the AP. The observed AODs indicate similar spatial distributions over annual and seasonal time scales, with high AODs over the Southern Red sea (SR), and the Northeast AP, and lower AODs over the central and southern end of the AP. It is also observed that the AOD exhibits year-to-year variations over different subregions of the AP. Analyses of the inter-annual variability over the AP reveals a significant relationship between the AOD and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the summertime. Furthermore, positive AOD anomalies over the AP can be closely linked with the intensification of the westerly jet at the Tokar Gap during La Nina phases. Enhanced monsoon associated heat low over the AP during La Nina phases further favors greater uplift and saltation of dust from desert regions.

TI  - Impact of land cover change on land surface temperature: A case study of Spiti Valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is the skin temperature of the earth surface. LST depends on the amount of sunlight received by any geographical area. Apart from sun light, LST is also affected by the land cover, which leads to change in land surface temperature. Impact of land cover change (LCC) on LST has been assessed using Landsat TM 5, Landsat 8 TIRS/OLI and Digital Elevation Model (ASTER) for Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh, India. In the present study, Spiti valley was divided into three altitudinal zones to check the pattern of changing land cover along different altitudes and LST was calculated for all the four land cover categories extracted from remote sensing data for the years of 1990 and 2015. Matrix table was used as a technique to evaluate the land cover change between two different years. Matrix table shows that as a whole, about 2,151,647 ha (30%) area of Spiti valley experienced change in land cover in the last 25 years. The result also shows vegetation and water bodies increased by 107,560.2 ha (605.87%) and 45 ha (0.98%), respectively. Snow cover and barren land decreased by 19,016.5 ha (23.92%) and 88,589 (14.14%), during the study period. A significant increase has been noticed in vegetation amongst all land cover types. Minimum, maximum and mean LST for three altitudinal zones have been calculated. The mean LST recorded was 11A degrees C in 1990 but it rose by 2A degrees C and reached to 13A degrees C in 2015. Changes in LST were obtained for each land cover categories. The mean temperature of different land cover types was calculated by averaging value of all pixels of a given land cover types. The mean LST of vegetation, barren land, snow cover and water body increased by 6A degrees C, 9A degrees C, 1A degrees C, and 7A degrees C, respectively. Further, relationships between LST, Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were established using Linear Regression.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OF MODERNISM IN THE POETRY OF IGOR SEVERYANIN
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to analyze the transformation of symbolism poetics into post-symbolist avant-garde poetics. Philosophical and religious discourse was one of the specific features of Russian symbolism; it reflected the spiritual quest of the era. The aspiration to comprehend the transcendent led to the creation of a special style within the literary language of the epoch. The characteristic verbal formulas of this style, repeating themselves from text to text, eventually formed a modem philosophical and religious discourse: a special way of writing and speaking about God, religious and philosophical problems. Its basic word concepts were: God and the Devil, Christ and Antichrist, Father and Son, the Cross, Calvary, the Spirit and the Flesh, the transcendental Genesis, the Apocalypse and the Kingdom of God on earth, Sophia, the Wisdom of God, the God-Man and the Man-God, etc. Despite the seriousness of the problem, such poetry and prose became the object of reflection, reinterpretation and parody in the 1900s. The material of the study is the works of Konstantin Balmont and Igor Severyanin, which reflected the philosophical and religious discourse of the era. Excerpts from the works of D. Merezhkovsky, A. Bely, Vyach. Ivanov, A. Izmailov, E. Viensky are also used for comparison. Methods of research are comparative, typological and historical-cultural analysis, and the theory of parody. The study revealed that Balmont's poem "Dalyokim blizkim" [To Distant Close Ones] (1903) is one of the first attempts to reflect on the philosophical and religious discourse of symbolism. His key concepts (Christ, the Antichrist, the Devil, God) are objectified; they acquire an ironic touch, but do not lose their meaning. In Severyanin's "Shampanskiy polonez" [Champagne Polonaise], the binary straightforward thinking and addiction to antitheses are shown, which are specific features, for example, for Merezhkovsky's novel trilogy Christ and Antichrist. In "Poeza ne dlya pechati" [Poesa not for Publication], the irony and the stylistic game with language stamps are enhanced. They appear in new stylistic contexts, lose meaning, form absurd combinations. Severyanin's "Konechnoe nicho" [The Final Nothing] (1918) sums up the philosophical and religious searches of the era, listing their figurative-ideological and lexical arsenal. The tangible focus on the "second plan", someone else's style, and ironic coloring allow classifying Severyanin's poems as parodies in their mechanism. The main conclusion of the article is that Severyanin distances himself from the legacy of symbolism, discredits it by travesty, exaggeration, hyperbole, grotesque and alogism, and, at the same time, uses its linguistic material to create poetry of a new type. Thus, symbolism as an artistic method and worldview is overcome. In return, a different world-view, aimed only at earthly existence, and the parodying game stylistics of a literary text are approved.

TI  - Monitoring Coastal Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Coastal Areas Using Machine Learning Models
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms have negatively affected the aquaculture industry and aquatic ecosystems globally. Remote sensing using satellite sensor systems has been applied on large spatial scales with high temporal resolutions for effective monitoring of harmful algal blooms in coastal waters. However, oceanic color satellites have limitations, such as low spatial resolution of sensor systems and the optical complexity of coastal waters. In this study, bands 1 to 4, obtained from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager satellite images, were used to evaluate the performance of empirical ocean chlorophyll algorithms using machine learning techniques. Artificial neural network and support vector machine techniques were used to develop an optimal chlorophyll-a model. Four-band, four-band-ratio, and mixed reflectance datasets were tested to select the appropriate input dataset for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration using the two machine learning models. While the ocean chlorophyll algorithm application on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager showed relatively low performance, the machine learning methods showed improved performance during both the training and validation steps. The artificial neural network and support vector machine demonstrated a similar level of prediction accuracy. Overall, the support vector machine showed slightly superior performance to that of the artificial neural network during the validation step. This study provides practical information about effective monitoring systems for coastal algal blooms.

TI  - Assessing Performance of the RST<sub>VOLC</sub> Multi-Temporal Algorithm in Detecting Subtle Hot Spots at Oldoinyo Lengai (Tanzania, Africa) for Comparison with MODLEN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of subtle thermal anomalies (i.e., of low-temperature and/or spatial extent) at volcanoes by satellite is of great interest for scientists, especially because minor changes in surface temperature might reveal an unrest phase or impending activity. A good test case for assessing the sensitivity level of satellite-based methods is to study the thermal activity of Oldoinyo Lengai (OL) (Africa, Tanzania), which is the only volcano on Earth emitting natrocarbonatite lavas at a lower temperature (i.e., in the range 500-600 degrees C) than usual magmatic surfaces. In this work, we assess the potential of the RSTVOLC multi-temporal algorithm in detecting subtle hot spots at OL for comparison with MODLEN: A thermal anomaly detection method tailored to OL local conditions, by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Our results investigating the eruptive events of 2000-2008 using RSTVOLC reveal the occurrence of several undocumented thermal activities of OL, and may successfully integrate MODLEN observations. In spite of some known limitations strongly affecting the identification of volcanic thermal anomalies from space (e.g., cloud cover; occurrence of short-lived events), this work demonstrates that RSTVOLC may provide a very important contribution for monitoring the OL, identifying subtle hot spots showing values of the radiant flux even around 1 MW.

TI  - Intraoperative frozen section sentinel lymph node assessment in breast cancer: A tertiary institution experience
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Intraoperative frozen section lymph node assessment helps to predict axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. However, the accuracy of this frozen section analysis may vary among institutions. This study describes our institution's experience in intraoperative analysis of sentinel lymph node and aims to determine the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of our assessment. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the histopathological material and data from 82 breast cancer patients diagnosed over a period of four years who underwent intraoperative frozen section evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes. Results: Frozen section analysis detected metastasis in 13 out of 82 cases and definitive pathological examination on the paraffin section confirmed these positive findings. There was no false positive case (specificity of 100%). The true positive cases comprised seven macrometastases, five micrometastases and one isolated tumour cells. Sampling error was noted in two cases in which the malignant cells were only present in the deeper final paraffin sections (false negative rate of 13.3%). The test sensitivity was 86.7% and the accuracy rate was 97.5%. These findings are comparable to other published data. Conclusion: Intraoperative frozen section analysis is a safe and reliable method for assessment of sentinel lymph node. Knowledge on limitation of frozen section analysis with diligent evaluation of frozen section specimen will be beneficial in reducing interpretation error.

TI  - Chlamydia Prevalence Trends Among Women and Men Entering the National Job Training Program From 1990 Through 2012
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Evaluating chlamydia prevalence trends from sentinel surveillance is important for understanding population disease burden over time. However, prevalence trend estimates from surveillance data may be misleading if they do not account for changes in risk profiles of individuals who are screened (case mix) and changing performance of the screening tests used.Methods We analyzed chlamydia screening data from a sentinel surveillance population of 389,555 young women (1990-2012) and 303,699 young men (2003-2012) entering the US National Job Training Program. This period follows the introduction of national chlamydia screening programs designed to prevent transmission and reduce population disease burden. After ruling out bias due to case mix, we used an expectation-maximization-based maximum likelihood approach to account for measurement error from changing screening tests, and generated minimally biased long-term chlamydia prevalence trend estimates among youth and young adults in this sentinel surveillance population.Results Adjusted chlamydia prevalence among women was high throughout the study period, but fell from 20% in 1990 to 12% in 2003, and remained between 12% and 14% through 2012. Adjusted prevalence among men was steady throughout the study period at approximately 7%. For both women and men, adjusted prevalence was highest among Black and American Indian youth and young adults, and in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the United States throughout the study period.Conclusions Our minimally biased trend estimates provide support for an initial decrease in chlamydia prevalence among women soon after the introduction of national chlamydia screening programs. Constant chlamydia prevalence in more recent years suggests that screening may not be sufficient to further reduce chlamydia prevalence among high-risk youth and young adults.

TI  - Is South Korea Leaning Toward China? Questioning the Contemporary Application of the Japanese Narrative About the Historical Korean Peninsula-China Linkage
T2  - PACIFIC FOCUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese often frame the history of East Asia in a Japan versus China dichotomy, and they have long embraced a national narrative that emphasizes the linkage between the Korean Peninsula and China in the traditional Confucian worldview. The narrative asserts that the peninsula has been culturally and geopolitically attached to China, and it has served as an important ideational backdrop to Japan's positioning in the changing regional security environment. In this article, we analyze the origin and contents of the Japanese national narrative, and examine how it has influenced both the Japanese view of the peninsula and policy-making. We focus on how it has reemerged in the post-Cold War and the rising China era, and how it has been particularly applied to frame current South Korea-China relations. We then turn to analyze whether contemporary South Korean policies toward China offer evidence in support of the narrative. We conclude that the Japanese concern that South Korea could eventually get pulled into China's orbit is a highly unlikely scenario, and that the Japanese narrative exhibits a time lag in incorporating contemporary factors into its historically generated storyline. South Korea's understanding of regional politics is intrinsically different from that of the pre-modern periods, and its relations with China are more complex than this particular Japanese narrative would suggest. Its interactions with China are guided by contemporary economic, political, and sociocultural considerations about the national interest, and the reality of the divided peninsula in the post-Cold War period.

TI  - Colour Classification of 1486 Lakes across a Wide Range of Optical Water Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing by satellite-borne sensors presents a significant opportunity to enhance the spatio-temporal coverage of environmental monitoring programmes for lakes, but the estimation of classic water quality attributes from inland water bodies has not reached operational status due to the difficulty of discerning the spectral signatures of optically active water constituents. Determination of water colour, as perceived by the human eye, does not require knowledge of inherent optical properties and therefore represents a generally applicable remotely-sensed water quality attribute. In this paper, we implemented a recent algorithm for the retrieval of colour parameters (hue angle, dominant wavelength) and derived a new correction for colour purity to account for the spectral bandpass of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We used this algorithm to calculate water colour on almost 45,000 observations over four years from 1486 lakes from a diverse range of optical water types in New Zealand. We show that the most prevalent lake colours are yellow-orange and blue, respectively, while green observations are comparatively rare. About 40% of the study lakes show transitions between colours at a range of time scales, including seasonal. A preliminary exploratory analysis suggests that both geo-physical and anthropogenic factors, such as catchment land use, provide environmental control of lake colour and are promising avenues for future analysis.

TI  - Spatially explicit modeling and prediction of shrub cover increase near Umiujaq, Nunavik
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
M3  - Article
AB  - A circumpolar increase in shrub growth and cover has been underway in Arctic and subarctic ecosystems for the last few decades, but there is considerable spatial heterogeneity in this shrubification process. Although topography, hydrology, and edaphic factors are known to influence shrubification patterns, a better understanding of the landscape-scale factors driving this phenomenon is needed to accurately predict its impacts on ecosystem function. In this study, we generated land cover change models in order to identify variables driving shrub cover increase near Umiujaq (Quebec, Canada). Using land cover maps from 1990/1994 and 2010, we modeled observed changes using two contrasting conceptual approaches: binomial modeling of transitions to shrub dominance and multinomial modeling of all land cover transitions. Models were used to generate spatially explicit predictions of transition to shrub dominance in the near future as well as long-term predictions of the abundance of different land cover types. Model predictions were validated using both field data and current Landsat-derived trends of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increase in the region in order to assess their consistency with observed patterns of change. We found that both variables related to topography and to vegetation were useful in modeling land cover changes occurring near Umiujaq. Shrubs tended to preferentially colonize low-elevation areas and moderate slopes, while their cover was more likely to increase in the vicinity of existing shrub patches. Deterministic realizations of the spatially explicit models of land cover change had a good predictive capability, although they performed better at predicting the proportion of different cover types than at predicting the precise location of the changes. Binomial models performed as well as multinomial models, indicating that neglecting land cover changes other than shrubification does not result in decreased prediction accuracy. The predicted probabilities of shrub increase in the region were consistent with patterns of change inferred from field data, but only partly supported by recent local increases in NDVI. Our findings increase the current understanding of the factors driving shrubification, while warranting further research on its impacts on ecosystem function and on the link between land cover changes and shifts in remotely sensed vegetation indices.

AB  - The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the initial metastatic site for the majority of solid cancers. In some cases, cancer cells may bypass the SLNs and enter the vascular channels directly to spread to the systemic sites. Metastatic progression is an orderly process. During the process of metastasis, complex biochemical and molecular mechanisms are involved being subjected to the host influence, in particular, the immune system. With more detailed understanding of the genomic and molecular characteristics of cancer both from the primary site and its metastases, the pathways of cancer growth and spread within the cancer microenvironment may be further elucidated.

TI  - From sample to pixel: multi-scale remote sensing data for upscaling aboveground carbon data in heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In times of rapid global change, ecosystem monitoring is of utmost importance. Combined field and remote sensing data enable large-scale ecosystem assessments, while maintaining local relevance and accuracy. In heterogeneous landscapes, however, the integration of field-collected data with remote sensing image pixels is not a trivial matter. Indeed, much of the uncertainty in models that use remote sensing to map larger areas lies on the field data integration. In this study, we propose to use fine spatial resolution (5 x 5 m(2)) remote sensing data as auxiliary data for upscaling field-sampled aboveground carbon data to target (meso-scale, i.e., 30 x 30 m(2)) image pixels. In this process, we assess the effects of field data disaggregation and extrapolation, with and without the auxiliary data. We test this on three study sites in heterogeneous landscapes of the Brazilian savanna. We thus compare two methods that use auxiliary data-surface method, which uses a weighting layer, and regression method, which applies a regression model-with one method without auxiliary data-cartographic method. To evaluate our results, we compared observed vs. estimated aboveground carbon values (for known samples) at the pixel level. Additionally, we fitted a random forest regression model with the assigned carbon estimates and the target satellite imagery and assessed the influence of the fraction of extrapolated vs. sampled carbon values on model performance. We observed that, in heterogeneous landscapes, the use of fine spatial resolution remote sensing data improves the upscaling of field-based aboveground carbon data to coarser image pixels. We also show that a surface method is more suitable for spatial disaggregation, while a regression approach is preferable for extrapolating non-sampled pixel fractions. In our study, larger datasets, which included a higher proportion of estimated values, generally delivered better models of aboveground carbon than smaller datasets that are assumed to more reliably reflect reality. Our approach enables to link field and remote sensing data, which in turn enables the detailed mapping of aboveground carbon in heterogeneous landscapes over large areas through the optimized integration of field data and multi-scale remote sensing data.

TI  - Novel Measurements of Fine-Scale Albedo: Using a Commercial Quadcopter to Measure Radiation Fluxes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of radiative indices must balance spatially and temporally coarse satellite measurements with finer-scale, but geographically limited, in-situ surface measurements. Instruments mounted upon an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can provide small-scale, mobile remote measurements that fill this resolution gap. Here we present and validate a novel method of obtaining albedo values using an unmodified quadcopter at a deciduous northern hardwood forest. We validate this method by comparing simultaneous albedo estimates by UAV and a fixed tower at the same site. We found that UAV provided stable albedo measurements across multiple flights, with results that were well within the range of tower-estimated albedo at similar forested sites. Our results indicate that in-situ albedo measurements (tower and UAV) capture more site-to-site variation in albedo than satellite measurements. Overall, we show that UAVs produce reliable, consistent albedo measurements that can capture crucial surface heterogeneity, clearly distinguishing between different land uses. Future application of this approach can provide detailed measurements of albedo and potentially other vegetation indices to enhance global research and modeling efforts.

TI  - Space-air-field integrated biodiversity monitoring based on experimental station
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing effective policies for biodiversity conservation and restoration policies requires spatially and temporally explicit data on distribution of species and habitats. Remote sensing provides an effective technical tool to meet this requirement. In recent years, the rapid development of integrated multi-platform, multi scale, multi-mode remote sensing technology the implementation of integrated remote sensing observations across space-air-field provides novel opportunities for biodiversity monitoring. In this paper, we review the main methods of remote sensing that aids biodiversity monitoring and assess existing remote sensing observation experiments. We found that current methods of biodiversity monitoring using remotely-sensed data lacked the support of space-air-field integrated observations and the existing space-air-field integrated observations did not include biodiversity parameters. The Wanglang integrated observation and experiment station for mountain ecological remote sensing illustrates the potential to integrate experimental station-based and space-air-field integrated observations for biodiversity monitoring. Our review highlights that integrating direct observations with remote sensing can provide spatio-temporally explicit information on species and habitats and improve the informed monitoring of biodiversity.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Urban Heat Island Intensities in Chinese, Russian, and DPRK Regions across the Transnational Urban Agglomeration of the Tumen River in Northeast Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the spatial pattern of urban heat island intensities across the transnational urban agglomeration of the Tumen River is important for the promotion of sustainable regional development. This study employed Landsat images and MODIS LST data obtained in 2016 to determine the intensity of urban heat islands in this region, enabling direct comparison of data from the sub-regions of China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and Russia. The average urban heat island intensity for the region was found to be 1.0 degrees C, with the highest intensity of 3.0 degrees C occurring during the summer time. The intensity of urban heat islands on the Chinese side was higher than on the other two sides, with city size, socio-economic development levels and vegetation coverage significantly affect their intensity. Urban heat island effects in Chinese cities in the region contribute increases in maximum summer temperatures and the number of high-temperature days that pose a threat to the health of their residents. The factors that influence urban heat island intensities in these cities and the impacts of urban heat island effects on the quality of life and health of residents are discussed. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the impact of urban heat island effects on cities in the region by increasing the area of green spaces they contain, as well as controlling their size and population.

TI  - Ship Size Extraction for Sentinel-1 Images Based on Dual-Polarization Fusion and Nonlinear Regression: Push Error Under One Pixel
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a method of ship size extraction for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which is composed of the image processing stage and the regression stage. In order to achieve extraction with high accuracy, considering the data characteristics of Sentinel-I images, we propose to use the dual-polarization fusion and the nonlinear regression with the gradient boosting. The experiments and analyses on a relatively large data set show that: 1) compared with the existing and related studies, the proposed method achieves an improved performance. The extraction errors are pushed under one pixel, and they are 4.66% (8.80 m) and 7.01% (2.17 m) for length and width, respectively; 2) the dual-polarization information fusion does improve the size extraction accuracy; and 3) the nonlinear regression does exploit the relationship between the influential factors and the size parameters and provide a better performance than the linear regression. The experimental results verify that the proposed design is suitable for ship size extraction in Sentinel-1 SAR images.

TI  - An Enhanced Single-Pair Learning-Based Reflectance Fusion Algorithm with Spatiotemporally Extended Training Samples
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion methods are considered a useful tool for generating multi-temporal reflectance data with limited high-resolution images and necessary low-resolution images. In particular, the superiority of sparse representation-based spatiotemporal reflectance fusion model (SPSTFM) in capturing phenology and type changes of land covers has been preliminarily demonstrated. Meanwhile, the dictionary training process, which is a key step in the sparse learning-based fusion algorithm, and its effect on fusion quality are still unclear. In this paper, an enhanced spatiotemporal fusion scheme based on the single-pair SPSTFM algorithm has been proposed through improving the process of dictionary learning, and then evaluated using two actual datasets, with one representing a rural area with phenology changes and the other representing an urban area with land cover type changes. The validated strategy for enhancing the dictionary learning process is divided into two modes to enlarge the training datasets with spatially and temporally extended samples. Compared to the original learning-based algorithm and other employed typical single-pair-based fusion models, experimental results from the proposed fusion method with two extension modes show improved performance in modeling reflectance using the two preceding datasets. Furthermore, the strategy with temporally extended training samples is more effective than the strategy with spatially extended training samples for the land cover area with phenology changes, whereas it is opposite for the land cover area with type changes.

TI  - Coastline and landscape changes in bay areas caused by human activities: A comparative analysis of Xiangshan Bay, China and Tampa Bay, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using multitemporal Landsat TM/OLI images at a 10-year interval, in this study, we (1) extracted information of spatial location, length, and sinuosity of coastline and landscape configuration, diversity and fragmentation in the bay areas of Xiangshan Bay (XB), China and Tampa Bay (TB), USA from 1985 to 2015; (2) constructed indices of artificial coastlines and human disturbance on bay area landscapes; and (3) explored and discussed the impacts of human activities on changes of coastlines and landscape types in the two bay areas. Our analysis results demonstrate the following five points. (1) During the past 30 years, the lengths of natural coastline in XB and TB shrank, while the lengths of their artificial coastline increased first and then maintained stable. Since there were different influences of human activities on coastlines and landscape types between the two bay areas, XB experienced dramatic changes in parts of coastline geomorphologies and continuous decrease of coastline sinuosity, while, in TB, there was a little change in coastline geomorphologies and its coastline sinuosity was almost unchanged. (2) The intensity of human activities in XB was continuously enhanced from 1985 to 1995, and then the degree of enhancement had slowed down after 1995. However, in the time period, the impacted extent of human activities gradually increased and finally covered almost entire coastlines in XB. In TB area, although the intensity of human activities was enhanced, the degree of enhancement slowed down from 1985 to 2015 and the impacted areas of human activates were concentrated in several coastal city areas. (3) The average area of landscape patches strongly disturbed by human activities in both XB and TB generally showed a trend of decreasing from 1985 to 2005. However, during the period of 2005 to 2015, the average patch area of landscapes disturbed by different degrees of human activities in XB changed differently, while in TB it almost did not change. (4) From 1985 to 2005, the indices of landscape diversity in various areas of human disturbance in XB gradually increased, while in TB, changes in indices of the landscape diversity varied. From 2005 to 2015, the changes in the intensity of human disturbance in both bay areas were from weak to strong, whereas the indices of landscape diversity in XB and TB increased first and then decreased. (5) The landscape fragmentation index in different human disturbance areas in both XB and TB gradually increased from 1985 to 2005, while from 2005 to 2015, in both bay areas, the landscape fragmentation index presented a decreasing trend.

TI  - Temporal Variation of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Highly Dynamic Waters from Unattended Sensors and Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of water quality changes in highly dynamic inland lakes is frequently impeded by insufficient spatial and temporal coverage, for both field surveys and remote sensing methods. To track short-term variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll-a concentrations in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, high-frequency, in-situ, measurements were collected from two fixed stations. The K-mean clustering method was also applied to identify clusters with similar spatio-temporal variations, using remote sensing Chl-a data products from the MERIS satellite, taken from 2003 to 2012. Four lake area classes were obtained with distinct spatio-temporal patterns, two of which were selected for in situ measurement. Distinct daily periodic variations were observed, with peaks at approximately 3:00 PM and troughs at night or early morning. Short-term variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and Chl-a levels were revealed, with a maximum intra-diurnal ratio of 5.1 and inter-diurnal ratio of 7.4, respectively. Using geostatistical analysis, the temporal range of chlorophyll fluorescence and corresponding Chl-a variations was determined to be 9.6 h, which indicates that there is a temporal discrepancy between Chl-a variations and the sampling frequency of current satellite missions. An analysis of the optimal sampling strategies demonstrated that the influence of the sampling time on the mean Chl-a concentrations observed was higher than 25%, and the uncertainty of any single Terra/MODIS or Aqua/MODIS observation was approximately 15%. Therefore, sampling twice a day is essential to resolve Chl-a variations with a bias level of 10% or less. The results highlight short-term variations of critical water quality parameters in freshwater, and they help identify specific design requirements for geostationary earth observation missions, so that they can better address the challenges of monitoring complex coastal and inland environments around the world.

TI  - Long-term variation of cloud droplet number concentrations from space-based Lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new 10 year of liquid water cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) climatology, and analyzes its long-term variation on both regional and global scales based on accurate depolarization ratio measurement from CALIPSO and 3.7 mu m cloud effective radius retrieval from MODIS. Compared with the widely used passive retrieval method (e.g., MODIS retrieval), which considers N-d as function of cloud optical depth, geometry thickness and effective radius, retrieval method of the new N-d dataset has a weak dependence upon the cloud adiabatic assumption and eliminates the possible bias caused by multilayer clouds. Statistical results show that the annual cycle and long-term variability of N-d retrieved by CALIPSO agree reasonably well with those obtained from MODIS retrieval method, especially over the stratocumulus regions (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Multiple regression models and contribution calculation verify that the variability of sulfate mass concentration dominates the long-term variation of N-d over most regions, even though the contribution factors and rates vary with different regions, temperatures and methods. In addition, our study also indicates that the impact of BC and OC on N-d should not be ignored, especially for supercooled water clouds over those important biomass burning regions. These results demonstrate the temperature-dependent N-d climatology derived from CALIOP has potential to be beneficial to climate research and reduce the uncertainties in estimates of the aerosol indirect effect in the model simulations.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Novel Polarimetric Active Radar Calibrator for Gaofen-3 SAR
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese first fully polarimetric space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-Gaofen-3 (GF-3) was launched in August 2016, which operates at the C-band and the resolution can reach 1 m. Polarimetric SAR calibration is a procedure that corrects the polarization distortion of a measured scattering matrix by referring to the scattering matrix of a known target. The present paper describes the principle, design, manufacture, and measurement results of a novel polarimetric active radar calibrator (PARC) designed for GF-3. A new design method for PARC was presented and two dual-polarized antennas with very high polarization purity were used. The internal calibration technique was introduced to ensure balance in the amplitude and phase, which ensures the precision of the PARC's scattering matrices. The results we obtained through measurement in the microwave anechoic chamber and experiments in in-orbit calibration agree well with the theoretical predictions, and the novel PARC presented is proved to be well suited for polarization and radiometric calibration of GF-3.

TI  - Analysis of Dust Aerosol Retrievals Using Satellite Data in Central Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several long-term monitoring of aerosol datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra/Aqua, Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) were used to derive the dust aerosol optical depth (DOD) in Central Asia based on the Angstrom exponent parameter and/or the particle shape. All sensors agree very well on the interannual variability of DOD. The seasonal analysis of DOD and dust occurrences identified the largest dust loading and the most frequent dust occurrence in the spring and summer, respectively. No significant trend was found during the research period in terms of both DOD and the dust occurrence. Further analysis of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol products on a case-by-case basis in most dust months of 2007 suggested that the vertical structure is varying in terms of the extension and the dust loading from one event to another, although dust particles of most episodes have similar physical characteristics (particle shape and size). Our analysis on the vertical structure of dust plumes, the layer-integrated color ratio and depolarization ratio indicates a varied climate effect (e.g., the direct radiative impact) by mineral dust, dependent on the event being observed in Central Asia.

T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) of China, as a typical eco-fragile and fanning-pastoral transitional region, shows great vulnerability to disturbances from cultivation activity. In this region, the conflict between cultivation activity and environmental protection has not attracted great importance until the implementation of China's Grain-for-Green Policy (CGGP) since 2000. Here, using Landsat5 TM/Landsat7 ETM+ images from 1990, 2000, and 2010, we monitor the cultivation activity and land-use/cover changes (LUCC) resulting from cultivation activity in the MUSL region. Based on the data from images, we developed a series of databases of cultivated activity-induced LUCC and use them to discuss comparatively the spatio-temporal evolution trends of cultivation activity before and after CGGP implementation. These results provide evidence for managers to evaluate the implementation effectiveness of governmental policy and the influence of cultivation activity on the ecological environment of the MUSL region.

TI  - Retrieval of cirrus cloud top height over ocean based on multi-angle polarized information
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height could be retrieved by polarized information. In order to reduce the uncertainty of retrieval results caused by the variability of cloud and surface polarized properties, the multi-angle polarized information of 490 nm band and 865 nm band was used to retrieve cirrus cloud top height. Atmospheric top polarized information and the differences of atmospheric top polarized information between 490 nm band and 865nm band was theoretically analyzed, which showed that it was feasible to retrieve cirrus cloud top height using polarized reflectance difference between 490 nm band and 865 nm band. Cirrus cloud was assumed as General Habit Mixture (GHM) model, the polarized reflectance difference was evaluated by the vector radiative transfer model based on adding-doubling method, and the sensitivity of polarized reflectance to cirrus cloud effective radius, optical thickness and cloud top pressure were evaluated. The results show that when the cirrus cloud optical thickness is greater than 3, the polarized reflectance difference is not sensitive to the change of effective particle radius and optical thickness, and is sensitive to the change of cloud top pressure. The polarized reflectance difference look-up table was constructed by choosing appropriate parameters according to sensitivity analysis, and retrieved cirrus cloud top heights using look-up table method base on POLDER3 data. The retrieval results were compared with POLDER3 product and MODIS product. The results indicate that compared with the official POLDER3 algorithm, the polarized reflectance difference look-up table method could applied to a wider scattering angle range, and had a better consistency with MODIS product.

TI  - The Evolution of the Urban Spatial Pattern in the Yangtze River Economic Belt: Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is an important national regional development strategy and a strategic engineering development system. In this study, the evolution of urban spatial patterns in the YREB from 1990 to 2010 was mapped using the nighttime stable light (NSL) data, multi-temporal urban land products, and multiple sources of geographic data by using the rank-size distribution and the Gini coefficient method. Through statistical results, we found that urban land takes on the feature of high in the east and low in the west. The study area included cities of different development stages and sizes. The nighttime light increased in most cities from 1992 to 2010, and the rate assumed an obvious growth tendency in the three urban agglomerations in the YREB. The results revealed that the urban size distribution of the YREB is relatively dispersed, the speed of urban development is unequal, and the trend of urban size structure shows a decentralized distribution pattern that has continuously strengthened from 1990 to 2010. Affected by factors such as geographical conditions, spatial distance, and development stage, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have developed rapidly, the upper and middle reaches have developed large cities, and a contiguous development trend is not obvious. The evolution of urban agglomerations in the region presents a variety of spatial development characteristics. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have entered a phase of urban continuation, forming a more mature interregional urban agglomeration, while the YREB inland urban agglomerations are in suburbanization and multi-centered urban areas. At this stage, the conditions for the formation of transregional urban agglomerations do not yet exist, and there are many uncertainties in the boundary and spatial structure of each urban agglomeration.

TI  - Land-Use/Cover Change and Driving Mechanism on the West Bank of Lake Baikal from 2005 to 2015-A Case Study of Irkutsk City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Baikal is located on the southern tableland of East Siberian Russia. The west coast of the lake has vast forest resources and excellent ecological conditions, and this area and the Mongolian Plateau constitute an important ecological security barrier in northern China. Land-use/cover change is an important manifestation of regional human activities and ecosystem evolution. This paper uses Irkutsk city, a typical city on the West Bank of Lake Baikal, as a case study area. Based on three phases of Landsat remote-sensing image data, the land-use/cover change pattern and change process are analyzed and the natural factors and socioeconomic factors are combined to reveal driving forces through the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model. The results show the following: (1) From 2005 to 2015, construction land expanded, and forestland was converted into construction land and woodland. In addition, grass land, bare land, and cultivated land were converted into construction land, and the woodland area increased. The annual changes in land use from 2005 to 2010 were dramatic and then slowed down from 2010 to 2015. (2) The main reasons for the change in land-use types were urban expansion and nonagricultural development caused by population migration. The process of urbanization from external populations to urban agglomeration and the process of reverse urbanization from a central urban population to urban suburbs jointly expanded urban construction land area. As a result, forestland, grass land and bare land areas on the outskirts of cities were continuously reduced. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, land privatization led to a decline in the farm economy, the emergence of agricultural land reclamation and urban expansion; in addition, the implementation of the one-hectare land policy intensified development in suburban areas, resulting in a reduction of forestland and grass land areas. The process of constructing the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor has intensified human activities in the region, and the prevention of drastic changes in land cover, coordination of human-land relations, and green development are necessary.

TI  - InSAR Time Series Analysis of L-Band Wide-Swath SAR Data Acquired by ALOS-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Operating at L-band (similar to 24 cm wavelength) in wide-swath modes is one of the characteristics of the new and next generation satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions. After 3 years of operation, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) satellite has acquired a wealth of 1-band wide-swath SAR data over many areas using its ScanSAR mode. We present interferometry SAR (InSAR) time series analysis results from ALOS-2 ScanSAR data. We analyze the possible error sources in the InSAR and correct them if possible. We present different time series analysis results including azimuth frequency modulation rate error, line of sight (LOS) ionospheric phase, azimuth shift caused by the ionosphere, and LOS displacement processed using both full-aperture and burst-by-burst workflows. The final InSAR LOS displacement time series result reveals both large-scale tectonic and small-scale anthropogenic deformation components. The results demonstrate the potential for measuring continental or even global-scale tectonic deformation and illustrate the promise of upcoming L-band wide-swath SAR missions, such as the NASA-ISRO SAR mission.

TI  - An Accurate Measurement Method for Azimuth Pointing of Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Antenna Beams Based on Ground Receiver
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper proposes a new method for measuring the azimuth pointing of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antenna beams based on the ground receiver, which can receive and record complex sampling data of the pulse signals transmitted from the spaceborne SAR. The center of the antenna pattern is extracted from the complex sampling data amplitude envelope to obtain the time when the beam main lobe center irradiates the ground receiver, and the range migration information is extracted from the complex sampling data to obtain the time when the satellite is over the top of the ground receiver. The results of Chinese civilian remote sensing GaoFen-3 SAR satellite experiment data processing show that the measurement accuracy of this method is better than 0.002 degrees, which can be applied to the accurate measurement of azimuth pointing of various low Earth orbit (LEO) SAR antenna beams.

TI  - Beamforming for Secure Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Terrestrial Networks Coexisting With Satellite Networks
T2  - IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a beamforming (BF) scheme to enhance wireless information and power transfer in terrestrial cellular networks coexisting with satellite networks. By assuming that the energy receivers are the potential eavesdroppers overhearing signals intended for information receivers (IRs), we first formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the minimal achievable secrecy rate of the IRs subject to the constraints of energy harvest requirement, interference threshold, and transmit power budget. Through exploiting the sequential convex approximation method, we convert the original problem into a linear one with a series of linear matrix inequality and second-order cone constraints. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to obtain the BF weight vectors. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.

TI  - SAR-Based Urban Extents Extraction: From ENVISAT to Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are only a few examples in technical literature about the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset to extract human settlement extents. This paper shows how it is possible to extract a global urban layer from multiyear ENVISAT Advanced SAR (ASAR) backscatter measurements, overcoming some of the drawbacks of a preliminary release. Additionally, this research shows that the same technique can be applied with minor changes to SAR data from the new Sentinel-1A platform. The current ASAR urban layer shows improvements with respect to the preliminary version in the test sites of the 2011 Round Robin (RR) on urban mapping promoted by the European Space Agency (ESA). For Sentinel-1, results are similarly validated on the test sites of the 2015 edition of the RR on urbanmapping. Results prove that UEXT can be used for SAR-based urban extent extraction using multiple sensors.

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection Using Multiple Shape Parameters of Spectral and NDVI Curves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral and NDVI values have been used to calculate the change magnitudes of land cover, but may result in many pseudo-changes because of inter-class variance. Recently, the shape information of spectral or NDVI curves such as direction, angle, gradient, or other mathematical indicators have been used to improve the accuracy of land cover change detection. However, these measurements, in terms of the single shape features, can hardly capture the complete trends of curves affected by the unsynchronized phenology. Therefore, the calculated change magnitudes are indistinct such that changes and no-changes have a low contrast. This problem has prevented traditional change detection methods from achieving a higher accuracy using bi-temporal images or NDVI time series. In this paper, a multiple shape parameters-based change detection method is proposed by combining the spectral correlation operator and the shape features of NDVI temporal curves (phase angle cumulant, baseline cumulant, relative cumulation rate, and zero-crossing rate). The change magnitude is derived by integrating all the inter-annual differences of these shape parameters. The change regions are discriminated by an automated threshold selection method known as histogram concavity analysis. The results showed that the mean differences in the change magnitudes of the proposed method between 2100 changed and 2523 unchanged pixels was 32%, the overall accuracy was approximately 88%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.76. A comparative analysis was conducted with bi-temporal image-based methods and NDVI time series-based methods, and we demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and robust than traditional methods in achieving high-contrast change magnitudes and accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation and change of Danjiangkou Reservoir dynamic capacity
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of storage capacity of the Danjiangkou Reservoir have important significance to guarantee water diversion middle route project. Aiming at the problems of complexity in measurement and short-term fluctuation in capacity in Danjiangkou Reservoir, we chose remote sensing data of Landsat series and HJ-1A/B, and DEM data, constructing a new method for extraction of dynamic storage capacity, extracting the monthly dynamic information of reservoir capacity in 2000-2016. We analyzed the factors that caused the dynamic change of storage capacity and its impacts on water diversion. The results showed that, in the past 17 years, the largest reservoir capacity of Danjiangkou was 19.216 billion m(3) and the minimum was 7.974 billion m(3), with an average of 11.204 billion m(3). After the first phase of the middle route of south-to-north water transfer, the storage capacity of Danjiangkou Reservoir had been gradually increased. In terms of the monthly averages, the capacity from May to October increased gradually, from October through December showed fluctuate change, and decreased gradually from December to next May. The cyclical artificial storage and climate change were the driving forces for the changes of the storage capacity. The Danjiangkou Reservoir could meet the need for water transfer under the reasonable dispatching of the reservoir water.

TI  - A Phenology-Based Method to Map Cropping Patterns under a Wheat-Maize Rotation Using Remotely Sensed Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land use and cropping patterns are closely related to food production, soil degradation, water resource management, greenhouse gas emission, and regional climate alterations. Methods for reliable and cost-efficient mapping of cropping pattern, as well as their changes over space and time, are therefore urgently needed. To cope with this need, we developed a phenology-based method to map cropping patterns based on time-series of vegetation index data. The proposed method builds on the well-known threshold model' to retrieve phenological metrics. Values of four phenological parameters are used to identify crop seasons. Using a set of rules, the crop season information is translated into cropping pattern. To illustrate the method, cropping patterns were determined for three consecutive years (2008-2010) in the Henan province of China, where reliable validation data was available. Cropping patterns were derived using eight-day composite MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. Results show that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory overall accuracy (84%) in extracting cropping patterns. Interestingly, the accuracy obtained with our method based on MODIS EVI data was comparable with that from Landsat-5 TM image classification. We conclude that the proposed method for cropland and cropping pattern identification based on MODIS data offers a simple, yet reliable way to derive important land use information over large areas.

TI  - Ecological water requirements of wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Naoli River
T2  - WATER POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades, the wetland area of the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China has shrunk severely. To provide a scientific basis for the protection and restoration of wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, Landsat TM images of 13 typical years of four well-preserved and contiguous wetlands are interpreted by remote sensing technology in the Sanjiang Plain of the Naoli River Drainage Basin. According to the results of the interpretation, the calculation of the minimum and the optimal ecological water requirements of the four wetlands was carried out by combining ecology with remote sensing technology. At the same time, considering the rainfall and surface runoff at different guarantee rates, the artificial recharge of four wetlands was calculated according to the principle of water balance. The results indicate that the wetland area decreased significantly from 1984 to 2013, and natural inflow of water cannot meet the actual water requirements of wetlands. The calculated artificial recharge of the four reserves provides technical support for replenishment of wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, and lays a good foundation for the restoration of wetland ecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain. At the same time, it also provides a good habitat for rare waterfowl.

TI  - Comparison of CBERS-04, GF-1, and GF-2 Satellite Panchromatic Images for Mapping Quasi-Circular Vegetation Patches in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions frequently exists in patches, which can be effectively mapped by remote sensing. However, not all satellite images are suitable to detect the decametric-scale vegetation patches because of low spatial resolution. This study compared the capability of the first Gaofen Satellite (GF-1), the second Gaofen Satellite (GF-2), and China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite 4 (CBERS-04) panchromatic images for mapping quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) with K-Means (KM) and object-based example-based feature extraction with support vector machine classification (OEFE) in the Yellow River Delta, China. Both approaches provide relatively high classification accuracy with GF-2. For all five images, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for area, perimeter, and perimeter/area ratio were smaller using the KM than the OEFE, indicating that the results from the KM are more similar to ground truth. Although the mapped results of the QVPs from finer-spatial resolution images appeared more accurate, accuracy improvement in terms of QVP area, perimeter, and perimeter/area ratio was limited, and most of the QVPs detected only by finer-spatial resolution imagery had a more than 40% difference with the actual QVPs in these three parameters. Compared with the KM approach, the OEFE approach performed better for vegetation patch shape description. Coupling the CBERS-04 with the OEFE approach could suitably map the QVPs (overall accuracy 75.3%). This is important for ecological protection managers concerned about cost-effectiveness between image spatial resolution and mapping the QVPs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Three cases of the avian influenza A (H9N2) virus have been documented in Changsha, which is a large city that has nine districts and a population of 7.04 million in central South China. Among these patients, one was a girl and two were boys. The ages of the patients were 9 months, 2 years, and 15 years. Two cases of H9N2 were detected in September, 2015 and one was detected in 2017. Two patients were children who had not reached the age for kindergarten and one was a student. These three cases were all mild and were detected in a sentinel hospital of the Chinese Influenza Surveillance System. We describe the clinical and epidemiological features of the youngest patient with H9N2 in 2017 and the surveillance results of the H9N2 virus in live poultry markets in Changsha. From January 2014 to December 2017, 4212 samples were collected in live poultry markets in Changsha, among which 25.81% (1087/4212) were H9N2-positive. Public health concerns should be addressed for emerging H9N2 virus infection, and more strategies should be performed before this virus mutates to be more transmissible and highly pathogenic.

TI  - Mapping water-logging damage on winter wheat at parcel level using high spatial resolution satellite data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Damage to agricultural crops due to water-logging is becoming more frequent in this era of global climate change. In this study, we investigated the effect of water-logging on winter wheat growth (LAI and aboveground biomass) and yield at a parcel scale using high spatial resolution satellite data. For this purpose, a dynamic mapping of winter wheat LAI and biomass during growth under water-logging conditions was implemented. In addition, yield mapping and yield loss estimation were also carried out to arrive at the potential impacts of water-logging on both winter wheat growth and grain yield. Two varieties of winter wheat were investigated (Yang Mai 14 and Yang Mai 18) at tillering, jointing to booting and flowering. Field conditions were representative of water-logging treatment (contrast check (CK), waterlogging (WL) and flooding (FL)). A total of eight high spatial resolution optical satellite images, including WorldView-2, WorldView-3, Pleiades-1A, SPOT-6, GeoEye-1 and SPOT-7 were obtained at time points concurrent with eight temporal field observations. Seven widely used vegetation indices (VIs) were utilized as independent variables for LAI, biomass and yield estimation. Optimal estimation models were selected according to coefficient of determination (R-2), correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) for subsequent mapping of LAI, biomass and yield. Results show that the power model, having EVI as the independent variable, had the highest accuracy for biomass estimation (R-2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.076 kg/m(2)) while the exponential model with NDVI is the optimal model for LAI estimation (with 0.74 in R-2 and 0.64 in RMSE). GNDVI is the optimal VI for yield mapping, with 0.563 in R-cv (cross validated R) and 843.76 kg/hm(2 )in RMSEcv (cross validated RMSEcv). As for the assessment of waterlogging damage on winter wheat growth, FL showed a more serious impact than that of WL, based on results of the dynamic mapping of biomass and LAI at the same development stages. Water-logging from jointing to booting showed a more serious damage impact with respect to biomass and yield than that at the tillering and flowering stages. Our results have demonstrated the potential of multi-source and high spatial resolution remotely-sensed optical data for quantifying the impact of water-logging on winter wheat growth and grain yield at parcel scales, a research direction that has rarely been reported in agricultural remote sensing literature. This study thus provides a fundamental basis and the possibility for crop yield loss evaluation, water-logging monitoring, and for the design of mitigation strategies that would benefit even small-holder and subsistence farmers.

TI  - Research on special-shaped concrete-filled steel tubular columns under axial compression
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Six L-shaped and twelve T-shaped concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) stub columns subjected to axial compression were experimented in this paper. The L-shaped CFST stub columns were welded vertical stiffener at the concave corner. The T-shaped CFST stub columns were stiffened by steel plate stiffeners. During the test, the experimental phenomenon and failure mode of special-shaped CFST stub columns were observed. According to axial load displacement curves, mechanical properties such as stiffness, bearing capacity and ductility were compared and analyzed. According to the load-strain curves and load-stress curves, strain and stress development of steel tubes and constraint effect for concrete provided by steel tubes were studied. The test results show that the stiffeners can effectively delay the local buckling of steel tubes, increase the buckling capacity, and increase the constraint effect for concrete. The cross-sectional dimension of specimens has no obvious effect on the ductility and the failure modes of T-shaped CFST stub column due to the restriction of steel plate stiffener, while obviously affects the stiffness and the bearing capacity. Finite element (FE) software ABAQUS was used to analyze special-shaped CFST columns subjected to axial compression and the simulated results were in good agreement with the experimental results. Further parameter analysis with ABAQUS was carried out to study the influences of the steel ratio a, steel yield strength f(y), concrete strength f(ck) and slenderness ratio lambda. Based on the experimental results and FE analysis, design formulae for calculating sectional bearing capacity and stability bearing capacity of special-shaped CFST columns are proposed.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership has continued to provide global ocean color data since its launch in October 2011. However, there are always many missing pixels in the original VIIRS-measured ocean color images due to clouds and various other reasons. The data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) is a method to reconstruct (gap filling) missing data in geophysical data sets based on the empirical orthogonal function. In this paper, the DINEOF is applied to VIIRS-derived global Level-3 binned ocean color data of 9-km spatial resolution, and the DINEOF-reconstructed ocean color data are used to fill the gaps of missing data. In particular, daily, eight-day, and monthly VIIRS global Level-3 binned ocean color data, including chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [K-d(490)], and normalized water-leaving radiance spectra [nL(w) (lambda)] at the five VIIRS visible bands, are tested and evaluated. To validate and evaluate the gap-filled data, a set of original valid nonmissing pixels in the VIIRS images are selected randomly and treated as missing pixels in the DINEOF process, so that the reconstructed pixels can be compared with the original data. Results show that the DINEOF method can successfully reconstruct and gap-fill meso-scale and large-scale spatial ocean features in the global VIIRS Level-3 images, as well as capture the temporal variations of these features.

TI  - Estimation of biogenic VOC emissions and its impact on ozone formation over the Yangtze River Delta region, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. In the present work, biogenic emissions over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region for year 2014 were developed based on the interpretation of remote sensing image and MODIS data using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). Impact of BVOCs emissions over the YRD region on ozone formation was investigated based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system for July 2014. Two parallel scenarios-with and without BVOCs emissions-were developed to evaluate the influence of BVOC5 emission on ozone formation. Biogenic emissions were estimated to be 18.86 x 10(5) ton yr(-1) over the YRD region for year 2014, with higher emissions in the southern YRD region than the northern region, and higher emissions in summer than other seasons. Model evaluation showed fairly good model performances, with the index of agreement (IOA) of meteorological parameters and ozone concentrations of 0.80-0.95 and 0.76-0.91, respectively. Ozone concentrations mainly concentrated in the northwest, which is the downwind of the YRD region in summer. Impact of biogenic emissions on ozone formation exhibited a strong spatial pattern: high contributions were observed in the middle YRD region, including Bengbu, Tongling, Hefei, Huzhou, Nanjing and Zhenjiang, with the maximum hourly ozone contribution of 18.43-36.1814/m(3) during July 18 to 23. Ozone concentrations in rural areas would be more likely to be influenced by BVOCs emissions than urban areas.

TI  - Evolution of Landscape Ecological Risk at the Optimal Scale: A Case Study of the Open Coastal Wetlands in Jiangsu, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed analysis of the evolution characteristics of landscape ecological risk is crucial for coastal sustainable management and for understanding the potential environmental impacts of a man-made landform landscapes (MMLL). As a typical open coastal wetland, large-scale human activities (e.g., tidal reclamation, fishery activities, wind farm construction, and port construction) have substantially affected the evolution of the coastal ecological environment. Previous landscape ecological risk assessment studies have documented the effectiveness of assessing the quality of ecological environment processes. However, these studies have either focused on the noncoastal zone, or they have not considered the evolution of the spatial characteristics and ecological risk evolution of the landscape at an optimal scale. Here, we present a landscape ecological risk pattern (LERP) evolution model, based on two successive steps: first, we constructed an optimal scale method with an appropriate extent and grain using multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI images acquired in the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2013 and 2017, and then we calculated landscape ecological risk indices. Based on this model, the entire process of the spatiotemporal evolution of ecological risk patterns of the open coastal wetlands in Jiangsu, China, was determined. The principal findings are as follows: (1) The main landscape types in the study area are tidal flats and farmland, and the main features of the landscape evolution are a significant increase in aquafarming and a substantial decrease in the tidal flat area, while the landscape heterogeneity increased; (2) In the past 20 years, the areas of low and relatively low ecological risk in the study region were greatly reduced, while the areas of medium, relatively high, and high ecological risk greatly increased; the areas of high-grade ecological risk areas are mainly around Dongtai and Dafeng; (3) The area of ecological risk from low-grade to high-grade occupied 71.75% of the study area during 2000-2017. During the previous periods (2000-2004 and 2004-2008), the areas of low-grade ecological risk were transformed to areas of middle-grade ecological risk area, while during the later periods (2008-2013 and 2013-2017) there was a substantial increase in the proportion of areas of high-grade ecological risk. Our results complement the official database of coastal landscape planning, and provide important information for assessing the potential effects of MMLL processes on coastal environments.

TI  - Piecewise Linear Retrieval Suspended Particulate Matter for the Yellow River Estuary Based on Landsat8 OLI
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much sediment is transported into Bohai by Yellow River every year. Therefore the study on suspended matter concentration(SPM) in Yellow River estuary is significant to the environmental monitoring and sediment transport of surrounding ocean. The piecewise linear retrieval model was proposed based on the remote sensing reflectance and suspended matter concentration synchronous sampled in summer and winter in 2011. The results showed: the sensitive bands combination for suspended matter concentration inversion was different under different concentration ranges, (600 similar to 700 nm) /(400 similar to 600 nm) and (750 similar to 900 nm)/(420 similar to 720 nm) respectively to the concentration range below and above 50 mg . L-1 , and the corresponding bands for Landsat 8 OLI were B4/B2 and B5/B3 respectively. The R-2, RMSE and APD of the Piecewise model were 0. 873 5, 4. 08 mg . L-1 and 22. 81% (SPM <= 50 mg . L-1) , 0. 969 3, 102. 96 mg . L-1, and 17. 51% (SPM>50 mg . L-1) respectively, and 0. 975 3, 67. 03 mg . L-1 and 20. 45% for the overall concentration, which were better than parameters of common single model under entire concentration range. In summary, the piecewise linear retrieval model is more suitable for suspended matter concentration inversion of the Yellow River estuary with large variation of concentration.

TI  - Using Dual-Polarization Interferograms to Correct Atmospheric Effects for InSAR Topographic Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric effect represents one of the major error sources for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), particularly for the repeat-pass InSAR data. In order to further improve the practicability of InSAR technology, it is essential to study how to estimate and eliminate the undesired impact of atmospheric effects. In this paper, we propose the multi-resolution weighted correlation analysis (MRWCA) method between the dual-polarization InSAR data to estimate and correct atmospheric effects for InSAR topographic mapping. The study is based on the a priori knowledge that atmospheric effects is independent of the polarization. To find the identical atmospheric phase (ATP) signals of interferograms in different polarizations, we need to remove the other same or similar phase components. Using two different topographic data, differential interferometry was firstly performed so that the obtained differential interferograms (D-Infs) have different topographic error phases. A polynomial fitting method is then used to remove the orbit error phases. Thus, the ATP signals are the only identical components in the final obtained D-Infs. By using a forward wavelet transform, we break down the obtained D-Infs into building blocks based on their frequency properties. We then applied weighted correlation analysis to estimate the wavelet coefficients attributed to the atmospheric effects. Thus, the ATP signals can be obtained by the refined wavelet coefficients during inverse wavelet transform (IWT). Lastly, we tested the proposed method by the L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-1 PALSAR dual-polarization SAR data pairs covering the San Francisco (USA) and Moron (Mongolia) regions. By using Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data as the reference data, we evaluated the vertical accuracy of the InSAR digital elevation models (DEMs) with and without atmospheric effects correction, which shows that, for the San Francisco test site, the corrected interferogram could provide a DEM with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.79 m, which is an improvement of 40.5% with respect to the DEM without atmospheric effects correction. For the Moron test site, the corrected interferogram could provide a DEM with an RMSE of 10.74 m, which is an improvement of 30.2% with respect to the DEM without atmospheric effects correction.

TI  - Mapping Mining Areas in the Brazilian Amazon Using MSI/Sentinel-2 Imagery (2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mining plays an important role for the economy of the Amazon, little is known about its attributes such as area, type, scale, and current status as well as socio/environmental impacts. Therefore, we first propose a low time-consuming and high detection accuracy method for mapping the current mining areas within 13 regions of the Brazilian Amazon using Sentinel-2 images. Then, integrating the maps in a GIS (Geography Information System) environment, mining attributes for each region were further assessed with the aid of the DNPM (National Department for Mineral Production) database. Detection of the mining area was conducted in five main steps. (a) MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument)/Sentinel-2A (S2A) image selection; (b) definition of land-use classes and training samples; (c) supervised classification; (d) vector editing for quality control; and (e) validation with high-resolution RapidEye images (Kappa = 0.70). Mining areas derived from validated S2A classification totals 1084.7 km(2) in the regions analyzed. Small-scale mining comprises up to 64% of total mining area detected comprises mostly gold (617.8 km(2)), followed by tin mining (73.0 km(2)). The remaining 36% is comprised by industrial mining such as iron (47.8), copper (55.5) and manganese (8.9 km(2)) in Carajas, bauxite in Trombetas (78.4) and Rio Capim (48.5 km(2)). Given recent events of mining impacts, the large extension of mining areas detected raises a concern regarding its socio-environmental impacts for the Amazonian ecosystems and for local communities.

TI  - Role of frozen section in sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer in the era of the ACOSOG Z0011 and IBCSG 23-10 trials
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intraoperative frozen sections (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were evaluated to avoid the need for deferred axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with early breast cancer (EBC). However, FS has low sensitivity for detecting micro-metastases (<2 mm), resulting in patients who later undergo deferred ALND. The aim of the study was to determine the best clinical approach for selecting patients who would derive real benefit from ALND, as well as to minimize the functional and psychological damage caused by delayed surgery, and the risk of undertreating EBC patients.Methods: This study evaluated 1453 patients with early breast cancer (EBC) who underwent SLN biopsy, FS and definitive evaluation. Causes of discrepancies between SLN biopsy and FS results and the need for further surgery were evaluated.Results: A total of 1226 (86%) patients underwent FS; of these patients, 146 (11.9%) were false negatives. The global sensitivity of FS in detecting both macro and micrometastases was 53.7%. Although ACOSOG Z0011 criteria found that ALND could be avoided in 236 patients, 40 (17%) of these had >3 positive axillary lymph nodes. In contrast, application of the IBCSG 23-10 trial criteria, found that only three patients (3.1%) had >3 positive axillary lymph nodes.Conclusions: FS has a low sensitivity in detecting micrometastases (19%), but a reasonable sensitivity for macrometastases (75%). Most false negatives were smaller metastases (mean 2.1 mm) and more likely in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Retrospective modelling of the IBCSG 23-10 criteria reduced the percentage of patients requiring deferred surgery from 12% to 4%. Guidelines recommend irradiation of lymph node drainage stations in patients with >= 4 axillary metastatic lymph nodes. Omission of ALND from 40% of patients who met Z0011 criteria would have resulted in their undertreatment. This risk decreases to 3% by omitting axillary clearing only in patients with micrometastases.

TI  - Using multi-level fusion of local features for land-use scene classification with high spatial resolution images in urban coastal zones
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring scene-level land-use in urban coastal zones has become a critical and challenging task, due to the rising risk of marine disasters and the greater number of scene classes such as harbors. Since street blocks are physical containers of different classes of land-use in urban zones, some scene classification methods based on high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images take blocks segmented by roads as classification units. However, these methods extract handcrafted low-level features from remote sensing images, limiting their ability to represent street blocks. To extract semantically meaningful representations of street blocks, the sparse auto-encoder (SAE) model was employed for local feature extraction in this paper and a multi-level method based on the fusion of local features was proposed for block-based land-use scene classification in urban coastal zones. First, convolved feature maps of street blocks were extracted by taking the hidden layer of the SAE as convolution kernels. Then, the local features were fused at three levels to generate more robust and discriminative representations of patches in convolved feature maps. The combination patterns and the absolute relationship of local features were captured at the first and second level, respectively. A convolution neural network was utilized to make the local features more discriminative to semantic information at the third level. Finally, the bag-of-visual-words model was employed to generate global features for street blocks. The proposed method was tested for Qingdao, China using Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite images and an overall accuracy of 83.80% was achieved in the study area. The classification results indicate that the proposed method in concert with GF-2 images has potential for accurately monitoring land-use scenes in urban coastal zones.

TI  - Coherence Difference Analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR Interferogram to Identify Earthquake-Induced Disasters in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a workflow that enables the accurate identification of earthquake-induced damage zones by using coherence image pairs of the Sentinel-1 satellite before and after an earthquake event. The workflow uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing to account for coherence variations between coseismic and preseismic image pairs. The coherence difference between two image pairs is useful information to detect specific disasters in a regional-scale area after an earthquake event. To remove background effects such as the atmospheric effect and ordinal surface changes, this study employs the two-step threshold method to develop the coseismic coherence difference (CCD) map for our analyses. Thirty-four Sentinel-1 images between January 2015 and February 2016 were collected to process 30 preseismic image pairs and two coseismic image pairs for assessing multiple types of disasters in Tainan City of southwestern Taiwan, where severe damages were observed after the Meinong earthquake event. The coseismic unwrapping phases were further calculated to estimate the surface displacement in east-west and vertical directions. Results in the CCD map agree well with the observations from post-earthquake field surveys. The workflow can accurately identify earthquake-induced land subsidence and surface displacements, even for areas with insufficient geological data or for areas that had been excluded from the liquefaction potential map. In addition, the CCD details the distribution of building damages and structure failures, which might be useful information for emergency actions applied to regional-scale problems. The conversion of 2D surface displacement reveals the complex behavior of geological activities during the earthquake. In the foothill area of Tainan City, the opposite surface displacements in local areas might be influenced by the axis activities of the Kuanmiao syncline.

TI  - Multidimensional Arrays for Analysing Geoscientific Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Geographic data is growing in size and variety, which calls for big data management tools and analysis methods. To efficiently integrate information from high dimensional data, this paper explicitly proposes array-based modeling. A large portion of Earth observations and model simulations are naturally arrays once digitalized. This paper discusses the challenges in using arrays such as the discretization of continuous spatiotemporal phenomena, irregular dimensions, regridding, high-dimensional data analysis, and large-scale data management. We define categories and applications of typical array operations, compare their implementation in open-source software, and demonstrate dimension reduction and array regridding in study cases using Landsat and MODIS imagery. It turns out that arrays are a convenient data structure for representing and analysing many spatiotemporal phenomena. Although the array model simplifies data organization, array properties like the meaning of grid cell values are rarely being made explicit in practice.

TI  - EUROSCEPTICISM AMONG CHRISTIAN CHURCHES: BETWEEN A DREAM OF THE "UNITED EUROPE" AND DEFENSE OF RELIGIOUS VALUES
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the attitude of Christian Churches to the Euroscepticism. The author states that the Euroscepticism in the religious context is not equal to the primitive Fundamentalism (with xenophobia and intolerance elements), but could be described as a complex political phenomenon that supports the existence of European structures. The Catholic Church became a traditional base for rethinking of integration processes. The Catholic worldview is supported by state and semi-state Churches of the Western and Northern Europe, in the first hand, the Lutheran Churches of Germany and Scandinavian nations. They are allies of all European institutions because of their traditional loyal position towards authorities and their own liberal evolution. A decentralized structure of the European Orthodoxy determines the diversity of opinions and different impressions of the European future. The role of the Churches in the context of Brexit in the United Kingdom is analyzed particularly. Inside political clashes over the unity of Europe, the liberal Anglican Church and conservative Catholic Church are on one pole. On the opposite pole, there are the critics and enemies of the EU - the conservative Fundamentalists from the Evangelical Protestant Churches. The political spectrum of Christian worldviews is represented in the majority of European countries. The main components of the Christian Euroscepticism are: the defense of evangelical values rooted in the Bible (that unites Orthodox Christians, Catholics, conservative Protestants-Evangelicals); promotion of the Christian legacy of Europe (that unites Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Lutherans, less Evangelicals); preserving of a national peculiarity against infringements of a liberal bureaucracy (that unites Orthodox Christians, less Catholics).

TI  - Multiple roles of lymphatic vessels in tumor progression
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node metastasis is a prognostic indicator for systemic tumor spread in many types of cancers, and tumor lymphangiogenesis correlates with reduced survival. Consequently, lymphatic vessels have been suggested to promote tumor progression in multiple ways. Tumor lymphangiogenesis occurs both in primary tumors and at distant (pre-) metastatic sites, and facilitates lymphatic invasion and tumor cell dissemination. Lymphatic vessels have also emerged as regulators of tumor immunity, transporting tumor antigens to lymph nodes and directly interacting with immune cells. Furthermore, lymphatic vessels might provide a 'lymphovascular' niche contributing to the maintenance of stem-like tumor cells that are tightly related to tumor recurrence. Thus, targeting tumor lymphangiogenesis or specific lymphatic-associated functions might represent a promising approach to inhibit tumor progression.

TI  - Unexpected contribution of lymphatic vessels to promotion of distant metastatic tumor spread
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor lymphangiogenesis is accompanied by a higher incidence of sentinel lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival in several types of cancer. We asked whether tumor lymphangiogenesis might also occur in distant organs with established metastases and whether it might promote further metastatic spread of those metastases to other organs. Using mouse metastasis models, we found that lymphangiogenesis occurred in distant lung metastases and that some metastatic tumor cells were located in lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes. In metastasis-bearing lungs of melanoma patients, a higher lymphatic density within and around metastases and lymphatic invasion correlated with poor outcome. Using a transgenic mouse model with inducible expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) in the lung, we found greater growth of lung metastases, with more abundant dissemination to other organs. Our findings reveal unexpected contributions of lymphatics in distant organs to the promotion of growth of metastases and their further spread to other organs, with potential clinical implications for adjuvant therapies in patients with metastatic cancer.

TI  - An investigation of an open-access model for scaling up methadone maintenance treatment
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims To examine retrospectively patient and programmatic outcomes following the development and implementation of an 'open-access' model in which prospective patients were enrolled rapidly in methadone maintenance treatment, irrespective of ability to pay, and provided real-time access to multiple voluntary treatment options. Design Medical and administrative records were abstracted to compare data for 1 year before and 9 years after initiating the implementation of an open-access treatment model in May 2007. Setting Methadone maintenance treatment center in Connecticut, USA. Participants Individuals with opioid use disorder entering treatment between July 2006 and June 2015. In June 2015, 64% (n=2594) of the sample were men and 80% (n=3133) reported that they were white. Intervention The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment-informed open-access treatment model uses process improvement strategies to improve treatment access and capacity. Measurements Census, waiting time, retention, non-medical opioid use, patient mortality and financial sustainability (net income and state-block grants as proportions of revenue). Findings In the 9 years following the initial implementation of the open-access model, patient census increased by 183% from 1431 to 4051, and average waiting-time days decreased from 21 to 0.3 (same day) without apparent deleterious effects on rates of retention, non-medical opioid use or mortality. Between fiscal years (FY) 06 and FY 15, net operating margin rose from 2 to 10%, while state-block grant revenues declined 14% and the proportion of total revenue from state-block grant revenue decreased from 49 to 24%. Conclusions An open-access model for rapid enrolment of people with opioid use disorder in methadone treatment appears to improve treatment access, capacity, and financial sustainability without evidence of deleterious effects on treatment outcomes.

TI  - Simultaneous Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Lymphatic Drainage of Chelator-Free <SUP>64</SUP>Cu-Labeled Nanoparticles
T2  - CANCER BIOTHERAPY AND RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems have been taken in use as new clinical diagnostic tools including detection and therapy planning of cancer. To reduce the amount of contrast agents injected in patients while fully benefitting both modalities, dual-modality probes are required. Material and methods: This study was first aimed at developing a hybrid PET-MRI probe by labeling superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with Cu-64 using a fast and chelator-free conjugation method, and second, to demonstrate the ability of the agent to target sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in vivo using simultaneous PET-MRI imaging. Results: High labeling efficiency of 97% produced within 10-15min was demonstrated at room temperature. Cu-64-SPIONs were chemically stable in mouse serum for 24h and after intradermal injection in the hind paw of C57BL/6J mice, demonstrated specific accumulation in the SLN. Simultaneous PET-MRI clearly demonstrated visualization of Cu-64-SPIONs, in dynamic and static imaging sequences up to 24h after administration. Conclusion: The use of a single hybrid probe and simultaneous hybrid imaging provides an efficient, complementary integration of quantitation and is expected to improve preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance of cancer treatments.

TI  - Keep calm and eat satay: Indonesia's consumption-themed signals of defiance against terrorism
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many have noted the unique response of the Indonesian society to the bombing attacks that happened in Jakarta in January 2016. Whereas other societies have shown a variety of responses ranging from displaying regional solidarity to counter-aggression, Indonesians took to social media with irreverent, consumption-themed messages against the perceived terrorist agenda. We used symbolic interactionism as a lens to frame an analysis of Indonesian social media and news articles following the attacks to investigate the underlying factors influencing the gestation of this unique response. We found the interplay of various Indonesian cultural characteristics were influential in the collective negotiation of identity against the worldview threats of terrorism. This research is thought to be the first to investigate a phenomenon where the idea of consumption itself is used as an instrument of social resilience.

TI  - Precursor anomalies prior to the 2006 Java and 2016 Yujing earthquakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents analysis of surface latent heat flux (SLHF), disturbance storm time (Dst) index and auroral electrojet index (AE) variations prior to the M-w 6.3 Java (Indonesia) and M-w 6.4 Yujing (Taiwan) earthquakes. SLHF results were obtained using satellite remote sensing techniques and reanalysis datasets. Multi-year background data was utilized to compute anomalies. The results exhibit spatial and temporal anomalous variations of SLHF before the main event. SLHF anomalies usually occurred 1-3 weeks prior to the earthquake. These variations were caused due to temperature increase and the release of gases before the earthquake. The release of energy was concentrated along the epicenter and regional fault lines. Dst and AE indices analysis show the presence of geomagnetic storm prior to the occurrence of earthquakes and the synchronization of geomagnetic surges and seismicity. The study will help to identify precursor anomalies in regions prone to earthquakes.
