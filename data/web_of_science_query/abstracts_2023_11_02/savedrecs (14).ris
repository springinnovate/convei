T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was carried out to acquire the optimized retrieval algorithm by the random forest method and based on remote sensing data to monitor total nitrogen and phosphorus parameters as key drivers for eutrophication in water bodies. For this purpose, the water quality monitoring data of Chitgar Lake in Tehran were used, which is an artificial shallow lake with recreational and urban scenery usage. The Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images were extracted after matching the date of field observation data and satellite images from 2014 to 2021. Data were divided into calibration and validation datasets. After performing pre-processing processes on satellite images, important bands were recognized using the random forest method. After that, appropriate band compositions and algorithms were selected and regression models were fitted and validated. The optimum model based on Sentinel-2 data was able to estimate total nitrogen concentration with Adj.R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.24 mg. L-1 and NRMSE = 15% as well as total phosphorus concentration with Adj.R2 = 0.6, RMSE = 0.012 mg. L-1 and NRMSE = 9% accom-panied by the power of 80% in the study area. Consequently, the optimal retrieving algorithm was chosen in the synergy of satellite data and the random forest. Moreover, the predictive model has a promising capability to estimate the concentration of the objective parameters in Chitgar Lake with acceptable accuracy.

TI  - Application of geospatial and remote sensing data to support locust management
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative impacts on agricultural activities by different locust species are well documented and have always been one of the major threats to food security and livelihoods, especially for local communities. Locust management and control have led to less frequent and intense plagues and outbreaks worldwide. However, political insecurity and armed conflicts affect locust management, and can as well as changing climate, and land use management contribute to new outbreaks. In the context of the increasing world population and higher demand for agricultural production, locust pests will remain of high concern. Geospatial and remote sensing data have become an important source of information for different applications within locust research and management. However, there is still a gap between available information and actual practical usage. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of geospatial and remote sensing data and how this information can be prepared for a straightforward application for stakeholders. For this purpose, we use the h3-hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system to simplify and structure spatial information into standardized hexagon units. The presented concept provides decision makers and ground teams with a simplified information database that contains area-wide information over time and space and can be used without detailed geospatial knowledge and background. The concept is designed for the use case of Italian locust management in the Pavlodar region (Kazakhstan) and based on actual practices. It can be extrapolated to any other study area or species of interest. Our results underline the importance of actual land management on locust presence. Up-to-date land management information can be derived from time-series analyses of remote sensing data. Furthermore, essential meteorological data are used to generate locust-specific climatic characteristics within the h3-system. Within this system, areal prioritizing for locust management can be achieved based on the included spatial information and experience from ongoing practices.

TI  - A role for pelvic sentinel lymph nodes in lower extremity melanoma?
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Consensus on management of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (PSLNs) has not been reached and thus the extent of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of the groin in melanoma patients varies among centers and surgeons. Lymphatic drainage to PSLNs is often identified in, but the diagnostic and clinical relevance of PSLNs has been debated. Our aim was to determine if the presence of PSLNs affected recurrence or survival rates in patients with melanoma in the lower extremities.Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 702 patients with cutaneous melanoma operated between 2005 and 2018. Of these, 134 patients with melanoma in the lower extremities were included in the study. Images of lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT studies were thoroughly observed together with surgery reports to define the status of SLNs.Results: Overall, 85 of 134 patients went through SLNB and 28 of them had PSLN identified. Two had their PSLN removed, which led 26 patients with PSLN to be compared to the 57 who did not have PSLN identified. We did not find statistically significant differences in overall recurrence (26.9% versus 28.0%, p = 1.00), regional nodal recurrence (11.5% versus 15.8%, p = 0.67), local or in-transit recurrence (19.2% versus 8.8%, p = 0.17), or distant recurrence rates (15.4% versus 19.3%, p = 0.66). Disease-free survival did not differ between the groups (median 23.0 (IQR 15.0-39.0) versus 19.0 (IQR 10.3-61.8) months, p = 0.82). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference in melanoma-specific 5-year survival (78.6% versus 87.2%, p = 0.42).Conclusions: We did not find more frequent recurrence, shorter disease-free survival, or poorer melanoma-specific survival in patients with drainage to PSLN. Our findings strengthen the evidence that PSLNs should not be routinely biopsied if they are not the first-tier nodes.

TI  - Level Set Discrete Element Method for modeling sea ice floes
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and projecting seasonal variations in sea ice is necessary to improve global climate predictions. However, accurately capturing changes in sea ice and its interactions with ocean and atmosphere variability remains a challenge for models, notably due to its complex behavior at the floe scale. In this work, we introduce a method to capture the floe-like behavior of sea ice, named the 'Level Set Discrete Element Method for Sea Ice' (LS-ICE). This model can resolve individual sea ice floes with realistic shapes, and represent their physical interactions by leveraging level-set functions for detecting contact between floes. LS-ICE can also be coupled to heat and momentum forcings from the atmosphere and the ocean, and simulate associated melt and breakage processes. The discrete representation of sea ice floes reveals melt dynamics, associated with their shapes and thickness distributions, which are currently not well represented by continuum models. We illustrate the model capabilities for two different years involving the spring to summer transition in Baffin Bay, where the sea ice concentration declines from approximately 80% to 0% between the months of June and July. Satellite imagery, along with oceanographic reanalysis data based on field measurements, are used to initialize the model and validate its subsequent evolution during these months. For an appropriate set of parameters, the model can reproduce the evolution of sea ice concentration, floe size distribution, oceanic temperature and mean sea ice thickness, despite only a small number of tunable parameters. This study identifies the potential for LS-ICE to simulate the interaction between floe shape, melt and breakage, to enhance seasonal scale forecasts for sea ice floes. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A noise removal algorithm based on adaptive elevation difference thresholding for ICESat-2 photon-counting data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) has shown great potential for near-shore bathymetry. Unavoidably, the photon data acquired has a lot of noise. In order to remove noise more accurately, a photon denoising algorithm based on adaptive elevation difference thresholding (AEDTA) is proposed under the assumption that the terrain is continuously changing. The algorithm uses a Gaussian function obtained by fitting an elevation histogram to ICESat-2 data for the extraction of underwater photons. Repeatedly count the elevation difference histogram of underwater photons and adaptively determine the threshold. And the final denoised underwater signal photons are obtained. Compared with the conventional clustering method of ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS), our algorithm achieves better photon detection results for under-water topography for different densities of ICESat-2 data and has the advantage of parameter adaption without human intervention. ICESat-2 data from Ganquan Island, Dongdao Island and Oahu Island were selected for testing, and the ICESat-2 bathymetry results calculated by the algorithm were compared with in situ bathymetry data to assess the reliability and accuracy of the proposed denoising algorithm. The results show that the MAE of the bathymetry results calculated using the ICESat-2 signal photon data extracted by the method ranged from 0.54 to 1.57 m and the RMSE ranged from 0.64 to 1.74 m in different seas. The algorithm can provide high quality denoised data for bathymetric mapping around coastal areas and islands. Meanwhile, the AEDTA algo-rithm also has a good denoising effect on terrestrial photons, and the effect of cloud shading on the Gaussian fit analysis of ICESat-2 data cannot be ignored.

TI  - Quantification of the uncertainty in multiscale validation of coarse-resolution satellite albedo products: A study based on airborne CASI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty in the multiscale validation of coarse-pixel satellite albedo product significantly reduces the reliability of validation results but has not yet been quantitatively assessed. To close this knowledge gap, this study first analyzed the main uncertainty factors in the procedure of multiscale validation, and then proposed the quantification method for measuring the uncertainty caused by different factors. Finally, the propagation law of these uncertainty factors into the final uncertainty of validation results was established. Our analysis demonstrates that the uncertainty of multiscale validation mainly comes from the errors in high-resolution albedo maps, the errors generated in the upscaling process, and the errors caused by the geolocation mismatch between reference albedo and satellite albedo. These uncertainty factors are uncorrelated with each other and linearly propagated into the final uncertainty of validation results. The influence of these uncertainty factors partly depends on their magnitudes and partly depends on their weighting coefficients. The systematic errors in highresolution albedo maps propagate into the errors of pixel scale ground "truth" linearly with slope coefficients equal to or slightly smaller than 1, depending on the std. of noise. And then the pixel scale ground "truth" propagates into the final validation results with the weighting coefficient close to -1. But the non-systematic errors are more likely to be balanced out through the upscaling process in the case of a small subpixel size. The errors generated in the upscaling procedure are generally within the range of -3%-3%. Moreover, their negative weighting coefficients are very small, with a magnitude of less than 0.01. Consequently, the contribution of the errors generated in the upscaling process is negligibly small. By contrast, the errors caused by geolocation mismatch are significant, with the values ranging from -10% to 25%, which exceed the 5% accuracy requirement of satellite albedo products proposed by GCOS. Furthermore, its contribution to the overall uncertainty of validation results is significant, with large weighting coefficients close to 1. The magnitudes of these uncertainty factors and their weighting coefficients show dependence on subpixel sizes. Generally, a fine subpixel size is preferred in multiscale validation because it not only reduces the influence of non-systematic errors of high-resolution albedo maps but also enables more stable and reliable upscaling results. This study deepens the consciousness and understanding of the uncertainty embedded in multiscale validation results, which takes an important step toward more reliable validation over heterogeneous surfaces.

TI  - Radiometric cross-calibration of Sentinel-2B MSI with HY-1C SCS based on the near simultaneous imaging of common ground targets
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - To simplify the cross-calibration process accuracy, this paper proposes a cross-calibration Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) carried by Sentinel that is, the satellite calibration spectrometer (SCS) sensor and establishes the calibration process. SCS and MSI spectral channels is performed by data to eliminate the difference in band settings cross-calibration coefficients. The SNO-x inherited method is used as a prediction method to carry low-latitude regions, which improves the cross-calibration range of calibration. The cross-calibration coefficients were obtained by processing the earth observation 2019. Then, the cross-calibration coefficients and other ground objects with different reflectance, cross-calibration results are evaluated with the Moderate (MODIS) carried by Terra as a reference. To improve band adjustment factor between the corresponding the measured reflectance of MODIS based on the directly obtained by processing the MSI image reflectance obtained based on the cross-calibration reflectance, and the reflectance corrected by the used as the MODIS-calculated reflectance. The relative error (RMSRE) between the MODIS-calculated reflectance is 2.16% and that the mean RMSRE and the MSI-measured reflectance is 3.05%, indicating calibration coefficients is closer to the MODIS-calculated source in the cross-calibration is analyzed, and 4.03%, indicating that SCS can be used as a reference (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the #479445 Journal (c) 2023 Received 27 Oct 2022; revised 19

TI  - A novel integrated approach for monitoring drought stress in an aeolian desertification area using Vegetation Drought Status Index
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a costly natural disaster. The accuracy and applicability of different drought indexes in drought monitoring at different research areas are also different. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system technology, we propose a new RS-based drought index, Vegetation Drought Status Index (VDSI), for agricultural drought monitoring in both arid and humid regions using multi-sensor data. This index combines the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and data from 81 verification points regarding the in situ soil drought status. The model was applied to drought monitoring in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. Based on the comprehensive influence of water absorption on the reflectance spectrum of vegetation and soil, the reflectance of soil in MODIS bands B6 and B7 is generally higher than that of vegetation, so the model can directly obtain the surface soil moisture index. The correlation analysis (R-2 > 0.79) was valid; the change trends were the same; i.e., VDSI is a reliable referential index for agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with computed tomography lymphography for mast cell tumours and a comparison between regional and sentinel lymph node histological status: Sixty-two cases
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - It is known that the regional lymph node (RLN) may not correspond to the sentinel lymph node (SLN) (the first lymph node draining the tumour), and many diagnostic techniques have recently been aimed at its detection. Although lymphoscintigraphy is the gold standard in both human and veterinary medicine for SLN mapping, it is relatively unavailable in veterinary medicine due to costs and difficult management of the radiotracer. This prospective study evaluated, as a first aim, the feasibility and sensitivity of the computed tomography lymphography (CTL) in detecting the SLN in 62 mast cell tumours (MCTs). The second aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the CTL in identifying the most representative lymph node of the patient's lymphatic status; the histological status of the SNL was compared with that of the RLN, to see in how many cases the patient's stage would have changed according to the RLN. When the RLN turned out to be also the SLN it was decided to excise, as a control LN, the one localised in the neighbourhood of the MCT (neighbouring lymph node; NLN). The detection rate was 90%, with failure of SLN identification in six cases. In 18 (32%) of 56 MCTs with a diagnostic CTL, the SLN did not correspond to the RLN. Forty-five MCTs were surgically removed, together with their corresponding SLN and RLN/NLN. Since the clinical stage of the patient would have changed in only 7% of cases, CTL is a reliable method of detecting the SLN and, for staging purposes, there is no need to remove other LNs.

TI  - A spatial regression approach to modeling urban land surface temperature
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is the instantaneous radiative skin temperature of land obtained from satellite sensors. Measured by visible, infrared or microwave sensors, the LST is useful in determining thermal comfort for urban planning. It also serves as a precursor to many underly-ing impacts such as health, climate change and the likelihood of rainfall. Due to the paucity of observed data because of cloud cover or rain-bearing clouds in the case of microwave sensors, it is necessary to model LST for the purpose of forecasting. Two spatial regression models were employed: the spatial lag model and the spatial error model. Using Landsat 8 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), these models can be studied and compared in terms of their ro-bustness in reproducing LST. Whereas LST is to be the independent variable, built-up area, water surface, albedo, elevation, and vegetation are to be considered as dependent variables and their relative contributions to LST examined.center dot Modeling LST based on spatial regression models with calculated LST as independent variable.center dot Dependent variables to be considered are normalised difference Built-up index (NDBI), nor-malised difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI), albedo and elevation.center dot The models were validated using k-fold cross validation method, mean square error and stan-dard deviation.

TI  - Recognising the embedded child in child protection: Children?s participation, inequalities and cultural capital
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Children's right to participation in child protection decision-making is supported by moral imperatives and in-ternational conventions. The fragmented implementation of this right reflects a conflicted discursive terrain that attempts to incorporate both children's agency and their need for protection. This article uses two theoretical lenses to further examine this terrain: child welfare inequalities and cultural capital. These theories highlight how social inequities and cultural capital relating to culture and class affect participation processes and out-comes. . An unintended consequence of constructing children within a traditional liberal account of rights , is reduced recognition of the culturally contested nature of an individualistic construction of children. Constructing children in this way excises children from their social backgrounds and promotes the notion of a 'universal child'. With a particular focus on class, culture and professional paradigms, I argue that the ways children's views are elicited, the content of those views, and how they are interpreted, are subject to a set of professional assumptions that take little cognisance of the social backround of children. This includes norms relating to class and culture, and the oppressive structural relations relating to those two factors including racialisation. Concepts such as attachment theory, the 'adultification' of children of colour, the diminishing of Indigenous concepts of children and childhood, and the pre-eminence of the 'concerted cultivation' middle class parenting style are some ways this lack of recognition is enacted. The child's cultural worldview and manner of expressing it may clash with professional cultures that prefer and reward verbal expression, independence, and entitlement when negotiating preferences with representatives of powerful social institutions (such as child protection systems). Many children may not comply with this expectation due to cultural and class socialisation processes, and the histories of the oppressive functions of child protection systems. As most child protection organisations must engage in constant translation of children's cultural capital to ensure participation, devolving authority and resources to affected communities may better serve children's rights to participation. Communities reflecting children's own, may be more able to offer full recognition to children and enable their participation more effectively.

TI  - Trade Wind Boundary Layer Turbulence and Shallow Precipitating Convection: New Insights Combining SAR Images, Satellite Brightness Temperature, and Airborne In Situ Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The imprint of marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) dynamical structures on sea surface roughness, as seen from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions, is investigated. We focus on 13 February 2020, a case study of the elucidating the role of clouds-circulation coupling in climate field campaign. For suppressed conditions, convective rolls imprint on sea surface roughness is confirmed through the intercomparison with MABL turbulent organization deduced from airborne measurements. A discretization of the SAR wide swath into 25 x 25 km(2) tiles then allows us to capture the spatial variability of the turbulence organization varying from rolls to cells. Second, we objectively detect cold pools within the SAR image and combine them with geostationary brightness temperature. The geometrical or physically-based metrics of cold pools are correlated to cloud properties. This provides a promising methodology to analyze the dynamics of convective systems as seen from below and above.

TI  - Identifying lakes at risk of toxic cyanobacterial blooms using satellite imagery and field surveys across the United States
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms caused by cyanobacteria are a threat to global water resources and human health. Satellite remote sensing has vastly expanded spatial and temporal data on lake cyanobacteria, yet there is still acute need for tools that identify which waterbodies are at-risk for toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Algal toxins cannot be directly detected through imagery but monitoring toxins associated with cyanobacterial blooms is critical for assessing risk to the environment, animals, and people. The objective of this study is to address this need by developing an approach relating satellite imagery on cyanobacteria with field surveys to model the risk of toxic blooms among lakes. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and United States (US) National Lakes Assessments are leveraged to model the probability among lakes of exceeding lower and higher demonstration thresholds for microcystin toxin, cyanobacteria, and chlorophyll a. By leveraging the large spatial variation among lakes using two national-scale data sources, rather than focusing on temporal variability, this approach avoids many of the previous challenges in relating satellite imagery to cyanotoxins. For every satellite-derived lake-level Cyanobacteria Index (CI_cyano) increase of 0.01 CI_cyano/km2, the odds of exceeding six bloom thresholds increased by 23-54 %. When the models were applied to the 2192 satellite monitored lakes in the US, the number of lakes identified with >= 75 % probability of exceeding the thresholds included as many as 335 lakes for the lower thresholds and 70 lakes for the higher thresholds, respectively. For microcystin, the models identified 162 and 70 lakes with >= 75 % probability of exceeding the lower (0.2 mu g/L) and higher (1.0 mu g/L) thresholds, respectively. This approach represents a critical advancement in using satellite imagery and field data to identify lakes at risk for developing toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Such models can help translate satellite data to aid water quality monitoring and management.

TI  - Effects of thinning intensity and rotation length on albedo- and carbon stock-based radiative forcing in boreal Norway spruce stands
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated how thinning intensity and rotation length affect radiative forcing, and thus climate warming or cooling, through changes in albedo and carbon stocks in Norway spruce (Picea abies Kart. (L.)) stands. Forest ecosystem model simulations were conducted under the current climate on sub-mesic sites in central Finland (62(o)N). Even-aged management regime with a business-as-usual (baseline) thinning from below over an 80-year rotation length was used as the reference management regime with which others were compared. Other even-aged management regimes included baseline thinning with +/- 20 per cent changes in basal area thinning thresholds over rotation lengths of 80, 100 and 120 years. Additionally, we used as a comparison an uneven-aged management regime, with selective cuttings (from above) at ca. 15-year intervals, and no management regime, over the simulation periods of 80-120 years. Under even-aged management, a simultaneous decrease in thinning intensity and extension of rotation length from 80 to 120 years reduced total radiative forcing compared to the reference management regime. Thus, it had an overall net cooling effect. Under even-aged management with baseline thinning and/or higher thinning intensity with rotation lengths of 80-100 years, and under uneven-aged management, there was little net climatic effect. This was because the opposing effects of changes in albedo and ecosystem carbon stocks largely cancelled each other out. No management regime resulted in the highest net cooling effect but provided no harvest income for timber. Thus, proper incentives for forest owners would likely be required to promote such potential cooling effects in forest management.

TI  - Online fusion of multi-resolution multispectral images with weakly supervised temporal dynamics
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time satellite imaging has a central role in monitoring, detecting and estimating the intensity of key natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, etc. One important constraint of satellite imaging is the trade-off between spatial/spectral resolution and their revisiting time, a consequence of design and physical constraints imposed by satellite orbit among other technical limitations. In this paper, we focus on fusing multi-temporal, multi-spectral images where data acquired from different instruments with different spatial resolutions is used. We leverage the spatial relationship between images at multiple modalities to generate high-resolution image sequences at higher revisiting rates. To achieve this goal, we formulate the fusion method as a recursive state estimation problem and study its performance in filtering and smoothing contexts. Furthermore, a calibration strategy is proposed to estimate the time-varying temporal dynamics of the image sequence using only a small amount of historical image data. Differently from the training process in traditional machine learning algorithms, which usually require large datasets and computation times, the parameters of the temporal dynamical model are calibrated based on an analytical expression that uses only two of the images in the historical dataset. A distributed version of the Bayesian filtering and smoothing strategies is also proposed to reduce its computational complexity. To evaluate the proposed methodology we consider a water mapping task where real data acquired by the Landsat and MODIS instruments are fused generating high spatial- temporal resolution image estimates. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology outperforms the competing methods in both estimation accuracy and water mapping tasks.

TI  - Investigating spatial-temporal contamination for two environments of the Amazon estuary: A multivariate approach
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of environmental quality in Amazonian estuaries utilizing histological and immunohistochemical biomarkers concomitantly with analyses of trace metals in the tissues of Sciades herzbergii, also considering physical chemical analyzes of the water. 352 animals were captured from two sites and during two periods (dry and rainy). Site 1: Sa similar to o Marcos Bay - heavy anthropic influence and Site 2: Caete ' estuary-preserved estuary. In the laboratory, the fish were weighed (g) and measured (cm). Fragments of gills and liver were analyzed using histology and immunohistochemistry (Caspase 3). The specimens from Site 1 presented a low-value condition factor, with the highest concentrations of Al, Cd, and Hg appearing in the muscle, and most severe damages to gills and liver. In contrast, individuals from Site 2 presented a high-value condition factor and showed low metal concentrations in the muscle with only slight tissue lesions. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that seasonal changes affect metal modulation and pathologies in fish at Site 1. The sentinel species chosen in this study is considered a strong bioindicator of pollution and the combination of different biomarkers was efficient in providing a clear view of the signs of exposure to pollutants, and the risks posed to fish health by the presence of metals in the environment, especially in Site 1.

TI  - Synoptic Variability in Satellite Altimeter-Derived Radar Freeboard of Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of sea ice freeboard are integral to the estimation of sea ice thickness. It is commonly assumed that radar pulses from satellite-mounted Ku-band altimeters penetrate through the snow and reflect from the snow-ice interface. We would therefore expect a negative correlation between snow accumulation and radar freeboard measurements, as increased snow loading weighs the ice floe down. In this study we produce daily resolution radar freeboard products from the CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 altimeters via a recently developed optimal interpolation scheme. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between radar freeboard anomalies and modeled snow accumulation. This suggests that, in the period after snowfall, radar pulses are not scattering from the snow-ice interface as commonly assumed. Our results offer satellite-based evidence of winter Ku-band radar scattering above the snow-ice interface, violating a key assumption in sea ice thickness retrievals.

TI  - Investigation of teak defoliator,<i> Hyblaea</i><i> puera</i> (Cramer, 1777) outbreak on mangrove ecosystem in Mumbai metropolitan region using multi-spectral satellite data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem supports biodiversity and ecology and plays a vital role in providing economic security to coastal fishers. A severe outbreak of the moth Hyblaea puera occurred along the Thane creek in Mumbai (Maharashtra, India) between September and October 2019. The ecological interaction of pest species in a mangrove ecosystem is complex and very few detailed studies have been undertaken along the Indian coast. There is evidence that infestation can have a negative impact on the already threatened mangrove ecosystem. This study investigates the mangrove infestation, the influence of the infestation on the Leaf Area Index (LAI), rainfall's effect on such outbreaks' occurrence, and spectral reflectance in infested and non-infested mangroves. Sentinel 2 MSI data was processed using the QGIS platform. There were two dominant mangrove species, Avicennia marina and Sonneratia apetala, of which the most affected species was A. marina. The study revealed that 67.90% (50.61 km2) of the mangrove area defoliated due to this outbreak, out of which 30.20% (22.50 km2) was highly defoliated, 37.70% (28.11 km2) was less defoliated, and 32.10% (23.95 km2) was unaffected. LAI is the health indicator of a forest affected by an infestation; it indicates the reduction in canopy cover due to the infestation. The t-test was applied to determine the significance of LAI before and after the infestation along the upper stretch of the creek,t-value was 3.886 (p = 0.0011, p <= 0.05 significant). The spectral reflectance analysis showed a reduction in the infested mangrove's Vegetation Red Edge and Near InfraRed reflectance. The ANOVA result shows that the three groups, Mangrove Highly Infested, Mangrove Less Infested, and Non-Infested Mangrove, are likely spectrally separable (p = 0.020, p <= 0.05). The analysis revealed that rainfall intensity during an Infested year significantly differs from that in a Non-Infested year (p = 0.0067, p <= 0.05).

TI  - Global estimates of surface albedo from Sentinel-3 OLCI and SLSTR data for Copernicus Climate Change Service: Algorithm and preliminary validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is to supply reliable climate data in support of strategies to adaptation and mitigation to climate change. The C3S provides access to high-quality climate data through its Climate Data Records (CDRs) of atmospheric, marine and land Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Global Earth Surface Albedo (SA) satellite-based products are included in the land (biosphere) portfolio. SA is a magnitude which quantifies the fraction of solar energy reflected by the surface of the Earth. This paper details the retrieval methodology and preliminary validation results for global estimates of surface albedo based on Sentinel-3 observations for the C3S ECVs data (C3S SA v3.0). The retrieval algorithm exploits the synergistic use of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on-board Sentinel-3 A and B satellites. Firstly, the atmospherically corrected reflectances are generated in the Copernicus Global Land Service framework. After that, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) inversion module concludes the BRDF model parameters, which are transferred to the angular integration module in order to generate spectral albedo quantities for the selected OLCI (Oa03, Oa04, Oa07, Oa17 and Oa21) and SLSTR (S1, S2, S5 and S6) bands. At the end, the spectral integration module generates broadband albedo quantities in three different standard broadband spectral regions (visible [0.4 mu m - 0.7 mu m ], near infrared [0.7 mu m - 4 mu m] and total shortwave [0.3 mu m - 4 mu m]). Preliminary validation results over 10-months demonstration period (July 2018-April 2019) show, in terms of spatial and temporal consistency, that C3S Sentinel-3 SA global estimates reached in general good agreement as compared to other satellite operational references derived from MODIS (MCD43A3 C6) and PROBA-V (C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0) acquisitions. The comparison with ground data shows similar results to the MCD43A3 C6 comparisons but opposite sign in differences (marginally positive in case of Sentinel-3), with accuracy of 0.005 (3.7%), precision of 0.016 (11.3%) and uncertainty of 0.032 (22.7%). Our results have demonstrated the feasibility to estimate global fields of SA from Sentinel-3 observations, with similar quality of existing operational products. These Sentinel-3 based SA datasets will give the continuity to the existing C3S SA CDR, introducing improvements in terms of spatial resolution (300 m) and spectral information (9 spectral albedos) in contrast to previous datasets based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; 4 km, 4 channels) and Vegetation instruments (VGT; 1 km, 4 channels).

TI  - Satellite-based multi-annual yield models for major food crops at the household field level for nutrition and health research: A case study from the Nouna HDSS, Burkina Faso
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing frequencies of climate change-induced extreme weather events like prolonged droughts pose signif-icant challenges for small-scale subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, who rely on the yearly harvest by more than 80 % of their nutritional needs. However, we do not have a good understanding of yield estimates at the field and household level (with a mean field size of < 2 ha) to understand nutritional priorities in vulnerable communities due to their scarcity in the literature, particularly yield estimates that do not require re-collection of in-situ data. Statistical models for estimating regional food crop yields based on high-resolution satellite data at the field level may provide better insights into how to address health risks such as child malnutrition. Especially in low-resource contexts, where the burden is greatest and expected to worsen in future climate projections. Our study developed crop-specific, satellite-based yield models using a novel three-year data set of in-situ yield measurements as exemplified for a rural region in Burkina Faso. The aim of the model is to reduce the need for in -situ field data collection while still assuring accurate yield estimates at the field level. The model employed LASSO regression and was based on monthly vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 and weekly accu-mulated Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall data. Our yield modeling results showed that there was less overfitting when there was more training data over three years that demonstrated a wider range of yields, which also led to better model fits. R2 values ranged from 0.62 (Maize) to 0.3 (Sorghum) for the three-year yield models, with normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values ranging from 12 % -16 %. An additional plausibility check confirmed the validity of our models, as we compared the magnitude of our yield estimation with national yield statistics for Burkina Faso. We demonstrated that our models based on three years of in-situ data may capture some of the inter-annual variability in yields, which could be a step toward minimizing the necessity for in-situ measurements in the future. Our advances in pre-dicting yield estimates at the field level enable a linkage between household-level yields, socioeconomic in-dicators, nutritional status of children, and the health status of the household members. A further application is linking high-resolution yield data to farmers' productivity losses from increasing heat under climate change.

TI  - Retrieving bbp and POC from CALIOP: A deep neural network approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The CALIOP instrument has demonstrated tremendous potential in terms of oceanic detection. Nighttime mea-surements from spaceborne lidar increase knowledge of the diurnal variability of ocean optical properties, while measurements in polar regions fill the gaps that passive measurements of ocean color may leave in these areas. However, due to non-ideal instrumental characteristics, errors may occur during retrieval of the ocean optical properties that are derived directly from CALIOP's measured signals. These errors are caused by the transient response (TR) function of the detectors and the polarization crosstalk (CT) between the polarization beam splitters. However, there is no study that integrates and explicitly describes both the required corrections. In addition, the published physics-based methods for retrieving the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp) from CALIOP use an empirical linear relationship between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) without considering the spatial and temporal variability associated with the conversion coefficient. In this study, after both effects are eliminated through TR deconvolution and CT correction, an innovative deep neural network (DNN) approach is proposed to retrieve bbp and particulate organic carbon (POC) from CALIOP. The DNN is trained with the CALIOP total ocean column-integrated depolarization ratio and subsurface column-integrated perpendicular backscatter data, which are combined with the collocated daytime MODIS bbp and POC prod-ucts. Once the DNN has been trained with the daytime MODIS product, measurements can be derived from CALIOP in conditions not covered by MODIS data, such as at night or in polar regions. Compared to published physics-based methods, this approach does not require diffuse attenuation coefficients, nor are additional as-sumptions regarding the conversion coefficient between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) neces-sary. A comparison of global total depolarization ratios, which are calculated before and after TR deconvolution and CT correction, indicates the necessity and efficacy of correction, and the preliminary results show that the oceanic properties derived from CALIOP via this DNN-based approach agree better with the MODIS products than those derived with the traditional physics-based methods. The use of lidar measurements to derive bbp and POC without relying on passively acquired data is of great interest to the ocean color community.

TI  - 'InfraRivChange': a web application to monitor river migration at sites of critical bridge infrastructure in the Philippines
T2  - SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting rivers, particularly with high migration rates, represent a geomorphic hazard at sites of critical bridge infrastructure. Conventional attempts to map and measure shifts in the position of river channels usually requires the manual digitization of riverbanks from satellite imagery using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) - a time-consuming process only feasible at a limited number of bridge sites using a small selection of satellite images. As part of the CDRI Fellowship, the authors leveraged the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to substantially upscale analyses using Earth observation (EO) data. Focusing on the Philippines, they designed a user-friendly web application for technical and non-technical users to monitor the relative risk of river migration at sites of critical bridge infrastructure by analysing thousands of satellite images. `InfraRivChange' uses openly accessible satellite imagery from Landsat (30mspatial resolution) and Sentinel (10 m spatial resolution) to quantify river channel changes at bridge sites. The study demonstrates the web application at test sites and suggests use-cases relevant to disaster resilient infrastructure. As a low-cost approach for monitoring shifting large rivers in the vicinity of infrastructure, InfraRivChange can be incorporated into bridge monitoring systems (e.g., as a component of bridge stability assessments) and inform the design and placement of future infrastructure. They envision that InfraRivChange can be applied to additional forms transport infrastructure adjacent to rivers (e.g., road and rail) and extended to other dynamic riverine settings.

TI  - Emission Reductions Significantly Reduce the Hemispheric Contrast in Cloud Droplet Number Concentration in Recent Two Decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have drastically impacted the climate system since the Industrial Revolution. However, to what extent anthropogenic emissions influence the cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), the critical parameter for understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, is poorly known on the hemispheric scale due to the considerable retrieval uncertainty. We employed multiple widely used N-d retrieval sampling methods to evaluate the long-term trend in N-d contrast (Delta Nd(NH-SH)) between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Here we show that the Delta Nd(NH-SH) was halved from 2003 to 2020 using different sampling methods and channels, even though the range of magnitudes of Delta Nd(NH-SH) from different retrieval sampling methods is large. Such dramatic changes in Delta Nd(NH-SH) are dominated by the significantly decreased N-d over the NH (similar to 20%) due to emission reductions compared to the relatively stable and pristine nature of the SH. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI) correlate poorly with N-d based on long-term trends, even though they replicate the contrast trends. This poor correlation is partly contributed by stratospheric smoke from wildfires in Australia that had little influence on N-d in the SH. The northwest Atlantic shows the largest contribution, similar to 38%, to the N-d trend, whereas the northwest Pacific dominates the change in AOD and AI, contributing more than 60% to AOD and similar to 50% to the AI trend in the NH. Our results imply that emission reductions significantly reduced Delta Nd(NH-SH) and provide strong observational evidence that anthropogenic activities have extensively altered liquid clouds in the NH in the last two decades.Plain Language Summary Cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) is essential in understanding cloud physics, precipitation formation, and quantifying the effective radiative forcing associated with aerosol-cloud interactions. Under the background of emission reductions over the past two decades, this study used global satellite observations to explore the long-term (2003-2020) trend in N-d over the ocean and its hemispheric contrast (Delta Nd(NH-SH)) between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. We found that N-d decreased similar to 20% over the Northern Hemisphere, but no clear N-d trend was found over the Southern Hemisphere. As a result, the fractional change (defined as the trend divided by its climatology) of Delta Nd(NH-SH) is about -60% from 2003 to 2020. We further quantify the regional contribution and found that the northwest Atlantic shows the largest contribution, similar to 38%, to the N-d trend over the Northern Hemisphere. Our results provide strong observational evidence that anthropogenic activities have extensively modified the microphysical properties of liquid clouds in the Northern Hemisphere over the past two decades.

TI  - Uncertainty assessment of remote sensing- and ground-based methods to estimate wildfire emissions: a case study in Calabria region (Italy)
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In a general framework characterized by ever-increasing evidence of impacts attributable to climate change, the quantitative estimation of wildfire emissions (e.g., black carbon, carbon monoxide, particulate matter) and the evaluation of its uncertainty are crucial for mitigation and adaptation purposes. Global atmospheric emission models use mainly remote sensing fire datasets, which are affected by significant uncertainties. To assess the errors of remote sensing-based inventories, we compared the temporal and spatial behavior of the last version of the satellite-based Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s) with a more accurate ground-based wildfire emissions inventory, for the 2008-2016 period. The study area was Calabria (southern Italy), among the Italian regions with the highest contribution to national wildfire emissions. This study highlights a reliable agreement of time evolution of Burned Areas (R-2 = 0.87), but an overestimation of their extent by satellite compared to ground observations (approximately + 18%). Nevertheless, satellite data systematically underestimated Dry Matter and emissions by forest and grassland wildfires (ranging between -66% and -97%). Furthermore, detailed information on land cover allowed assessing the vegetation parameters uncertainties on ground-based emission inventory. The Mass Available Fuel values, which are constantly modified by wildfires, and land use changes, and not frequently updated, showed not to affect the emission estimations. Finally, the relationship between ground-based and remote sensing-based inventories for the analyzed period highlighted that the preliminary satellite emissions related to 2017-2019 require careful validation before any applications.

TI  - Can fluorescence-guided surgery improve optimal surgical treatment for ovarian cancer? A systematic scoping review of clinical studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe predicament of achieving optimal surgical intervention faced by surgeons in treating ovarian cancer has driven research into improving intra-operative detection of cancer using fluorescent materials. ObjectiveTo provide a literature overview on the clinical use of intra-operative fluorescence-guided surgery for ovarian cancer, either for cytoreductive surgery or sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. MethodsThe systematic review included studies from June 2002 until October 2021 from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus as well as those from a search of related literature. Studies were included if they investigated the use of fluorescence-guided surgery in patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Authors charted variables related to study characteristics, patient demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, fluorescence-guided surgery material, and treatment details, and surgical, oncological, and survival outcome variables. After screening 2817 potential studies, 24 studies were included. ResultsStudies investigating the role of fluorescence-guided surgery to visualize tumor deposits or SLN biopsy included the data of 410 and 118 patients, respectively. Six studies used indocyanine green tracer with a mean SLN detection rate of 92.3% with a pelvic and para-aortic detection rate of 94.8% and 96.7%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for micrometastases detection of OTL38 and 5-aminolevulinc acid at time of cytoreduction were 92.2% vs 79.8%, 67.3% vs 94.8%, and 55.8% vs 95.8%, respectively. ConclusionFluorescence -guided surgery is a technique that may improve the detection rate of micrometastases and SLN identification in ovarian cancer. Further research is needed to establish whether this will lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - The SWADE model for landslide dating in time series of optical satellite imagery
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are destructive natural hazards that cause substantial loss of life and impact on natural and built environments. Landslide frequencies are important inputs for hazard assessments. However, dating landslides in remote areas is often challenging. We propose a novel landslide dating technique based on Segmented WAvelet-DEnoising and stepwise linear fitting (SWADE), using the Landsat archive (1985-2017). SWADE employs the principle that vegetation is often removed by landsliding in vegetated areas, causing a temporal decrease in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The applicability of SWADE and two previously published methods for landslide dating, harmonic modelling and LandTrendr, are evaluated using 66 known landslides in the Buckinghorse River area, northeastern British Columbia, Canada. SWADE identifies sudden changes of NDVI values in the time series and this may result in one or more probable landslide occurrence dates. The most-probable date range identified by SWADE detects 52% of the landslides within a maximum error of 1 year, and 62% of the landslides within a maximum error of 2 years. Comparatively, these numbers increase to 68% and 80% when including the two most-probable landslide date ranges, respectively. Harmonic modelling detects 79% of the landslides with a maximum error of 1 year, and 82% of the landslides with a maximum error of 2 years, but requires expert judgement and a well-developed seasonal vegetation cycle in contrast to SWADE. LandTrendr, originally developed for mapping deforestation, only detects 42% of landslides within a maximum error of 2 years. SWADE provides a promising fully automatic method for landslide dating, which can contribute to constructing landslide frequency-magnitude distributions in remote areas.

TI  - A Coupled Deep Learning Model for Estimating Surface NO<sub>2</sub> Levels From Remote Sensing Data: 15-Year Study Over the Contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a novel two-step deep learning (DL) model for estimating surface NO2 concentrations using satellite data over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2005 to 2019. The first phase of the model uses partial convolutional neural network (PCNN), an advanced DL model that accurately imputes gaps between surface NO2 stations and creates 5,478 daily-mean NO2 grids (PCNN-NO2) of the 2005-2019 period over the study area. We then feed the PCNN-NO2, along with other predictor variables, into a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate surface NO2 levels, achieving exceptional performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.975-0.978, a mean absolute bias of 0.99-1.38 ppb, and a root mean square error of 1.47-1.97 ppb. Spatial cross-validation results also indicate strong spatial performance of PCNN-DNN surface NO2 estimates. In addition to its accurate estimates, the PCNN-DNN model consistently generates estimated NO2 grids without any missing values, improving the quality of various applications such as emission reduction strategies and public health studies. Between 2005 and 2019, the 5,478 daily estimated NO2 grids over the CONUS reveal significant reductions in NO2 levels in 14 major urban environments: Washington D.C. (-43%), New York (-45%), Los Angeles (-38%), Chicago (-25%), Boston (-43%), Houston (-34%), Dallas (-40%), Philadelphia (-41%), Phoenix (-38%), Detroit (-20%), Denver (-23%), Atlanta (-0.7%), Cincinnati (-38%), and Pittsburgh (-56%). Furthermore, the study shows that the denser urban regions that in-situ stations are installed in, the higher the difference between in-situ observations and regional-mean NO2 levels.Plain Language Summary Despite the significance of NO2 monitoring stations, their number and spatial coverage is limited, leaving many regions with no NO2 observations. This limitation calls for the development of advanced models to fill the gaps between NO2 stations and create gap-free spatiotemporally-consistent grids of surface NO2 concentrations. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) algorithms have enabled them to fill the gaps in various images, such as those representing the human face, nature, etc. with plausible contents. This technology can also be applied to fill the gaps between surface NO2 stations when the model is trained on datasets such as satellite tropospheric column density of NO2 images, available in almost all regions. In this study, we introduce a novel DL model to construct daily gap-free grids of estimated NO2 levels over the contiguous United States from 2005 to 2019, obtaining exceptional performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.975-0.978. The first phase of the model uses a partial convolutional neural network, trained mainly by satellite images, to fill the gaps between surface NO2 stations, and the second phase utilizes a deep neural network to bias correct the output of the first phase.

TI  - Assessment of change in forests land, carbon stock and carbon emissions of KPK, Pakistan for past three decades using geospatial techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is a mechanism to cut down GHG emissions and protect the threatened forest ecosystems. Pakistan is suffering from high forest degradation and deforestation rates, but recent plantations under BTTAP have created a significant impact. This study was designed to identify the LULC changes, forest sequestration and emissions from forest degradation in the forest hub districts (Malakand, Mardan, Lower Dir and Upper Dir) of KPK, Pakistan using Landsat imageries. LULC changes were analyzed from 1990 to 2020. In addition, the amount of carbon sequestration and emissions from forest degradation were also calculated. Results of the analysis showed forest area reduction from 1990 to 2009, followed by a sharp increase in the next decade (2010-2020) by 56%. Around 836 km(2) of land was found to be covered with forests during BTTAP. The net change was a 32% increase in forest land over three decades. The study offers important information which environment managers and decision-makers can utilize to encourage the plantation of trees and save existing forests in the country to combat climate change.

TI  - Open-source environmental data as an alternative to snail surveys to assess schistosomiasis risk in areas approaching elimination.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background: Although the presence of intermediate snails is a necessary condition for local schistosomiasis transmission to occur, using them as surveillance targets in areas approaching elimination is challenging because the patchy and dynamic quality of snail host habitats makes collecting and testing snails labor-intensive. Meanwhile, geospatial analyses that rely on remotely sensed data are becoming popular tools for identifying environmental conditions that contribute to pathogen emergence and persistence. Methods: In this study, we assessed whether open-source environmental data can be used to predict the presence of human Schistosoma japonicum infections among households with a similar or improved degree of accuracy compared to prediction models developed using data from comprehensive snail surveys. To do this, we used infection data collected from rural communities in Southwestern China in 2016 to develop and compare the predictive performance of two Random Forest machine learning models: one built using snail survey data, and one using open-source environmental data. Results: The environmental data models outperformed the snail data models in predicting household S. japonicum infection with an estimated accuracy and Cohenas kappa value of 0.89 and 0.49, respectively, in the environmental model, compared to an accuracy and kappa of 0.86 and 0.37 for the snail model. The Normalized Difference in Water Index (NDWI) within half to one kilometer of the home and the distance from the home to the nearest road were among the top performing predictors in our final model. Homes were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads, or nearer to waterways. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in low-transmission environments, investing in training geographic information systems professionals to leverage open-source environmental data could yield more accurate identification of pockets of human infection than using snail surveys. Furthermore, the variable importance measures from our models point to aspects of the local environment that may indicate increased risk of schistosomiasis. For example, households were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads or were surrounded by more surface water, highlighting areas to target in future surveillance and control efforts.

TI  - Cabbage butterfly as bioindicator species to investigate the genotoxic effects of PM<sub>10</sub>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric pollution poses a serious threat to environment and human health, and particulate matter (PM) is one of the major contributors. Biological effects induced by PM are investigated through in vitro assays using cells and by in vivo tests with laboratory model animals. However, also the estimation of adverse effects of pollutants, including airborne ones, on wild animals, such as insects, is an essential component of environmental risk assessment. Among insects, butterflies are sensitive to environmental changes and are important wild pollinators, so they might be suitable as environmental bioindicator species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of a wild cabbage butterfly species (Pieris brassicae) as a bioindicator organism to assess the genotoxic effects of PM10 collected in different sites. PM10 was collected from April to September in urban, suburban, and rural sites. P. brassicae larvae were reared in laboratory under controlled conditions on cabbage plants and exposed to PM10 organic extracts or dimethyl sulfoxide (controls) through vaporization. After exposure, larvae were dissected, and cells were used for comet assay. All PM extracts induced significant DNA damage in exposed larvae compared to controls and the extract collected in the most polluted site caused the highest genotoxic effect. In conclusion, the study suggested that butterflies, such as P. brassicae, could be applied as sensitive and promising bioindicators to investigate air quality and PM genotoxicity. Indeed, the use of these organisms allows the detection of genotoxic effects induced by PM sampled also in low-polluted areas.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of NbS using flood resilient scenario modelling (FReSMo)
T2  - SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal flood impact assessment on built infrastructure is critical for coastal resilience and sustainability, but the estimation process is rather complex. Especially for developing countries that have limited access to information regarding future flood extent, land use change and damage behaviour of elements at flood risk such as residential buildings. The rising impact of coastal floods on built infrastructure requires an economical and lucrative intervention that is impracticable without the estimation of the potential damage cost. Therefore, the proposed flood resilient scenario modelling (FReSMo) aims to estimate the probable cost of future damage that could be further used in determining the efficacy of IPCC defined nature-based solutions (NbS) in reducing flood impact on built infrastructure in Sagar Island, West Bengal. FReSMo is made up of a multivariate damage model that is developed to have a flexible application over spatial (local to regional) and temporal (flood character and intensity) dimensions. The future built-up area for 2050 is predicted using a patch-growing algorithm FUTURES model that generates realistic outcomes based on landscape metrics, temporal land use growth, demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The return period of high-water flooding is calculated using peak over threshold (PoT) analysis of long-term tidal data. The flood extent is mapped using a connected bathtub model derived from the Cartosat DEM. Residential building damage against a 100-yr flood event is calculated using FReSMo in pre- and post-mitigation scenarios. The cost-benefit analysis shows that an investment in mangroves will reduce the impact of floods by 70-75%, with a total benefit of about 261.3% for a 48-hr flood and 254.6% for a 24-hr flood.

TI  - Systemic immune-inflammation index is associated with aneurysmal wall enhancement in unruptured intracranial fusiform aneurysms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionInflammation plays a key role in the progression of intracranial aneurysms. Aneurysmal wall enhancement (AWE) correlates well with inflammatory processes in the aneurysmal wall. Understanding the potential associations between blood inflammatory indices and AWE may aid in the further understanding of intracranial aneurysm pathophysiology. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with intracranial fusiform aneurysms (IFAs) who underwent both high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and blood laboratory tests. AWE was defined as a contrast ratio of the signal intensity of the aneurysmal wall to that of the pituitary stalk >= 0.90. The systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index (neutrophils x platelets/lymphocytes) was calculated from laboratory data and dichotomized based on whether or not the IFA had AWE. Aneurysmal symptoms were defined as sentinel headache or oculomotor nerve palsy. Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine how well the SII index was able to predict AWE and aneurysmal symptoms. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to explore the potential associations between variables. ResultsThis study included 95 patients, of whom 24 (25.3%) presented with AWE. After adjusting for baseline differences in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, leukocytes, and neutrophils in the multivariable logistic regression analysis, smoking history (P = 0.002), aneurysmal symptoms (P = 0.047), maximum diameter (P = 0.048), and SII index (P = 0.022) all predicted AWE. The SII index (P = 0.038) was the only independent predictor of aneurysmal symptoms. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the SII index was able to accurately distinguish IFAs with AWE (area under the curve = 0.746) and aneurysmal symptoms (area under the curve = 0.739). DiscussionAn early elevation in the SII index can independently predict AWE in IFAs and is a potential new biomarker for predicting IFA instability.

AB  - We tested whether children's and adults' resource levels predicted their beliefs about resources (Study 1) and whether those beliefs shaped their willingness to share their resources with others (Study 2). In Study 1, we found that among adults (n = 230, 59.1% female, 72.6% White) and young children (n = 109, 4-6 years old, 56% female, 33% White), increased resource level predicted increases in the belief that others have lots of resources. In Study 2, we found that adults (n = 495, 52.5% female, 69.1% White) and young children (n = 154, 4-5 years old, 52.6% female, 36.4% White) randomly assigned to believe that others have lots of resources were less likely to share their own resources with others.

TI  - Monitoring the 2021 Cumbre Vieja Volcanic Eruption Using Satellite Multisensor Data Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor satellite data fusion merges measurements or products from imaging and sounding instruments with different spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution to obtain more comprehensive information about key atmospheric variables and processes. Here, data from low Earth and geostationary orbits, such as the Joint Polar Satellite Systems and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites platforms, respectively, are integrated using spatial-temporal fusion to enhance the detection of trace gas emissions from volcanoes. Not only does this yield trace gas information with improved spatial detail but, more importantly, the fusion product is also made available at significantly increased temporal resolution to help monitor the variable dispersion of trace gas emissions. The emission and dispersion of volcanic sulfur dioxide and ash plumes from the Cumbre Vieja volcano (Canary Islands, Spain) eruptions in October 2021 are studied through the synergistic exploitation of measurements and products from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, the Cross-track Infrared Sounder, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, and the Advanced Baseline Imager. Fusion results show increased spatial and temporal detail and describe evolution and directionality of the volcanic ash plumes; the potential benefits range from improved air quality monitoring to better guidance from aircraft safety systems.Plain Language Summary Improved delineation of volcanic emissions is shown via fusion of the high spectral resolution sounder Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) or TROPOspheric Monitoring instrument (TROPOMI), with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite or Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data. Whereas ABI is onboard geostationary satellite platforms, which offer fast temporal coverage, the other instruments are on low-Earth orbit platforms providing twice daily global coverage instead. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ash from the Cumbre Vieja volcano eruptions on La Palma in the Canary Islands are tracked on two separate days in October 2021. While TROPOMI, since it measures in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges, is limited to daytime viewing, CrIS infrared measurements offer night and day coverage of SO2. Fusion with ABI enables the extension to time sequences of the changes in the emissions and the resulting plumes. This fusion demonstration foreshadows capabilities of planned future geostationary sensors.

TI  - Malaccha: An R-based end-to-end Markov transition matrix extraction for land cover datasets
T2  - SOFTWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - The Markov chain approach is one of the many methods used in analyzing land cover change. The method is widely used for its ease of use and transparency. Malaccha (Markovian Land Cover Change) presents an end-to-end code that processes a land cover dataset into Markov transition matrices, presenting the probability of change from one land cover type to another. In this study, the code was built with NASA's readily available MODIS HDF dataset in mind. Malaccha breaks down into several steps: land cover data loading, raster reprojection and cropping, data extraction, and transition matrix calculation. The processes were designed to be done in one run. The end results of the software are the land cover classification and the probability transition matrices. Malaccha's product can be used for subsequent studies, including coupling with other sophisticated methods and future development in understanding land cover change dynamics and projections.

AB  - IntroductionNet primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator used to characterize the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. The spatial distribution and dynamic change in NPP are closely related to regional climate, vegetation growth and human activities. Studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of NPP and its influencing factors plays a vital role in understanding ecosystem carbon sink capacity. MethodsBased on MODIS-NPP data, meteorological data, and land use data from 2000 to 2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of NPP in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (MRYR) by using unary linear regression analysis, third-order partial correlation analysis, and Sen+Mann-Kendall trend analysis. ResultsThe results showed that the annual average NPP of the MRYR was 319.24 gCm(-2)a(-1) with a spatially decreasing trend from the southern part to the northern part. From 2000 to 2020, the annual average NPP experienced a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 2.83 gCm(-2)a(-1), and the area with a significant upward trend accounted for 87.68%. The NPP of different land use types differed greatly, in which forest had the greatest increase in NPP. Temperature had a negative correlation with NPP in most parts of the MRYR. Water vapor pressure promoted the accumulation of NPP in the northwestern MRYR. The areas with a positive correlation between NPP and water vapor pressure accounted for 87.6%, and 20.43% of the MRYR area passed the significance test of P< 0.05. ConclusionThe results of the study highlight the impact of climate factors and land-use changes on NPP and provide theoretical guidance for high-quality sustainable development in the MRYR.

TI  - Combining CloudSat/CALIPSO and MODIS measurements to reconstruct convective cloud structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical convective clouds are a crucial component of the Earth's weather and climate system. However, there are still large uncertainties in model simulations of tropical convective clouds and precipitation. In this study, CloudSat/CALIPSO and MODIS measurements are combined to provide vertical convective cloud structures under horizontal storm context and structures of convective cores. Convective cells are identified with MODIS brightness temperature at 11 mu m (BT11) and convective centers are determined for each cell by finding the minimum BT11 (BT11min). The difference between BT11 and BT11min is calculated to provide the distance to the convective center as in brightness temperature. Therefore, detailed convective cloud structures from centers to the stratiform regions could be shown as in the contoured frequency by temperature diagram (CFTD) of radar reflectivity factor (Ze). A group of strongly attenuated Ze profiles is identified near the convective center in Africa during daytime, and the occurrence of this group of profiles is much smaller in the west Pacific during daytime. The out-of-phase day/night variations of convective system structures over ocean and over land are also analyzed. It is shown that over ocean regions, rather than land regions, nighttime convective clouds have larger Ze than daytime ones between 210 K to 260 K, but they have smaller Ze at temperatures colder than 210 K near the cloud top. The convective cores are analyzed by separating and classifying those strongly attenuated Ze profiles as group one convective cores representing the developing stage, and the rest regular profiles as group two convective cores representing the later stage. As BT11min decreases for group one, the cores grow stronger with the maximum Ze shifts into lower temperature; and as BT11min decreases for group two, the CFTD for the cores gradually shifts to larger Ze for temperatures colder than 273.15 K and smaller Ze for temperatures warmer than 273.15 K. These observed composite structures of convective clouds and land/ocean and day/night vari-ations provide crucial information for model evaluations.

TI  - Object-based continuous monitoring of land disturbances from dense Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate mapping of land disturbances with regard to their timing and locations is the prerequisite for the success of downstream disturbance characterization. This study introduces and tests a novel approach that integrates a spatial perspective into the dense Landsat time series analysis, called "Object-Based COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance" (OB-COLD). The new algorithm is based on the recognition that the pixels under effects of the same disturbance event often present similar spectral change concurrently in a short time; such pixels experiencing concurrent change could be grouped as an analytic spatial unit, namely "change object". OB-COLD first generates a change-magnitude snapshot every 60 days by applying per-pixel time series analysis to measure spectral change history. Then, an object-based change analysis is applied for each time-stamped snapshot: two levels of change objects are generated through over-segmentation and region merging; the changing area is determined by examining three object-level properties derived at different scales: the average change magnitude, the pre-change cover type, and the object size. Lastly, OB-COLD reconstructs model coefficients for each temporal segment based on the temporal breaks indicated by new snapshot-based change maps. We tested the new algorithm using 3000 randomly selected reference sample plots and eight Landsat ARD tiles across the continental United States. The accuracy assessment suggests that OB-COLD achieved 76.9% producer's accuracy, which is significantly higher than the per-pixel time series algorithm (i.e., COLD) (16.3 percentage increase) while keeping a comparable user's accuracies (58.7% vs. 57.8%). The quantitative and qualitative evaluations both suggest that OB-COLD could significantly reduce omission errors, particularly for stress disturbances. Most commission errors (73%) are attributed to agricultural practices and climate variability. The proposed algorithm is computationally scalable to large-scale spatiotemporal datasets with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources, holding great potential as the base detection algorithm for the next generation of land disturbance products.

TI  - Role of Land-Atmosphere Interaction in the 2016 Northeast Asia Heat Wave: Impact of Soil Moisture Initialization
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of soil moisture initialization on the 2016 Northeast Asian heat wave was explored using the Land Information System (LIS) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. To obtain advanced soil moisture estimates, various meteorological variables from the Global Data Assimilation System analysis and Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement observation data were used as atmospheric forcings for the offline simulation of the Noah land surface model (Noah-LSM). Based on the LIS, Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite were assimilated in the Noah LSM simulation. The assimilated soil moisture estimates revealed the drier land surface conditions over Northeast Asia compared with the product from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis (FNL) and were used as the initial condition of the WRF model. The WRF experiment initialized by the assimilated soil moisture product (LIS experiment) exhibited the observed surface air temperature (SAT) and 500 hPa geopotential height (500 GPH) over Northeast Asia compared with the result from the experiment initialized by the FNL (CTL experiment). At Week 1, the LIS experiment simulated warmer SAT than that from the CTL experiment, which was induced by the negative anomaly of latent heat flux over Mongolia. Then, 500 GPH became strong and spatially expanded in response to the thermal low induced by the warmer SAT, and the SAT was further increased during Weeks 2 and 3.Plain Language Summary The association between soil moisture and land-atmosphere interaction occurring in the East Asia were analyzed by focusing on the 2016 extreme heat wave case. The numerical experiment with the initial soil moisture from the fusion of satellite data and land surface model output simulated a more realistic land-atmosphere interaction over East Asia within a 3-week heat wave simulation period, compared to the experiment with the operational soil moisture product.

TI  - Satellite spectroscopy reveals the atmospheric consequences of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing geopolitical conflicts and climate change, the effects of war on the atmosphere remain unclear, espe-cially the recent large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine. Here, we assess how war affects human emission activ-ities by observing atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using high-resolution satellite spectroscopy. Spatial and temporal responses of atmospheric composition to armed conflict are characterized. Significant decreases in NO2 con-centrations of 10.7-27.3 % occurred in most Ukrainian cities at the beginning of the war, in contrast to dramatic in-creases in NO2 concentrations in Russian cities outside the northern border. Anomalous changes in NO2 were also found in transportation hubs. By excluding the effect of meteorology, the machine learning model indicates that war-induced changes in anthropogenic emissions may account for-40 % of the reduction in NO2 pollution for major cities such as Kyiv. Our study demonstrates that satellites can provide a unique perspective on the atmospheric consequences of humanitarian disasters.

TI  - Towards uninterrupted canopy-trait time-series: A Bayesian radiative transfer model inversion using multi-sourced satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy traits play an important role in plant growth, carbon sequestration, and the land surface water and energy balance, and thus it is important to understand and monitor how these traits change over time. Canopy radiative transfer models, which use canopy traits to predict spectra, provide a powerful means to understand canopy trait variation and these models can be inverted, allowing us to use remotely sensed data to monitor canopy traits. However, a single inversion represents a snapshot in time for a single sensor. In this study, we used a Bayesian approach to assimilate snow-free observations from three different sensors (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A and MODIS) over the course of 2019 by inverting the ProSAIL radiative transfer model, producing a robust estimate of six canopy traits and their joint uncertainties at each time point. Next, we used a state-space time series model to integrate observations from multiple sensors to capture variation in vegetation optical traits throughout the year. The results demonstrate that our model can capture seasonal variation of surface reflectance with less than 5% RMSE compared with observed reflectance. Moreover, linking observations in time narrows the uncertainty intervals compared to the posterior distributions for individual time points. We are also able to make statistical inferences on dates when no data is available, and provide reasonable and reliable time-series inversion results compared with LAI ground measurements.

TI  - A 6G meta-device for 3D varifocal
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sixth-generation (6G) communication technology is being developed in full swing and is expected to be faster and better than the fifth generation. The precise information transfer directivity and the concentration of signal strength are the key topics of 6G technology. We report the synthetic phase design of rotary doublet Airy beam and triplet Gaussian beam varifocal meta-devices to fully control the terahertz beam's propagation direction and coverage area. The focusing spot can be delivered to arbitrary positions in a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional space. The highly concentrated signal can be delivered to a specific position, and the transmission direction can be adjusted freely to enable secure, flexible, and high-directivity 6G com-munication systems. This technology avoids the high costs associated with extensive use of active components. 6G communication systems, wireless power transfer, zoom imaging, and remote sensing will benefit from large-scale adoption of such a technology.

TI  - A Bayesian approach for multiscale modeling of the influence of seasonal and annual habitat variation on relative abundance of ring-necked pheasant roosters
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding ecologically relevant relationships between environmental covariates and response variables requires determining appropriate scales of effect. While considering multiple spatial scales of effect in hierarchical models has been the focus of recent studies, the effect of spatiotemporal scales, and temporal resolution of data on habitat suitability and species abundance has received less attention. We investigated relationships between ringnecked pheasant rooster abundance and environmental covariates with the goal of identifying important variables and their scales of effect in South Dakota, U.S.A. Using a suite of remote sensing data, we examined whether seasonal environmental conditions influence pheasant relative abundance and how survey conditions might affect detectability of roosters. To select optimal scales of effect and the best subset of covariates simultaneously, we employed a Reversible-Jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain (RJMCMC) approach in a Bayesian framework. We explored sources of uncertainty in data and controlled them through consideration of random effects. The use of seasonal covariates in addition to annual covariates revealed differential effects on species abundance. The proportion of grasslands on the landscape was an important covariate in models in all years, with rooster abundance generally being highest at intermediate levels of grassland density at local scales of effect. Pheasant abundance was also positively related to the proportion of small grain crop cover on the landscape at >2 km scales. Spring gross primary productivity and percentage of herbaceous wetlands on the landscape, both at a large scale (8 km), were the most important covariates in the wet years of 2018 and 2019 and were positively related to pheasant abundance. Grasslands at intermediate levels of density explained variability of pheasant abundance. However, other variables important to pheasant relative abundance varied among years depending on prevailing weather and climate conditions. Our workflow to model relationships between relative abundance and habitat components for pheasants can also be employed to model count data for other species to inform management decisions.

TI  - Assessment of remote sensing-based indices for drought monitoring in the north-western region of Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a widespread hazard that can tremendously affect the biodiversity, habitat of wild species, and ecosystem functioning and stability, especially in the dry region. Due to its geographic location, the north-western region of Bangladesh has a comparatively arid climate which is very much susceptible to drought occurrence and is marked as a red zone. Despite the growing evidence of the impact of drought on food security and ecosystem functioning, little effort has been paid to mitigate the drought in this region. The present study aimed to assess the drought condition of the north-western region of Bangladesh using earth observation techniques. For this purpose, Landsat data from 1990 to 2020 was used to determine various vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (NDWI), Moisture Index (NDMI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), along with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results show that the depletion of forests (2832 km2) and water bodies (6773 km2) resulted from the expansion of settlement (6563 km2) and agricultural land (1802 km2) for the period 1990-2020. Examination of the temporal changes of vegetation indices and LST showed that the values of all indices decreased while the LST increased. The negative correlation between NDVI value and LST indicates that the vegetation in our study was subject to drought-induced shocks. This study reveals the current situation of the vegetation health in the north-western region of Bangladesh in relation to the drought conditions. The findings of this study have practical implications for the policymakers in implementing necessary measures for agriculture, forests, water development, and economic zone planning.

TI  - Confirmed feasibility of a satellite tracker attachment method on small juvenile hawksbill turtles <i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite trackers can be used for studying sea turtle movement, illuminating their migrations and behaviours. However, many studies have focused on adult turtles, with uneven species representation, despite the importance of understanding movement and habitat use of turtles at all life-stages. Furthermore, few publications detail successful satellite tracker attachment methods, particularly for juveniles. Smaller-sized juvenile sea turtles often have an irregularly shaped carapace and are fast growing, rendering the attachment of rigid trackers in a safe and durable manner challenging. Juvenile hawksbill turtles' specific carapace shape and imbricated scute arrangement further complicate satellite tracker attachment compared to juveniles of other turtle species. This study's objective was to confirm the feasibility of an attachment method that would allow small-sized juvenile hawksbill turtles (similar to 267-345 mm curved carapace length) to continue growing, without tracker loss or damage to underlying scutes. Replica trackers were made of resin (simulating Wildlife Computer Spot-387 trackers), and attached with epoxy, silicone and neoprene, using a technique modified from those used on neonate loggerheads and Kemp's ridleys. Throughout the study (3.5 mo), replica trackers remained attached, the turtles grew up to 114% heavier and 25% longer, and all turtles appeared clinically healthy and active. Furthermore, all scutes were undamaged after tracker removal. As a critically endangered species, the paucity of data on hawksbill turtles, and specifically juveniles, can hinder evidence-based management decision-making. The improved ability to satellite track juvenile hawksbills can, therefore, help better our understanding of their ecology and inform management and conservation practices for this species.

TI  - Monitoring Black Sea environmental changes from space: New products for altimetry, ocean colour and salinity. Potentialities and requirements for a dedicated <i>in-situ</i> observing system
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, satellite products developed during the Earth Observation for Science and Innovation in the Black Sea (EO4SIBS) ESA project are presented. Ocean colour, sea level anomaly and sea surface salinity datasets are produced for the last decade and validated with regional in-situ observations. New data processing is tested to appropriately tackle the Black Sea's particular configuration and geophysical characteristics. For altimetry, the full rate (20Hz) altimeter measurements from Cryosat-2 and Sentinel-3A are processed to deliver a 5Hz along-track product. This product is combined with existing 1Hz product to produce gridded datasets for the sea level anomaly, mean dynamic topography, geostrophic currents. This new set of altimetry gridded products offers a better definition of the main Black Sea current, a more accurate reconstruction and characterization of eddies structure, in particular, in coastal areas, and improves the observable wavelength by a factor of 1.6. The EO4SIBS sea surface salinity from SMOS is the first satellite product for salinity in the Black Sea. Specific data treatments are applied to remedy the issue of land-sea and radio frequency interference contamination and to adapt the dielectric constant model to the low salinity and cold waters of the Black Sea. The quality of the SMOS products is assessed and shows a significant improvement from Level-2 to Level -3 and Level-4 products. Level-4 products accuracy is 0.4-0.6 psu, a comparable value to that in the Mediterranean Sea. On average SMOS sea surface salinity is lower than salinity measured by Argo floats, with a larger error in the eastern basin. The adequacy of SMOS SSS to reproduce the spatial characteristics of the Black Sea surface salinity and, in particular, plume patterns is analyzed. For ocean colour, chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended particulate materials are proposed using regional calibrated algorithms and satellite data provided by OLCI sensor onboard Sentinel-3 mission. The seasonal cycle of ocean colour products is described and a water classification scheme is proposed. The development of these three types of products has suffered from important in-situ data gaps that hinder a sound calibration of the algorithms and a proper assessment of the datasets quality. We propose recommendations for improving the in-situ observing system that will support the development of satellite products.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of timber volume and basal area prediction in heterogeneously structured and mixed forests by automated co-registration of forest inventory plots and remote sensing data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate georeferencing is essential if forest indicators, such as timber volume, are to be modelled and predicted area-wide by establishing a linkage between local inventories and remote sensing data. Nevertheless, due to inaccuracies in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements under a closed canopy, determining the exact position of sample-plots in a forest inventory is a major challenge. In this study different methods were evaluated, each of which is designed to improve the co-registration between field measurements and remote sensing data in a forest inventory. The methods were evaluated in two areas in Switzerland (Bremgarten and Zurich), all of which have heterogeneously structured and mixed forests. A simple algorithm that searches for the best match between tree-tops, detected in remote sensing data, and an inventory tree-top point-cloud led to unsatisfactory results. The failure of the algorithm was primarily related to the lack of accurate single-tree-identification (STI) methods in airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (10 points m(-2)) on deciduous and mixed forest stands. These inaccuracies hampered a successful co-registration of the two data sources. To omit the single-tree-identification (STI) step, methods that rely on the comparison between an artificial canopy height model (CHM) calculated from the inventory data and the CHM generated from ALS data were tested. Correlating the two CHMs made it possible to identify plausible positions within the search range. The quality of all co-registration methods was assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validated root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the timber volume estimate of the subsequently calibrated regression model. The best results were achieved with a method that modelled inventory tree-crowns as spheres and that applied a correlation metric named SQDIFF_-NORMED. Co-registration made it possible to increase the model accuracy of timber volume estimates in Bremgarten by 31 RMSE-%, i.e. from 134.4 m(3) ha(-1) (without co-registration) to 92.6 m(3) ha(-1) with co-registered positions. Additional testing of the identified superior method with a larger inventory dataset of the canton of Zurich, Switzerland confirmed these results. There, the RMSE of the basal-area estimate was improved by 10 RMSE-%, from 13.56 m(2) ha(-1) to 12.18 m(2) ha(-1). For these CHM-based methods, integrating the information from a deciduous-evergreen (DecEv) raster improved the positional accuracy but not the overall predictive power of the regression models.

TI  - What are the individual and joint impacts of key meteorological factors on the risk of unintentional injuries? A case-crossover study of over 147,800 cases from a sentinel-based surveillance system
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological factors are a critical component of a sustainable society, especially in the context of climate change. Although studies have linked key meteorological factors to unintentional injuries, their joint effects on the occurrence of unintentional injuries remain unclear. We conducted a case-crossover study using a sentinel-based injury database in a mega-city in China and identified the vulnerable subgroups by demographic and injury characteristics. We observed significantly increased cumulative risk associated with each interquartile range increase in temperature (excess risk [ER] range=4.78-7.05%) and precipitation (ER range=1.00-2.09%) from lag0-1 day onwards. Conversely, there was a significantly decreased risk with relative humidity (RH) from lag0-2 days onwards (ER range=-2.83 to -2.10%). The link between meteorological factors and unintentional injuries was worthy of particular attention for the working-age groups, males, and those with fall-related injuries, road-related injuries, or fractures. Climate conditions with high wind speed (WS) and temperature combined with low precipitation and RH exhibited the greatest ER. The ER of high WS and RH, combined with low pre-cipitation and temperature, was also significant. These key factors may jointly contribute to unintentional injury, which is important for evidence-based climate mitigation and injury prevention.

TI  - Analysis of land subsidence caused by hydrodynamic force in Loess Hilly and gully region based on SBAS-InSAR
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - After large-scale land consolidation in hilly loess region of the Loess Plateau in China, land subsidence has a wide affecting area and considerable difficulty of prevention. Hence, large-scale, stabilized, and continuous deformation monitoring is urgently needed for slopes. In this study, land consolidation zone in the loess platform area of Weinan, China, was selected as the object, and the 30-scene Sentinel-1A data in Jan, 2018 to Dec, 2019 were analyzed. The mean annual velocity of ground deformation was from -6.19 mm center dot a(-1) to 3.86 mm center dot a(-1), and Accumulated deformation velocity was within -8.49 mm center dot a(-1) to 7.24 mm center dot a(-1). Accumulated deformation of land consolidation changed with the seasons changing. The interrelationship between the spatiotemporal variations in ground subsidence and the precipitation, ground water, loess engineering properties was also discussed. Accumulated deformation of land consolidation changed with the seasons changing. The precipitation accelerated the subsidence by unexpected strong precipitation reflects that the infiltration of rainwater can lead to compacted loess deformation which caused by moistening effect. Under varying ground water environment, external loads may lead to soil collapse, resulting in non-uniform land subsidence. Co-compression deformation of original loess and compacted loess is main influencing factors of subsidence. These findings have important implications and significant positive effects on the prevention of potential hazard such as subsidence and side slope slip.

TI  - Variability in Tree-ring Width and NDVI Responses to Climate at a Landscape Level
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Inter-annual climatically driven growth variability of above-ground biomass compartments (for example, tree stems and foliage) controls the intensity of carbon sequestration into forest ecosystems. However, understanding the differences between the climatic response of stem and foliage at the landscape level is limited. In this study, we examined the climate-growth response of stem and leaf biomass and their relationship for Pinus sylvestris (PISY) and Picea abies (PCAB) in topographically complex landscapes. We used tree-ring width chronologies and time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from high-resolution Landsat scenes as proxies for stem and leaf biomass, respectively. We then compared growth variability and climate-growth relationships of both biomass proxies between topographical categories. Our results show that the responses of tree rings to climate differ significantly from those found in NDVI, with the stronger climatic signal observed in tree rings. Topography had distinct but species-specific effects: At moisture-limited PISY stands, stem biomass (tree rings) was strongly topographically driven, and leaf biomass (NDVI) was relatively insensitive to topographic variability. In landscapes close to the climatic optimum of PCAB, the relationship between stem and leaf biomass was weak, and their correlations with climate were often inverse, with no significant effects of topography. Different climatic signals from NDVI and tree rings suggest that the response of canopy and stem growth to climate change might be decoupled. Furthermore, our results hint toward different prioritizations of biomass allocation in trees under stressful conditions which might change allometric relationships between individual tree compartments in the long term.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest classification is needed to solve a wide range of environmental issues related to of forest classes and succession processes, the extent of afforestation and deforestation and global environmental change. These applications require a very accurate mapping and monitoring of forest types. This article investigates the combination of modern open geographic information systems and remote sensing data in forest management tasks for a specific part of the Ukrainian state area. Based on the existing afforestation plans, the results of the unsupervised classification of Sentinel-2 images and the selection of forest species fragments with closed crowns as training data for supervised classification, classifiers of forest species of the study object were developed with and without taking into account age groups. A supervised classification of research objects is realized and the accuracy of the obtained results is evaluated. It is established that the accuracy of determining forest species on the basis of the proposed method is 90.3 and 91.4%, taking into account age groups and without taking them into account, respectively. Thus, it is found that the modeling of the age groups does not improve the classification result for the test area.

T2  - ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Treatment for endometrial cancer is changing. The additional determination of molecular subtypes makes treatment more individual. This also affects surgical treatment. The necessity of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer has not been conclusively clarified.Materials and methods: This work is based on a selective literature search in the PubMed database and is based on the German and European guidelines.Results: Lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer has been given priority in both the current German and European guidelines. Depending on the tumor stage and molecular subtype, sentinel node biopsy or systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy is recommended.Conclusions: The importance of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer remains unclear. Further studies, such as the Endometrial Cancer Lymphadenectomy Trial (ECLAT), are needed to clarify the role of surgery in endometrial cancer.

TI  - The representation of migrant identities in UK Government documents about Brexit A corpus-assisted analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the English worldview, "not all immigrants are created equal" (Henderson and Wyn Jones 2021:91). This paper provides support for the above statement by employing key semantic domain analysis (Rayson 2008) and CDA to answer the research question: How are EU and extra-EU migrants constructed in Brexit-related UK Government documents published between 2016 and 2019? The analysis demonstrates that extra-EU migrants are constructed as a threat that requires UK-EU unity. At the same time, the government's grammatical and linguistic strategies discursively exclude EU migrants from the British public. The study argues that a neoliberal construction of the acceptable EU migrant erases the identities of migrant workers in so-called unskilled roles and foreshadows the social exclusion of these groups brought about by the UK's post-Brexit immigration system. The paper concludes that the documents problematise Britain's "tolerant nation" rhetoric and threaten to weaken feelings of belonging to the UK among migrants.

TI  - Near real-time generation of a country-level burned area database for Italy from Sentinel-2 data and active fire detections
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The first national database of burned areas in Italy at 20 m spatial resolution is presented. It was generated in near real-time by processing, as soon as they were available, all the Sentinel-2 im-ages covering the Italian territory throughout the fire seasons of years 2019-2021. An updated version of the AUTOmatic Burned Area Mapper (AUTOBAM), originally developed in a previous study, was used to produce the database. Active fire data and a feature extraction procedure were used by AUTOBAM to associate a set of quality flags to each burned area. The AUTOBAM product was evaluated by comparing it with reference polygons derived from ground surveys. Even the database derived from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) was compared to reference polygons to assess the utility of the AUTOBAM product with respect to an already existing one. Good results were obtained by AUTOBAM in terms of detec-tion capability (the Correctness parameter) and overlap factor (both larger than 60%). However, quite high values of the commission error were obtained, especially in 2019. Through a per land cover analysis, it was found that this error mostly occurred in cultivated land. Excluding the latter target, the commission error was always less than 35%, the omission error was less than 27% and the Dice Coefficient was larger than 69%.

TI  - Gata6+large peritoneal macrophages: an evolutionarily conserved sentinel and effector system for infection and injury
T2  - TRENDS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - There are striking similarities between the sea urchin cavity macrophage-like phagocytes (coelomocytes) and mammalian cavity macrophages in not only their location, but also their behaviors. These cells are crucial for maintaining homeosta-sis within the cavity following a breach, filling the gap and functioning as a barrier between vital organs and the environment. In this review, we summarize the evolv-ing literature regarding these Gata6+ large peritoneal macrophages (GLPMs), focus-ing on ontogeny, their responses to perturbations, including their rapid aggregation via coagulation, as well as scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains and their potential roles in diseases, such as cancer. We challenge the 50-year old phe-nomenon of the 'macrophage disappearance reaction' (MDR) and propose the new term 'macrophage disturbance of homeostasis reaction' (MDHR), which may better describe this complex phenomenon.

TI  - What is the appropriate "first lymph node" in the era of segmentectomy for non-small cell lung cancer?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe place of segmentectomy in the management of lung cancer is shifting following the inspiring results of the Japanese JCOG0802 trial. I n this study, authors suggested that performing segmentectomy would require in an optimal way an intraoperative confirmation of pN0 tumor with a frozen section. Our objective was to determine whether the proposed technique, i.e. adjacent lymph node analysis, is consistent with the results of our study on sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using fluorescence. MethodsThis is a retrospective, observational, single center study. Eighty-one patients with suspected localized stage NSCLC (IA to IIA) were included between December 2020 and March 2022. All patients received an intra-operative injection of indocyanine green (ICG) directly in the peritumoral area or by electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB). The SLN was then assessed by using an infrared fluorescence camera. ResultsIn our cohort, SLN was identified in 60/81 patients (74.1%). In 15/60 patients with identified SLN (25%), NIR-guided SLN was concordant with the suggestions of JCOG0802 study. A retrospective SLN pathological analysis was performed in 43 patients/60 cases with identified SLN (71.2%), including 37 cases of malignant disease. Occult micro-metastases were found in 4 patients out of 37 SLN analyzed, leading to a 10.8% upstaging with NIR-guided SLN analysis. DicussionAt the time of segmentectomies, ICG technique allowed the identification of the SLN in a high percent of cases and in some areas usually out of the recommended stations for lymph node dissection.

TI  - Alternative states in the structure of mountain forests across the Alps and the role of disturbance and recovery
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextStructure is a central dimension of forest ecosystems that is closely linked to their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Drivers such as changing disturbance regimes are increasingly altering forest structure, but large-scale characterizations of forest structure and disturbance-mediated structural dynamics remain rare.ObjectivesHere, we characterize large-scale patterns in the horizontal and vertical structure of mountain forests and test for the presence of alternative structural states. We investigate factors determining the occurrence of structural states and the role of disturbance and recovery in transitions between states.MethodsWe used spaceborne lidar (GEDI) to characterize forest structure across the European Alps. We combined GEDI-derived structural metrics with Landsat-based disturbance maps and related structure to topography, climate, landscape configuration, and past disturbances.ResultsWe found two alternative states of forest structure that emerged consistently across all forest types of the Alps: short, open-canopy forests (24%) and tall, closed-canopy forests (76%). In the absence of disturbance, open-canopy forests occurred at high elevations, forest edges, and warm, dry sites. Disturbances caused a transition to open-canopy conditions in approximately 50% of cases. Within 35 years after disturbance, 72% of forests recovered to a closed-canopy state, except in submediterranean forests, where recovery is slow and long-lasting transitions to open-canopy conditions are more likely.ConclusionsAs climate warming increases disturbances and causes thermophilization of vegetation, transitions to open-canopy conditions could become more likely in the future. Such restructuring could pose a challenge for forest management, as open-canopy forests have lower capacities for providing important ecosystem services.

TI  - Generation of a synthetic aperture radar deception jamming signal based on a deep echo inversion network
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing methods for generating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) deception jamming signals have slow speed, low imaging quality, and insufficient intelligence in complex electromagnetic environments. This paper proposes a deep learning-based SAR deception jamming signal generation method based on deep echo inversion Unet (DEIUnet). This method has high speed and provides high-image quality of the interference signal. A Swin Next (SN) block is proposed to combine local and non-local information in the image and echo data. The Unet structure consists of SN blocks, and a residual connection is used as the jump connection to fuse the multi-scale feature information from the echo and image data. PixelShuffle is utilised for up-sampling to generate high-quality echo data. The experimental results on MSTAR and Sentinel-1 data sets verify the effectiveness and superiority of DEIUnet for echo inversion. The imaging results of the SAR deception jamming signal generated by DEIUnet on an MSTAR scene confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Spatially explicit subpixel-based study on the expansion of impervious surfaces and its impacts on soil organic carbon
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise spatiotemporal datasets of impervious surfaces (IS) are essential for evaluating urbanization processes and associated soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. However, spatially explicit studies on SOC stocks based on high-quality IS data remain deficient, which affects the accuracy of urban SOC budgets. In this study, we used 30-m Landsat images and a subpixel-based model to accurately evaluate and quantify the annual IS of Kaifeng, an ancient city in China that experienced intensive urbanization from 2000 to 2020. Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics were further estimated and spatially exhibited based on the SOC densities (SOCD) of different land covers observed in the field. Our results demonstrate that Kaifeng experienced drastic IS expansion from 2000 to 2020, both in total area (an increase of similar to 154.35%) and density (56% vs. 72%). Spatially, IS mainly sprawled to the west, and infilling was observed in the old town. Moreover, the expansion of IS in Kaifeng has resulted in a total of 0.08 Tg (1Tg = 10(12) g) of SOC loss over the past 20 years, and the study area has acted as a clear carbon source. The greatest SOC losses occurred during 2010-2015, mainly in the west, with >30% (similar to 0.024 Tg) of the total loss occurring between 2010 and 2015. This study provides new insights into urban growth through the mapping of growth patterns in terms of both outward sprawl and infill. Our research also could provide a scientific basis for urban planning that seeks to control the rate and spatial pattern of IS expansion, and guide urban greening projects to mitigate the loss of SOC and protect the carbon sequestration capacity of urban soil.

TI  - Multi-spatiotemporal AOD trends and association with land use changes over the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area during 2001-2021
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing long-term variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is beneficial for determining high-pollutant-risk areas and formulating mitigation policies. In this study, multi-spatiotemporal trends and periodicity of AOD, as well as the persistence over the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 2001 to 2021, were investigated by the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD), Theil-Sen Median trend analysis and Hurst exponent. The results elucidate that AOD exhibits fluctuant variations during the 21-year period with the year 2012 as the turning point. There is a slight upward tendency (0.009 year(-1)) in the pre-2012 period but a pronounced downward trend (-0.03 year(-1)) in the post-2012 period, suggesting an overall declining trend in the study area. The northern cities in the area present an increasing-stable-decreasing trend of monthly average AOD, whereas other cities have an increasing-fluctuating-decreasing trend over the study period. The decreasing rate in the western parts is higher than that in the eastern parts, like Zhaoqing, Jiangmen and Foshan city. A continuous decline of AOD is dominated over the study area, whereas an anti-persistence tendency is accumulated in the northeastern parts. Additionally, elevated AOD can be observed in unused land, water bodies and construction land, while grassland, cropland and woodland have lower AOD. The decreasing rate is larger when land-use types with high AOD are converted to those with low AOD; otherwise, the decreasing rate is smaller. The results have a great significance for improving the understanding of long-term variations of AOD, as well as providing a scientific basis to formulate environmental protection and mitigation practices.

TI  - Estimation of daily FAPAR from MODIS instantaneous observations at forest sites
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The daily Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is crucial for vegetation dynamics monitoring and terrestrial carbon modeling. However, current FAPAR products only provide instantaneous values at the satellite transit times and a large data gap exists between instantaneous and daily FAPAR. To fill this gap, this study aimed to estimate daily FAPAR from instantaneous values retrieved from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A framework combining method to estimate instantaneous FAPAR (instantaneous FAPAR method) and method to calculate daily FAPAR (instantaneous-to-daily FAPAR method) was proposed. Instantaneous FAPAR method for estimating intra-daily FAPAR from reduced observations was evaluated. Three instantaneous-to-daily FAPAR methods (ratio, simple average and solar zenith angle weighted average methods) were compared to estimate the daily FAPAR from continuous instantaneous values. The daily FAPAR was finally estimated from MODIS instantaneous values. The estimation and validation were performed at seven forest sites distributed in North America and Western Europe.The results show that the instantaneous FAPAR method can accurately simulate the intra-daily instantaneous FAPAR (RMSE -0.01, bias -0). The three instantaneous-to-daily FAPAR estimation methods showed similar performances (R2-1, RMSE -0.01, and bias -0). The in situ instantaneous FAPAR values at the MODIS acquisition times underestimated the daily value during the non-peak growing season (FAPAR < 0.9) and the underestimation is also affected by the diffuse PAR radiation. MODIS instantaneous FAPAR underestimates in situ daily FAPAR over the year. The daily FAPAR estimates from in situ instantaneous values at MODIS acquisition times or the MODIS instantaneous FAPAR data reduce the gap between instantaneous and daily values. Validated by in situ data, the MODIS instantaneous FAPAR products should be further optimized to improve the accuracy of daily FAPAR estimation. This study lays the foundation for estimating the daily FAPAR from instantaneous values to improve GPP estimation.

TI  - Surface soil moisture estimation from multi-frequency SAR images using ANN and experimental data on a semi-arid environment region in Konya, Turkey
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an essential component of the water cycle on earth and has a substantial role in the assessment of agriculture, drought, ecology, and climate science. Accurate estimation of SSM is critical for strategic management of precise farming, and climate change and drought monitoring. In particular, microwave remote sensing sensors can estimate SSM over large areas. The objective of this study is to propose a framework for retrieving soil moisture employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for a semi-arid environment, using the data acquired from multi-frequency (X-, C-, and L-band) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the experimental analysis, soil parameters (i.e., SSM, soil roughness, and altitude) and sensor characteristics (i.e., frequency, incidence angle, and backscatter coefficient) were used for the fallow land and, an additional feature as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was included for a field cultivated with wheat. The resam-pling of data was tested over two windows as 3 x 3 and 5 x 5. The obtained results show that in general the window size 5 x 5 provides better results. Amongst the wavelengths, X-band Kompsat-5 achieved the highest correlation in both cultivated (R=0.85) and fallow lands (R=0.79), and L-band ALOS-2 gave the lowest RMSE as 1.68 of (vol%). Furthermore, Radarsat-2 provided slightly better results (RMSE=3.34-3.73) than Sentinel-1 (RMSE=3.20-3.77) in ANN analysis in the C-band.

TI  - The Dialectical Mandala Model of Self-cultivation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the development of a cross-cultural primary ontological model that can help self-cultivation practitioners illuminate their path and help researchers identify the complex implications, context, and progression of self-cultivation in diverse cultures, especially those associated with Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. Integrating self-cultivation traditions into social science research from the perspective of subject-object dichotomy is difficult. However, the assimilation of the mutual implication of subject and object in the Avatamsaka worldview helps resolve this issue. This study employs the Buddhist tetralemmic dialectic (catusko?i), which goes beyond the limitations of dualistic and reductionist logic, to construct the Dialectical Mandala Model of Self-cultivation as the first of a two-step epistemological strategy. The model provides a universal framework for the multifaceted and systemic analysis of self-cultivation traditions so that future research can further develop additional culturally specific ontologies and psychological models in the second step of the strategy. As in a research map, this model could help researchers make ontological commitments, understand self-cultivation more comprehensively, and determine whether they have overlooked any research domain.

TI  - Upscaling dryland carbon and water fluxes with artificial neural networks of optical, thermal, and microwave satellite remote sensing
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth's drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth's carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for the joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (US) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture and temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices and thermal infrared and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-5P TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> column observations with the CAMS regional air quality ensemble
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument, launched in October 2017, provides unique observations of atmospheric trace gases at a high resolution of about 5 km, with near-daily global coverage, resolving individual sources like thermal powerplants, industrial complexes, fires, medium-scale towns, roads, and shipping routes. Even though Sentinel-5P (S5P) is a global mission, these datasets are especially well suited to test high resolution regional-scale air quality (AQ) models and provide valuable input for emission inversion systems.In Europe, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) has implemented an operational regional AQ forecasting capability based on an ensemble of several European models, available at a resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees. In this paper, we present comparisons between TROPOMI observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and the CAMS AQ forecasts and analyses of NO2. We discuss the different ways of making these comparisons and present quantitative results in the form of maps for individual days, summer and winter months, and a time series for European subregions and cities between May 2018 and March 2021. The CAMS regional products generally capture the fine scale daily and averaged features observed by TROPOMI in much detail. In summer, the comparison shows a close agreement between TROPOMI and the CAMS ensemble NO2 tropospheric columns with a relative difference of up to 15 % for most European cities. In winter, however, we find a significant discrepancy in the column amounts over much of Europe, with relative differences up to 50 %. The possible causes for these differences are discussed, focusing on the possible impact of retrieval and modeling errors. Apart from comparisons with the CAMS ensemble, we also present results for comparisons with the individual CAMS models for selected months. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the free tropospheric contribution to the estimation of the tropospheric column and thus include profile information from the CAMS configuration of the ECMWF's (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) global integrated model above 3 km altitude in the comparisons. We also show that replacing the global 1 degrees x 1 degrees a priori information in the retrieval by the regional 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution profiles of CAMS leads to significant changes in the TROPOMIretrieved tropospheric column, with typical increases at the emission hotspots up to 30 % and smaller increases or decreases elsewhere. As a spinoff, we present a new TROPOMI NO2 level 2 (L2) data product for Europe, based on the replacement of the original TM5-MP generated global a priori profile by the regional CAMS ensemble profile. This European NO2 product is compared with ground-based remote sensing measurements of six Pandora instruments of the Pandonia Global Network and nine Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments. As compared to the standard S5P tropospheric NO(2 )column data, the overall bias of the new product for all except two stations is 5 % to 12 % smaller, owing to a reduction in the multiplicative bias. Compared to the CAMS tropospheric NOcolumn data, the overall bias of the new product for all except two stations is 5 % to 12 % smaller, owing to a reduction in the multiplicative bias. Compared to the CAMS tropospheric NO2 columns, dispersion and correlation parameters with respect to the standard data are, however, superior.columns, dispersion and correlation parameters with respect to the standard data are, however, superior

TI  - Ionospheric response to the 23-31 August 2018 geomagnetic storm in the Europe-African longitude sector using multi-instrument observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents ionospheric responses of the mid and low-latitude region in the Europe-African longitude sector (along 30 degrees +/- 10 degrees E) to the intense geomagnetic storm of 23-31 August 2018 (SYM-Hmin =-207 nT) using the Global Ionospheric Map (GIM) and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers data, the satellite data (SWARM, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Global Ultraviolet Imager on board the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (GUVI/TIMED)), and Prompt Penetration Equatorial Electric Field model (PPEFM). The percentage deviation in total electron content (TEC) denoted by DTEC (%) was used to observe the ionospheric storm effects. The rate of change of TEC index (ROTI) derived from GPS-TEC and the rate of change of plasma density index (RODI) obtained from SWARM satellites were utilized to quantify the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities. Results obtained from GPS receivers and GIM data revealed a large increase in TEC (positive ionospheric storm effect) in the equatorial and low-latitude region of Africa, and a decrease in TEC (negative ionospheric storm effect) over the midlatitude region of Europe and Africa during the storm recovery phase. The decrease in [O]=[N2] ratio is the possible cause for the observed negative iono-spheric storm effect. Hemispheric asymmetry were noticed over Europe-African longitude sector during the storm main and recovery phases. The occurrence of ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region of Africa in the premidnight and post-midnight was suppressed (ROTI<0.4 TECU/min). This could be related to the local time at which the minimum SYM-H occurred which corresponded to daytime over Europe-African longitude sector. This, on the other hand, may not support the development of conducive environment for the generation of ionospheric irregularities. However, significant fluctuation in the plasma density was noticed by the SWARM-C on 23, 25, 30, and 31 August 2018 over equatorial and low-latitude region of Africa during the post-midnight period.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Cloud-covered MODIS LST reconstruction by combining assimilation data and remote sensing data through a nonlocality-reinforced network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstruction of cloud-covered thermal infrared land surface temperature (LST) is vital for the measurement of physical properties in land surface at regional and global scales. In this paper, a novel reconstruction method for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data with a 1-km spatial resolution is proposed by combining assimilation data and remote sensing data through a nonlocality-reinforced network (NRN) model. Firstly, a data grading criterion is introduced to evaluate the importance of the various datasets, forming four combinations of multi-modal datasets for the training and testing of the NRN model. Secondly, the NRN model with a multiscale encoding-decoding structure considering the nonlocality-reinforced module is proposed for LST reconstruction. The results suggest that the proposed method can precisely reconstruct cloud-covered LST, with a mean absolute error (MAE) less than 0.8 K, even when no auxiliary remote sensing LST are used (Combination 1). The best result is the full combination (Combination 4), in which the coefficient of determination is 0.8956, the MAE is 0.5219 K, and the root-mean-square error is 0.7622 K. Compared with the traditional harmonic analysis of time series method, the improved enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion method and the multiscale feature connected convolutional neural network method for LST reconstruction, the proposed method can achieve superior results. The proposed method with Combination 1 has been implemented to reconstruct the daily LST in the study area for 2019. Referring to the meteorological station observations, the reconstructed bias absolute value is less than 1 K, indicating that the proposed model is very effective and valid for regional cloud-covered LST reconstruction.

TI  - Modeling forest above-ground biomass using freely available satellite and multisource datasets
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving the 2 degrees C global warming target will require all stakeholders, from local to global, to accelerate carbon reduction plans. To properly estimate carbon amounts sequestered and stored by forests, these stakeholders need accurate maps of forest above-ground biomass (AGB). However, AGB maps are developed solely by researchers using methodologies that are typically difficult for non-researchers to understand. To ensure that non-researchers can prepare such maps, freely available open-source datasets are needed along with a simple AGB estimation method. Remote sensing data have become widely used, and some satellite images are provided as open-source data. However, few AGB estimation studies have relied exclusively on freely available datasets. This study, therefore, examined the capability of using open-source satellite and multisource datasets to estimate AGB for two contrasting test sites in Hokkaido, Japan, and for the two sites combined (the unified sites). Test site 1 contained three forest types on a hilly terrain, while test site 2 contained one dominant forest type on a flat terrain. The datasets used were L-band backscatter, a canopy height model, slope, aspect, annual mean tem-perature, annual precipitation, and forest type. Three machine-learning algorithms and one parametric algorithm were compared. The results showed that the machine-learning models outperformed the parametric model in all instances, reproducing low and high AGB values properly with reduced saturation issues. A variable importance analysis revealed that in the best-performing machine-learning models, forest type and annual precipitation were the two most important variables for test site 1 and the unified sites, and another climatic factor, annual mean temperature, rose in rank for the unified sites. These variables had relatively large intra-variability and inter -variability in common, both of which appear to have offered advantages in modeling AGB for the sites where AGB variability was large. In contrast, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based variables (the backscatter and the canopy height model) ranked lower in relative importance. This may reflect the negative influence of hilly terrain of test site 1 (and the unified sites) on the precision of SAR-based datasets. For test site 2, with its flat terrain, these SAR-based variables were the two dominant variables. Our results show the promise of freely available satellite and multisource datasets for modeling AGB and the important roles that non-SAR-based variables may play in large-scale AGB mapping that includes varied terrain.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface deformation can severely damage socioeconomic living conditions around the world. This study aimed to identify the Shaziba landslide and further assess deformation activities in Enshi city. For this purpose, the sentinel-1 C-bands data acquired in ascending directions were processed with Sentinel Application Platform and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) software packages. Our results revealed the location of a landslide that occurred on 21 July 2020 in the Shaziba area, Enshi Prefecture. More interesting deformation results were found in Enshi city for the first time with a deformation range from -51.6 to 54.2 mm/year. We conducted a thorough observation of different urban infrastructures such as commercial and residential buildings, roads, bridges, and airports in Enshi city and along the Qingjiang River to evaluate land surface deformation. Observations revealed that there are a number of influencing factors contributing to disturbing the natural environment and resources in Enshi Prefecture. Of these influencing factors, intensive rainfall is a major cause as are the infiltration of rainfall into the subsurface Silurian strata together with the load of infrastructure in the study area. If this issue is not addressed it could lead to devastating geo-hazard disasters in the future. Scientific approaches to determine various causes of frequent geo-hazards in this region are of great significance for developing early warning systems for disasters and ensuring the safety of residents' lives and property.

TI  - Airborne glyoxal measurements in the marine and continental atmosphere: comparison with TROPOMI observations and EMAC simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on airborne limb and nadir measurements of vertical profiles and total vertical column densities (VCDs) of glyoxal (C2H2O2) in the troposphere, which were performed aboard the German research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and LOng Range) in different regions and seasons around the globe between 2014 and 2019. The airborne nadir and integrated limb profiles agree excellently among each other. Our airborne observations are further compared to collocated glyoxal measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with good agreement between both data sets for glyoxal observations in (1) pristine terrestrial, (2) pristine marine, (3) mixed polluted, and (4) biomass-burning-affected air masses with high glyoxal concentrations. Exceptions to the overall good agreement are observations of (1) faint and aged biomass burning plumes over the oceans and (2) of low-lying biomass burning or anthropogenic plumes in the terrestrial or marine boundary layer, both of which contain elevated glyoxal that is mostly not captured by TROPOMI. These differences in airborne and satellite-detected glyoxal are most likely caused by the overall small contribution of plumes of a limited extent to the total glyoxal absorption in the atmosphere and the difficulty in remotely detecting weak absorbers located close to low reflective surfaces (e.g. the ocean in the visible wavelength range) or within dense aerosol layers. Observations of glyoxal in aged biomass burning plumes (e.g. observed over the tropical Atlantic off the coast of West Africa in summer 2018, off the coast of Brazil by the end of the dry season 2019, and the East China Sea in spring 2018) could be traced back to related wildfires, such as a plume crossing over the Drake Passage that originated from the Australian bushfires in late 2019. Our observations of glyoxal in such aged biomass burning plumes confirm recent findings of enhanced glyoxal and presumably secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in aged wildfire plumes from yet-to-be-identified, longer-lived organic precursor molecules (e.g. aromatics, acetylene, or aliphatic compounds) co-emitted in the fires. Furthermore, elevated glyoxal (median 44 ppt - parts per trillion), as compared to other marine regions (median 10-19 ppt), is observed in the boundary layer over the tropical oceans, which is well in agreement with previous reports. The airborne data sets are further compared to glyoxal simulations performed with the global atmosphere chemistry model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). When using an EMAC set up that resembles recent EMAC studies focusing on complex chemistry, reasonable agreement is found for pristine air masses (e.g. the unperturbed free and upper troposphere), but a notable glyoxal overestimation of the model exists for regions with high emissions of glyoxal and glyoxal-producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the biosphere (e.g. the Amazon). In all other investigated regions, the model underpredicts glyoxal to varying degrees, in particular when probing mixed emissions from anthropogenic activities (e.g. over continental Europe, the Mediterranean, and East China Sea) and potentially from the sea (e.g. the tropical oceans). Also, the model tends to largely underpredict glyoxal in city plumes and aged biomass burning plumes.The potential causes for these differences are likelyto be multifaceted, but they all point to missing glyoxal sources from the degradation of the mixture of potentially longer-chained organic compounds emitted from anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, and from theorganic microlayer of the sea surface.

TI  - Modeling carbon uptake by vegetation of grassland ecosystems and its associated factors in China based on remote sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to reveal the spatial variation characteristics and influencing factors of grassland net primary productivity (NPP) in China, this paper uses remote sensing data, land use data and meteorological data to simulate and estimate China's grassland net primary productivity from 2001 to 2019 using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA). The trend analysis and complex correlation analysis were used to analyze the relationship with the temporal and spatial changes of grassland NPP from the perspectives of climate factors, topography, longitude and latitude. The results show that: 1) In the past 19 years, the China's grassland NPP has generally shown a fluctuating upward trend, the spatial distribution of NPP variation shows a characteristic of low in the west and high in the east, with the increased area accounting for 70.39% of the total grassland area, and the low NPP values are mainly distributed in the northwestern part of Tibet and Qinghai and the central part of Inner Mongolia, the average annual NPP is 257.13 g C.m(.)(-2)a(-1). 2) The change of mean NPP value of grassland in China is more dependent on precipitation (p) than air temperature (T). 3) Grassland NPP showed a decreasing trend with the increase of altitude, and the NPP on the gradient with DEM between 200 m and 500 m was the highest (483.86 g.C.m(.)(-2)a(-1)); The maximum annual mean value (448.42 g C(.)m(.)(-2)a(-1)) is fallen over the sharp slope of 35 degrees-45 degrees; the NPP of grassland increases with the slope (from shade to sunny), and the NPP of grassland on the semi-sunny slope increases. The annual average NPP is the highest (270.87 g C(.)m(.)(-2)a(-1)). 4) The mean value of grassland NPP was negatively correlated with the change of latitude, and showed a "wave-like " downward trend from south to north; the mean value of grassland NPP was positively related to the change of longitude. The correlation relationship shows a "stepped " upward trend from west to east.

TI  - Flood susceptibility mapping using multi-temporal SAR imagery and novel integration of nature-inspired algorithms into support vector regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood has long been known as one of the most catastrophic natural hazards worldwide. Mapping flood-prone areas is an important part of flood disaster management. In this study, a flood susceptibility mapping frame-work was developed based on a novel integration of nature-inspired algorithms into support vector regression (SVR). To this end, various remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) datasets were applied to the hybridized SVR models to map flood susceptibility in Ahwaz township, Iran. The proposed framework has two main steps: 1) updating the flood inventory (historical flooded locations) using the proposed RS-based flood detection method developed within the google earth engine (GEE) platform. The mosaicked images of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been used in this step; 2) producing flood sus-ceptibility map using the standalone SVR and hybridized model of SVR. The hybridized methods were derived from a novel integration of SVR with meta-heuristic algorithms, hence forming the SVR-bat algorithm (SVR-BA), SVR-invasive weed optimization (SVR-IWO), and SVR-firefly algorithm (SVR-FA). A spatial database of flood locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to stream, curvature, rainfall, soil type, and land use/cover) were built for the susceptibility modelling. The accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the statistical and sensitivity indices, such as root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) index. The results indicated that all hybridized models out-performed the standalone SVR. According to AUROC values, the predictive power of the SVR-FA was the highest with the value of 0.81, followed by SVR-IWO, SVR-BA, and SVR with values of 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively.

TI  - The impacts of Persian Gulf water and ocean-atmosphere interactions on tropical cyclone intensification in the Arabian Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last two decades, the number of tropical cyclone (TC) events in the Arabian Sea has increased dramatically. These events have led to severe human and economic damage in Oman, Iran and Pakistan. Within this context, Gonu, Phet and Shaheen were the Arabian Sea's most destructive TCs on record, leading to a total of 6.07 billion USD in damages and 159 fatalities. Previous studies have mainly focused on atmospheric, sea surface temperature (SST) and anthropogenic impacts of TC generation and intensification. By contrast, oceanographic currents, Persian Gulf water outflow and the role of ocean-atmospheric interactions on the distribution of outflow water into the Arabian Sea and their impacts on TC intensification, are poorly understood. In order to address this issue, we use historical TC records, satellite data, atmospheric and reanalyzed oceanographic data to shed new light on the relationship between large-scale atmospheric forcing and ocean currents on TC intensification in the Arabian Sea. The results demonstrate that pre-monsoon TCs mainly occurred during co-existing La Nin similar to a, cold Indian Ocean Basin Model (IOBM) and anomalous northern hemisphere circulations over the Persian Gulf. By contrast, post-monsoon TCs were generally generated during warming acceleration period. Poleward movement of the monsoon belt provided the required humidity and energy for TC generation and increased upwelling events. Water salinity and temperature have increased in the north and northwestern parts of the Arabian Sea following rising upwelling events and a decrease in Persian Gulf outflow water depth. Rapid TC intensification has increased noticeably since 2007 and >72 % of cyclones have reached category 3 or more. We find that the rate of SST rise in the Arabian Sea is higher than the other parts of the northern Indian Ocean since 1998. SST and salinity in the Arabian Sea have been controlled by Persian Gulf outflow water and oceanographic currents. TC intensity is controlled by warm and saline (>36.6 PSU) water distribution patterns, mediated by eddy and jet currents. Rapid intensification of pre-monsoon TCs occurred by tracking to the north and northwest, with most landfalls occurring during this period. Post-monsoon TCs generally affect the center and the southwest of the Arabian Sea. The risk of intensive TCs manifests an increasing trend since 2007, therefore education programs via international platforms such as the International Ocean Institute (IOI) and UNESCO are required for the countries most at risk.

TI  - Severity of influenza illness by seasonal influenza vaccination status among hospitalised patients in four South American countries, 2013-19: a surveillance- based cohort study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although several studies have reported attenuated influenza illness following influenza vaccination, results have been inconsistent and have focused predominantly on adults in the USA. This study aimed to evaluate the severity of influenza illness by vaccination status in a broad range of influenza vaccine target groups across multiple South American countries.Methods We analysed data from four South American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay) participating in REVELAC-i, a multicentre, test-negative design, vaccine effectiveness network including 41 sentinel hospitals. Individuals hospitalised at one of these centres with severe acute respiratory infection were tested for influenza by real-time RT-PCR, and were included in the analysis if they had complete information about their vaccination status and outcomes of their hospital stay. We used multivariable logistic regression weighted by inverse probability of vaccination and adjusted for antiviral use, duration of illness before admission, and calendar week, to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital death (and combinations of these outcomes) among influenza-positive patients by vaccination status for three target groups: young children (aged 6-24 months), adults (aged 18-64 years) with pre-existing health conditions, and older adults (aged & GE;65 years). Survival curves were used to compare length of hospital stay by vaccination status in each target group.Findings 2747 patients hospitalised with PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 8, 2019, were included in the study: 649 children (70 [10 & BULL;8%] fully vaccinated, 193 [29 & BULL;7%] partially vaccinated) of whom 87 (13 & BULL;4%) were admitted to ICU and 12 (1 & BULL;8%) died in hospital; 520 adults with pre-existing medical conditions (118 [22 & BULL;7%] vaccinated), of whom 139 (26 & BULL;7%) were admitted to ICU and 55 (10 & BULL;6%) died in hospital; and 1578 older adults (609 [38 & BULL;6%] vaccinated), of whom 271 (17 & BULL;2%) were admitted to ICU and 220 (13 & BULL;9%) died in hospital. We observed earlier discharge among partially vaccinated children (adjusted hazard ratio 1 & BULL;14 [95% CI 1 & BULL;01-1 & BULL;29]), fully vaccinated children (1 & BULL;24 [1 & BULL;04-1 & BULL;47]), and vaccinated adults with pre-existing medical conditions (1 & BULL;78 [1 & BULL;18-2 & BULL;69]) compared with their unvaccinated counterparts, but not among vaccinated older adults (0 & BULL;82 [0 & BULL;65-1 & BULL;04]). Compared with unvaccinated individuals, lower odds of ICU admission were found for partially vaccinated children (aOR 0 & BULL;64 [95% CI 0 & BULL;44-0 & BULL;92]) and fully vaccinated children (0 & BULL;52 [0 & BULL;28-0 & BULL;98]), but not for adults with pre-existing conditions (1 & BULL;25 [0 & BULL;93-1 & BULL;67]) or older adults (0 & BULL;88 [0 & BULL;72-1 & BULL;08]). Lower odds of in-hospital death (0 & BULL;62 [0 & BULL;50-0 & BULL;78]) were found in vaccinated versus unvaccinated older adults, with or without ICU admission, but did not differ significantly in partially vaccinated (1 & BULL;35 [0 & BULL;57-3 & BULL;20]) or fully vaccinated young children (0 & BULL;88 [0 & BULL;16-4 & BULL;82]) or adults with pre-existing medical conditions (1 & BULL;09 [0 & BULL;73-1 & BULL;63]) compared with the respective unvaccinated patient groups.Interpretation Influenza vaccination was associated with illness attenuation among those hospitalised with influenza, although results differed by vaccine target group. These findings might suggest that attenuation of disease severity might be specific to certain target groups, seasons, or settings.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil properties using random forest, k-nearest neighbors and cubist approaches in the foothills of the Ural Mountains, Russia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) and pH are important indicators to evaluate soil quality. This study applied several machine learning (ML) techniques, namely Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor method (kNN) and Cubist, to digital map SOM and pH (H2O and KCl) contents in the foothills of the Ural Mountains, Russia. For this purpose, a total of 52 soil samples were collected from the topsoil depth (0-20 cm). The environmental variables were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), satellite imagery (Sentinel-2A) and land use/land cover (LULC) map. The ML models were calibrated and validated by the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to determine the ML model performance. According to the R-2 and RMSE metrics, Cubist method resulted in the most accurate spatial prediction for SOM (R-2 = 0.64 and RMSE = 1.95), while RF approach showed the highest performance to predict pH H2O and KCl (R-2 = 0.49; RMSE = 0.45 and R-2 = 0.44; RMSE = 0.61, respectively). Results showed that remote sensing data were the key variables to explain the variability of all soil properties. Sentinel-2A bands B8A, B7 and B8 were the most effective covariates in predicting SOM, whereas spectral indices GNDVI and SAVI explained most of the spatial distribution of both soil pH. According to the generated maps, the highest SOM concentrations (4-8%) were found under the forest and especially at the bottom of the slopes, which is consistent with favorable conditions of organic carbon accumulation and its redeposition under the influence of water erosion. More acidic soils (pH H2O < 6) were also located under the forest, consisting of mixed coniferous broad-leaved species, which also affects the soil acidity. This study confirms the necessity to use various ML techniques to predict individual soil properties. Overall, our findings and generated maps can provide useful information for future digital soil mapping of areas in similar climatic and geographic conditions.

TI  - Status of deforestation of Madagascar
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have reported tree cover loss at an unprecedented rate in Madagascar because of human population expansion which affects biodiversity, ecosystems, and weather patterns. Here we examine deforestation in Madagascar over the past 20 years (2001-2021). Time-series analysis of Landsat images empirically show that Madagascar, which covers an area of about 59 million hectares (230,000 square miles), has lost 4.85 million hectares of tree cover since 2000, equivalent to a 25% decrease in tree cover, and a gross estimate of 2.52 gigatonnes of CO2e - carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Without breaking the intertwined cycle of poverty and deforestation, increasing rates of extinction will continue to impact Madagascar's flora and fauna.

TI  - Combined use of magnetic seed and tracer in breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy for non-palpable breast lesions: A pilot study describing pitfalls and solutions
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds: Traditionally, breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer is guided by wire or radioactive seed and radioactive tracer for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Alternatively, a stain-less magnetic seed and superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer (SPIO) can be combined as a radioactive-free technique. The aim of this study was to define the pitfalls we encountered during implementation of this combined technique and provide solutions resulting in an instruction manual for a radio-active free procedure. Methods: Between January and March 2021, seventeen consecutive patients with cN0 non-palpable breast cancer were included. The magnetic seed was placed to localize the lesion and SPIO was used to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN). A lymphoscintigraphy with Technetium-99m nano colloid was performed concomitantly in all patients as a control procedure for SPIO. Surgical outcomes are reported, including problems with placing and retrieval of the seed and SPIO and corresponding solutions. Results: Surgical excision was successful with invasive tumor-free margins in all patients. SLN detection was successful in 82% patients when compared to Technetium-99m. The most challenging issue was an overlapping magnetic signal of the seed and SPIO. Solutions are provided in detail. Conclusions: Combined use of magnetic seed and SPIO for wide local excision and SLNB patients with nonpalpable breast lesions appeared challenging due to overlapping magnetic signals. After multiple adaptations, the protocol proved to be feasible with an added advantage of eliminating the use of radioisotopes. We described the pitfalls and solutions resulting in an instruction manual for a totally radioactive-free procedure.

TI  - A new compositional, mineralogical and chronological study of the Leibnitz crater within the SPA basin
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leibnitz is an impact crater 237 km in diameter located on the lunar farside within the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. It shares much of its southern rim with the Von Karman crater (186 km in diameter), which is currently the focus of in situ exploration by the Yutu-2 rover, part of the Chang'e-4 mission. This complementary study analyzes Leibnitz's surface materials mineralogy and age using remote sensing data. We focused on the spectral information from 95 fresh craters within Leibnitz to minimize the effects of weathering on the exposed materials. Subsequently, we employed the Modified Gaussian Model to derive a distribution map for the high to low Ca pyroxene ratio values. Finally, we derived absolute model age estimations of the mare basalts using the lunar crater chronology method. A new geologic map of the Leibnitz crater summarizes the results of this study. The results show that the interiors of Von Karm;an and Leibnitz share a degree of similarity in mineral composition, with strong absorption features around the 1 mu m and 2 mu m bandcenters, due to the spectral dominance of mafic minerals. The ejecta from the adjacent Finsen crater have higher Ca/Fe and HCP/LCP ratios than the exposed materials of the Leibnitz crater. This study also finds evidence to support an older age of formation of the crater than age estimates to date from previous studies of the Leibnitz crater.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of VIIRS dark target and deep blue aerosol products over land
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms have been applied to the VIIRS to construct a long-term climate data recording of atmospheric aerosols. This study provides the first evaluation and comparison of two updated VIIRS aerosol products over global land based on Version 3 Level 1.5 AERONET measurements. Overall, both AOD products agree well with AERONET measurements with correlation coefficients >0.85 and over 75 % of AOD matchups falling within the expected error (EE). The DB product is superior to the DT product with more AOD matchups meeting the EE. Meanwhile, the DB AOD performs better in spatiotemporal accuracy, adaption to different aerosol types, and addresses the effects of large view geometry. DT AOD shows higher accuracy in the summer months in the northern hemisphere and evergreen broadleaf forest areas than DB AOD. The two products exhibit similar spa-tial distribution patterns of AOD, but higher values are seen in the DT product, especially in Asia and Western North America. The spatial completeness of the DB AOD is higher than DT, especially in brighter surface regions. In contrast, higher temporal completeness of the DT AOD is found in vegetated areas. A case study of the Western United States wildfires in 2020 indicates both products can capture extreme smoke aerosols. In addition, the DB AOD shows a dis-tinct advantage in spatial and temporal continuity and in displaying the regional transport of smoke aerosols. How-ever, the accuracy of the AOD retrieval for both products still needs to be improved in sparse vegetation regions, northern hemisphere summers, fine particle aerosols, and during extreme aerosol events. The overall evaluation of DB SSA and AE products shows that they are unsuitable for quantitative scientific research. This study can provide users a guide on how to select VIIRS aerosol products for different research purposes.

TI  - Single-port nipple-sparing subcutaneous mastectomy with immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThis study compares the perioperative results, aesthetic outcome and oncologic safety of single-port insufflation endoscopic nipple-sparing subcutaneous mastectomy combined with immediate reconstruction using prosthesis implantation (SIE-NSM-IRPI) with those of conventional open-nipple and areola-sparing subcutaneous mastectomy combined with immediate reconstruction using prosthesis implantation (C-NSM-IRPI).MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, 64 early-stage breast cancer patients were divided into SIE-NSM-IRPI (n = 38) and C-NSM-IRPI (n = 26) groups. Perioperative results (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, drainage duration, and recent complications) were then compared between the two groups. Differences in satisfaction with the breasts, psychosocial well-being, physical well-being (chest) and sexual well-being were analyzed according to the BREAST-Q scale, and survival outcomes were also compared.ResultsThe median follow-up time was 51.5 months. The incision length of SIE-NSM-IRPI was shorter than that of C-NSM-IRPI (P < 0.001). SIE-NSM-IRPI achieved the same detection rate and median number of sentinel lymph nodes as C-NSM-IRPI (3.00vs. 4.00, P = 0.780). The incidence of prosthesis removal due to infection or prosthesis exposure in the SIE-NSM-IRPI group was lower than that in the C-NSM-IRPI group (P = 0.015). Satisfaction with breasts (82.00vs.59.00, P < 0.001), psychosocial well-being (93.00vs.77.00, P = 0.001) and physical well-being (chest) (89.00vs.82.00, P < 0.001) scores were higher in the SIE-NSM-IRPI group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.829, 95% confidence interval = 0.182-3.779) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.919, 95% confidence interval = 0.169-21.842).ConclusionIn this selected cohort of patients with early breast cancer, SIE-NSM-IRPI was comparable to C-NSM-IRPI, considering oncologic safety and detection of sentinel lymph nodes. It had a lower incidence of prosthesis removal, shorter incision length, and was associated with better patient satisfaction with the breasts. More random clinical trials of this novel approach in a larger cohort of Chinese patients with an extended follow-up period are needed in the future.

TI  - Forest fire area detection using Sentinel-2 data: Case of the Beni Salah national forest-Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest cover plays an important role in terms of biodiversity and the environment. The Beni Salah national forest in its part which is located in the Guelma province in the extreme northeast of Algeria is an illustrative example where forest fires represent the chronic phenomenon which weighs heavily on this forest. The present study comes after a forest fire that occurred in 2021, when 3 000 ha of this forest were ravaged by forest fires according to the conservation of forests of Guelma. The main objective of this research is to map the severity of burns and estimate the severely burned area using Sentinel-2 satellite images based on remote sensing indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Differenced Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dGNDVI), Burn Area Index (BAI) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR). The result obtained revealed that 28.23% of the study area represents a seriously burned area. The established burn severity map is a real decision-making tool, but it still has certain limitations.

TI  - Investigation of Antalya forest fire's impact on air quality by satellite images using Google earth engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several fires occur in Turkiye every year for various reasons. Some of these fires are extinguished within a short period of time. But some of them get bigger due to various factors. Prolonged fires harm the biological ecosystem and nature to a great extent. Gases released into the atmosphere due to the fires negatively affect the life of living things. In this study, the number of fires in the Antalya-Manavgat region in 2021 was determined. For this aim, BAI (Burned Area Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) plant indexes were used to determine the amount of fire by us -ing high resolution satellite images. In addition, the carbon monoxide (CO) and ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) values during the fire were investigated using satellite images. The precipi-tation and temperature values of the region between the years 2015-2021 were discussed. The emitted gases were correlated with the national air quality station data and when the destroyed area after the fire was determined by satellite, it was determined that the CO gas released in the fire produced meaningful results with the national air quality station.

AB  - The present work is the first effort to apply machine learning approaches and variable importance analysis (VIA) to the determination of environmental attributes that regulate the variation of magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements (Xlf, Xhf, and Xfd) in landscape scale. We depicted a total of 346 soil samples (0-20 cm depth) by stratified random sampling in the west of Iran. MS measurements and some soil properties comprising clay, silt, sand, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) were measured. Fifty environmental variables from different sources (soil analyses, topographic attributes, remote sensing data, and thematic maps) and three machine learning approaches (Support vector machine, SVM), Random forest, RF), and Cubist) were used for modeling. The results revealed that the RF model showed the highest accurateness modeling Xhf (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 0.37) and Xfd (R2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.43). Also, the Cubist model presented acceptable accurateness in the modeling of Xlf (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.37). Among the inde-pendent variables used in the modeling of MS attributes, the distance from mines was identified as the most important variable, due to the release of ferrimagnetic minerals to the nearby environment. In the next rankings, soil properties affected by parent materials (silt and sand), as well as SOC and CCE "as the diamagnetic minerals" showed great contribution to the variability of MS. Moreover, some indices derived from remote sensing and topographic data including Ferrous Iron, Ferrous mineral, brightness index (BI), and Valley depth were impor-tant. This research confirmed the high potential of machine learning and VIA to find out the factors that control magnetic susceptibility across the study area. On the other hand, more advanced technologies are still needed to differentiate the contribution of each controlling variable in the detailed scales.

TI  - Disease Incidence and Severity of Cercospora Leaf Spot in Sugar Beet Assessed by Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Images and Machine Learning
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Disease incidence (DI) and metrics of disease severity are relevant parameters for decision making in plant protection and plant breeding. To develop automated and sensor-based routines, a sugar beet variety trial was inoculated with Cercospora beticola and monitored with a multispectral camera system mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over the vegetation period. A pipeline based on machine learning methods was established for image data analysis and extraction of disease-relevant parameters. Features based on the digital surface model, vegetation indices, shadow condition, and image resolution improved classification performance in comparison with using single multispectral channels in 12 and 6% of diseased and soil regions, respectively. With a postprocessing step, area-related parameters were computed after classification. Results of this pipeline also included extraction of DI and disease severity (DS) from UAV data. The calculated area under disease progress curve of DS was 2,810.4 to 7,058.8%.days for human visual scoring and 1,400.5 to 4,343.2%.days for UAV-based scoring. Moreover, a sharper differentiation of varieties compared with visual scoring was observed in area-related parameters such as area of complete foliage (A(F)), area of healthy foliage (A(H)), and mean area of lesion by unit of foliage (A(c/F)). These advantages provide the option to replace the laborious work of visual disease assessments in the field with a more precise, nondestructive assessment via multispectral data acquired by UAV flights.

TI  - Potential and limitations of crowdsourced data for high-resolution rice mapping in Madagascar: The importance of representation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the projected population growth and rice consumption in Madagascar, assessing its rice production potential is important. Existing spatial representations of rice are characterized by coarse resolutions and diverge widely. Mapping rice production based on remote sensing offers a potential solution to this problem but its application in Sub-Saharan Africa is hindered by scarce ground truth data and a complex array of cropping systems. While crowdsourcing initiatives provide data that could in principle be used to overcome this hurdle, their usefulness in rice mapping is hitherto underexplored. Here, we investigate the usefulness of crowdsourced data to enhance the mapping of rice production areas in the data-poor context of Madagascar. At present, dedicated crowdsourcing initiatives only limitedly cover rice but do provide sufficient information to build a dataset of data points characterizing a No-Rice class. On the other hand, geotagged pictures from social media, which do document rice production areas, predominantly represent 'scenic' fields appealing to social media contributors, i.e. irrigated, intensive rice production systems. The archetypal nature of these data leads to distinct feature signatures. Consequently, these data could be successfully used for rice mapping in the Lake Alaotra basin, which is characterized by the type of intensive rice cropping that is well-represented by the crowdsourced data. However, it was not possible to construct an accurate map of rice production in the greater Antananarivo region or at the national scale using crowdsourced data as they do not sufficiently represent the present variety in rice production systems. The value of crowdsourced data thus depends on the representativeness of the data, which in turn depends on the application and can be improved through applying a probabilistic sampling design. Our study also highlights the need for data representation checks prior to data augmentation or classification for future applications wanting to construct credible maps using crowdsourcing within their sampling design for which we present a multi-faceted evaluation framework.

TI  - Remote sensing-based energy balance for lettuce in an arid environment: influence of management scenarios on irrigation and evapotranspiration modeling
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient irrigation is critical for managing scarce water resources where precipitation is minimal. Field-scale irrigation is largely unaccounted for in landscape evapotranspiration models, primarily due to the unavailability of data and the lack of water balance components in energy balance-based evapotranspiration models. To overcome these challenges, we implemented a remote sensing-based energy and water balance model BAITSSS (Backward-Averaged Iterative Two-Source Surface temperature Solution) to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation requirements of winter lettuce in the arid environment of the Lower Colorado River Basin. Predicted evapotranspiration and irrigation were compared against data from twelve eddy covariance (EC) sites for wide range of soil hydraulic properties operating between 2016 and 2020 and the applied irrigation, respectively. BAITSSS estimated evapotranspiration and irrigation based on vegetative formation, weather demand, soil hydraulic characteristics, and predefined management allowed depletion (MAD) (0.4-0.6). Ground-based weather data, Sentinel-2-based vegetation indices, and SSURGO (NRCS soil survey database) soil moisture characteristics were model inputs. The results showed mean seasonal ET from BAITSSS and EC were comparable, differing on average by about 7% based on a constant rooting depth (500 mm) and MAD of 0.5 for entire crop growth stages. Variations in daily and seasonal ET were mainly due to differences in applied and model-simulated irrigation. Seasonal values of applied and simulated irrigation closely agreed (similar to 6%) in most sites, though some sites applied irrigation more effectively than others. Overall, this study provided insight into consumptive water use and field-scale irrigation practices, as well as the capabilities and limitations of model-simulated ET and irrigation.

TI  - Climate adaptation and vulnerability of foundation species in a global change hotspot
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering species ranges, and relative abundances within ranges, as populations become differentially adapted and vulnerable to the climates they face. Understanding present species ranges, whether species harbour and exchange adaptive variants, and how variants are distributed across landscapes undergoing rapid change, is therefore crucial to predicting responses to future climates and informing conservation strategies. Such insights are nonetheless lacking for most species of conservation concern. We assess genomic patterns of neutral variation, climate adaptation and climate vulnerability (offsets in predicted distributions of putatively adaptive variants across present and future landscapes) for sister foundation species, the marine tubeworms Galeolaria caespitosa and Galeolaria gemineoa, in a sentinel region for climate change impacts. We find that species are genetically isolated despite uncovering sympatry in their ranges, show parallel and nonparallel signals of thermal adaptation on spatial scales smaller than gene flow across their ranges, and are predicted to face different risks of maladaptation under future temperatures across their ranges. Our findings have implications for understanding local adaptation in the face of gene flow, and generate spatially explicit predictions for climatic disruption of adaptation and species distributions in coastal ecosystems that could guide experimental validation and conservation planning.

TI  - Prediction of lake chlorophyll concentration using the BP neural network and Sentinel-2 images based on time features
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important indicators of lake eutrophication is chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, which is also an essential component of lake water quality monitoring. It is an efficient, economical and convenient method to monitor the Chl-a concentration through remote sensing images. Taking the Wuliangsuhai Lake as an example, the relevant bands of Sentinel-2 images were used as the input and the Chl-a concentration as the output to build neural network models. In the process of building the model, we mainly studied and tested the impact of adding time features to the model input on the model accuracy. Through the experiment, it was found that the month and day difference features of remote sensing images and Chl-a measurement could significantly improve the prediction accuracy of Chl-a concentration in varying degrees. Finally, it was determined that the neural network prediction model with 12 bands of Sentinel-2 images combined month features as inputs and 1 hidden layer, 8 neurons and Chl-a concentration as outputs was the best. Then, the accuracy of the model was validated when the test set accounts for 20 and 30%, and good results were obtained.

TI  - A hyperspectral image reconstruction algorithm based on RGB image using multi-scale atrous residual convolution network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images are a valuable tool for remotely sensing important characteristics of a variety of landscapes, including water quality and the status of marine disasters. However, hyperspectral data are rare or expensive to obtain, which has spurred interest in low-cost, fast methods for reconstructing hyperspectral data from much more common RGB images. We designed a novel algorithm to achieve this goal using multi-scale atrous convolution residual network (MACRN). The algorithm includes three parts: low-level feature extraction, high-level feature extraction, and feature transformation. The high-level feature extraction module is composed of cascading multi-scale atrous convolution residual blocks (ACRB). It stacks multiple modules to form a depth network for extracting high-level features from the RGB image used as an input. The algorithm uses jump connection for residual learning, and the final high-level feature combines the output of the low-level feature extraction module and the output of the cascaded atrous convolution residual block element by element, so as to prevent gradient dispersion and gradient explosion in the deep network. Without adding too many parameters, the model can extract multi-scale features under different receptive fields, make better use of the spatial information in RGB images, and enrich the contextual information. As a proof of concept, we ran an experiment using the algorithm to reconstruct hyperspectral Sentinel-2 satellite data from the northern coast of Australia. The algorithm achieves hyperspectral spectral reconstruction in 443nm-2190nm band with less computational cost, and the results are stable. On the Realworld dataset, the reconstruction error MARE index is less than 0.0645, and the reconstruction time is less than 9.24S. Therefore, in the near infrared band, MACRN reconstruction accuracy is significantly better than other spectral reconstruction algorithms. MACRN hyperspectral reconstruction algorithm has the characteristics of low reconstruction cost and high reconstruction accuracy, and its advantages in ocean spectral reconstruction are more obvious.

TI  - Development of chlorophyll-a concentration estimation algorithm for turbid productive inland waters in India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from remote-sensing reflectance derived from satellite imagery is highly effective in monitoring the spatial and temporal optical variations in water bodies. In turbid, productive and inland waters, implementation of traditional Chl-a estimation algorithms using the blue and green wavelength bands results in higher error in estimated Chl-a. To minimize the absorption and scattering effects of other water constituents like colored dissolved organic matter and particulate matter, the wavelengths bands in red and Near Infrared (NIR) are generally used for estimating Chl-a concentration in productive waters. Owing to a widely observed optical variability in natural waters, a single universal algorithm is not applicable to all waterbodies, hence, regional tuning of algorithms is necessary for estimating Chl-a in turbid and inland productive waters. Here, a 2-band based algorithm of the form R-rs(lambda(1))/R-rs(lambda(2)) and a 3-band algorithm of form [R-rs(-1)(lambda 1)-R-rs(-1)(lambda(2))] x Rrs(lambda 3) were tuned for Chl-a estimation based on field measurements carried out in three water bodies, Chilika Lake of Orissa, Ujjani Reservoir of Maharashtra, Vallabh Sagar Reservoir of Gujarat, India, wherein the observed Chl-a concentration range is 5-33 mg/m(3). Together with measured in situ reflectance spectra and concurrent Chl-a concentrations, tuning of red-NIR algorithms is performed. The optimal wavelengths to estimate Chl-a found by the proximal sensing method are lambda(1) = 691 nm and lambda(2) = 667 nm in case of 2-band red-NIR type algorithm. For 3-band red-NIR algorithm, the optimal wavelengths are lambda(1) = 670 nm, lambda(2) = 696 nm and lambda(3) = 740 nm. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values obtained for the estimated Chl-a using the tuned 2-band red-NIR algorithm are 29.9% and 5.35 mg/m(3), respectively. Similarly, RMSE and MAPE values for Chl-a concentration estimated using the 3-band tuned red-NIR algorithm are 4.24 mg/m3 and 22.5%, respectively. The tuned 2-band and 3-band algorithms resulted in better Chl-a estimates than the fourteen blue-green and red-NIR algorithms from previous studies. The 2-band and 3-band algorithms were re-calibrated to wavelengths present in the ocean land color imager (OLCI) sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite to monitor these water bodies. Spatio-temporal analysis of OLCI imagery derived Chl-a concentrations over Chilika lake (2019 and 2020) indicated seasonal variations. The tuned 3-band red-NIR algorithm exhibited robust performance in all seasons despite wide variations in colored dissolved organic matter and suspended sediments. The tuned red-NIR algorithms are useful in monitoring inland turbid productive waters with upcoming missions such as Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud Ecosystem (PACE) and Oceansat-3.

TI  - Analyzing spatio-temporal mechanisms of land subsidence in the Parowan Valley, Utah, USA
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Parowan Valley, Utah (USA), is an agricultural region experiencing rapid subsidence due to extensive groundwater extraction from aquifers with a significant portion of fine-grained sediments. To analyze the subsidence spatio-temporally, time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) of 155 Sentinel-1 C-band scenes were processed. These data showed approximately 30 cm of ground subsidence in Parowan Valley from 2014 to 2020. Because of the high temporal sampling rate of the Sentinel-1 satellite (12-day cycle), it is possible to determine the seasonal changes of ground deformation and relate this to groundwater extraction. To better understand the relationship between ground deformation and groundwater extraction in the Parowan Valley, temporal changes in hydraulic head data from US Geological Survey observation wells were monitored. Additionally, well logs were analyzed and used to construct a map that showed the percentage of fine-grained material in the subsurface. The investigation of hydraulic head and geology, together with InSAR-derived ground displacement data, indicates that the most subsidence occurs where there is a co-occurrence of high groundwater demand and a high percentage of fine-grained sediments, but recharge likely plays a role in mitigating subsidence in some areas. The subsidence developed in Parowan Valley shows a long-term trend as well as seasonal variation and appears to be influenced by both agricultural activity and annual precipitation.

TI  - Hydrological and botanical diversity of a raised bog and its evaluation using<i> in</i><i> situ</i> and remote sensing methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland vegetation requires water-logged conditions for peat-forming plant communities to survive. Changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition. Occa-sionally, the spatial and chronological constraints in water table monitoring impede the correct evaluation of the status of these sensitive ecohydrological systems. Therefore, it is important to combine in situ and remote sensing methods to assess ecohydrological diversity over large areas of threatened peatland ecosystems. The present study assessed the relationship between hydrological indicators (the in situ water table fluctuations of 57 mea-surement wells and five study plots in the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons); botanical indicators (in situ species composition in three raised bog habitat types, namely, bog woodland, a semi-open raised bog, and an open raised bog); and spectral indices (NDVI - Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and NDWI - Normalised Difference Water Index, 2015-2020, Sentinel 2) for the evaluation of heterogeneous raised bog spatial patterns and tem-poral change. There were statistically significant relationships between vegetation and water table depth in different raised bog habitat types. Deeper water tables prevailed in woodland habitats (trees, green mosses, Rhododendron tomentosum) and vice versa in areas where open raised bog plants (Sphagnum) occupied the sur-face. Moderate relationships (r > |0.4|, p <.05) were detected between some of the botanical and hydrological indicators and spectral indices. The application of high-resolution remote sensing data may be useful for raised bog measurements, and changes in vegetation cover and related spectral indices may become hydroclimatic indicators.

TI  - Observations of intra-peatland variability using multiple spatially coincident remotely sensed data sources and machine learning
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are important sites of ecosystem services, particularly as soil carbon stores, and are recognised in many international climate strategies. However, drained peatlands, which have been modified for industrial extraction or agriculture, are responsible for carbon emission. Peatland restoration aims to return these degraded sites to a natural state. Multiple means of remotely monitoring the success of peat restoration are available, ranging from space-based satellite measurements (optical and radar) to airborne geophysical measurements (electro-magnetic and radiometric). This paper integrates multi-band, spatially coincident, remotely sensed data into a single framework, resulting in a comprehensive interpretation of intra-peatland variation of key restoration indicators. It uses a semi-automatic, data driven approach with unsupervised neural network machine learning clustering. A Multi-Cluster Average Standard Deviation metric is introduced which can determine the appropriate number of clusters for any dataset. The method was applied to a site in Ireland, representative of degraded peatlands, where optical satellite and airborne radiometric geophysical measurements were combined. The method was successful at determining the appropriate number of clusters for single and combined datasets, and the resulting cluster signatures provided visually compelling representations of the intra-peatland variation. This resulted in a comprehensive interpretation of intra-peatland variation of several key peatland restoration indicators, namely surface vegetation levels and soil moisture to - 60 cm of the peat surface. The study provides a framework for high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of peatland restoration using future drone-based platforms.

TI  - Evaluating capabilities of machine learning algorithms for aquatic vegetation classification in temperate wetlands using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Different perspectives use of machine learning (ML) algorithms have proven their performance depends on the quality of reference data. This is particularly true when targets are complex environments, such as wetlands, on which a vast majority of studies are site-specific and based on a single date. With this work, an extensive reference dataset of about 400,000 samples was collected, covering nine different sites and multiple seasons, to be considered representative of temperate wetland vegetation communities at continental scale. Starting from this dataset, the performance of selected ML classifiers was compared for detailed wetland vegetation type mapping, using spectral indices (SI) derived from multi-temporal composites of Sentinel-2 as input. Global and per-class accuracy metrics were computed based on four independent training and testing subsets, extracted from the overall dataset, and the impacts of input features variation in number and sites covered were assessed. Our results show a generally higher predictive power for ensemble methods, such as Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), compared to standalone ones, with the notable exception of Support Vector Machine (SVM); the latter in fact, in the algorithm that scored the highest overall accuracy (0.977 +/- 0.001) and F-score for all the target classes. Decreasing the number of input features generally resulted in classification accuracy losses, less marked for RF than for SVM, while site-specific algorithms training showed more stability of SVM, thus indicating SVM stronger transferability than RF and XGBoost.

TI  - Exploring the use of Sentinel-2 datasets and environmental variables to model wheat crop yield in smallholder arid and semi-arid farming systems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low levels of agricultural productivity are associated with the persistence of food insecurity, poverty, and other socio-economic stresses. Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in real-time at high spatial resolu-tion are essential for ensuring food security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since input datasets are generally scarce, and access is re-stricted due to security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield. Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we estimated an R2 value of 51 % for the model, whereas for out-of-sample prediction, this was 41 %, both of which indicate reasonable predictive performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23 for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by reducing prediction var-iability. Besides crop yield estimates, the model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition, the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power. The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments, particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of agricultural statistics.

TI  - Geoenvironment factors guided coastal urban growth prospect (UGP) delineation using heuristic and machine learning models
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urban growth along the coastal cities may disturb the balance between the ecosystem and urbani-sation; thus, a development strategy guided by geoenvironmental factors is necessary. We have attempted to delineate suitable Urban Growth Prospect (UGP) zones within the coastal region of the Vishakhapatnam district of India, based on geoenvironmental factors. We conduct an initial assessment of the temporal urban growth pattern in last 15 years using Landsat data and published landuse maps, demonstrating that the urban growth has percolated to unstable geomorphic units, making it vulnerable to flooding. Geoenvironmental factors (geo-morphology, lithology, structure, land use, soil, slope and groundwater) based multi-thematic data integration approach is adopted to delineate UGP zones using heuristic and machine learning techniques like Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR). We used present-day field observations to train the predictive models like ANN, LR & RF and test the outcomes with accuracy assessment ratios (detection percentage, miss factor etc.). The ANN-derived result presents the best accuracy with a detection percentage of 85% and predicts a 55% spatial scope of urban expansion, which was further refined using the mask of the strategic and ecologically sensitive location with appropriate buffers. The final map represents the UGP zones within the city and surroundings, encompassing stable landform units. The study provides insight into the usefulness of the heuristic and machine learning models in predictive analysis, using geoenvironmental factors for urban expansion in fast-growing coastal cities.

TI  - The Mystery of Cancer Resistance: A Revelation Within Nature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer, a disease due to uncontrolled cell proliferation is as ancient as multicellular organisms. A 255-million-years-old fossilized forerunner mammal gorgonopsian is probably the oldest evidence of cancer, to date. Cancer seems to have evolved by adapting to the microenvironment occupied by immune sentinel, modulating the cellular behavior from cytotoxic to regulatory, acquiring resistance to chemotherapy and surviving hypoxia. The interaction of genes with environmental carcinogens is central to cancer onset, seen as a spectrum of cancer susceptibility among human population. Cancer occurs in life forms other than human also, although their exposure to environmental carcinogens can be different. Role of genetic etiology in cancer in multiple species can be interesting with regard to not only cancer susceptibility, but also genetic conservation and adaptation in speciation. The widely used model organisms for cancer research are mouse and rat which are short-lived and reproduce rapidly. Research in these cancer prone animal models has been valuable as these have led to cancer therapy. However, another rewarding area of cancer research can be the cancer-resistant animal species. The Peto's paradox and G-value paradox are evident when natural cancer resistance is observed in large mammals, like elephant and whale, small rodents viz. Naked Mole Rat and Blind Mole Rat, and Bat. The cancer resistance remains to be explored in other small or large and long-living animals like giraffe, camel, rhinoceros, water buffalo, Indian bison, Shire horse, polar bear, manatee, elephant seal, walrus, hippopotamus, turtle and tortoise, sloth, and squirrel. Indeed, understanding the molecular mechanisms of avoiding neoplastic transformation across various life forms can be potentially having translational value for human cancer management.

TI  - Nodal lymphangiogenesis and immunophenotypic variations of sinus endothelium in sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes of invasive breast carcinoma
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated the de novo formation of lymphatic vessels or the reorganization of lymphatic sinus in tumor-draining lymph nodes, partly preceding the detection of lymphatic metastases. This "lymphovascular niche"is supposed to facilitate the survival of metastatic tumor cells. Few studies on nodal lymphangiogenesis in invasive breast cancer (BC) have been published, not considering tumor-free sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and tumor types. Specimens of SLN and/ or non-SLN (NSLN) of 95 patients with BC were examined immunohistochemically for expression of the lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 (podoplanin) on lymphatic vessels and the subcapsular sinus. The number of D2-40-positive lymph vessels in metastases was evaluated with two morphometric methods (Chalkley count and number per HPF). Data was explored with respect to TNM parameters, grading, tumor type, size of metastasis, lymph vessel number and hormone receptor/HER2 status with appropriate statistical tests. Lymphangiogenesis was detected exclusively in and around BC metastases with both methods for lymph vessel quantification being equivalent. Lymph vessel number correlated with the size of metastases, being significantly higher in larger metastases (p < 0.001). There was no significant statistical difference with respect to tumor types. Intranodal lymphangiogenesis could not be verified by D2-40 staining in any of the tumor-free lymph nodes examined. However, D2-40 was frequently detected in sinus endothelial/virgultar cells of the subcapsular sinus, partly with strong uniform positivity. Staining intensity and stained proportion of the subcapsular sinus were markedly heterogeneous, significantly correlating with each other both in SLN and NSLN (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of D2-40 stained subcapsular sinus in SLN was significantly associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.0036) and an independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis (p = 0.033, HR 2.87). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the biological and clinical significance of the observed immunophenotypic variations of nodal sinus endothelium.

TI  - Synergistic effects of climate warming and atmospheric nutrient deposition on the alpine lake ecosystem in the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau during the Anthropocene
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are highly sensitive to global change and have been recognized as the sentinel of climate warming. However, anthropogenic impacts in populated area are migrating to these remote areas via transporting particulate nutrients by atmospheric deposition. Whether warming and nutrient deposition would impose additive or synergistic effects on the lake ecosystem remains largely unknown. Here, we present multi-proxy (sediment pigment and geochemistry) records during the past two centuries at the Cuoqia Lake in the southeast Tibetan Plateau. We found that the lake exhibited rapid ecological changes since 1980 AD characterized by an increase in primary productivity due to algal proliferation, with more rapid growth of green algae and diatoms. These findings are in concert with many other lakes (e.g., Moon Lake and Shade Co) in the same area, suggesting a consistent pattern of ecosystem evolution at the region scale. Statistical analyses suggested that nutrient deposition and climate warming were strongly associated with the variations in primary productivity and algae composition, exerting both individual and interactive effects. In addition, scenario analyses with a well-established process-based ecosystem model further revealed that the two factors not only individually, but also synergistically promoted the algal proliferation and community succession. Such synergy is evident in that the effect of lake warming would be more pronounced under higher nutrient deposition scenario, which is potentially due to higher temperature-driven mineralization in warmer conditions, and higher efficiency of nutrient utilization under enhanced light availability attributing to declining ice thickness and duration in cold seasons. Overall, our study proposes the existence and quantifies the synergistic impacts of climate warming and anthropogenic activities in driving the ecological changes in remote alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The lake ecological consequences driven by individual factor would be worsen by such synergy, so that we cannot predict the lake ecosystem trajectory in the future based on each factor separately, and more efforts than previously expected would be needed for the lake restoration and management.

TI  - Temporal and spatial dynamics distribution of organic carbon content of surface soil in coastal wetlands of Yancheng, China from 2000 to 2022 based on Landsat images
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the dynamic changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) content in coastal wetlands over the past 23 years, we use the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Nature Reserve in Jiangsu Province, China as the study area. A normalized difference soil spectral index (NDSOC), which is directly related to SOC, was constructed by using the spectral reflectance of Landsat images, and six auxiliary environmental variables related to SOC were extracted: surface temperature, surface moisture, soil salinity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface brightness, and soil texture information. The coastal wetland soil surface SOC inversion model was constructed by multiple linear regression, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization-based random forest regression (PSO-RFR). By using the best inversion model, we obtain the dynamic distribution of soil surface SOC in the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Reserve for the past 23 years. The results indicate (1) that the NDSOC index constructed based on the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands 1 and 2 of the Landsat images has a strong indication of SOC. Among the extracted auxiliary environmental variables, the NDVI, soil clay content, surface temperature, and soil salinity contribute more strongly to the SOC content of coastal wetlands, which averaged 27.9 %, 24.4 %, 22.1 %, and 18 %, respectively. (2) The PSO-RFR algorithm provided the best simulation of the surface SOC content of coastal wetlands: the model determination coefficient R2 is 0.731, the average fitting root mean square error RMSE is 0.917 g/kg, and the fitting uncertainty standard deviation was 0.362 g/kg. (3) From 2000 to 2022, the organic carbon storage and organic carbon density in the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Reserve gradually increased, the highest value was reached in 2016, they were 4.017 (104 t) and 1.718 kg/cm2, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of lake area in response to climate change at varying elevations: A case study of Mt. Tianshan, Central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in lake area (water surface area) are often considered accurate and sensitive representations of climate change. However, the role that elevation plays in this dynamic is somewhat unclear; studies remain inconclusive as to whether lake responses are consistent across elevation gradients. Here, we used Landsat and keyhole satellite images to quantify lake area changes from the 1960s to 2020 at different elevations in Central Asia's Tianshan Mountains and relate them to both climatic and anthropogenic factors. The results revealed that all low-elevation lakes showed a de-creasing trend, and the total area of all monitored low-elevation lakes was reduced by 18.50 %. The total area of the mid-elevation lakes decreased by 0.16 %, while the total area of the high-elevation glacial lakes increased by 4.35 %. Lakes are recharged by a variety of influxes including glacial meltwater and precipitation. Notably, human activities (urban and agricultural water consumption) were the dominant factors in the shrinkage of low-elevation lakes. Cli-matic factors were the main driving factors of mid-elevation lake changes, and these lakes appeared to be more sensi-tive to temperature changes than lakes at other elevations. In addition, significant warming dominated area changes in high-elevation proglacial and unconnected glacial lakes. Overall, those results emphasized that when using lakes to re-construct paleoclimates or predict lake evolution, it is necessary to consider how elevation gradients and recharge types may affect lake sensitivity to variations in climatic and anthropogenic activity.

TI  - The role of drought conditions on the recent increase in wildfire occurrence in the high Andean regions of Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire occurrence has increased sharply in the last two decades in the Peruvian Andes. There is, however, little research on wildfires and their impacts. This study explores the conditions conducive to wildfire during 2020. MODIS images were collected to estimate the development of vegetation. In addition, ground-based monthly and satellite-based daily precipitation data were collected. Daily precipitation regularity was evaluated using a concentration index (CI), while monthly precipitation was used to estimate the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). We used also the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI), which is a useful indicator of vegetation dynamics based on vegetation moisture. Our results do not indicate a direct link between rainfall regularity (lowest CI values) and development of vegetation. Although the SPI drought analysis using seasonal rainfall indicated nearly normal conditions during 2019-2020, analysis of dry-day frequency (DDF) suggests that the dry period played an important role between September and November 2020, producing conditions similar to the droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2016. GVMI also showed below-average values from April to November. We corroborate the usefulness of DDF for monitoring the potential increase in wildfire conditions. A controlled burn policy could offer a more useful way to reduce the impacts of wildfire.

TI  - ChinaCropSM1 km: a fine 1 km daily soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize across China during 1993-2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable of the regional hydrological cycle and has important applications for water resource and agricultural drought management. Various global soil moisture products have been mostly retrieved from microwave remote sensing data. However, currently there is rarely spatially explicit and time-continuous soil moisture information with a high resolution at the national scale. In this study, we generated a 1 km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181 327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164 202 samples) and others for testing (17 125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20 cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033 m(3) m(-3); maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035 m(3) m(-3)). The spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of ChinaCropSM1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116 %, ubRMSE decreased by 64 %), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM. The approach developed in our study could be applied to other regions and crops in the world, and our improved datasets are very valuable for many studies and field management, such as agricultural drought monitoring and crop yield forecasting. The data are published in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6834530 (wheat(0-10)) (Cheng et al., 2022a), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6822591 (wheat(10-20)) (Cheng et al., 2022b), https://doi/org/10.5281/zenodo.6822581 (maize(10)) (Cheng et al., 2022c) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6820166 (maize(10-20)) (Cheng et al., 2022d).

AB  - Purpose of ReviewIdentifying and treating long-term complications of cancer treatment, including breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), is important as BCRL negatively impacts the quality of life in both physical and psychosocial domains. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent literature regarding risk factors for lymphedema, review risk reduction strategies, and dispel myths about precautionary behaviors.Recent FindingsEarly detection and treatment of BCRL, including subclinical lymphedema, is encouraged. Lymphovenous bypass and LYMPHA may reduce the incidence of BCRL. Patients no longer need to avoid blood pressure measurements, needle sticks, and flying as they do not increase the risk of nor incite BCRL.Risk factors such as the type of axillary surgery and radiation therapy remain the leading contributors to BCRL development. Blanketed recommendations regarding precautionary behaviors should be avoided. Surgical treatment and prevention of BCRL continue to mature and appropriate patients should be counseled regarding these options.

TI  - Lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy in vulvar melanoma: the first multicenter study and systematic review
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective. This multicenter study aimed to investigate the role of preoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) as well as the impact of negative SNB on loco-regional control and survival in vulvar melanoma patients with clinically negative nodes (cN0).Methods. Patients who had a proven vulvar melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1-4 mm, cN0 and under-went a preoperative lymphatic mapping followed by SNB between July 2013 and March 2021 were retrospec-tively included. Groin recurrence and mortality rate were calculated as absolute and relative frequency. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. We provided a systematic review, searching among PubMed/Medline and Embase libraries. A total of 6 studies were identified (48 patients).Results. A total of 18 women were included. Preoperative planar images showed 51 SNs in 28 groins. Additional SPECT/CT images were acquired in 5/18 cases; SNs were identified pre-and intra-operatively in all cases. A total of 65 SNs were excised from 28 groins. A total of 13/18 (72.2%) patients (21/28 groins, 75%) had negative SNs with no groin recurrences and 12/13 (92.3%) were still alive at last follow-up. Five out of the 18 (27.8%) patients (7/28 groins, 25%) had positive SNs, 2/5 (40%) patients died of cancer after 26.2 and 33.8 months, respectively. The median DFS and OS for the entire cohort were 17.9 months (95% CI, 10.3-19.9) and 65.0 months (95% CI, 26.2-infinite), respectively. The probability of DFS and OS at 3 years were 15.5% (95% CI, 2.6-38.7) and 64.3% (95% CI, 15.5-90.2), respectively.Conclusions. The use of preoperative lymphatic mapping followed by SNB permits a precise and minimally in-vasive surgical approach in cN0 vulvar melanoma patients. Negative SNB is associated with low risk of groin re-lapse and good survival.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effects of extreme flood events on the turbidity maximum zone in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary, China
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme flood events can significantly disturb hydro-sediment dynamics and affect turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) distributions, which are crucial to estuary evolution. This study used field data and eight Sentinel-2A/B MSI, GF-1/6 WFV, and Landsat-8 OLI satellite images to examine the behavior of the TMZ in the North Passage (NP) and South Passage (SP) of the Yangtze Estuary under the influence of the 2020 extreme flood event. Images covered average annual, usual flood, and extreme flood (river discharge above 70,000 m3/s) conditions between 2018 and 2020. The surface suspended sediment concentration (SSSC) of the Yangtze Estuary was retrieved and verified by the in-situ measured turbidity. Relative SSSC (RSSSC), the ratio of retrieved SSSC to region-averaged SSSC, was then calculated to determine the TMZ (RSSSC>1). The results show that the relation between the SSSC measured in the TMZ core of the SP and river discharge at Datong Gauging Station demonstrated an anticlockwise hysteresis, which can be divided into three stages. In the second stage, the observed SSSCs during the extreme flood were 0.18- 0.68 kg/m3, 0.10- 0.17 kg/m3 higher than before. SSSCs after the extreme flood were lower than those with similar discharge before it in this stage. The TMZ boundary location is correlated logarithmically with river discharge, and the upper boundary moves more seaward than the lower boundary. They moved 6- 20 and - 4- 11 km seaward in the NP and migrated 4- 13 and - 7- 9 km seaward in the SP during the extreme flood, respectively, compared with average annual and usual flood conditions. These findings further clarify TMZ characteristics in extreme floods and can be used as a reference for ecological and waterway projects considering the impacts of extreme flood events.

A series of simulations by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) satellite data were used and compared against the observed data during the period 2013-2017. Results indicate overestimation by the WRF model in most of the stations and underestimation of wind speed by the CCMP for relatively strong winds. Maximum and minimum wind speeds in the Persian Gulf occur in its southeastern and northwestern parts, respectively. Maximum wind speed over the Oman Sea occurs in its northeastern, central, and southeastern parts. Maximum extractable wind energy is from the Oman Sea, especially in the eastern parts and also, in some parts of the Sultanate of Oman coastal area.

TI  - Persistence and remote sensing of agri-food wastes in the environment: Current state and perspectives
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Food demand is expected to increase globally by 60-110% from 2005 to 2050 due to diet shifts and population growth. This growth in food demand leads to the generation of enormous agri-food wastes (AFWs), which could be classified into pre-consumption and post-consumption. The AFW represents economic losses for all stakeholders along food supply chains, including consumers. It is reported that the direct financial, social, and environmental costs of food waste are 1, 0.9, and 0.7 trillion USD/year, respectively. Diverse conventional AFW management approaches are employed at the different life cycle levels (entre supply chain). The review indicates that inadequate transportation, erroneous packaging, improper storage, losses during processing, contamination, issues with handling, and expiry dates are the main reason for the generation of AFWs in the supply chain. Further, various variables such as cultural, societal, personal, and behavioral factors contribute to the AFW generation. The selection of a specific valorization technology is based on multiple physicochemical and biological parameters. Furthermore, other factors like heterogeneity of the AFWs, preferable energy carriers, byproducts management, cost, end-usage applications, and environmental legislative and disposal processes also play a crucial role in adopting suitable technology. Valorization of AFW could significantly impact both economy and the environment. AFWs have been widely investigated for the development of engineered added-value biomaterials and renewable energy production. Considering this, this study has been carried out to highlight the significance of AFW cost, aggregation, quantification, and membrane-based strategies for its management. The study also explored the satellite remote sensing data for Spatio-temporal monitoring, mapping, optimization, and management of AFW management. Along with this, the study also explained the most recent strategies for AFW valorization and outlined the detailed policy recommendation along with opportunities and challenges. The review suggested that AFW should be managed using a triple-bottom-line strategy (economic, social, and environmental sustainability).

TI  - U-net-based semantic classification for flood extent extraction using SAR imagery and GEE platform: A case study for 2019 central US flooding
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven models for water body extraction have experienced accelerated growth in recent years, thanks to advances in processing techniques and computational resources, as well as improved data availability. In this study, we modified the standard U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) method, to extract water bodies from scenes captured from Sentinel-1 satellites of selected areas during the 2019 Central US flooding. We compared the results to several benchmark models, including the standard U-Net and ResNet50, an advanced thresholding method, Bmax Otsu, and a recently introduced flood inundation map archive. Then, we looked at how data input types, input resolution, and using pre-trained weights affect the model performance. We adopted a three-category classification frame to test whether and how permanent water and flood pixels behave differently. Most of the data in this study were gathered and pre-processed utilizing the open access Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. According to the results, the adjusted U-Net outperformed all other benchmark models and datasets. Adding a slope layer enhances model performance with the 30 m input data compared to training the model on only VV and VH bands of SAR images. Adding DEM and Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model data layer improved performance for models trained on 10 m datasets. The results also suggested that CNN-based semantic segmentation may fail to correctly classify pixels around narrow river channels. Furthermore, our findings revealed that it is necessary to differentiate permanent water and flood pixels because they behave differently. Finally, the results indicated that using pre-trained weights from a coarse dataset can significantly minimize initial training loss on finer datasets and speed up convergence.

TI  - Probabilistic cloud mask from visible and infrared sensors on-board geostationary platform
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel technique for developing a probabilistic cloud mask using sensors on a geostationary platform. The clear-sky probability of a pixel is estimated using the past 45 days' observations by making use of the Gaussian mixture model, spectral clustering, and Bayes' theorem. The proposed cloud-masking algorithm is applied on INSAT-3D imager observations for the whole years 2017 and 2018. The INSAT-3D imager cloud mask generated using the proposed method is compared against the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MYD35 cloud-mask product. The skill of the algorithm, against the MODIS cloud-mask product, is evaluated for day and night as well as for land and ocean separately. Overall, the Kuipers skill score (KSS) is found to be 0.82. The best performance of the algorithm is obtained during daytime over the land with KSS=0.84$$ \mathrm{KSS}=0.84 $$.

TI  - Karst vegetation coverage detection using UAV multispectral vegetation indices and machine learning algorithm
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundKarst vegetation is of great significance for ecological restoration in karst areas. Vegetation Indices (VIs) are mainly related to plant yield which is helpful to understand the status of ecological restoration in karst areas. Recently, karst vegetation surveys have gradually shifted from field surveys to remote sensing-based methods. Coupled with the machine learning methods, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing data can effectively improve the detection accuracy of vegetation and extract the important spectrum features.ResultsIn this study, UAV multispectral image data at flight altitudes of 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m were collected to be applied for vegetation detection in a karst area. The resulting ground resolutions of the 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m data are 5.29, 10.58, and 21.16 cm/pixel, respectively. Four machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Deep Learning (DL), were compared to test the performance of vegetation coverage detection. 5 spectral values (Red, Green, Blue, NIR, Red edge) and 16 VIs were selected to perform variable importance analysis on the best detection models. The results show that the best model for each flight altitude has the highest accuracy in detecting its training data (over 90%), and the GBM model constructed based on all data at all flight altitudes yields the best detection performance covering all data, with an overall accuracy of 95.66%. The variables that were significantly correlated and not correlated with the best model were the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and the Modified Anthocyanin Content Index (MACI), respectively. Finally, the best model was used to invert the complete UAV images at different flight altitudes.ConclusionsIn general, the GBM_all model constructed based on UAV imaging with all flight altitudes was feasible to accurately detect karst vegetation coverage. The prediction models constructed based on data from different flight altitudes had a certain similarity in the distribution of vegetation index importance. Combined with the method of visual interpretation, the karst green vegetation predicted by the best model was in good agreement with the ground truth, and other land types including hay, rock, and soil were well predicted. This study provided a methodological reference for the detection of karst vegetation coverage in eastern China.

TI  - Forest plantation species classification using Full-Pol-Time- Averaged SAR scattering powers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantation species identification is essential for biodiversity conservation, sustainable management, and carbon sequestration. Fully Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Full-Pol-SAR) remote sensing data aids as an alternative to time-consuming field inventory and cloud -covered optical data for forest plantation species identification. This study tried to identify forest plantation species using Fully Polarimetric Time-series Averaged SAR (Full-Pol-Time-Averaged SAR) datasets. Due to the availability of time series quad polarization data of TerraSAR-X from December 20, 2014 to March 07, 2015 and near-real-time field with us for the Haldwani forest area, we have utilized these data sets for the proposed work. The temporal effect of phenological changes can be characterized using the Full-Pol-SAR 6-component Scattering power Decomposi-tion (6SD) and is utilized to identify different forest species. Misclassification problem exists in forests with single-date 6SD images, an improved forest species classification approach based on time-averaged 6SD and a supervised Random Forest (RF) classifier is proposed. This study reveals that Teak, Eucalyptus, Poplar, mixed, and non-forest could be distinctly identified and classified in time-averaged 6SD images. The overall classification accuracy of the proposed approach (similar to 83.72%) was, higher than the single-date Full-Pol-SAR results (mean overall accuracy with standard deviation 68.949 +/- 2.096%).

TI  - Extensive assessment of climate change impacts on coastal zone paddy growth using multispectral analysis and hydrodynamic modeling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has led to sea levels raise (SLRs) and Malaysia is no exception to this problem. Especially for low-lying coastal areas including the Kuala Kedah area which is active in agricultural and fisheries activities. Farmers have had to bear up to 75 % of yield losses due to seawater breaches since 2016. Therefore, this study is designed to assess the im-pact of seawater encroachment on water quality through spatial technology approaches and hydrodynamic modeling related to the growth of paddy trees. The study was conducted during two different paddy cultivation seasons namely Season 1-2019 and Season 2-2019 which take place in the southwest and northeast monsoon in Kuala Kedah, Malaysia. The study involved three phases, which are the assessment of salinity and pH concentration levels, the as-sessment of the health of paddy crops through multispectral image analysis involving three plant indices (VI), namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI) and Normal-ized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), and finally, the assessment of the impact of SLR through the numerical method in MIKE 21 for hydrodynamic modeling considering two conditions that are without mitigation factor (K1) and with existing mitigating factor (K2). According to the findings, the salinity concentration trend is decreasing across the growth stage during Season 1-2019, whereas it is the contrary during Season 2-2019. It was discovered that during the study period for both tidal events, 73 % of the 44 sampling points in Season 1-2019, as opposed to just 3 % in Sea-son 2-2019, were categorized as Class 4 and Class 5. Even though there were fluctuations throughout the observation, the pH reading is still within the allowed range of 6.5 to 9.0 for the estuary area. Following that, the ANOVA analysis proved that salinity concentration a statistically significant difference with tidal variations and pH levels. Moreover, the multispectral image analysis findings revealed that the VI value was correlated with both the yield and the health of the rice crop, with R-square values of 0.842 compared to 0.706 and 0.575 for NDVI and BNDVI values, respectively. It confirmed that NDRE granted a more accurate and reliable measurements. Additionally, the hydrodynamic simula-tion results demonstrated that, if the mitigation factors were considered in the modeling, overflow seawater to the mainland could be reduced by up to 20 %, reducing the impact of coastal flooding on the local area as well as the nearby rice cultivation area. Ultimately, these three elements-water quality, vegetation index, and hydrodynamic modeling-can assist in identifying the underlying cause of the problem and develop short and long-term solutions.

TI  - Reconstructing volcanic radiative forcing since 1990, using a comprehensive emission inventory and spatially resolved sulfur injections from satellite data in a chemistry-climate model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents model simulations of stratospheric aerosols with a focus on explosive volcanic eruptions. Using various (occultation and limb-based) satellite instruments, providing vertical profiles of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and aerosol extinction, we characterized the chemical and radiative influence of volcanic aerosols for the period between 1990 and 2019. We established an improved and extended volcanic SO2 emission inventory that includes more than 500 explosive volcanic eruptions reaching the upper troposphere and the stratosphere. Each perturbation identified was derived from the satellite data and incorporated as a three-dimensional SO2 plume into a chemistry-climate model without the need for additional assumptions about altitude distribution and eruption duration as needed for a "point source " approach. The simultaneous measurements of SO2 and aerosol extinction by up to four satellite instruments enabled a reliable conversion of extinction measurements into injected SO2. In the chemistry-climate model, the SO2 from each individual plume was converted into aerosol particles and their optical properties were determined. Furthermore, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the instantaneous radiative forcing on climate were calculated online. Combined with model improvements, the results of the simulations are consistent with the observations of the various satellites. Slight deviations between the observations and model simulations were found for the large volcanic eruption of Pinatubo in 1991 and cases where simultaneous satellite observations were not unique or too sparse. Weak- and medium-strength volcanic eruptions captured in satellite data and the Smithsonian database typically inject about 10 to 50 kt SO2 directly into the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region or the sulfur species are transported via convection and advection. Our results confirm that these relatively minor eruptions, which occur quite frequently, can nevertheless contribute to the stratospheric aerosol layer and are relevant for the Earth's radiation budget. These minor eruptions cause a total global instantaneous radiative forcing of the order of -0.1 Wm(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) compared to a background stratospheric aerosol forcing of about -0.04 Wm(-2). Medium-strength eruptions injecting about 400 kt SO2 into the stratosphere or accumulation of consecutive smaller eruptions can lead to a total instantaneous forcing of about -0.3 Wm(-2). We show that it is critical to include the contribution of the extratropical lowermost stratospheric aerosol in the forcing calculations.

AB  - The proposed facies classification approach uses three features of the GLCM with multitemporal X-band SAR data of TerraSAR-X combined with k-means clustering. This approach was tested on 15 transboundary Himalayan glaciers. They were classified into six facies namely debris, dry snow, wet snow, bare ice, percolation zone 1 and percolation zone 2 and the covered areas for these classes are 20.56%, 12.50%, 20.26%, 13.16%, 25.49% and 8.03% of total area respectively. After classification, the signature for classes are validated using the benchmark outline of East Rathong glacier, India. The accuracy achieved is 89.56% with negligible variance and kappa of 0.87.

TI  - Improved estimation of particulate matter in China based on multisource data fusion
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is a global health concern and causes millions of premature deaths worldwide annually. Highresolution and full-coverage PM datasets are essential to support the accurate assessment of PM exposure. Here, a three-stage model framework is developed based on the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations (12 km) and multisource data fusion to estimate 1 km daily PM concentrations across China in 2015, including PM2.5 (<2.5 mu m) and PM10 (<10 mu m). The three-stage model performs well with cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91 and 0.87, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.3 mu g/m3 and 27.2 mu g/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. After data fusion from multiple sources, the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are in better agreement with ground observations compared to the CMAQ simulation with RMSE reduced by 72 % and 67 %. High PM2.5 events mainly occur in the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Sichuan Basin, and PM10 show similar spatial patterns to PM2.5 in eastern China. These full-coverage PM datasets enable in-depth analysis of PM pollution over small areas and support future epidemiological studies and health assessments.

TI  - The control of short-term ice melange weakening episodes oncalving activity at major Greenland outlet glaciers
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dense mixture of iceberg of various sizes and sea ice observed in many of Greenland's fjords, called ice melange (sikussak in Greenlandic), has been shown to have a significant impact on the dynamics of several Greenland tidewater glaciers, mainly through the seasonal support it provides to the glacier terminus in winter. However, a clear understanding of shorter-term ice melange dynamics is still lacking, mainly due to the high complexity and variability of the processes at play at the ice-ocean boundary. In this study, we use a combination of Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery to investigate in detail intra-seasonal ice melange dynamics and its link to calving activity at three major outlet glaciers: Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, Helheim Glacier and Sermeq Kujalleq in Kangia (Jakobshavn Isbr & UAELIG;). In those fjords, we identified recurrent ice melange weakening (IMW) episodes consisting of the up-fjord propagation of a discontinuity between jam-packed and weaker ice melange towards the glacier terminus. At a late stage, i.e., when the IMW front approaches the glacier terminus, these episodes were often correlated with the occurrence of large-scale calving events. The IMW process is particularly visible at the front of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier and presents a cyclic behavior, such that we further analyzed IMW dynamics during the June-November period from 2018 to 2021 at this location. Throughout this period, we detected 30 IMW episodes with a recurrence time of 24 d, propagating over a median distance of 5.9 km and for 17 d, resulting in a median propagation speed of 400 m d(-1). We found that 87 % of the IMW episodes occurred prior to a calving event visible in spaceborne observations and that similar to 75 % of all detected calving events were preceded by an IMW episode. These results therefore present the IMW process as a clear control on the calving activity of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier. Finally, using a simple numerical model for ice melange motion, we showed that a slightly biased random motion of ice floes without fluctuating external forcing can reproduce IMW events and their cyclic influence and explain observed propagation speeds. These results further support our observations in characterizing the IMW process as self-sustained through the existence of an IMW-calving feedback. This study therefore highlights the importance of short-term ice melange dynamics in the longer-term evolution of Greenland outlet glaciers.

TI  - A new merged dataset of global ocean chlorophyll-a concentration for better trend detection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) is recognized as an essential climate variable and is one of the primary parameters of ocean-color satellite products. Ocean-color missions have accumulated continuous Chla data for over two decades since the launch of SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) in 1997. However, the on-orbit life of a single mission is about five to ten years. To build a dataset with a time span long enough to serve climate change related studies, it is necessary to merge the Chla data from multiple sensors. The European Space Agency has developed two sets of merged Chla products, namely GlobColour and OC-CCI (Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative), which have been widely used. Nonetheless, issues remain in the long-term trend analysis of these two datasets because the inter-mission differences in Chla have not been completely corrected. To obtain more accurate Chla trends in the global and various oceans, we produced a new dataset by merging Chla records from the SeaWiFS, MODIS (Medium-spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), MERIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), and OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) with inter-mission differences corrected in this work. The fitness of the dataset on long-term Chla trend study was validated by using in situ Chla and comparing the trend estimates to the multi-annual variability of different satellite Chla records. The results suggest that our dataset can be used for long-term series analysis and trend detection. We also provide the global trend map in Chla over 23 years (1998-2020) and present a significant positive global trend with 0.67% +/- 0.37%/yr.

TI  - Cost effectiveness analysis of the East of England stroke telemedicine service
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Stroke is the fourth single leading cause of death in the UK with more than 100,000 people diagnosed with stroke annually. Timely access to urgent care and treatments, such as thrombolysis, is crucial for survival and recovery but there are national variations in care access. Materials and methods: We explore the cost-effectiveness of an integrated telemedicine service for rapid access to stroke Consul-tant support in the East of England acute stroke care pathway compared to usual care during out-of-hour periods. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) health economics thrombolysis tool enabled us to compare the service with usual acute stroke care pathway. The tool was used to estimate costs and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain associated with improved thrombolysis rates from a health and social care perspective. Results: Based on SSNAP data, an average of 1,861 stroke patients were admitted out-of-hours in the participating centres annually between 2014 and 2019. Average thrombolysis rate was 9.7% when using a telemedicine service across the centres relative to the total stroke patients that presented out-of-hours. The total NHS cost savings compared to usual care were estimated at 482k pound and 471k pound while social care cost savings were 1.7m pound and 536k pound at the end of 1-year and 5-years respectively. Conclusion: Integrating a telemedicine service improves thrombolysis rates in out-of-hours acute stroke care and is associated with NHS and social care savings and QALY gains. Telemedicine is a cost-effective approach to delivering stroke care to remote communities with limited access to stroke specialists.

TI  - A Diachronic Cross-Platforms Analysis of Violent Extremist Language in the Incel Online Ecosystem
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The emergence and growth of incel subculture online has triggered a considerable body of research to date, most of which analyzing its worldview or mapping its position and connections within the broader manosphere. While this research has considerably enhanced our understanding of the incel phenomenon, it tends to offer a somewhat static, one-dimensional portrayal of what is-like all online subcultures and communities-a highly dynamic and multi-layered environment. Consequently, we lack sufficiently nuanced answers to what is arguably a critical question for law enforcement and academics alike: is this a violent extremist ideology? Using a uniquely extensive corpus covering a range of online spaces constitutive of the incelosphere spanning several years, we analyze the evolution of incel language across both time and platforms. Specifically, we test whether this language has grown more extreme over time as online spaces shutdown and others emerged. Our findings demonstrate that, while levels of violent extremist language do vary across the incelosphere, they have steadily increased in the main online spaces over the past 6 years. Further, we demonstrate that, while activity on these online spaces is responsive to offline events, the impact of these on violent extremist ideation is not uniform.

TI  - Needleless inhaled anesthesia with sevoflurane: Advantages of a simplified approach for children with spinal muscular atrophy undergoing intrathecal administration of nusinersen
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIntrathecal nusinersen administration, a fundamental step in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, is challenging in children. AimsThis retrospective monocentric analysis of prospectively collected data evaluated the feasibility of needleless general anesthesia exclusively with sevoflurane, without imaging guidance, for children undergoing nusinersen administration in a 24-month period. MethodsClinical data included demographics, type of spinal muscular atrophy, presence and severity of scoliosis. Primary outcome was defined by the number of predefined sentinel adverse events related to anesthesia. Secondary outcomes were assessed by duration of the procedure, number of lumbar puncture attempts, and number of failures. Other measures included number and type of moderate, minor and minimal adverse events, as well as number and type of puncture-related adverse events. Results116 patients (mean age: 8.7 (SD 6.9) years; with scoliosis: 49.1%) underwent 250 lumbar punctures; two cases of prolonged desaturation, considered as sentinel adverse events, (0.8%) were recorded during anesthesia (primary outcome). None of the patients underwent orotracheal intubation nor required an unplanned admission in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. No patient required an unplanned or prolonged hospitalization after the procedure. Mean number of puncture attempts was 1.6 (SD 1.3), and mean duration of the procedure was 14.1 (SD 8.3) minutes. No failure in the drug administration occurred (secondary outcomes). ConclusionIn this single-center experience, needleless general anesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane without imaging guidance has been shown to be feasible for children with spinal muscular atrophy undergoing lumbar puncture for nusinersen administration.

TI  - Modelling relationship between land use land cover changes, land surface temperature and urban heat island in Indore city of central India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urban expansion and land surface temperature (LST) fluctuations have been negatively influenced by rapid urbanisation, which degrades the urban thermal environment. This study has endeavoured to incorporate future urban growth modelling and assess the impact of urbanization on LST over Indore City, India, using temporal Landsat satellite data for the years 2010, 2015 and 2020. The present study has utilized the Cellular Automata (CA) model to project future urban growth for the year 2025. The result shows that the built-up land has increased by 28.7% during 2010-2015 and 24.9% during 2015-2020, while a future projection of 4.7% is evident in 2025. The mean LST over the city signifies a decreasing trend during the winter and summer seasons from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, an occurrence of higher LST in the surrounding rural area is observed, witnessing cool heat island phenomenon. The urban thermal field variation index (UTFVI) map shows non-UTFVI in the urban area, which shows an increasing trend and strongest UTFVI in rural regions with decreasing trend in summer season during 2010-2020. Whereas in the winter season, the observed result suggests the opposite behaviour of UTFVI.

TI  - Life purposes: Comparing higher education students in four institutions in the Netherlands and Finland
T2  - JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Universities worldwide are beginning to counter the prevailing neo-liberal ideology by paying renewed attention to the moral development of students and fostering their life purposes. This mixed methods study investigates the life purposes of higher education students in four institutions in the Netherlands (n(Dutch) = 663) and Finland (n(Finnish) = 846). Based on quantitative data, we identified four purpose profiles: purposeful, self-oriented, dreamer, and disengaged. Qualitative data showed that students' willingness to contribute to a better world was not particularly prominent. An exception was found in the data of a Dutch research university working with a specific worldview and value base and emphasizing moral education. We conclude that universities need to put more effort into educating young professionals whose life purpose goes beyond their self-interest and who are willing and able to address pressing societal and global problems. This particularly includes professionals in the domains of technology and economy.

TI  - WS4GEE: Enhancing geospatial web services and geoprocessing workflows by integrating the Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial web services (GWSs) assist scientists developing models online. Cloud computing technologies have created opportunities for faster and more efficient environmental modeling. Among of the new public cloud products, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is particularly well adapted to meet the needs of environmental scientists developing and sharing their models. However, the potential of GEE to support geospatial community is less well explored. Scientists are still waiting to see what public cloud platforms can do for geospatial web services. This paper proposes a prototype called WS4GEE that can wrap GEE-embedded datasets, functions, and models as OGC Web Services such as WMS, WFS, WCS, and WPS. In this way, WS4GEE can support direct access to GEE through OGC interfaces thus allowing geoprocessing workflows to use GEE resources. Two experiments are presented - one with a GEE-enabled geospatial data service and the other deploying geoprocessing composition with GEE-enabled GWSs. The results confirm that WS4GEE with the support of GEE significantly enhances the capabil-ities of GWS to deal with labor intensive and time-consuming tasks. This study provides guidance for the wider geospatial community when integrating other existing public cloud platforms.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variation of the Daytime Surface Temperature in Local Climate Zones, Forming Cool Island in Bhopal
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Natural and man-made changes in the environment cause surface heating or cooling in the metropolitan areas in comparison with the rural areas. The urban area and surrounding rural areas have differences in energy balance due to variations in surface characteristics. These differences in temperature are the main reason for the formation of Urban Heat Islands or Urban Cool Islands. This research explores the spatio-temporal variations in surface temperatures during the daytime in Bhopal city-a case of the fast-developing metropolitan city having a composite climate. To explore the surface cool island phenomena, this research built a temporal and spatial difference in Local Climate Zones (LCZ) with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Spatial indices. Remotely sensed Satellite data-Landsat-5 and Landsat-8, from 1990 to 1995 and 2015 to 2020, were acquired to investigate the LST and generate the LCZs. Both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period data were analysed. LCZ was classified on the basis of built-up area, vegetation, and agricultural areas of Bhopal. The LCZ classes were analysed with LST, and LST was further correlated with vegetation and moisture indices using Pearson's correlation. Different indices are investigated in order to determine the major causes of observed LST patterns in different LCZ. A linear negative correlation was found between NDVI and LST up to - 0.4 at 0.01 significance. The statistical association between NDBI and LST has shown a positive correlation across the seasons, indicating that impervious surfaces result in high surface temperatures. The LST of water surfaces, i.e. LCZ G is 3 degrees C to 5 degrees C lower than that of other LCZ classes. The moisture Index (NDMI) and LST have a negative correlation of -0.55 that was greater and more consistent. The result from 1990 to 2020 shows that the LST of LCZ in rural areas of Bhopal is almost 2.5 degrees C to 3 degrees C higher than the urban area LCZs. The above spatio-temporal analysis of LST thus confirms the formation of Surface Urban Cool Island in the Bhopal urban area during day time and has a comparatively low surface temperature as compared to its surroundings.

TI  - Classification of Precipitation Intensities from Remote Sensing Data Based on Artificial Intelligence Using RF Multi-learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new strategy based on random forest (RF) classifier multi-learning is elaborated for the rainfall intensities classification from remote sensing data provided by Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. It consists in carrying out a series of classifications to isolate a class at each treatment (learning/classification). The idea developed here is to allow the RF classifiers to better separate the classes by proceeding one by one. To do this, the training of a set of RF models independently of each other is carried out. The first learning is performed to isolate the first class. Pixels belonging to the first class are excluded from the database during the second training. This second learning is performed on the remaining pixels to isolate the second class. The pixels corresponding to the second class are also excluded from the database during the third training. The process continues until the separation between the two last classes. Thus, for n classes, we perform n-1 learning. The learning and validation of RF models (hereafter called Multi-RF) are realized by comparing input data from the MSG satellite with output data from Setif meteorological radar. To evaluate the Multi-RF, the results obtained are compared to those obtained by applying the standard RF (Uni-RF) and to One versus All RF (OvA-RF). The comparison results indicate superior performance for the proposed scheme. Indeed, the evaluation statistical parameters obtained for Multi-RF are better than those obtained by Uni-RF and OvA-RF.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations in the Effective Snow/Glacier Coverage in the Sikkim Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The sustainability of eco-hydrology of the Eastern Himalaya depends on snow and glacial dynamics. Glaciers, permanent and seasonal snow are the freshwater flow regimes and an indicator of climate variability. Spatio-temporal mapping provides information regarding several aspects such as freshwater storage, mass balance trends, snowline and volume, snow avalanche forecasting, and melt-water run-off predictions. In this article, an attempt has been made to study the spatio-temporal variations in snow coverage of Sikkim using an integrated approach of multivariate statistics and band ratio between 1989 and 2019 at an interval of 2-4 years. Landsat 5/8 and Sentinel 2 datasets have been processed for snow cover products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) further used as an input to digital AND-gate operator for deriving effective snow cover maps of the Teesta river basin. The intra-annual effective snow cover change has been observed to behave in an inverse correlation with the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST.v5) in Nino 3.4 region. The snow line altitude (SLA) has been observed to have a twofold periodicity in the last 30 years. The effective snow cover results corroborate well with the field investigation (January 17-28, 2021). The overall mapping accuracy (84.14-85.53%) has been evaluated using MODIS/Terra 8-day L3 500 m composite products (MOD10A2) along with kappa (0.68-0.71) and conditional kappa of snow class (0.74-0.82). In addition, results have been checked for statistical differences using the McNemar test z-scores.

TI  - A boreal wildfire and harvesting database with ensemble confidence attributes for Ontario (1972-2021+)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a repeatable workflow that produced a comprehensive wildfire and timber harvesting database for Ontario (1972-2021) that accommodates annual updates after each new fire season. Training sites for classifi-cation are identified at the individual scene-level to avoid spectral variations introduced by time and distance. ISODATA classification on the training data produces clusters that are modelled by a smooth polynomial function to identify a local minimum point along the classification clusters that distinguishes disturbances from non-disturbances. This threshold is then applied to map disturbances on independent scenes of Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, or OLI imagery. Results are aggregated to 1.44 ha cells and converted to points for dissemination; we do not map explicit boundaries to avoid issues of context-and scale-dependence, or the realities of transitional boundaries. Disturbance points are cross-referenced through time, ensuring that the earliest date for each disturbance is recorded. Disturbance points are intersected with other harvesting and fire databases to assess their ensemble confidence which is attached to each mapped location. We present summaries of Ontario's boreal disturbance mapping with respect to levels of assessed confidence.

TI  - A 1.2 Billion Pixel Human-Labeled Dataset for Data-Driven Classification of Coastal Environments
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's coastlines are spatially highly variable, coupled-human-natural systems that comprise a nested hierarchy of component landforms, ecosystems, and human interventions, each interacting over a range of space and time scales. Understanding and predicting coastline dynamics necessitates frequent observation from imaging sensors on remote sensing platforms. Machine Learning models that carry out supervised (i.e., human-guided) pixel-based classification, or image segmentation, have transformative applications in spatio-temporal mapping of dynamic environments, including transient coastal landforms, sediments, habitats, waterbodies, and water flows. However, these models require large and well-documented training and testing datasets consisting of labeled imagery. We describe "Coast Train," a multi-labeler dataset of orthomosaic and satellite images of coastal environments and corresponding labels. These data include imagery that are diverse in space and time, and contain 1.2 billion labeled pixels, representing over 3.6 million hectares. We use a human-in-the-loop tool especially designed for rapid and reproducible Earth surface image segmentation. Our approach permits image labeling by multiple labelers, in turn enabling quantification of pixel-level agreement over individual and collections of images.

TI  - Tropical cyclones facilitate recovery of forest leaf area from dry spells in East Asia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests disturbance by tropical cyclones is mostly documented by field studies of exceptionally strong cyclones and satellite-based approaches attributing decreases in leaf area. By starting their analysis from the observed damage, these studies are biased and may, therefore, limit our understanding of the impact of cyclones in general. This study overcomes such biases by jointly analyzing the cyclone tracks, climate reanalysis, and changes in satellite-based leaf area following the passage of 140 +/- 41 cyclones. Sixty days following their passage, 18 +/- 8 % of the cyclones resulted in a decrease and 48 +/- 18 % showed no change in leaf area compared to nearby forest outside the storm track. For a surprising 34 +/- 7 % of the cyclones, an increase in leaf area was observed. Cyclones resulting in higher leaf area in their affected compared to their reference area coincided with an atmospheric pressure dipole steering the cyclone towards a region experiencing a dry spell caused by the same dipole. When the dipole was present, the destructive power of cyclones was offset by their abundant precipitation enabling forest canopies in the affected area to recover faster from the dry spell than canopies in the reference area. This study documents previously undocumented widespread antagonist interactions on forest leaf area between tropical cyclones and droughts.

TI  - A comprehensive drought index based on remote sensing data and nested copulas for monitoring meteorological and agroecological droughts: A case study on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new comprehensive remote sensing drought index (CRSDI) based on the nested copulas of remotely sensed precipitation, vegetation index, and land surface temperature that represent water availability, vegetation health, and disturbance impact, respectively, for monitoring meteorological and agroecological droughts. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is chosen as a case study to test the CRSDI and investigate drought changes and their impacts on vegetation. The results show that CRSDI can effectively monitor the propagation processes and characteristics of meteorological and agroecological droughts. Drought conditions on the QTP are overall relieved from 2000 to 2020, while these changes show an apparent spatial variability, with a general drying (wetting) trend in the north (south). Moreover, vegetation response to drought is different among different vegetation types, with shrubland having a stronger response, followed by cropland, grassland, and forestland. Clearly, CRSDI is valuable for large-scale drought monitoring and assessment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding just how the increase in the Earth's Surface Temperature (LST) is related to alterations of the urban climate -Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) or Urban Hotspots (UHS)- and with the deterioration of cities ' environmental quality has become a great challenge. Societies worldwide seek actions that might break these trends and improve the quality of life of local inhabitants in the face of climate change. In this research, and with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images (day and night), the space-time variability of the LST and the SUHI over the metropolitan areas of the capitals of Andalusia (Spain) during the year 2021 was studied to evaluate how these variables, together with the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), may have influenced the variability of the UHS and the level of thermal comfort according to the Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). As results, an important spatial variability of the LST, SUHI, UHS, and the different classes of UTFVI is reported. The diurnal UHS are found mainly in rural areas without vegetation, whereas the night UHS are distributed in urban areas with impervious surfaces.

TI  - Cross-modal change detection flood extraction based on convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood events are often accompanied by rainy weather, which limits the applicability of optical satellite images, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is less sensitive to weather and sunlight conditions. Although remarkable progress has been made in flood detection using heterogeneous multispectral and SAR images, there is a lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and more efforts are required for exploiting deep neural networks in heterogeneous flood detection. This study constructed a pre-disaster Sentinel-2 and post-disaster Sentinel-1 heterogeneous flood mapping dataset named CAU-Flood containing 18 study plots with careful image pre-processing and human annotation. A new deep convolutional neural network (CNN), named cross-modal change detection network (CMCDNet), was also proposed for flood detection using multispectral and SAR images. The proposed network employs a encoder-decoder structure and performs feature fusion at multiple stages using gating and self-attention modules. Furthermore, the network overcomes the feature misalignment issue during decoding by embedding a feature alignment module in the upsampling operation. The proposed CMCDNet outperformed SOTA methods in terms of flood detection accuracy and achieved an intersection over union (IoU) of 89.84%. The codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/CAU-HE/CMCDNet.

TI  - Quantifying floodplain heterogeneity with field observation, remote sensing, and landscape ecology: Methods and metrics
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplains provide numerous ecosystem services that depend on the spatial heterogeneity, or patchiness, of the floodplain. Direct and indirect human alterations of rivers can reduce floodplain heterogeneity and function, but relatively little is known of patterns of floodplain heterogeneity in natural, fully functional floodplains. We quantify floodplain heterogeneity at four sites in the United States with the objectives of (i) developing a method of combining field measurements and remote sensing data products to calculate integrative landscape-scale metrics of floodplain spatial heterogeneity and (ii) demonstrating which metrics from landscape ecology are likely to be useful for identifying qualities of natural floodplains, differentiating floodplains, and inferring processes, based on a case study of three prairie floodplains and one beaver-modified floodplain in the continental United States. We developed a new unsupervised classification workflow that combines field data, topography, and Sentinel-2A imagery to create classified floodplains for all four field sites that could be used to calculate heterogeneity metrics. We identified six heterogeneity metrics for characterizing natural floodplain heterogeneity: aggregation index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, largest patch index, patch density, percentage of like adjacencies, and Shannon's evenness index, and these metrics capture both intermetric (variation in spatial heterogeneity between the floodplains) and intrametric variation (variation in the patterns of the metrics). Results show that natural floodplains have high evenness and interspersion and juxtaposition of classes, and we attribute this to natural flow and sediment regimes driving channel migration, erosion, deposition, vegetation succession, and active beaver modifications. Colorado floodplains show higher aggregation and lower fragmentation than the Oklahoma floodplain. We attribute this to the greater incision and lower hydrologic variability at the Oklahoma site.

TI  - The Politics of Respectability and Black Americans' Punitive Attitudes
T2  - AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing research largely ignores Black support for punitive policies that target group members, even as this support challenges expectations of in-group favoritism and group solidarity. The current research fills this gap by leveraging a familiar concept: "the politics of respectability." Building on historical and qualitative accounts of this worldview, which focuses on the behavior of group members, I develop a social psychological framework to understand how identity-based concerns motivate Black support for punishment that targets members of their racial group. I also develop a novel measure of respectability-the Respectability Politics Scale. Findings demonstrate that adherents of respectability feel more ashamed about the public view of their racial group, endorse more negative racial stereotypes, and feel relatively less close to other Black people. They are also more likely to support a range of punitive policies that target group members, including restrictive dress code policies, tough-on-crime policies, and paternalistic welfare policies.

TI  - Absorption-based algorithm for satellite estimating the particulate organic carbon concentration in the global surface ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean contributes to understanding the global ocean carbon cycle system. The surface POC concentration can be effectively detected using satellites. In open oceans, the blue-to-green band ratio (BG) algorithm is often used to obtain global surface ocean POC concentrations. However, POC concentrations are underestimated in waters with complex optical environments. To generate a more accurate global POC mapping in the surface ocean, we developed a new ocean color algorithm using a mixed global-scale in situ POC dataset with the concentration ranging from 11.10 to 4389.28 mg/m(3). The new algorithm (a-POC) was established to retrieve the POC concentration using the strong relationship between the absorption coefficient at 490 nm (a(490)) and POC, in which a(490) was from the Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) v5.0 suite. Afterward, the a-POC algorithm was applied to OC-CCI v5.0 data for special regions and the global ocean. The performances of the a-POC algorithm and the BG algorithm were compared by combining the match-ups of satellite data and in situ dataset. The results showed that the statistical parameters of the a-POC algorithm were similar to those of the BG algorithm in the Atlantic oligotrophic gyre regions, with a median absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) value of 22.04%. In the eastern coastal waters of the United States and the Chesapeake Bay, the POC concentration retrieved by the a-POC algorithm was highly consistent with the match-ups, and MAPD values were 33.06% and 26.11%. The a-POC algorithm was also applied to the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data pre-processed with different atmospheric correction algorithms to evaluate the universality. The result showed that the a-POC algorithm was robust and less sensitive to atmospheric correction than the BG algorithm.

TI  - Inversion models of internal solitary wave propagation speed in ocean based on least squares method and support vector machine br
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The propagation speed is one of the important parameters of the internal solitary wave (ISW). How toobtain the ISW speed through optical remote sensing images accurately and quickly is an important problem tobe solved. In this paper, we simulate ISW optical remote sensing imaging, obtain an experimental database, andbuild the ISW speed inversion model based on a single-scene optical remote sensing image by using the leastsquares method and the support vector machine. The accuracy of the ISW speed inversion model is tested byusing MODIS Image and GF-4 image data of the South China Sea. The study results are shown below. Theleast squares ISW speed inversion model can give the regression equation, which is more intuitive and has lessaccuracy in the water depth ranging from 300 m to 399 m, while the support vector machine ISW speedinversion model has high accuracy in the water depth ranging from 400 m to 1200 m and from 83 m to 299 m.Therefore, the two kinds of ISW speed inversion models have different advantages, and can be applied to theinversion of the ISW speed in the real ocean

TI  - Mapping annual 10 m rapeseed extent using multisource data in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China (2017-2021) on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on the distribution of rapeseed enables accurate yield forecasting and supports agricultural planning to assist global security in edible oil supply. Large-scale remotely sensed maps of rapeseed nevertheless are nonexistent in China because of landscape fragmentation, cloudy weather conditions, and phenological variations. Existing rapeseed mapping methods based on spectral, phenological, and machine learning algorithms are challenging to accurately and seamlessly extract the planting distribution of rapeseed over a large spatial region. In view of this, the annual extent of rapeseed in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China from 2017 to 2021 was mapped. Multisource data including Sentinel-1/2, Google Earth very-high-resolution (GE-VHR) images, and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data were used to develop a systematic methodology. First, the ground reference dataset was collected from fieldwork and all available GE-VHR images to construct a rapeseed point collection (RPC). Second, RPC, Sentinel-1, and GLDAS data were used to estimate the annual rapeseed peak-flowering date maps (RPDMs) based on a random forest regression model. Third, a hybrid mapping strategy was implemented on Google Earth Engine leveraging the dense Sentinel-1/2 data to generate the annual seamless 10 m rapeseed extent maps (REMs). Accuracy assessment illustrates the reliability of the RPDM with an R2 of 0.86 (RMSE = 5.32 days). Comparisons with other rapeseed mapping methods and comprehensive validation attest to the high precision of the REMs, with an average F1 score of 0.93. Moreover, the rapeseed cultivation area decreased over the five study years. Rapeseed fields in the YREB are highly fragmented, averaging 18 per ha, but trend analysis suggests a potential for crop intensification. This study provides an essential reference and information service for rapeseed production and agricultural resource survey in China.

TI  - Tracking changes in coastal land cover in the Yellow Sea, East Asia, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are essential ecosystems due to their provision of invaluable ecosystem services. However, the geomorphologic characteristics of coastal zones are becoming more complex and changeable due to global warming, sea-level rise (SLR), and the intensification of anthropogenic activities. Therefore, accurate and timely knowledge of coastal land cover types (including tidal flats, coastal vegetation, and year-long water cover) is needed for coastal research and sustainable management. To date, land cover products for coastal areas are mainly derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images, but few studies have used Sentinel -1 synthetic aperture radar (S1) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2) images, which can provide more detailed maps. We developed a Rule-based Time Series Classification (RTSC) approach to map coastal land cover types at a 10 m resolution, combining S1/S2 time-series images (2015-2019) and Google Earth Engine (GEE). These products were developed for the coastal zone of the Yellow Sea (YS), East Asia, which is an essential ecosystem protecting a coastal population of 60 million people from storms and SLR effects. Accuracy assessment showed that the annual maps of coastal land cover had high overall accuracy. The coastal land cover types for the YS in 2019 comprised 3593.42 km2 of tidal flats, 28,506.98 km2 of coastal vegetation, and 5436.92 km2 of coastal year-long water. The interannual dynamics of the coastal land cover area in the YS during 2015-2019 were smaller. This study provides a promising method that combines S1/2 time series, a RTSC approach, and GEE to map coastal land cover areas at large scales. The 10 m resolution maps generated in this study are the most current dataset of coastal land cover types for the YS, and they potentially provide a basis for the sus-tainable management and conservation of this important coastal zone.

TI  - Unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and control of vectors of malaria and other vector-borne diseases
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has expanded rapidly in ecological conservation and agriculture, with a growing literature describing their potential applications in global health efforts including vector control. Vector-borne diseases carry severe public health and economic impacts to over half of the global population yet conventional approaches to the surveillance and treatment of vector habitats is typically laborious and slow. The high mobility of UAVs allows them to reach remote areas that might otherwise be inaccessible to ground-based teams. Given the rapidly expanding examples of these tools in vector control programmes, there is a need to establish the current knowledge base of applications for UAVs in this context and assess the strengths and challenges compared to conventional methodologies. This review aims to summarize the currently available knowledge on the capabilities of UAVs in both malaria control and in vector control more broadly in cases where the technology could be readily adapted to malaria vectors. This review will cover the current use of UAVs in vector habitat surveillance and deployment of control payloads, in comparison with their existing conventional approaches. Finally, this review will highlight the logistical and regulatory challenges in scaling up the use of UAVs in malaria control programmes and highlight potential future developments.

TI  - Impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cote d'Ivoire introduced rotavirus vaccine in March 2017. Rotavirus surveillance is conducted at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Yopougon in Abidjan, the capital city. Children <5 years of age are enrolled in rotavirus surveillance if admitted to the hospital with acute gastroenteritis. We used sentinel surveillance data from 2014 through mid-2019 to compare trends in rotavirus pediatric gastroenteritis hospitalizations before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction. We used Poisson regression to analyze changes in rotavirus prevalence, adjusting for calendar month and accounting for total monthly admissions; January 2014 - December 2016 was considered "pre-vaccine," and January 2017 - June 2019 was considered "post-vaccine." Age distribution and severity were compared between periods using the Mann-Whitney U test. Rotavirus-positive admissions declined 51% (95% CI: 28%-67%), from 31.5% pre-vaccine to 14.9% afterward. The median age of rotavirus-positive children increased from 7 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-11) in the pre-vaccine period to 11 months (IQR: 7-18, p = .005) in the post-vaccine period. The median severity score decreased from 11 to 9 (p = .008) among all children, and from 12 pre- to 10.5 post-vaccine (p = .35) among rotavirus-positive children. Our findings suggest that rotavirus vaccine introduction contributed to reduced rotavirus hospitalization in Abidjan and possibly more broadly.

TI  - Modelling non-linear deforestation trends for an ecological tension zone in Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation is a recent phenomenon that started in the second part of the twentieth century. One may argue that the Brazilian state of Maranha & SIM;o is an excellent case study for ex-amining deforestation trends and the effects of environmental policies. A man-made line sepa-rates Maranha & SIM;o into two sections. Due to the administrative divide between the Legal Amazon Maranha & SIM;o (LM) and the Cerrado Maranha & SIM;o (CM), one may hypothesize about differences in deforestation between the two regions. This research employs a nonlinear modelling approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with a quasi-Poisson distribution and a logarith-mic function to detect deforestation patterns in these areas. Deforestation is linked to the year and a variety of climatic variables. These covariates differ substantially across seasons (rainy and dry) and regions. During times of above-average precipitation, including in the dry and wet seasons, deforestation occurred in the LM area. However, in the non-enforced region, this regime was not followed. According to the statistics, deforestation decreased in the LM region when precipitation levels were below average.

TI  - Snow depth alteration and its relation with climate variability in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Various climatic factors and their interactions affect China's snow depth alterations. However, a measure of the relative importance of climatic factors regarding the variance in snow depth is lacking. Here, we use a heretofore largest dataset, quality-controlled daily observations from 1,665 meteorological stations, and statistical analyses to identify proxy drivers and their contributions regarding regional variability and trends in China's snow depth and snow depth-climate relationships from 1951 to 2019. Results show that seasonal snow depth alterations are substantial in China and caused by various climatic drivers. In winter, observed positive trends in the northwest and northeast of China mainly respond to augmentation in solid precipitation and snow accumulation in fall. For the Tibetan Plateau, the negative snow depth anomaly seems to respond to the rising air temperature below the freezing point along with some secular changes in solid precipitation and shallower fall snowpacks. All these trends in winter snow depth over the northwest, northeast, and Tibetan Plateau of China account approximately for 30% of the total interannual variance in spring snow depth in these regions. In the milder central north and south of China, snow accumulation is not evident. Besides solid precipitation and rising air temperature below the freezing point, atmospheric humidity is also notable for its effect on the interannual variance in winter snow depth in these regions. In spring and fall, however, the negative effect of warming climate on snow depth becomes remarkably more important. It seems that about 13-33% (12-50%) of the total interannual variance in the widespread decrease (insignificant perturbation), except for some weak increases in the northeast region (decreases in the Tibetan Plateau), of China's spring (fall) snow depth are caused by the rising air temperature below the freezing point.

TI  - A snow and glacier hydrological model for large catchments - case study for the Naryn River, central Asia
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we implement a degree day snowmelt and glacier melt model in the Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology (DECIPHeR) model. The purpose is to develop a hydrological model that can be applied to large glaciated and snow-fed catchments yet is computationally efficient enough to include model uncertainty in streamflow predictions. The model is evaluated by simulating monthly discharge at six gauging stations in the Naryn River catchment (57 833 km(2)) in central Asia over the period 1951 to a variable end date between 1980 and 1995 depending on the availability of discharge observations. The spatial distribution of simulated snow cover is validated against MODIS weekly snow extent for the years 2001-2007. Discharge is calibrated by selecting parameter sets using Latin hypercube sampling and assessing the model performance using six evaluation metrics.The model shows good performance in simulating monthly discharge for the calibration period (NSE is 0.74 < NSE < 0.87) and validation period (0.7 < NSE < 0.9), where the range of NSE values represents the 5th- 95th percentile prediction limits across the gauging stations. The exception is the Uch-Kurgan station, which exhibits a reduction in model performance during the validation period attributed to commissioning of the Toktogul reservoir in 1975 which impacted the observations. The model reproduces the spatial extent in seasonal snow cover well when evaluated against MODIS snow extent; 86 % of the snow extent is captured (mean 2001-2007) for the median ensemble member of the best 0.5 % calibration simulations.We establish the present-day contributions of glacier melt, snowmelt and rainfall to the total annual runoff and the timing of when these components dominate river flow. The model predicts well the observed increase in discharge during the spring (April-May) associated with the onset of snow melting and peak discharge during the summer (June, July and August) associated with glacier melting. Snow melting is the largest component of the annual runoff (89 %), followed by the rainfall (9 %) and the glacier melt component (2 %), where the values refer to the 50th percentile estimates at the catchment outlet gauging station Uch-Kurgan. In August, glacier melting can contribute up to 66 % of the total runoff at the highly glacierized Naryn headwater sub-catchment. The glaciated area predicted by the best 0.5 % calibration simulations overlaps the Landsat observations for the late 1990s and mid-2000s. Despite good predictions for discharge, the model produces a large range of estimates for the glaciated area (680-1196 km(2)) (5th-95th percentile limits) at the end of the simulation period. To constrain these estimates further, additional observations such as glacier mass balance, snow depth or snow extent should be used directly to constrain model simulations.

TI  - Assessment of Dynamics of Frontal Part of Gangotri Glacier, India, from 2017 to 2021 Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The current study employed multi-sensor data from 2017 to 2021 to demonstrate the rapid transformation of the Gomukh-the terminus of the Gangotri Glacier, Central Himalaya, India. Between 2017 and 2021, the Gangotri Glacier's frontal zone underwent rapid changes, including the formation and merging of ephemeral lakes, the development of ice cliffs, and a shift in the meeting of melt streams from Raktvarn Glacier. The analysis showed that the snout of the Gangotri Glacier has lost an area of similar to 0.08 km(2) from its frontal part from 2017 to 2021. During the investigation period, the snout of the Gangotri Glacier has receded by around 270 m. The mean surface velocity near the snout of the glacier was similar to 8 m/year from 2018 to 2019 according to Sentinel-2 datasets. Analysis of the glacier's surface velocity revealed that the main Gangotri Glacier in the lower ablation zone below Chaturangi Glacier was moving at a slower rate than the glacier ice above the meeting point of the Chaturangi Glacier melt water stream. These findings are significant because they demonstrate how the dynamic glacial front changes with glacier ice area loss and indicate that increasing glacier recession should be anticipated as the climate warms, which may occasionally result in the formation of ephemeral lakes and generate a negative feedback loop.

TI  - Coupling Lagrangian simulation models and remote sensing to explore the environmental effect on larval growth rate: The Mediterranean case study of round sardinella (<i>Sardinella aurita</i>) early life stages
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between environmental conditions and early life-history traits of Sardinella aurita are investigated using material collected in two sites of the Central Mediterranean Sea. Individual mean daily growth during the planktonic phase has been determined by using otolith microstructure analysis, while Lagrangian simulation models allowed to estimate the daily position in space and time of each specimen from the hatching to the catch. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) have been implemented to explore the impact of environmental conditions at time t, t-1 day and t-2 days on the mean daily growth rate occurring at time t. Spatial analysis evidenced a wide dispersion of eggs and larvae in the coastal area of both sampling sites in correspondence to relatively warmer and chlorophyll-a enriched waters. Lagrangian simulations detected a complementary larval dispersal pathway able to transport larvae to a known retention area. Temperature at time t was the most important driver affecting the mean daily larval growth, followed by the food availability. On the other hand, models performed on lagged environmental covariates (t-1 and t-2) did not show any significant effect on the growth rate at time t. In addition to the sub-linear positive correlation between temperature and mean daily larval growth, model highlighted a decrease in the otolith core width at higher temperature that can be linked to an earlier stage of ontogeny at hatching. This study provided a useful methodological approach that takes advantage of available remote sensing data to perform ecological studies in support to fisheries management.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL COOLING DEMAND IN CHANGCHUN CITY OF CHINA: SPATIAL RESPONSE TO DIFFERENCES IN URBAN THERMAL ENVIRONMENT INTENSITY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization promotes social and economic development, but it also causes severe urban thermal environmental problems. Identifying the cooling priority zones, which is dependent on the intensity and spatial differentiation of an urban heat island (UHI), has become the key to alleviating the urban thermal environment problem. Using Changchun City of China as an example, this study used the split window algorithm (SWA) to extract the land surface temperature (LST) information from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image data and then discussed the ecological cooling priority zones of green landscapes by analyzing the multi-level structure of administrative division, quadrant, and loop differences in the thermal environment. The results revealed that there was an average LST difference of up to 5 celcius between the inner and outer urban areas. The average temperature of the administrative region with the highest cooling demand was 2.57 degrees C higher than that of the region with the lowest demand. From a quadrant perspective, the regions with the lowest and highest ecological cooling demands were located in the northeast and southwest, respectively. Additionally, based on the loop, the ecological cooling demands of the central urban area in Changchun City increased from the perimeter to the center, with the center being 4.05 degrees C warmer than the perimeter. This study determined, from a multi-structure perspective, the priority order of cooling demand in the central urban area of Changchun City. The results pointed in the right direction for effectively mitigating the urban heat island effect and optimizing the landscape structure and layout of urban green space.

TI  - Influence of geological factors on surface deformation due to hydrocarbon exploitation using time-series InSAR: A case study of Karamay Oilfield, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformation due to hydrocarbon extraction from buried reservoirs may gradually evolve to geological hazards, which can undermine the safety of infrastructure facilities. Monitoring the surface deformation and studying on the influencing factors of surface deformation have great significance to ensure the stability of oilfield development, and prevent geological hazards. In this study, Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data of Karamay Oilfield acquired between January 2018 to December 2020 was used to map how the land surface has deformed in response to hydrocarbon exploitation. Based on the monitoring results of time series InSAR, geological data, and oilfield data, the correlations between the different factors and the surface deformation were analyzed. The results show that the reservoir buried depth, porosity and permeability have an impact on the surface deformation, and the influence on surface uplift is obviously greater than that on surface subsidence. Surface uplift decreases with the increasing buried depth and the decreasing porosity and permeability, and the correlation between porosity and surface uplift is the best. However, the impact is limited in the area with shallow reservoir depth, high porosity, and high permeability, such as the heavy oil blocks in the study area.

TI  - Satellite assessment of eutrophication hot spots and algal blooms in small and medium-sized productive reservoirs in Uruguay's main drinking water basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive agricultural activities favor eutrophication and harmful phytoplankton blooms due to the high export of nutrients and damming of rivers. Productive watersheds used for water purification can have multiple reservoirs with phytoplankton blooms, which constitutes a high health risk. In general, water quality monitoring does not cover small- and medium-sized reservoirs (0.25-100 ha) of productive use due to their large number and location in private properties. In this work, the in situ trophic state of fourteen reservoirs was simultaneously assessed using Sentinel-2 images in the Santa Lucia River Basin, the main drinking water basin in Uruguay. These reservoirs are hypereutrophic (0.18-5.22 mg total P L-1) with high phytoplankton biomasses (2.8-4439 mu g chlorophyll-a L-1), mainly cyanobacteria. Based on data generated in situ and Sentinel-2 imagery, models were fitted to estimate satellite Chl-a and transparency in all the basin reservoirs (n = 486). The best fits were obtained with the green-to-red band ratio (560 and 665 nm, R-2 = 0.84) to estimate chlorophyll-a and reflectance at 833 nm (R-2 = 0.73) to determine transparency. The spatial distribution of the trophic state was explored by spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis, and the variation in spatial patterns could be determined prior and subsequent to a maximum cyanobacteria value in water treatment plant intakes. Therefore, reservoirs with greater potential for phytoplankton biomass export were identified. This work provides the first fitted tool for satellite monitoring of numerous reservoirs and strengthens the country's ability to respond to harmful phytoplankton blooms in its main drinking water basin.

TI  - Distinct regional meteorological influences on low-cloud albedo susceptibility over global marine stratocumulus regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine stratocumuli cool the Earth effectively due to their high reflectance of incoming solar radiation and persistent occurrence. The susceptibility of cloud albedo to droplet number concentration perturbations depends strongly on large-scale meteorological conditions. Studies focused on the meteorological dependence of cloud adjustments often overlook the covariability among meteorological factors and their geographical and temporal variability. We use 8 years of satellite observations sorted by day and geographical location to show the global distribution of marine low-cloud albedo susceptibility. We find an overall cloud brightening potential for most marine warm clouds, which is more pronounced over subtropical coastal regions. A weak cloud darkening potential in the annual mean is evident over the remote SE Pacific and SE Atlantic. We show that large-scale meteorological fields from the ERA5 reanalysis data, including lower-tropospheric stability, free-tropospheric relative humidity, sea surface temperature, and boundary layer depth, have distinct covariabilities over each of the eastern subtropical ocean basins where marine stratocumuli prevail. This leads to a markedly different annual cycle in albedo susceptibility over each basin. Moreover, we find that basin-specific regional relationships between key meteorological factors and albedo susceptibilities are absent in a global analysis. Our results stress the importance of considering the geographical distinctiveness of temporal meteorological covariability when scaling up the local-to-global response of cloud albedo to aerosol perturbations.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe ecological environment of tidal flats often changes due to tidal erosion and sedimentation. The distribution of tidal flat surface sediment is a natural reflection of the changes in the external dynamic environment, the spatial and temporal distribution pattern is of great significance. MethodsIn this study, the output structure of traditional convolutional neural network is combined with BP neural network. Meanwhile, four phases of Sentinel-2 multispectral images were collected and combined with field data from the Doulonggang tidal flat in Jiangsu Province, China, to construct the sediment composition inversion model. ResultsThe inversion accuracy was higher than 80% compared with the measured results. According to the inversion result, from 2017 to 2022, the surface sediment particle size of the tidal flat in Jiangsu varied seasonally and was coarse in summer and fine in winter. Additionally, the sediment composition tended to coarsen, showing an interannual change trend of increasing sand content and decreasing clay and silt contents. DiscussionThe above change of the sedimentary environment of the tidal flat may be caused by the decrease of fine grained sediment deposition, the introduction of exotic vegetation, the global sea level rise and the influence of human activities.

TI  - AnisoVeg: anisotropy and nadir-normalized MODIS multi-angle implementation atmospheric correction (MAIAC) datasets for satellite vegetation studies in South America
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The AnisoVeg product consists of monthly 1 km composites of anisotropy (ANI) and nadir-normalized (NAD) surface reflectance layers obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor over the entire South American continent. The satellite data were preprocessed using the multi-angle implementation atmospheric correction (MAIAC). The AnisoVeg product spans 22 years of observations (2000 to 2021) and includes the reflectance of MODIS bands 1 to 8 and two vegetation indices (VIs), namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). While the NAD layers reduce the data variability added by bidirectional effects on the reflectance and VI time series, the unique ANI layers allow the use of this multi-angular data variability as a source of information for vegetation studies. The AnisoVeg product has been generated using daily MODIS MAIAC data from both Terra and Aqua satellites, normalized for a fixed solar zenith angle (SZA = 45 degrees), modeled for three sensor view directions (nadir, forward, and backward scattering), and aggregated to monthly composites. The anisotropy was calculated by the subtraction of modeled backward and forward scattering surface reflectance. The release of the ANI data for open usage is novel, and the NAD data are at an advanced processing level. We demonstrate the use of such data for vegetation studies using three types of forests in the eastern Amazon with distinct gradients of vegetation structure and aboveground biomass (AGB). The gradient of AGB was positively associated with ANI, while NAD values were related to different canopy structural characteristics. This was further illustrated by the strong and significant relationship between EVIANI and forest height observations from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar sensor considering a simple linear model (R-2=0.55). Overall, the time series of the AnisoVeg product (NAD and ANI) provide distinct information for various applications aiming at understanding vegetation structure, dynamics, and disturbance patterns. All data, processing codes, and results are made publicly available to enable research and the extension of AnisoVeg products for other regions outside of South America. The code can be found at (Dalagnol and Wagner, 2022), EVIANI and EVINAD can be found as assets in the Google Earth Engine (GEE; described in the data availability section), and the full dataset is available from the open repository (Dalagnol et al., 2022).

TI  - Accounting for the aerosol type and additional satellite-borne aerosol products improves the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine airborne particles (diameter <2.5 mu m; PM2.5) are recognized as a major threat to human health due to their physicochemical properties: composition, size, shape, etc. However, normally only size-fraction-specific particle concentrations are monitored. Interestingly, although the aerosol type is reported as part of the aerosol optical depth retrieval from satellite observations, it has not been utilized, to date, as an auxiliary information/co-variate for PM2.5 prediction. We developed Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models that account for this information when predicting surface PM2.5. The models take as input only widely available data: satellite aerosol products with full cover and surface meteorological data. Distinct models were developed for AOD of specific aerosol types. Both the RF and XGBoost models performed well, showing moderate-to-high crossvalidated adjusted R2 (RF: 0.753-0.909; XGBoost: 0.741-0.903), depending on the aerosol type and other covariates. The weighted performance of the specific aerosol-type models was higher than of the RF and XGBoost baseline models, where all the AOD retrievals were used together (the common practice). Our approach can provide improved risk estimates due to exposure to PM2.5, better resolved radiative forcing calculations, and tailored abatement surveillance of specific pollutants/sources.

TI  - Improved soil evaporation remote sensing retrieval algorithms and associated uncertainty analysis on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is the key link between water and energy cycles. However, accurate evaporation estimation in alpine barren areas remains understudied. In this study, we aimed to improve the satellite-driven Process-based Land Surface ET/Heat fluxes algorithm (P-LSH) for better satellite retrieval of ET on the Tibetan Plateau by introducing two effective soil moisture constraint schemes in which normalized surface soil moisture and the ratio of cumulative antecedent precipitation to cumulative antecedent equilibrium evaporation are used to represent soil water stress, respectively, based on the intercomparison and knowledge-learning of the existing schemes. We first conducted intercomparison of six existing soil evaporation algorithms and sorted out the two most effective soil moisture constraint schemes. We then introduced the modified versions of the two constraint schemes into the P-LSH algorithm and further optimized the parameters using the differential evolution method. As a result, it formed two improved P-LSH algorithms. We systematically assessed the performances of the two improved P-LSH algorithms and six existing remote sensing ET retrieval algorithms on two barren-dominated basins of the Tibetan Plateau using reconstructed ET estimates derived from the terrestrial water balance method as a benchmark. The two moisture constraint schemes largely improved the performance of the P-LSH algorithm and showed better performance in both basins (root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.36 and 7.76 mm per month; R-2=0.86 and 0.87), resulting in a higher simulation accuracy than all six existing algorithms. We used five soil moisture datasets and five precipitation datasets to further investigate the impact of moisture constraint uncertainty on the improved P-LSH algorithm. The ET estimates of the improved P-LSH algorithm, driven by the GLDAS_Noah soil moisture, performed best compared with those driven by other soil moisture and precipitation datasets, while ET estimates driven by various precipitation datasets generally showed a high and stable accuracy. These results suggest that high-quality soil moisture can optimally express moisture supply to ET, and that more accessible precipitation data can serve as a substitute for soil moisture as an indicator of moisture status for its robust performance in barren evaporation.

TI  - Integrating RADAR and optical imagery improve the modelling of carbon stocks in a mopane-dominated African savannah dry forest
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study examined the integration of two satellite data sets, that is Landsat 7 ETM+ and ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture RADAR) in estimating carbon stocks in mopane woodlands of north-western Zimbabwe. Mopane woodlands cover large spatial extents and provide ecosystem benefits to the rural economies and grazing resources for both livestock and wildlife. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to estimate carbon stocks based on spectral metrics derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ and ALOS PALSAR. To determine the utility of the two satellite-derived metrics, a two-pronged modelling framework was adopted. Firstly, we used spectral bands and vegetation indices from the two satellite data sets independently, and subsequently, we integrated the metrics from the two satellite data sets into the final model. Results showed that the ALOS PALSAR (R-2 = 0.75 and nRMSE = 0.16) and Landsat ETM+ (R-2 = 0.78 and nRMSE = 0.14) derived spectral bands and vegetation indices comparatively yielded accurate estimations of carbon stocks. Integrating spectral bands and vegetation indices from both sensors significantly improved the estimation of carbon stocks (R-2 = 0.84 and nRMSE = 0.12). These findings underscore the importance of integrating satellite data in vegetation biophysical assessment and monitoring in poorly documented ecosystems such as the mopane woodlands.

TI  - An integrated approach of remote sensing and geospatial analysis for modeling and predicting the impacts of climate change on food security
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agriculture sector provides the majority of food supplies, ensures food security, and promotes sustainable development. Due to recent climate changes as well as trends in human population growth and environmental degradation, the need for timely agricultural information continues to rise. This study analyzes and predicts the impacts of climate change on food security (FS). For 2002-2021, Landsat, MODIS satellite images and predisposing variables (land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration, precipitation, sunny days, cloud ratio, soil salinity, soil moisture, groundwater quality, soil types, digital elevation model, slope, and aspect) were used. First, we used a deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to detect agricultural land (AL). A remote sensing-based approach combined with the analytical network process (ANP) model was used to identify frost-affected areas. We then analyzed the relationship between climatic, geospatial, and topographical variables and AL and frost-affected areas. We found negative correlations of - 0.80, - 0.58, - 0.43, and - 0.45 between AL and LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, and soil salinity, respectively. There is a positive correlation between AL and precipitation, sunny days, soil moisture, and groundwater quality of 0.39, 0.25, 0.21, and 0.77, respectively. The correlation between frost-affected areas and LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, elevation, slope, and aspect are 0.55, 0.40, 0.52, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.39. Frost-affected areas have negative correlations with precipitation, sunny day, and soil moisture of - 0.68, - 0.23, and - 0.38, respectively. Our findings show that the increase in LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, and soil salinity is associated with the decrease in AL. Additionally, AL decreases with a decreasing in precipitation, sunny days, soil moisture, and groundwater quality. It was also found that as LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, elevation, slope, and aspect increase, frost-affected areas increase as well. Furthermore, frost-affected areas increase when precipitation, sunny days, and soil moisture decrease. Finally, we predicted the FS threat for 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2060 using the CA-Markov method. According to the results, the AL will decrease by 0.36% from 2030 to 2060. Between 2030 and 2060, however, the area with very high frost-affected will increase by about 10.64%. In sum, this study accentuates the critical impacts of climate change on the FS in the region. Our findings and proposed methods could be helpful for researchers to model and quantify the climate change impacts on the FS in different regions and periods.

TI  - Characterizing urban growth and land surface temperature in the western himalayan cities of India using remote sensing and spatial metrics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHI) are developing due to increasing urbanization and loss of vegetation in major cities in India. Increased urbanization modifies the urban microclimate that leads to significant land-use changes resulting in surface conversion and heat release, which poses serious risks to human health, environment and the ecosystem of the Himalayan ecosystem. Hence, mitigating UHI becomes important and requires a better understanding of underlying associated biophysical processes. In the study an attempt has been made to demonstrate the impact of urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) in Shimla and Dehradun, capitals of the Western Himalayan states, India using satellite data and spatial metrics. The process was analyzed using urban coverage patterns obtained from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and corresponding sensors from TM, ETM+, and OLI. The Built-up and Non-Built-up areas were extracted and the biophysical parameters NDVI, NDBI, NDWI and LST were calculated to capture different features of urban growth. The result indicated, that the built-up area increased from 32.19 km(2) (2000) to 68.37 km(2) (2016) in Dehradun and from 12.38 km(2) (2000) to 29.47 km(2) (2016) in Shimla during the study period, resulting in an increase in NDBI and LST and Reduction and NDVI and NDWI. Results showed that temperature hotspots were largest in urban areas, followed by vegetation and water bodies. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between LST and biophysical parameters -NDVI, NDBI, NDWI. Spatial metrics at the class and landscape levels show that increased urban growth from 2000 to 2016 has made the landscape fragmented and more heterogeneous. The Identified trends and changes in landscape patterns and their impact on heterogeneous urban areas suggest that the study is feasible to estimate LST, NDVI, NDBI and NDWI with reasonable accuracy that will likely have influence on policy interventions.

TI  - Identifying building locations in the wildland-urban interface before and after fires with convolutional neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Wildland-urban interface (WUI) maps identify areas with wildfire risk, but they are often outdated owing to the lack of building data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract building locations from remote sensing data, but their accuracy in WUI areas is unknown. Additionally, CNNs are computationally intensive and technically complex, making them challenging for end-users, such as those who use or create WUI maps, to apply.Aims We identified buildings pre- and post-wildfire and estimated building destruction for three California wildfires: Camp, Tubbs and Woolsey.Methods We evaluated a CNN-based building dataset and a CNN model from a separate commercial vendor to detect buildings from high-resolution imagery. This dataset and model represent to end-users the state of the art of what is readily available for potential WUI mapping.Key results We found moderate accuracies for the building dataset and the CNN model and a severe underestimation of buildings and their destruction rates where trees occluded buildings. The CNN model performed best post-fire with accuracies >= 73%.Conclusions Existing CNNs may be used with moderate accuracy for identifying individual buildings post-fire and mapping the extent of the WUI. The implications are, however, that CNNs are too inaccurate for post-fire damage assessments or building counts in the WUI.

TI  - Identification of dust aerosols, their sources, and the effect of soil moisture in Central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols in Central Asia are an important factor in global climate change and attribution studies. Identifying the source of dust in Central Asia is crucial for understanding the ecological environment and climate, locally and globally. In this study, daily dust aerosol data were calculated and extracted for Central Asia from 2003 to 2018. The multi-year trends of dust aerosols were analyzed, dust sources were identified, the characteristics of dust aerosols in dust sources were analyzed, and the influence of soil moisture on sand initiation was explored. The results show that there are dis-tinct seasonal characteristics in the spatial distribution of dust aerosols in Central Asia. The proportion of the area in the zone of high dust aerosols was the greatest in spring. Nearly half of the dust aerosol areas exhibited an increasing trend. A high incidence of dust sources was mainly distributed in the southern Xinjiang region. The trend of change in the dust area first increased and then decreased. With the increase in soil moisture under different wind speed condi-tions, the aerosols from dust sources all showed an exponentially decreasing trend, and the increase in soil moisture led to an increase in the wind speed threshold of sand initiation. This study provides basic data support for the study of dust aerosols, identifies dust sources, and provides a basis for studying the radiative forcing and climate effects of dust aerosols in Central Asia.

TI  - The ETS transcription factor ETV6 constrains the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI to promote Ewing sarcoma
T2  - NATURE CELL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) are frequently mutated in cancer. Paediatric cancers exhibit few mutations genome-wide but frequently harbour sentinel mutations that affect TFs, which provides a context to precisely study the transcriptional circuits that support mutant TF-driven oncogenesis. A broadly relevant mechanism that has garnered intense focus involves the ability of mutant TFs to hijack wild-type lineage-specific TFs in self-reinforcing transcriptional circuits. However, it is not known whether this specific type of circuitry is equally crucial in all mutant TF-driven cancers. Here we describe an alternative yet central transcriptional mechanism that promotes Ewing sarcoma, wherein constraint, rather than reinforcement, of the activity of the fusion TF EWS-FLI supports cancer growth. We discover that ETV6 is a crucial TF dependency that is specific to this disease because it, counter-intuitively, represses the transcriptional output of EWS-FLI. This work discovers a previously undescribed transcriptional mechanism that promotes cancer.Independent but complementary studies from Vakoc and Stegmaier identify and characterize a role for ETV6 in counteracting the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI during Ewing sarcoma development, which may be targeted for therapeutic benefits.

TI  - BRAF<SUP>V600E</SUP> Expression Is Homogenous and Associated with Nonrecurrent Disease and Better Survival in Primary Melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) are the most common type of melanoma and cause the majority of skin cancer deaths. More than 50% of cases harbor a mutation in the BRAF gene that activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cancer signaling pathway. BRAF(V600E) is the most common BRAF mutation, and it represents an important biomarker that guides treatment selection. However, the relationship between the BRAF(V600E) gene expression and intratumoral protein distribution, on one side, and clinicopathological factors and patient outcomes, on the other, is not fully described. Additionally, whether MAPK cancer signaling activation in melanoma is due to increased biochemical activity of BRAF(V600E), increased mRNA levels, or both requires further investigation. Here, we addressed these questions by examining expression patterns of BRAF(V600E) in primary treatment-naive melanomas and correlating them to clinicopathological factors and patient outcomes. Methods: In 166 SSM cases, we performed immunohistochemical staining to investigate the protein expression of BRAF(V600E), and we measured BRAF mRNA levels using NanoString nCounter system. Results: Ninety-seven (49%) melanomas stained positive for BRAF(V600E), with nearly 100% intratumoral homogeneity observed. Positive BRAF(V600E) expression was significantly associated with nonrecurrent disease and was found to be an independent predictor of better prognosis in univariate and multivariable analyses. Furthermore, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, sentinel lymph node biopsy negativity, and low Breslow thickness were all independent predictors of better prognosis. We observed no difference in the BRAF mRNA levels in BRAF(V600E)-negative and BRAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, respectively. Validation in a larger publicly available cohort confirmed that there is only a weak correlation (Spearman 0.4) between BRAF(V600E) mRNA and protein levels and no differences in mRNA between BRAF(V600E) mutated and non-mutated patients. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that BRAF(V600E) is homogeneously present throughout the whole tumor and is associated with nonrecurrent disease and better survival in primary melanoma. We also showed that BRAF(V600E) mutation does not result in higher transcriptional levels, suggesting that activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in BRAF(V600E) mutated patients can be attributed to the increased biochemical activity caused by the mutation.

TI  - A long-term 1 km monthly near-surface air temperature dataset over theTibetan glaciers by fusion of station and satellite observations
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface air temperature (SAT) is a key indicator of global warming and plays an important role in glacier melting. On the Tibetan Plateau (TP), there exists a large number of glaciers. However, station SAT observations on these glaciers are extremely scarce, and moreover the available ones are characterized by short time series, which substantively hinder our deep understanding of glacier dynamics due to climate changes on the TP. In this study, an ensemble learning model is constructed and trained to estimate glacial SATs with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km from 2002 to 2020 using monthly MODIS land surface temperature products and many auxiliary variables, such as vegetation index, satellite overpass time, and near-surface air pressure. The satellite-estimated glacial SATs are validated against SAT observations at glacier validation stations. Then, long-term (1961-2020) glacial SATs on the TP are reconstructed by temporally extending the satellite SAT estimates through a Bayesian linear regression. The long-term glacial SAT estimates are validated with root mean squared error, mean bias error, and determination coefficient being 1.61 degrees C, 0.21 degrees C, and 0.93, respectively. The comparisons are conducted with other satellite SAT estimates and ERA5-Land reanalysis data over the validation glaciers, showing that the accuracy of our satellite glacial SATs and their temporal extensions are both higher. The preliminary analysis illustrates that the glaciers on the TP as a whole have been undergoing fast warming, but the warming exhibits a great spatial heterogeneity. Our dataset can contribute to the monitoring of glaciers' warming, analysis of their evolution, etc. on the TP. The dataset is freely available from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.272550 (Qin, 2022).

TI  - Remote sensing crop group-specific indicators to support regional yield forecasting in Europe
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational crop yield forecasting services typically provides crop yield forecasts based on regression models between official yields and agro-environmental variables, among which meteorological data, crop simulation model or satellite-derived indicators. The reliability with which these variables infer on yields depends, among many other factors, also on their aggregation in the space domain, for example on the type of the crop masks utilized in the aggregation process from point to regional scale. This work investigates how the yield explanatory power of satellite-derived indicators is changing moving from time-stable arable land masks to annual crop group-specific masks. We compare in particular the linkage between time series of regional crop yield in Europe and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), when generic arable land masks or crop group-specific and year-specific information are applied to aggregate pixel values at regional level. Regional (Eurostat level NUTS-2) crop yield statistics were collected from official databases for the period 2003-2019, while NDVI data were derived from MODIS daily products at 250 m spatial resolution for the same reference period. Regional NDVI profiles were retrieved by averaging single pixels time series according to the information of five crop masks, including generic arable land masks, crop group-specific static masks (separating winter and spring crops from summer crops), and annual crop groupspecific masks (distinguishing between the two crop groups and varying in time). A compared correlation analysis between yield data and regional temporal NDVI profiles was performed assuming a linear regression model. Coefficient of determination R2 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were computed to assess the models' errors and to analyze the effect of the aggregation on the different crop masks. Results indicated an improvement in yield estimation when using annual crop group-specific indicators with respect to generic and static products. Although not homogeneously distributed throughout Europe, advantages have been highlighted both in terms of accuracy and timeliness of the prediction. In most regions, the introduction of annual masks allowed to reduce RMSE values by 0.3 t/ha and advanced forecast times by up to 30 days. The added value in the use of annual crop group-specific masks concerned the two European most cultivated crops, namely soft wheat and grain maize.

TI  - Adverse events following first and second dose COVID-19 vaccination in England, October 2020 to September 2021: a national vaccine surveillance platform self-controlled case series study
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Post-authorisation vaccine safety surveillance is well established for reporting common adverse events of interest (AEIs) following influenza vaccines, but not for COVID- 19 vaccines. Aim: To estimate the incidence of AEIs presenting to primary care following COVID-19 vaccination in England, and report safety profile differences between vaccine brands. Methods: We used a self-controlled case series design to estimate relative incidence ( RI) of AEIs reported to the national sentinel network, the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub. We compared AEIs (overall and by clinical category) 7 days pre- and post-vaccination to background levels between 1 October 2020 and 12 September 2021. Results: Within 7,952,861 records, 781,200 individuals (9.82%) presented to general practice with 1,482,273 AEIs, 4.85% within 7 days post-vaccination. Overall, medically attended AEIs decreased post-vaccination against background levels. There was a 3-7% decrease in incidence within 7 days after both doses of Comirnaty (RI: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91-0.94 and RI: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94-0.98, respectively) and Vaxzevria (RI: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.98). A 20% increase was observed after one dose of Spikevax (RI: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.00-1.44). Fewer AEIs were reported as age increased. Types of AEIs, e.g. increased neurological and psychiatric conditions, varied between brands following two doses of Comirnaty (RI: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.28-1.56) and Vaxzevria (RI: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.97-1.78).Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a small decrease in medically attended AEI incidence. Sentinel networks could routinely report common AEI rates, contributing to reporting vaccine safety.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Between March and June 2020, activity in the major cities of Latin America declined due to containment efforts implemented by local governments to avoid the rapid spread of COVID-19. Our study compared 2020 with the previous year and demonstrated a considerable drop in tropospheric NO2 levels obtained by the SENTINEL 5P satellite in major Latin American cities. Lima (47.5%), Santiago (36.1%), Sa similar to o Paulo (27%), Rio de Janeiro (23%), Quito (18.6%), Bogota (17.5%), Buenos Aires (16.6%), Guayaquil (15.3%), Medellin (14.2%), La Paz (9.5%), Belo Horizonte (7.8%), Mexico (7.6%) and Brasilia (5.9%) registered statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations during the study period. In addition, we analyzed mobility data from Google and Apple reports as well as meteorological information from atmospheric reanalysis data along with satellite fields between 2011 and 2020, and performed a refined multivariate analysis (non-negative matrix approximation) to show that this decrease was associated with a reduction in population mobility rather than meteorological factors. Our findings corroborate the argument that confinement scenarios may indicate how air pollutant concentrations can be effectively reduced and managed.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential for carbon sink and association with land occupation
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic influences on a global scale have caused negative impacts on the environment, among the most prominent being the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). In this study, the objective was then to estimate the potential of carbon flux (CO2 flux) in the riparian vegetation of the Jacarei-Jaguari reservoir; using the digital processing of orbital images of the CBERS 4A system. To determine the CO2 flux, vegetative indices were used: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and the scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index (sPRI), associating them with land use and occupation classifications from the MapBiomas collection, determining the histogram of each class for CO2 flux analysis, revealing CO2 flux between -0.136 and 0.4049. The lower values of CO2 flux in the reservoir are due to the decrease in vegetative classes, indicating the need for (re)planting and plant conservation, confirming the importance of areas with an ecosystem function, of carbon sink.

TI  - Burned vegetation recovery trajectory and its driving factors using satellite remote-sensing datasets in the Great Xing'An forest region of Inner Mongolia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is one of the most important factors that alter a forest ecosystem's biogeochemical cycle. Large-scale distributed burned areas lose their original vegetation structure and are more impacted by climate change in the vegetation recovery process, thus making it harder to restore their original vegetation structure. In this study, we used historical Landsat imagery and the LandTrendr algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform to study and identify post-fire stages in the Great Xing'An Range of Inner Mongolia. Moreover, we categorized different post-fire vegetation recovery trajectories. The usefulness of spectral indices was also evaluated in the study region. We applied the Geodetector model to analyze the driving factors of the burned area vegetation regeneration process. The results show that burn severity and earth-atmosphere hydrological cycle are two main impacting factors in the short term after the fire (e.g. 5-6 years). Other climatical conditions affect vegetation recovery, including prolonged vegetation recovery process, hydrothermal circulation process and topographical conditions, seasonally frozen soil, freeze-thaw processes, and climate events. This study improves understanding of the dynamic successional processes in the burned area and the driving factors. Also, the outcomes can facilitate and support sustainable forest management of the Great Xing'An Range.

TI  - Continual expansion of<i> Spartina</i><i> alterniflora</i> in the temperate and subtropical coastal zones of China during 1985-2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions are considerably altering ecosystem structure and functions, especially in coastal ecosystems that are subject to intensive anthropogenic disturbances. Spartina alterniflora has been recognized as the most serious invasive species in coastal China, which has received considerable attention from the government and the public. There is urgent need to control this invasive species at regional and national scales, but such efforts were impeded by lack of time-series data of Spartina spread. Here, we assessed the pixel-and phenology-based al-gorithm for mapping Spartina saltmarshes, and applied this algorithm to generate annual Spartina saltmarsh maps (30-m spatial resolution) from 1985 to 2020 by using time series Landsat 5/7/8 images. The resulting maps suggest that Spartina has been expanding since 1990 in coastal China, with three noticeable phases (rapid, moderate, and rapid). Along the latitudinal gradient, Spartina exhibited a longer invasion history and more frequent changes at low latitudes. Although human interventions caused the decline of Spartina in certain areas, rapid natural spread was primarily responsible for its extensive and continual invasion. These results provide insights for efficiently managing this invasive species, enhancing the conservation of coastal wetlands, and promoting the sustainability of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Development of a GNSS/INS buoy array in preparation for SWOT validation in Bass Strait
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In preparation for validation of the swath-based altimetry mission (Surface Water Oceanography Topography, SWOT), we developed a buoy array, equipped with Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System, capable of accurately observing sea surface height (SSH), wave information and tropospheric delay. Here we present results from an 8-day trial deployment at five locations along a Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6MF) ground track in Bass Strait. A triplet buoy group including two new buoys (Mk-VI) and a single predecessor (Mk-IV) were deployed in proximity to the historic Jason-series comparison point. SSH solutions compared against an in-situ mooring suggest the new buoys were working at an equivalent precision of similar to 1.5 cm to the previous design (MK-IV). At 10-km spacing along the S6MF track, the buoy array was shown to observe the progression of oceanographic and meteorological phenomena. Tidal analysis of the buoy array indicated moderate spatial variability in the shallow water tidal constituents, with differences in the instantaneous tidal height of up to similar to 0.2 m across the 40-km track. Further, tidal resonance within Bass Strait was observed to vary, most probably modulated by atmospheric conditions, yet only partially captured by an existing dynamic atmospheric correction product. A preliminary investigation into the spatial scale of the buoy error based on observed/inferred geostrophic currents with our present buoy array configuration suggests that the signal-noise ratio of the array became significant at 20-km spacing in Bass Strait. Finally, as an illustrative comparison between the buoy array and high resolution S6MF data, a single cycle was compared. The wet tropospheric delay observed by the S6MF radiometer exhibited some potential land contamination in the deployed area, while the 1-Hz and 20-Hz significant wave height from S6MF appeared within mission requirements. Generally good agreement between buoy and altimeter SSH was observed. However, subtle differences between the altimeter and the buoy sea level anomaly series warrants further investigation with additional cycles from a sustained deployment in the area. We conclude that the buoy array offers a useful geodetic tool to help quantify and understand intra-swath variability in the context of the SWOT mission.

TI  - An assessment of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Landsat-derived aerosol concentration in relation with land cover and road networks in the Lagos megacity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The interrelationships between air quality, land cover change, and road networks in the Lagos megacity have not been explored. Globally, there are knowledge gaps in understanding these dynamics, especially using remote sensing data. This study used multi-temporal and multi-spectral Landsat imageries at four epochs (2002, 2013, 2015, and 2020) to evaluate the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) levels in relation to land cover and road networks in the Lagos megacity. A look-up table (LUT) was generated using Py6S, a python-based 6S module, to simulate the AOT using land surface reflectance and top of atmosphere reflectance. A comparative assessment of the method against in situ measurements of particulate matter (PM) at different locations shows a strong positive correlation between the imagery-derived AOT values and the PMs. The AOT concentration across the land cover and road networks showed an increasing trend from 2002 to 2020, which could be explained by urbanization in the megacity. The higher concentration of AOT along the major roads is attributed to the high air pollutants released from vehicles, including home/office generators and industries along the road corridors. The continuous rise in pollutant values requires urgent intervention and mitigation efforts. Remote sensing-based AOT monitoring is a possible solution.

TI  - AI4Boundaries: an open AI-ready dataset to map field boundaries with Sentinel-2 and aerial photography
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Field boundaries are at the core of many agricultural applications and are a key enabler for the operational monitoring of agricultural production to support food security. Recent scientific progress in deep learning methods has highlighted the capacity to extract field boundaries from satellite and aerial images with a clear improvement from object-based image analysis (e.g. multiresolution segmentation) or conventional filters (e.g. Sobel filters). However, these methods need labels to be trained on. So far, no standard data set exists to easily and robustly benchmark models and progress the state of the art. The absence of such benchmark data further impedes proper comparison against existing methods. Besides, there is no consensus on which evaluation metrics should be reported (both at the pixel and field levels). As a result, it is currently impossible to compare and benchmark new and existing methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce AI4Boundaries, a data set of images and labels readily usable to train and compare models on field boundary detection. AI4Boundaries includes two specific data sets: (i) a 10 m Sentinel-2 monthly composites for large-scale analyses in retrospect and (ii) a 1 m orthophoto data set for regional-scale analyses, such as the automatic extraction of Geospatial Aid Application (GSAA). All labels have been sourced from GSAA data that have been made openly available (Austria, Catalonia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden) for 2019, representing 14.8 M parcels covering 376 K km2. Data were selected following a stratified random sampling drawn based on two landscape fragmentation metrics, the perimeter/area ratio and the area covered by parcels, thus considering the diversity of the agricultural landscapes. The resulting "AI4Boundaries " dataset consists of 7831 samples of 256 by 256 pixels for the 10 m Sentinel-2 dataset and of 512 by 512 pixels for the 1 m aerial orthophoto. Both datasets are provided with the corresponding vector ground-truth parcel delineation (2.5 M parcels covering 47 105 km(2)), and with a raster version already pre-processed and ready to use. Besides providing this open dataset to foster computer vision developments of parcel delineation methods, we discuss the perspectives and limitations of the dataset for various types of applications in the agriculture domain and consider possible further improvements. The data are available on the JRC Open Data Catalogue: http://data.europa.eu/89h/0e79ce5d-e4c8-4721-8773-59a4acf2c9c9 .

T2  - MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invertebrates are harmed by pollution of their habitats. Litter-dwelling sedentary scorpions, such as Tityus pusillus, studied here, may be good models for examining the genotoxic effects of xenobiotics in soil. Thirty specimens were collected from five sites in Northeast Brazil with different levels of human disturbance, as well as a laboratory group. The comet assay was performed on hemolymph cell samples. Damage Index (DI) and Damage Frequency (DF%) were measured. Much higher genotoxicity was observed in animals collected in an area with human interference and solid waste, compared to those obtained in more pristine areas or the laboratory. T. pusillus may be a useful model for environmental genotoxicity assays.

TI  - Comparison of different methods to account for the plasmaspheric electron content in GNSS-derived ionospheric altimeter corrections and their impact on sea level trend estimation
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global ionospheric maps based on GNSS measurements are nowadays often used to correct satellite altimeter measurements when the instruments have only one frequency or measure over coasts and inland waters. If these corrections do not account for the free electron fraction over the altimeter satellites, this leads to systematic deviations in the range measurements and thus in the estimated sea level. This study compares and assesses different approaches to reduce GNSS-based corrections for the plasmaspheric electron content. It is shown that using a simple scaling with a constant factor of 0.881 gives the best results for the Jason-1 mission, while correcting with the commonly used model ratios leads to higher sea level trend artefacts and larger noise levels, especially for periods of lower solar activity. Using this approach, the sea level trend error for both Jason-1 and Sentinel-6A can be reduced to below 0.1 mm/year, with standard deviations of the differences from the dual-frequency altimeter corrections of 6.74 mm. A simple machine learning approach (boosted regression tree) is also investigated and shows promising results. However, due to the higher processing capacity requirements and the larger deviations from long-term trend, further improvements are recommended before such an approach can be used in routine processing of altimeter corrections.

TI  - Combining forest growth models and remotely sensed data through a hierarchical model-based inferential framework
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-area growth estimates can be obtained by coupling growth model predictions with wall-to-wall remotely sensed aux-iliary variables through a generalized hierarchical model-based (GHMB) inferential framework. So far, most GHMB variance estimators do not account for the residual errors of the submodels and their spatial correlations. This likely induces an under-estimation of the true variance of the point estimator. In this study, we provide an example of large-area growth estimation obtained through the GHMB framework. To do this, we developed a new variance estimator that accounts for residual errors as well as potential spatial correlations among them. We tested this variance estimator through a simulation study and then used it to estimate the annual volume increment for a forest management unit in Quebec, Canada. Our results show that, contrary to our expectation, neglecting the residual errors of the different submodels leads to overestimating the true variance of the point estimator. We observed increases in the overestimation with small populations and spatially correlated residual errors. Our developed variance estimator corrected this overestimation and made it possible to derive reliable confidence intervals for annual volume increments at the population level.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Standard treatment of early-stage vulvar cancer is a radical, wide, local excision of the primary tumor and a sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure for the groins. An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is no longer necessary for patients who have a negative SLN or micrometastasis (<= 2 mm). When there is macrometastasis (> 2 mm) in the SLN, an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is indicated; however, this procedure is associated with major morbidity, such as wound healing, lymphoceles, and lymphedema.Primary Objective To investigate the safety of replacing inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy by chemoradiation in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer with a macrometastasis (> 2 mm) and/or extracapsular extension in the sentinel node.Study Hypothesis Combination of 56 Gy of radiation to the inguinal site and concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy without completion inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy will be feasible and safe, with low groin recurrence rates.Trial Design This is a single-arm, prospective phase II treatment trial with stopping rules for unacceptable groin recurrences. Eligible patients will receive 56 Gy of radiation to the involved inguinal site and chemotherapy with concurrent cisplatin.Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Eligible patients undergoing sentinel node procedure will have stage I, unifocal, invasive (> 1 mm depth of invasion) squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with tumor size < 4 cm, and no suspicious nodes on imaging. Those eligible for the trial are those with a metastasis > 2 mm in the sentinel node and/or extracapsular extension, or more than one sentinel node with micrometastasis <= 2 mm.Primary Endpoint Groin recurrence rate in the first 2 years after primary treatment.Sample Size 157 patients with macrometastases in their SLN.Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results January 1, 2029.

AB  - The Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) is a collection of de-identified whole-population administrative datasets. Researchers are increasingly utilising the IDI to answer pressing social and policy research questions. Our work provides an overview of the IDI, associated issues for Maori (the Indigenous peoples of New Zealand), and steps to realise Maori data aspirations. We first introduce the IDI including what it is and how it was developed. We then move to an overview of Maori Data Sovereignty. We consider the main issues with the IDI for Maori including technical issues and problems with ethnic identifiers, deficit-framed work, community involvement, consent, social licence, further data linkage, offshore access, and barriers to access for Maori. We finish with a set of recommendations around how to improve the IDI for Maori, making sure that Maori can get the most out of administrative data for our communities. These include the need to build data researcher capacity and capability for Maori; work with hapori Maori to increase utilisation; change accountability mechanisms, including greater co-governance of data; adequately fund alternatives; or potentially even abolishing the IDI and starting again.HE WHAKARAPOPOTOTANGAKo te Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) tetahi kohinga raraunga whakahaerenga a-taupori katoa te-tautohua.

TI  - Fracture in Patients with Normal Bone Mineral Density An Evaluation of the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone Registry
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Fractures often occur in patients with normal dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured bone mineral density (BMD). DXA does not consider clinical fracture risk factors or bone quality. We hypothesized that patients with normal BMD who sustain a fracture have other characteristics suggesting abnormal bone and an elevated fracture risk requiring additional bone health evaluation and potential anti-osteoporotic treatment.Methods:A total of 7,219 patients who were >= 50 years of age, had sustained a fracture from July 2016 to July 2021, and had DXA data in the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone (AOA OTB) registry were included in this study. The index and prior fracture site data were obtained. BMD status was classified by the World Health Organization T-score criteria. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) scores with and without BMD were calculated in patients with normal BMD. An elevated risk was defined as a major osteoporotic fracture risk of >= 20% or a hip fracture risk of >= 3%.Results:The mean patient age (and standard deviation) was 70.8 +/- 9.71 years, 84% of patients were female, and 92% of patients were Caucasian. Normal BMD was present in 8.6% of patients. The index fracture was a major osteoporotic fracture in 68.6% of patients with normal BMD and 75.6% of patients with osteoporosis. The most common site for index and prior fractures other than major osteoporotic fractures was the foot and ankle; of patients with normal BMD, 13.9% had this as the most common index site and 17.4% had this as the most common prior site. The FRAX risk calculated without BMD was elevated in 72.9% of patients with normal BMD, and the FRAX risk calculated with BMD was elevated in 12.0% of patients.Conclusions:Most patients with a fracture and normal BMD met indications, including a prior fracture or elevated FRAX risk, for anti-osteoporotic therapies. Most patients were Caucasian and therefore potentially had a higher baseline fracture risk. The FRAX risk calculated without BMD was elevated more often than the FRAX risk with BMD, implying that clinical risk factors, which highlight multiple opportunities for non-pharmacologic secondary fracture prevention, should be considered along with DXA. Fractures other than major osteoporotic fractures were more common in patients with normal BMD, suggesting that minor fractures in adults who are >= 50 years of age should be considered sentinel events warranting further evaluation. Surgeons must recognize that other important risk factors apart from BMD may help to guide further bone health evaluation.

TI  - Radiative effects of observationally constrained tropical upper-level clouds in a radiative-convective equilibrium model
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical upper-level clouds (TUCs) control the radiation budget in a climate system and strongly influence surface temperatures. This study examines global mean surface temperature changes due to the percent change in TUC cover, which is referred to as the tropical upper-level cloud radiative effect (TUCRE, in units of Kelvin per %). We use a radiative-convective equilibrium model that can control both upper- and lower-level cloud layers separately in three idealized regions (extratropics, tropical moist, and tropical dry regions) and two sub-regions (clear-moist and cloudy-moist regions) within the tropical moist regions. In the simulation, tropical reflectivity based on the TUC fraction assumes a primary role in determining the TUCRE. Accurate estimate of the TUCRE requires careful prescriptions according to actual satellite observations. We use the extent of TUC fraction and reflectivity obtained from 18 years (2003-2020) of satellite data on daily MODIS cloud properties. Our results show that the estimated net TUCRE ranges from 0.19 to 0.33 K/%, with a higher TUC fraction leading to higher temperatures (a warming effect) in the climate system. This means that a longwave TUCRE dominates over a shortwave TUCRE. When upper- and lower-level clouds interplay in the model, the range of the TUCRE was greater with a combination of two cloud layers, although all values were positive. The TUCRE is greater by 0.22 to 0.40 K/% when upper- and lower-level clouds are negatively coupled, because the Earth warms due to a decline in the reflectance of solar radiation. When upper- and lower-level clouds are positively coupled, the TUCRE is lower by 0.14 to 0.30 K/%, as less radiation reaches the Earth through combined cloud layers. Finally, we test the sensitivity of the TUCRE with five TUC fractions and 15 combinations of tropical reflectivity. Comparing our results with the TUCREs estimated from climate models will help us understand how TUC cover affects climate, and should greatly reduce uncertainty associated with cloud feedback.

TI  - Timing of real-time indocyanine green fluorescence visualization for lymph node dissection during laparoscopic colon cancer surgery
T2  - LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAlthough numerous studies have highlighted the potential value of indocyanine green (ICG) imaging in lymph node dissection of cancer surgery, its efficacy and optimal method remain to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate how lymphatic flow observation via ICG fluorescence could contribute to colon cancer surgery.MethodsFrom October 2018 to March 2021, a total of 56 patients with colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with intraoperative ICG imaging were analyzed. Lymphatic flow was examined at the following time points following ICG injection: within 5 min, 30-60 min, and over 60 min. We also evaluated the distribution of ICG fluorescence per each vascular pedicle.ResultsLymphatic flow was observed within 5 min following ICG injection in 6 cases (10.7%), and at 30-60 min following ICG injection in 43 cases (76.8%). ICG-stained vascular pedicles were variable especially in hepatic flexural, transverse, and splenic flexural colon cancer. Lymph node metastases were observed in 14 cases. Although metastatic lymph nodes were present only in the area along the ICG-stained vascular pedicles in 12 of the 14 cases, two patients exhibited lymph node metastasis in areas along the ICG-unstained vascular pedicles. ICG fluorescence was observed outside the standard range of lymph node dissection in 9 cases (20.9%: 9/43). Although addition of the proposed resection areas was made in 8 of these 9 cases, there was no pathologically positive lymph node.ConclusionReal-time ICG fluorescence imaging of lymph nodes may improve the performance of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery, although its oncological benefit is not yet clear.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of terrestrial plastic waste
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic waste is a significant environmental pollutant that is difficult to monitor. We created a system of neural networks to analyze spectral, spatial, and temporal components of Sentinel-2 satellite data to identify terrestrial aggregations of waste. The system works at wide geographic scale, finding waste sites in twelve countries across Southeast Asia. We evaluated performance in Indonesia and detected 374 waste aggregations, more than double the number of sites found in public databases. The same system deployed in Southeast Asia identifies 996 subsequently confirmed waste sites. For each detected site, we algorithmically monitor waste site footprints through time and cross-reference other datasets to generate physical and social metadata. 19% of detected waste sites are located within 200 m of a waterway. Numerous sites sit directly on riverbanks, with high risk of ocean leakage.

TI  - Integrating environmental and satellite data to estimate county-level cotton yield in Xinjiang Province
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely estimation of cotton yield over large areas is essential for precision agriculture, facilitating the operation of commodity markets and guiding agronomic management practices. Remote sensing (RS) and crop models are effective means to predict cotton yield in the field. The satellite vegetation indices (VIs) can describe crop yield variations over large areas but can't take the exact environmental impact into consideration. Climate variables (CVs), the result of the influence of spatial heterogeneity in large regions, can provide environmental information for better estimation of cotton yield. In this study, the most important VIs and CVs for estimating county-level cotton yield across Xinjiang Province were screened out. We found that the VIs of canopy structure and chlorophyll contents, and the CVs of moisture, were the most significant factors for cotton growth. For yield estimation, we utilized four approaches: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Due to its ability to capture temporal features over the long term, LSTM performed best, with an R-2 of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 150 kg/ha and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 8.67%; moreover, an additional 10% of the variance could be explained by adding CVs to the VIs. For the within-season yield estimation using LSTM, predictions made 2 months before harvest were the most accurate (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 220 kg/ha, rRMSE = 15.97%). Our study demonstrated the feasibility of yield estimation and early prediction at the county level over large cotton cultivation areas by integrating satellite and environmental data.

TI  - Remote mapping of leafy spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula,</i> L.) in Northwestern Colorado
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) has been introduced to the Yampa River in Northwestern Colorado for over 40 years and flood and runoff events transport leafy spurge propagules onto adjacent landscapes. The spread of leafy spurge beyond the river channels has yet to be mapped and recorded, and this research was conducted to map leafy spurge occurrence in the Yampa River Valley. Significant stakeholder mapping efforts took place in the summer of 2019-2021, leading to excellent spatial data on leafy spurge presence and absence along the main channel. In summer 2019, multispectral SPOT seven satellite imagery, stakeholder ground mapping efforts, and bright yellow-green leafy spurge bracts were used to interpret imagery, identify dense, unobscured patches of leafy spurge, and digitize them. Spectral signatures from training samples for leafy spurge and other land cover classes (generalized as "not leafy spurge") were then used to train a Random Forest machine learning classification. In the summer of 2021, generated classification maps were compared to multispectral satellite imagery and stakeholder ground mapped leafy spurge presence. Mismatches were identified, and 271 validation locations were identified, navigated to, and evaluated for leafy spurge presence. Leafy spurge training samples were classified with 96% accuracy. Correctly classified leafy spurge locations had higher leafy spurge coverage and lower overstory canopy than missed leafy spurge locations. Leafy spurge growing beneath shrub canopy or growing as individual plants along the riverbanks were more likely to be missed. A frequency analysis for other plant species found at validation locations determined that smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale L.), and willow (Salix sp.) were most frequently misclassified as leafy spurge. In conclusion, multispectral satellite imagery was useful at remote detection of leafy spurge in open areas with dense leafy spurge coverage, but more work must be done for identification of sparse and diffuse leafy spurge infestations.

TI  - Evaluation of time-series Sentinel-2 images for early estimation of rice yields in south-west of Iran
T2  - AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn the past three decades, remote sensing-based models for estimating crop yield have addressed critical problems of general food security, as the unavailability of grains such as rice creates serious worldwide food insecurity problems. The main purpose of this study was to compare the potential of time-series Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data to predict rice yield several weeks before harvest on a regional scale. Design/methodology/approachTo this end, the sum of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based models created the best agreement with actual yield data at the golden time window of six weeks before harvest when rice grains were in milky and mature growth stages. The application of nine other vegetation indicators was also investigated in the golden time window in comparison to NDVI. FindingsThe findings of this study demonstrate the viability of identifying locations with poor and superior performance in terms of production management approaches through a rapid and economical solution for early rice grain yield assessment. Results indicated that while some of those, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, were able to estimate rice yield with high accuracy, NDVI is still the best indicator to predict rice yield before harvest. However, experiments can be conducted in different regions in future studies to evaluate the generalizability of the approach. Originality/valueTo achieve this objective, the authors considered the following purposes: using Sentinel-2 time-series data, determining the appropriate growth stage for estimating rice yield and evaluating different vegetation indices for estimating rice yield.

TI  - Incentives, penalties, and rural air pollution: Evidence from satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - I test the role of economic incentives and command and control in reducing agricultural fires, a major source of air pollution in most rural regions across the world caused by burning crop residues after harvest. To tackle data shortage, I use high-resolution satellite data to construct a fine measure of agricultural fires as well as other geographic characteristics at 1 km x 1 km resolution for China. Using the staggered arrival of biomass power plants, which purchase crop residues as production inputs from nearby areas, as a shock to economic incentives, I find a more than 30% drop in agricultural fires in the vicinity of a plant after its opening relative to areas farther away. Such drop cannot be explained by structural transformation, migration, or enhanced regulation near the plant, and is consistent with an incentive-based explanation. I then examine the effectiveness of a command and control policy that bans agricultural fires within 15 km of airports. Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I find no evidence that such policy works.

TI  - Pixel-based yield mapping and prediction from Sentinel-2 using spectral indices and neural networks
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and predicting crop yield on a large scale is increasingly important for use cases such as policy-making, risk insurance and precision agriculture applications at farm and field scale. The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat allows for satellite-based crop yield mapping even in relatively small scaled agricultural settings such as found in Switzerland and other central European regions. In this study, five years (2017-2021) of cereal crop yield data from a combine harvester were used to model crop yield within-field, on a spatial scale corresponding to the Sentinel-2 pixel level. Three established methods from literature using (i-ii) spectral indices and (iii) raw satellite reflectance as well as (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen for analysis. Although the RNN approach did not outperform the other methods, it was more efficient because of the comparatively simple end-to-end training of the model, resulting in much less time spent on data cleaning and feature extraction needed for spectral index time series analysis. The RNN was also able to discriminate cloudy data by itself, reaching similar performance levels as if using pre-processed, cloud-free data. Modelling was performed on individual years, all years combined and on unseen years using leave-one-year-out crossvalidation. The models performed best when using data from all years (R2 up to 0.88, relative RMSE up to 10.49 %) and showed poor performance when predicting on unseen data years, especially for years with previously unknown weather patterns. This highlights the importance of yearly model calibration and the need for continuous data collection enabling long time series for future crop yield models.

TI  - River effects on sea-level rise in the Rio de la Plata estuary during the past century
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the causes for historical sea-level changes in coastal tide-gauge records is important for constraining oceanographic, geologic, and climatic processes. The Rio de la Plata estuary in South America features the longest tide-gauge records in the South Atlantic. Despite the relevance of these data for large-scale circulation and climate studies, the mechanisms underlying relative sea-level changes in this region during the past century have not been firmly established. I study annual data from tide gauges in the Rio de la Plata and stream gauges along the Rio Paran & aacute; and Rio Uruguay to establish relationships between river stream flow and sea level over 1931-2014. Regression analysis suggests that streamflow explains 59 % +/- 17 % of the total sea level variance at Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 28 % +/- 21 % at Montevideo, Uruguay (95 % confidence intervals). A longterm streamflow increase effected sea-level trends of 0.71 +/- 0.35 mm yr(-1) at Buenos Aires and 0.48 +/- 0.38 mm yr(-1) at Montevideo. More generally, sea level at Buenos Aires and Montevideo respectively rises by (7.3 +/- 1.8) x 10-6 m and (4.7 +/- 2.6)x10(-6) m per 1 m(3) s(-1) streamflow increase. These observational results are consistent with simple theories for the coastal sea-level response to streamflow forcing, suggesting a causal relationship between streamflow and sea level mediated by ocean dynamics. Findings advance understanding of local, regional, and global sea-level changes; clarify sea-level physics; inform future projections of coastal sea level and the interpretation of satellite data and proxy reconstructions; and highlight future research directions. Specifically, local and regional river effects should be accounted for in basin-scale and global mean sea-level budgets as well as reconstructions based on sparse tide-gauge records.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IntroductionThe EU Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 defines new rules for the certification and post-market surveillance of medical devices (MD), including an additional review by Expert Panels of clinical evaluation data for high-risk MD if reports and alerts suggest possibly associated increased risks. Within the EU-funded CORE-MD project, our aim was to develop a tool to support such process in which web-accessible safety notices (SN) are automatically retrieved and aggregated based on their specific MD categories and the European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN) classification by applying an Entity Resolution (ER) approach to enrich data integrating different sources. The performance of such approach was tested through a pilot study on the Italian data.MethodsInformation relevant to 7622 SN from 2009 to 2021 was retrieved from the Italian Ministry of Health website by Web scraping. For incomplete EMDN data (68%), the MD best match was searched within a list of about 1.5 M MD on the Italian market, using Natural Language Processing techniques and pairwise ER. The performance of this approach was tested on the 2440 SN (32%) already provided with the EMDN code as reference standard.ResultsThe implemented ER method was able to correctly assign the correct manufacturer to the MD in each SN in 99% of the cases. Moreover, the correct EMDN code at level 1 was assigned in 2382 SN (97.62%), at level 2 in 2366 SN (96.97%) and at level 3 in 2329 SN (95.45%).ConclusionThe proposed approach was able to cope with the incompleteness of the publicly available data in the SN. In this way, grouping of SN relevant to a specific MD category/group/type could be used as possible sentinel for increased rates in reported serious incidents in high-risk MD.

TI  - Latitudes and land use: Global biome shifts in vegetation persistence across three decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The dynamics of terrestrial vegetation are shifting globally due to environmental changes, with potential repercussions for the proper functioning of the Earth system. However, the response of global vegetation, and the variability of the responses to their changing environment, is highly variable. In addition, the study of such changes and the methods used to monitor them, have in of themselves, been found to significantly impact the findings.Methods: This research builds on a recently developed vegetation persistence metric, which is simple to use, is user-controlled to assess levels of statistical significance, and is readily reproducible, all designed to avoid these potential pitfalls. This study uses this vegetation persistence metric to present a global exploration of vegetation responses to climatic, latitudinal, and land-use changes at a biomes level across three decades (1982-2010) of seasonal vegetation activity via the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).Results: Results demonstrated that positive vegetation persistence was found to be greater in June, July, August (JJA), and September, October, November (SON), with an increasing vegetation persistence found in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) over the Southern Hemisphere (SH). While vegetation showed positive persistence overall, this was not constant across all studied biomes. Overall forested biomes along with mangroves showed positive responses towards enhanced vegetation persistence in both the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. Contrastingly, desert, xeric shrubs, and savannas exhibited no significant persistence patterns, but the grassland biomes showed more negative persistence patterns and much higher variability over seasons, compared to the other biomes. The main drivers of changes appear to relate to climate, with tropical biomes linking to the availability of seasonal moisture, whereas the northern hemisphere forested biomes are driven more by temperature. Grasslands respond to moisture also, with high precipitation seasonality driving the persistence patterns. Land-use change also affected biomes and their responses, with many biomes having been significantly impacted by humans such that the vegetation response matched land use and not biome type.Discussion: The use here of a novel statistical time series analysis of NDVI at a pixel level, and looking historically back in time, highlights the utility and power of such techniques within global change studies. Overall, the findings match greening trends of other research but within a finer scale both temporally and spatially which is a critical new development in understanding global vegetation shifts.

TI  - Conditional survival in patients with stage IB-IIIA melanoma undergoing sentinel node biopsy in Queensland: A longitudinal study
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tumour characteristics such as thickness and ulceration, along with sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, have been essential in predicting survival in patients with locally invasive melanomas at the time of diagnosis. It is unclear if these prognostic factors are relevant 1, 2 or 5 years after diagnosis.Objectives The key aim of this project was to analyse conditional survival in a cohort of Queensland patients with stage IB to IIIA melanomas (American Joint Committee on Cancer's staging system, 8th version) and to test the relevance of clinicopathological prognostic factors for melanoma outcome after varying intervals of survival time.Methods Patients with primary invasive cutaneous melanoma who were referred to a tertiary melanoma clinic and underwent SLN biopsy between 1994 and 2011 were ascertained. The effect of patient and tumour characteristics on melanoma survival were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models at diagnosis and at variable times after diagnosis.Results The final analysis included 651 patients (average age 49 years, 55.5% male) with stage IB to IIIA melanoma. At diagnosis, and after 1 and 2 years survived, SLN positivity, thickness and ulceration were predictive of 10-year survival since diagnosis. However, once patients survived 5 years, only SLN status was predictive. Overall conditional melanoma survival improved with increasing time survived. Five years after diagnosis, 10-year conditional melanoma survival (MSS) was 91% (95% CI 86%-95%) compared with 85% (82%-88%) predicted at diagnosis. The improvement in MSS was observed mainly for Stage II melanoma patients and not for those with a positive SLN biopsy.Conclusions This study confirms the improvement of prognosis according to time survived since diagnosis suggesting that after 5 years survival the classic prognostic indicators may not have the same influence.

T2  - PROCESS BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria play a critical role in immune system. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a tractable probiotic cell has emerged as a 'smart microbe' that can provide therapeutic modalities at the sites of disease. Additionally, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) represents one of the key probiotics in clinical studies with the ability to enhance intestinal immunity in symbiosis with other cells. To fully exploit the advantages of EcN and LGG, we optimized the commensal culture medium for LGG and EcN, succeeded by the establishment of a novel fluorescence-based colony quantification. From the metabolite analysis, more lactate was consumed when LGG is co-cultured with EcN; thus, YkgG was further explored as it was foreseen to be the enzyme responsible for lactate conversion to pyruvate. The YkgG enzyme from EcN has Vmax of 64.5 mM min-1 and catalytic ability kcat/Km of 2055 mM-1 min-1, that is 6-fold compared to E. coli MG1655. Co-culture strategy of EcN with LGG in the mimic gastrointestinal tract increased the CFU by 50 % and 40 % within 5 mins and 10 mins, respectively. This practical, feasible, and promising symbiosis system aims to accelerate the application of probiotic in healthy food industries.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and overflow risk analysis of the Salt Lake in the Hoh Xil Region using machine learning methods
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is inducing dramatic changes in fluvial geomorphology and reshaping the hydrological connections between rivers and lakes. The water level and area of the Salt Lake have increased rapidly since the outburst of the Zonag Lake in the Hoh Xil region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2011, threatening the downstream infrastructure. However, fewer studies have focused on its spatiotemporal variation and overflow risk over long time series. Here, we used three machine learning algorithms: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to extract the area of the Salt Lake for a long time series, analyzed its spatiotemporal variation from 1973 to 2021, and finally assessed the overflow risk. The Kappa coefficient (KAPPA) and the overall accuracy (OA) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results showed that Random Forest performs superior in lake extraction (KAPPA = 0.98, overall accuracy = 0.99), followed by Classification and Regression Trees and Support Vector Machine. normalized difference water index is the relatively important feature variable in both RF and CART. Before the outburst event, the area change of the Salt Lake was consistent with the variation in precipitation; after that, it showed a remarkable area increase (circa 350%) in all orientations, and the main direction was the southeast. Without the construction of the emergency drainage channel, the simulation result indicated that the earliest and latest times of the Salt Lake overflow event are predicted to occur in 2020 and 2031, respectively. The results of this paper not only demonstrate that RF is more suitable for water extraction and help understand the water system reorganization event.

TI  - Rapid and large changes in coastal wetland structure in China's four major river deltas
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide essential ecosystem goods and services but are extremely vulnerable to sea-level rise, extreme climate, and human activities, especially the coastal wetlands in large river deltas, which are regarded as "natural recorders" of changes in estuarine environments. In addition to the area (loss or gain) and quality (degradation or improvement) of coastal wetlands, the information on coastal wetland structure (e.g., patch size and number) are also major metrics for coastal restoration and biodiversity protection, but remain very limited in China's four major river deltas. In this study, we quantified the spatial-temporal dynamics of total area (TA) and patch number (PN) of coastal wetlands with different sizes in the four deltas and the protected areas (PAs) and assessed the effects of major driving factors during 1984-2020. We also investigated the effectiveness of PAs through the comparison of TA and PN of coastal wetlands before and after the years in which PAs were listed as Ramsar Sites. We found both TA and PN experienced substantial losses in the Liaohe River Delta and Yellow River Delta but recent recoveries in the Yangtze River Delta. The coastal wetlands had a relatively stable and variable trend in TA but had a continually increasing trend in PN in the Pearl River Delta. Furthermore, reduced coastal reclamation, ecological restoration projects, and rapid expansion of invasive plants had great impacts on the coastal wetland structure in various ways. We also found that PAs were effective in halting the decreasing trends in coastal wetland areas and slowing the expansion of reclamation, but the success of PAs is being counteracted by soaring exotic plant invasions. Our findings provide vital information for the government and the public to address increasing challenges of coastal restoration, management, and sustainability in large river deltas.

TI  - Hydrologic evaluation of the global precipitation measurement mission over the US: Flood peak discharge and duration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a great amount of research has been done towards evaluating precipitation data generated by satellites, but less has focused on how these estimates and their uncertainties manifest further into the water cycle. In this study, ten years of satellite-based and ground-based radar data are used as forcings for a distributed hydrologic model across the Continental United States. They are compared using a methodology designed to assess the flood signals and characteristics generated by the model. By focusing on how well the model reproduces flood characteristics rather than fits traditional bulk statistics, this research provides robust insights into satellite precipitation deficiencies. It is found that satellite data has greater success at resolving lower magnitude flood events while tending to generate floods of longer durations. Additionally, flood managers should note that satellites tend to generate floods that characteristically both begin earlier and end later than the ground radar reference. Subsequent research is recommended into other satellite data products in order to better understand these discrepancies and mitigate or plan for them in the future. Plain Language Summary: In recent years, satellites have been increasingly used to provide valuable insights on rainfall across the globe, especially in locations where radars are unable to be installed on the ground. By nature, however, the rainfall data provided by satellites has uncertainties. Large amounts of research has gone into the difference in accuracy between satellite radar and ground references, but less has focused on how these differences impact flood simulations, respectively. In this study it was found that the rainfall data from satellites tends to predict floods that are more severe (have higher magnitudes), last longer (have longer durations), and have different timings (start earlier and end later) than the reference. It is also found that satellites struggle with predictions involving extreme rainfall values. Further research is suggested to better understand these issues, as well as compare against other forms of satellite rainfall data.

TI  - Using buffer analysis to determine urban park cooling intensity: Five estimation methods for Nanjing, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks are part of the blue-green infrastructure of urban ecosystems. Although the cooling effect of urban parks has been widely recognized, the understanding of park cooling intensity (PCI) and its mechanisms remains incomplete. Applicable and accurate quantification could facilitate better design and management of urban parks. We used five methods (equal area method [EAM], equal radius method [ERM], fixed radius method [FRM], turning point method-maximum perspective [TPM-M], and turning point method-accumulation perspective [TPM-A]) to estimate PCI, and established the method selection mechanism, which we evaluated in terms of PCI amplitudes, spatial heterogeneity, and interactions with park landscape features. Using Nanjing as a case study, we employed spatial and statistical analyses to further assess the autocorrelation of PCI and its relationship with park landscape features. The results indicate the following: (1) 62.38 % of Nanjing's urban parks are located above the 90 % confidence level in cold spot areas. (2) Different methods had significant effects on the estimated PCI, were positively correlated, and had similar spatial heterogeneity. (3) All methods revealed that park area (PA), water area proportion (WAP), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the vegetated area (NDVIveg) were the three dominant factors that influenced PCI; WAP and NDVIveg that achieved more effective cooling. (4) The quantification of PCI using the ERM and TPM is recommended over other methods. These findings are essential for landscape planners to understand the formation of PCI and design cooler parks to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect more systematically.

TI  - Interaction of permafrost degradation and thermokarst lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of ice-rich permafrost can form thermokarst landforms such as thermokarst lakes. There are a large number of thermokarst lakes distributed in the ice-rich permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the effect of the spatial distribution of thermokarst lakes on permafrost degradation at a regional-scale in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not fully understood. Time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar is an established remotely-sensing tool to measure surface deformation in permafrost regions, and has been widely used in permafrost degradation investigation. In this study, we characterized spatial-temporal variations of surface deformation in the Beiluhe Basin in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with time series InSAR analysis, and extracted thermokarst lakes from Landset-8 images. Additionally, MODIS land surface temperature data and Stefan model were used to estimate the active layer thickness of permafrost in the basin. Results showed that the linear subsidence rate in the permafrost region within the basin generally exceeded 5 mm/yr, with a seasonal deformation amplitude of >10 mm, and the active layer thickness ranged from 2.1 m to 3.5 m. We found that permafrost degradation was concentrated in the areas with a high density of thermokarst lakes. Specifically, the density of thermokarst lakes was positively correlated with the linear subsidence rate and the seasonal deformation amplitude, and the larger active layer thickness clustered significantly in the area of thermokarst lakes. We also found that accelerated thermokarst collapse of the lake shore intensified the development of thermokarst lakes, and the lake expansion further aggravated the permafrost deformation. In addition, there is a strongly negative correlation (r = -0.78) between active layer thickness and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index in the basin, inferring that the degradation of permafrost may lead to the transformation from alpine meadow to alpine grassland and alpine desert.

TI  - A stronger advance of urban spring vegetation phenology narrows vegetation productivity difference between urban settings and natural environments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is posing dramatic effects on terrestrial vegetation dynamics. The links between vegetation phenology or vegetation activity (growth) and climate change have been widely reported, yet, less is known about the impacts of phenological shifts on vegetation growth. Urban settings characterized by urban heat island and CO2 dome are often used as ideal natural laboratories to understand how vegetation responds to global climate change. Here we assessed the impacts of phenology changes on vegetation growth in China using satellite phenology metrics and gross primary production (GPP) data from 2003 to 2018 and urban-natural contrast analysis. Compared with natural environments, phenological metrics (e.g., start/end of growing season (SOS/EOS), and the length of growing season (GSL), etc.) were observed to change more dramatically in urban environments. Furthermore, we found that GPP in both settings in-creased over time but with a higher increment in the urban environments, and the urban-natural vegetation produc-tivity gap had been diminishing at a rate of 16.9 +/- 6.76 g C m-2 y-1. The narrowing of the urban-natural GPP difference over time can be attributed to a more advanced SOS and extended GSL in urban settings than their natural counterparts, particularly SOS shift. These findings suggested that the distinct urban phenological shifts would become increasingly important in offsetting the loss of vegetation productivity induced by urbanization.

TI  - The Analysis of Fire Hotspot Distribution in Kalimantan and its Relationship With Enso Phases
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Kalimantan experiences fire hazards almost every year, which threaten the largest tropical forest in Southeast Asia. Climatic conditions, such as increasing surface temperature and decreasing rainfall, become important especially when El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs. Studies on fire are commonly conducted based on the climatic condition such as the dry or wet season, but those which focused on analysis of fire occurrences with the specific ENSO phases are still limited. This study aims to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, land surface temperature, and soil moisture and analyses the distribution of hotspots in Kalimantan from 2014 to 2020 during different ENSO phases. The data used are Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for hotspot analysis, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) for rainfall analysis, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) for surface temperature analysis and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) for soil moisture analysis. The methods used were descriptive and spatial analyses based on each ENSO phase, which were then combined to analyse the temporal and spatial distribution of fire, rainfall, LST and soil moisture. The temporal distribution shows a positive relationship between ENSO, rainfall, LST, soil moisture and hotspots with a confidence level of 90% in the dry months of August-October. Fire occurred in most parts of West and Central Kalimantan, associated with low elevation, organic soil types and agricultural peatland. The average trend of increasing hotspots is 17.4% in the El Nino phase and decreasing hotspots by 84.7% in the La Nina phase during August-October in Kalimantan.

TI  - The inversion modeling and aboveground biomass mapping of withered grass changes in the western grassland of Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground biomass (AGB) of withered grass is an important early-warning indicator for grassland fire risk. Most grassland fires occur during the dry-grass season. In order to improve the fire-warning efficiency of withered AGB, it is essential to rapidly acquire the amount of withered-grass biomass. Remote-sensing data has been widely used in monitoring and estimating grassland yields during the growing season. However, applying remote sensing to the estimation of withered grass is still in need of exploration. The aim of this work was to try to establish a remote-sensing estimation model for withered AGB in the dry-grass season. The estimation of aboveground biomass can effectively prevent the occurrence of fire, protect the environment, facilitate local management and reduce economic losses. Our approach was to, first, calculate a dry-grass index based on Sentinel-2 image data and using ENVI, SNAP, and ArcGIS software. Second, a model to estimate the fuel quantity during the dry-grass season was established by regression analysis combined with field-measured data. Finally, the estimation model was used to predict the amount of fuel in different months of the dry-grass season, followed by the fire-defense elements, which were quantified and mapped in the Longzhao Marsh wetlands. It was found that: 1) the two indices were significantly correlated (0.678) with the amount of fuel; 2) the established model could accurately estimate the amount of fuel in the study area during the dry season, and accurate test results demonstrated that the correlation between the estimated results of the best model and the measured values was 0.863, indicating high accuracy; 3) the spatiotemporal variation of withered grass in the study area was obviously different, and the quantities of fuel predicted for the other months were more accurate, which may reflect monthly dynamic changes in actual fuel quantities; and 4) the establishment of a remote-sensing estimation model for fuel quantity in the Longzhao Marsh during the dry-grass season could provide important parameters for fire-risk warning in the western grassland of Jilin Province and Northeast China.

TI  - Imprints of tropical cyclone on three-dimensional structural characteristics of mesoscale oceanic eddies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on the three-dimensional characteristics of mesoscale oceanic eddies is investigated in this study on the basis of statistical analysis by satellite-based eddy information and Argo data. By comparing the three-dimensional structure of the temperature, salinity, and geostrophic velocity in the upper ocean above 1,000 m depth, it was found that there is a heat pump effect in the changes of eddy structure similar to that in tropical cyclones. Under the forcing of TC, the abnormal signals in the strong cold core (warm core) structure originally existing in the upper layer of the cyclonic eddy (anticyclonic eddy) are transmitted to the middle and lower layers of the eddy and form retention, making the eddy structure not recover to the original state in a short period of time. To a certain extent, this shows that the influence of TC on the eddy structure is not limited to the ocean surface. At the same time, the change of barrier layer in the eddy is explored, and it was found that the barrier layer thickness in both cyclonic eddy and anticyclonic eddy has increased, which also confirms the previous research.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, earthquakes have occurred frequently on the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and the seismic hazard is high. However, because of the remote location of the Ganzi-Yushu fault zone, no high-resolution geodetic measurements of this region have been made. The radar line-of-sight deformation field of the Ganzi-Yushu fault was obtained using seven-track ascending and descending Sentinel-A/B interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from 2014 to 2020. Using the InSAR and published Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, we calculated the 3D deformation field in the study area, investigated the segment-specific fault slip rate, and inverted the fault slip distribution pattern using the steepest descent method. We then evaluated the seismic hazard using the strain rate field and slip deficit rate. The main findings of this study include the following. 1) The slip rate of the Ganzi-Yushu fault gradually increases from 2.5 to 6.8 mm/yr from northwest to southeast. 2) A high-resolution strain rate map shows high-value anomalies in the Yushu and Dangjiang areas. 3) Our comprehensive analysis suggests that the seismic hazard of the Dangjiang and Dengke segments with high slip deficits cannot be ignored.

TI  - Kinetically inert manganese (II)-based hybrid micellar complexes for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph node metastasis
T2  - REGENERATIVE BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The localization and differential diagnosis of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are particularly important for tumor staging, surgical planning and prognosis. In this work, kinetically inert manganese (II)-based hybrid micellar complexes (MnCs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were developed using an amphiphilic manganese-based chelate (C18-PhDTA-Mn) with reliable kinetic stability and self-assembled with a series of amphiphilic PEG-C18 polymers of different molecular weights (C18En, n = 10, 20, 50). Among them, the probes composed by 1:10 mass ratio of manganese chelate/C18En had slightly different hydrodynamic particle sizes with similar surface charges as well as considerable relaxivities (similar to 13 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.5 T). In vivo lymph node imaging in mice revealed that the MnC MnC-20 formed by C18E20 with C18-PhDTA-Mn at a hydrodynamic particle size of 5.5 nm had significant signal intensity brightening effect and shortened T-1 relaxation time. At an imaging probe dosage of 125 mu g Mn/kg, lymph nodes still had significant signal enhancement in 2 h, while there is no obvious signal intensity alteration in non-lymphoid regions. In 4T1 tumor metastatic mice model, SLNs showed less signal enhancement and smaller T-1 relaxation time variation at 30 min post-injection, when compared with normal lymph nodes. This was favorable to differentiate normal lymph nodes from SLN under a 3.0-T clinical MRI scanner. In conclusion, the strategy of developing manganese-based MR nanoprobes was useful in lymph node imaging.

TI  - <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-labeled amphiphilic polymer nanoparticles for PET imaging of sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - REGENERATIVE BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise diagnosis of lymph node metastasis is important for therapeutic regimen planning, prognosis analysis and probably better outcomes for cancer patients. In this work, Ga-68-labeled amphiphilic alternating copolymers nanoparticles with different rigid ligands were synthesized as positron emission tomography (PET) probes for lymph node metastasis imaging. The labeling efficiency and stability of nanoparticles was improved with increased rigidity of coordination unit. PU(Ga-68-L-MDI-PEG) nanoparticles (PU(Ga-68-L-MDI-PEG) NPs) with the strongest rigidity of coordination unit exhibited the lowest critical micelle concentration, the best Ga-68 labeling efficiency and stability. During in vivo lymph node metastasis imaging, PU(Ga-68-L-MDI-PEG) NPs led to different accumulations in normal lymph nodes (N-LN) and tumor metastasized sentinel lymph nodes (T-SLN), which resulted in different PET signal presentation, making it feasible to differentiate N-LN from T-SLN. In comparison, small molecule probe (GaL)-Ga-68 had poor lymph node accumulation, not only making it difficult to find lymph nodes on PET/computed tomography scan, but also tough to distinguish N-LN from metastatic ones. Overall, this work provides a reference for design of Ga-68 labeled polymeric nanoparticles with high chelation efficiency and stability, as sensitive PET probes for lymph node imaging.

TI  - Integrating spatial dependence into functional clustering of NDVI in the Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial dependence into environmental data is an influential criterion in clustering processes, as the resulting clustering outputs depend very much upon such spatial structure. As classical methods do not take spatial dependence in consideration, the inclusion of this structure produces unexpected but more realistic results and clusters of curves that may not be similar in shape or behavior. In this paper, clustering is made using the KMSCFD algorithm for spatially correlated functional data. The methodology was developed through weighting the distance matrix between the curves with the trace-variogram calculated with the coefficients of the basis functions resulting from a data smoothing operation. For the validation of the method, a number of simulated scenarios were tested together with an application to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data derived from a high elevation ecosystem in the Ecuadorian Andes. Quality indices are implemented to obtain the appropriate number of clusters. The analysis showed five different regions that were latitudinally distributed.

TI  - Estimating fractional vegetation cover and aboveground biomass for land degradation assessment in eastern Mongolia steppe: combining ground vegetation data and remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) are critically important for monitoring grassland degradation, and their accurate estimation can be used as key proxies for assessing land degradation. The main purpose of this study was to estimate the FVC and AGB in the eastern Mongolian steppe using remote sensing and machine learning. In this context, spectral bands and vegetation indices were extracted from the processed Sentinel-2 data and used as predictors. The field vegetation data were derived from the Mongolian pasture-monitoring database, which consisted of 256 plots with FVC and AGB measurements. Consequently, we derived FVC and AGB from Sentinel-2 imagery using 256 field vegetation measurements in the vast eastern Mongolian steppe as a reference for random forest (RF) models (R-2 (FVC) = 0.81, R-AGB(2) = 0.76). Among the variables, the predictor variables derived from spectral vegetation and soil indices, especially NDVI, Simple Ratio (SR), and OSAVI, were highly important for predicting FVC and AGB. As expected, a comparison among the map values showed that the spatial distribution of FVC and AGB was consistent with the landscapes and ecoregions in the study area. As the FVC and AGB maps only showed the current condition of vegetation cover, we also analysed NDVI trends to explain vegetation cover changes. We tested temporal trends in vegetation using Landsat NDVI time series data and the Mann-Kendall trend test. This revealed that in 7.3% of the area, the NDVI significantly increased, whereas a significant decrease was observed in 58% of the area.

AB  - Soil depth is one of the most critical factors which impact on culture productivity and makes difficult appropriate management decisions. However, assessing this parameter is also the most challenging tasks in the agronomic field. The objective of this work was to predict the spatial distribution of soil depth from space techniques (remote sensing, RS) and machine learning. A total of 292 sites were allocated (based on the toposequence approach) and drilled (0-2 m depth) at three different locations in Brazil. Based on these, in-situ traditional depth maps (denominated field-map) were elaborated for validation. Afterwards, we created a strategy to ach-ieve these different depths by RS (RS) approach. Landsat 8 OLI bands, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and emissivity in dry and rainy seasons as well as terrain at-tributes were applied to predict soil depth. For this purpose, the most important covariates were selected using Recursive Feature Selection (RFE) based on Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Afterwards, the application of RF and SVM by selected covariates were compared based on tenfold cross validation for each location. The best model was selected based on R2, RMSE and MAE, accuracy and bootstrapping approach and uncertainties. Terrain attributes were important to discriminate soil depth. Although, LST and NDVI also pre-sented important contribution to this task. Different seasons implies on water and plant dynamics in deep and shallow soils. This impacted on NDVI and LST as detected by RS. Thus, the method brings more variables to infer soil depth. The RF model performed better than SVM to predict soil depth with an average of 0.77 R2. The accuracy between a digital soil mapping and a field-map reached 0.58 to 0.81 indicating an important result considering the difficulty of the objective This may help pedologists and farmers as well as water and plants environmental monitoring.

TI  - From violent lone-actor types to lone-actor grievance-fueled violence: The Aarhus University shooting as an example of multi-facetted offender motivations and context-sensitive boundaries between violent lone-actor categories
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, western societies have experienced an increase in acts of mass violence carried out by lone actors. While this concept is mostly associated with lone-actor terrorists, it also involves the actions of other single perpetrators, e.g., school shooters, workplace attackers, rampage shooters, and some forms of incel violence. In this article, we argue in favor of moving away from such categorization of violent lone-actor types and toward the unifying concept of lone-actor grievance-fueled violence. We illustrate the analytical benefits gained from such a conceptual shift by analyzing the Danish Aarhus University Shooting in 1994, where a single offender killed two students. While this attack is widely accepted as the only Danish school shooting in history, we identify signs of an extremist misogynist worldview held by what we today would call incels. This case serves as an illustration of the blurred and context-sensitive boundaries between violent lone-actor types and how nuances in offender motivation can be lost when lone-actor attacks are classified within a typological framework. Rather than simply recasting the Aarhus University Shooting as an incel attack considering the recent development of this category, we argue for the need to embrace the conceptualization of lone-actor grievance-fueled violence, which points toward the common genesis of lone-actor violence and allows for multi-faceted offender motivations. Using the Aarhus University shooting as a steppingstone, we discuss the pitfalls of lone-actor violence typologies and the advantages of the unifying lone-actor grievance-fueled violence conceptualization for both academia and practice.

TI  - Air pollution and the onset of balance problems: The Canadian longitudinal study on aging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To understand the relationship between ambient air pollution and the onset of balance problems. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study.Methods: Baseline and 3-year follow-up data were used from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. The Comprehensive Cohort included adults aged 45-85 years old recruited from 11 sites across 7 provinces. Data on air pollution came from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium. Annual mean levels of ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide for each participant's postal code were estimated from satellite data. Balance was measured at both time points using the one-leg balance test with those who could not stand on one leg for at least 60 s defined as failing the balance test. Our outcome was the new development of failing the balance test at follow-up in those who passed the balance test at baseline. Logistic regression was used. Results: Of the 12,158 people who could stand for 60 s on one leg at baseline, 18% were unable to do so 3 years later. In single pollutant models, living in an area with higher ozone levels was associated with the 3-year onset of balance problems (odds ratio (OR) = 1.13 per interquartile range of ozone, 95% CI 1.02, 1.24) after adjust-ment for demographic, lifestyle, and health variables. In a multipollutant model, the association with ozone increased slightly (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.04, 1.30). There were no associations with PM2.5 or sulfur dioxide.Conclusion: Our findings provide longitudinal evidence that higher ozone levels are associated with the odds of developing balance problems over a 3-year period. Further work should attempt to confirm our findings and explore the potential mechanism of action.

TI  - Strengthening Social Compact and Innovative Health Sector Collaborations in Addressing COVID-19 in South African Workplaces
T2  - NEW SOLUTIONS-A JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Workplaces are nodes for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission and require strategies to protect workers' health. This article reports on the South African national coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) strategy that sought to ensure workers' health, protect the economic activity, safeguard livelihoods and support health services. Data from the Occupational Health Surveillance System, Surveillance System of Sentinel Hospital Sites, and government databases (public sector health worker and Compensation Fund data) was supplemented by peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. A multipronged, multi-stakeholder response to occupational health and safety (OHS) policy development, risk management, health surveillance, information, and training was adopted, underpinned by scientific input, through collaboration between government, organized labour, employer bodies, academia, and community partners. This resulted in government-promulgated legislation addressing OHS, sectoral guidelines, and work-related COVID-19 worker's compensation. The OHS Workstream of the National Department of Health provided leadership and technical support for COVID-specific workplace guidelines and practices, surveillance, information, and training, as well as a workplace-based vaccination strategy.

TI  - A data-driven approach to flag land-affected signals in satellite derived water quality from small lakes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-affected signal in remotely sensed radiance from nearshore waters is a common problem for remote sensing, introducing uncertainty in atmospheric correction and subsequent water quality constituent concentration estimates. This study proposes a new method for identifying effects of land on satellite remote sensing of water quality. The new optical water types (OWT) containing the land-affected signal were derived from POLYMER-corrected imagery of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer in reduced resolution (MERIS RR) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). These were then applied, as part of a larger set of existing OWTs corresponding to the variability observed in natural waters, to satellite images. The ability to identify pixels containing both water and land, and those contaminated with radiance from adjacent land, was evaluated. Our test sites include dark lakes of varying size in Sweden (Lakes Rusken, Bolmen, Ringsjo center dot n, and Ivo center dot sjo center dot n) where the classification showed high sensitivity to land near the lake shore. The land-affected signal is shown to lead to underestimations of chlorophyll-a concentration and Forel-Ule colour indices, and overestimations of turbidity in these lakes, which can be corrected after masking out the land-affected pixels. The land-affected signal is strongest in summer, both NDVI and sun zenith angle covaried with the seasonal variation of land-affected signal. Further, the results confirmed that satellite images with coarser spatial resolution are more prone to land-affected signal compared to images with finer spatial resolution, for small inland water bodies. We propose a data-driven approach for water quality processing with 'land-affected water types' as an effective way to improve the lake optical water quality monitoring from water colour sensors.

TI  - Evaluating the Potentials of PLSR and SVR Models for Soil Properties Prediction Using Field Imaging, Laboratory VNIR Spectroscopy and Their Combination
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pedo-spectroscopy has the potential to provide valuable information about soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Nowadays, wemay predict soil properties usingVNIRfield imaging spectra (IS) such as Prisma satellite data or laboratory spectra (LS). The primary goal of this study is to investigate machine learning models namely Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for the prediction of several soil properties, including clay, sand, silt, organic matter, nitrate NO3-, and calcium carbonate CaCO3, using five VNIR spectra dataset combinations (% IS, % LS) as follows: C1 (0% IS, 100% LS), C2 (20% IS, 80% LS), C3 (50% IS, 50% LS), C4 (80% IS, 20% LS) and C5 (100% IS, 0% LS). Soil samples were collected at bare soils and at the upper (0-30 cm) layer. The data set has been split into a training dataset 80% of the collected data (n= 248) and a validation dataset 20% of the collected data (n= 61). The proposed PLSR and SVR models were trained then tested for each dataset combination. According to our results, SVR outperforms PLSR for both: C1 (0% IS, 100% LS) and C5 (100% IS, 0% LS). For Soil Organic Matter (SOM) prediction, it achieves (R-2 = 0.79%, RMSE= 1.42%) and (R-2 = 0.76%, RMSE= 1.3%), respectively. The data fusion has improved the soil property prediction. The highest improvement was obtained for the SOM property (R-2 = 0.80%, RMSE= 1.39) when using the SVR model and applying the second Combination C2 (20% of IS and 80% LS).

TI  - Calibration and Validation from Ground to Airborne and Satellite Level: Joint Application of Time-Synchronous Field Spectroscopy, Drone, Aircraft and Sentinel-2 Imaging
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-invasive investigation of surfaces from drones and manned aircrafts used as camera platforms is a well-established remote-sensing practice. However, cross-comparison of multispectral reflectance from different camera systems across different platforms, locations, and times can be challenging. We investigate reflectance retrieved from Sentinel-2 and two airborne camera systems with respect to the mobile, radiometrically calibrated, two-channel hemispherical-conical field-spectrometer system RoX. This spectrometer system serves in combination with a nine-panel grey scale as ground reference and transfer instrument. In the first step, the ground reference was validated against Sentinel-2 reflectance including atmospheric compensation. Our results suggest significant differences in the uncorrected reflectance from the two airborne sensors with respect to instantaneous calibration across 22 mixed targets. In the second step, those differences were reduced to a median discrepancy below 10% using the proposed in-field empirical line correction method (ELC). Continuous irradiance correction further improved the agreement across the validation targets and achieved a coherent reflectance dataset from all four different sensor systems, from the satellite level to the ground and airborne level, considering the limitations of instrument and in-field handling. NDVI maps created from drone and manned aircraft achieved an agreement around 89% and 95% compared to the satellite after calibration and correction. We consider in-field calibration with additional, continuous down-welling radiance correction of reflectance promising to support fusion of information across four sensors and platforms. Thus, field-spectrometer systems serve as transfer instruments and bridge the gap of information from the satellite down to the ground and airborne scale in future airborne mapping and classification efforts.

TI  - Separation and attribution of impacts of changes in land use and climate on hydrological processes
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aims to assess, compare, and attribute the effects due to separate and combined land use/land cover (LULC) and climate changes on hydrological processes in a tropical catchment. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is set up and calibrated for a small contributing sub-basin of the Tana River Basin (TRB) in Kenya. The model is then applied to simulate the hydrological components (i.e., streamflow (FLOW), evapotranspiration (ET), soil water (SW), and water yield (WYLD)) for different combinations of LULC and climate scenarios. Land use data generated from Land Satellite 5 Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5TM) images for two different periods (1987 and 2011) and satellite-based precipitation data from the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) dataset are utilized as inputs to the SWAT model. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), percent bias (PBIAS), and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation (RSR) for daily streamflow were 0.73, 0.76, 3.16%, and 0.51 in calibration period, respectively, and 0.45, 0.54, 12.53%, and 0.79 in validation period, respectively, suggesting that the model performed relatively good. An analysis of the LULC data for the catchment showed that there was an increase in agricultural, grassland, and forested land with a concomitant decrease in woodland and shrubland. Simulation results revealed that change in climate had a more significant effect on the simulated parameters than the change in LULC. It is shown that changes in LULC only had very minor effects in the simulated parameters. The monthly mean FLOW and WYLD decreased by 0.02% and 0.11%, respectively, while ET and SW increased by a monthly mean of 0.2% and 2.2%. Varying the catchment climate and holding the land use constant reduced FLOW, ET, SW, and WYLD by an average monthly mean of 43.2%, 21%, 13%, and 70%, respectively, indicating that climate changes have more significant effects on the catchment hydrological processes than changes in LULC. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate and identify the isolated and combined effects of LULC and climatic changes when assessing impacts on the TRB's hydrological processes.

TI  - Beyond presence mapping: predicting fractional cover of non-native vegetation in Sentinel-2 imagery using an ensemble of MaxEnt models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Non-native species maps are important tools for understanding and managing biological invasions. We demonstrate a novel approach to extend presence modeling to map fractional cover (FC) of non-native yellow sweet clover Melilotus officinalis in the Northern Great Plains, USA. We used ensembles of MaxEnt models to map FC across landscapes from satellite imagery trained from regional aerial imagery that was trained by local unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Clover cover from field surveys and classified UAV imagery were nearly identical (n = 22, R-2 = 0.99). Two classified UAV images provided training data to map clover presence with MaxEnt and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery. We binned cover predictions from NAIP imagery within each Sentinel-2 pixel into eight cover classes to create pure (100%) and FC (20%-95%) training data and modeled each class separately using MaxEnt and Sentinel-2 imagery. We mapped pure clover with one classification threshold and compared its performance to 15 candidate maps that included FC predictions outside pure predictions. Each FC map represented alternative combinations of five MaxEnt thresholds and three approaches to assign cover to pixels with multiple predictions from the FC ensemble. Evaluations of performance with independent datasets revealed maps including FC corresponded to field (n = 32, R-2 range: 0.39-0.68) and UAV (n = 20, R-2 range: 0.61-0.84) data better than pure clover maps (R-2 = 0.15 and 0.31, respectively). Overall, the pure clover map predicted 3.2% cover, whereas the three best performing FC maps predicted 6.6%-8.0% cover. Including FC predictions increased accuracy and cover predictions which can improve ecological understanding of invasions. Our method allows efficient FC mapping for vegetative species discernible in UAV imagery and may be especially useful for mapping rare, irruptive or patchily distributed species with poor representation in field data, which challenges landscape-level mapping.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring by downscaling of remote sensing products using LST/VI space derived from MODIS products
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39% and rESA-CC I(2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014)=2.23%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014)=2.59%).

TI  - Mapping dinoflagellate blooms<i> (Noctiluca</i> and<i> Alexandrium)</i> in aquaculture production areas in the NW Iberian Peninsula with the Sentinel-2/3 satellites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Galician Rias (northwestern Spain) are periodically affected by harmful algal blooms (HABs), mostly dinoflagel-lates, which pose a challenge to aquaculture activities due to the accumulation of biotoxins in shellfish. Typically, red-dish blooms in the Rias are associated with non-toxic species like Noctiluca scintillans, with a few exceptions such as Alexandrium minutum, a producer of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST). Here, a useful approach is presented for monitor-ing reddish blooms through satellite imagery based on three case studies, two of them belonged to monospecific blooms of red Noctiluca scintillans, and the third to a bloom of Alexandrium spp. dominated by A. tamarense. In every case, a propulsive index was evaluated using Sentinel-2A/B satellites, which provide high spatial and spectral resolu-tions, combined with adequate atmospheric and sunglint correction by using the ACOLITE and C2RCC processors. This approach offers a simple and feasible method to accurately and timely map blooms of red N. scintillans and Alexandrium spp. in the study area, useful to detect the distribution of reddish blooms with synoptic observations for monitoring and aquaculture management purposes. Conversely, Sentinel-3A/B satellites with a relatively coarser spatial resolution, lacking adequate visualization and mapping of the extent of small blooms, did not accurately detect bloom footprints in the coastal bay region, although this sensor displays a set of suitable multispectral bands.

TI  - Soil-vegetation moisture capacitor maintains dry season vegetation productivity over India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - India receives more than 70% of its annual rainfall in the summer monsoon from June to September. The rainfall is scanty and scattered for the rest of the year. Combining satellite data and model simulations, we show that the soil-vegetation continuum works as a natural capacitor of water, storing the monsoon pulse and releasing the moisture to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration over approximately 135 days when the moisture supply from precipitation is less than the evapotranspiration losses. The total Gross Primary Productivity of vegetation in India during the capacitor period accounts for almost 35% of the total annual GPP value. It primarily depends on the soil moisture at the beginning of the period, a measure of moisture capacitance of soil, with a correlation of 0.6. Given that India is the second largest contributor to recent global greening, its soil-vegetation water capacitance plays a significant role in the global carbon balance.

TI  - Malformation in coccolithophores in low pH waters: evidences from the eastern Arabian Sea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic calcifying plankton such as coccolithophores is expected to exhibit sensitivity to climate change stressors such as warming and acidification. Observational studies on coccolithophore communities along with carbonate chemistry provide important perceptions of possible adaptations of these organisms to ocean acidification. However, this phytoplankton group remains one of the least studied in the northern Indian Ocean. In 2017, the biogeochemistry group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-National Institute of Oceanography (CSIR-NIO) initiated a coccolithophore monitoring study in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). Here, we document for the first time a detailed spatial and seasonal distribution of coccolithophores and their controlling factors from the EAS, which is a well-known source of CO2 to the atmosphere. To infer the seasonality, data collected at three transects (Goa, Mangalore, and Kochi) during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) of 2018 was compared with that of the late SWM of 2017. Apart from this, the abundance of coccolithophores was studied at the Candolim Time Series (CaTS) transect, off Goa during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM). The most abundant coccolithophore species found in the study region was Gephyrocapsa oceanica. A high abundance of G. oceanica (1800 x 10(3)cells L-1) was observed at the Mangalore transect during the late SWM despite experiencing low pH and can be linked to nitrogen availability. The high abundance of G. oceanica at Mangalore was associated with high dimethylsulphide (DMS). Particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and scattering coefficient retrieved from satellites also indicated a high abundance of coccolithophores off Mangalore during the late SWM of 2017. Interestingly, G. oceanica showed malformation during the late SWM in low pH waters. Malformation in coccolithophores could have a far-reaching impact on the settling fluxes of organic matter and also on the emissions of climatically important gases such as DMS and CO2, thus influencing atmospheric chemistry. The satellite data for PIC in the EAS indicates a high abundance of coccolithophore in recent years, especially during the warm El Nino years (2015 and 2018). This warrants the need for a better assessment of the fate of coccolithophores in high-CO2 and warmer oceans.

TI  - Out of Ruins: Contextualizing an Ancient Egyptian Spectacle of Architectural Reuse
T2  - CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Architectural reuse was common in ancient Egypt. Modern interpretations of this practice, particularly in royal contexts, usually ascribe it either a practical or ideological function, only rarely considering it possible that different motivations were involved. This type of approach is particularly true for the reuse of Old Kingdom blocks by the Middle Kingdom king Amenemhat I in his pyramid at Lisht, a case often classified as solely utilitarian. However, an approach that prioritizes not only the ancient Egyptian worldview and royal ideology, but also how this case of reuse fits into cross-cultural considerations of monumentality, demonstrates the necessity to look at this practice more holistically. This study focuses in particular on the possibility that the transportation of reused materials by Amenemhat I was a spectacle of construction used to showcase the king's legitimacy and authority at the start of a new dynasty.

TI  - Finding the sentinel lymph node in early cervical cancer: When is unusual not uncommon?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To report our institutional experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using indocyanine green for cervical cancer, in terms of detection rates, detection of SLN at unusual locations, and factors associated with unusual SLN locations. In addition, we performed a systematic review of the literature to identify factors associated with unusual SLN localizations.Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of women with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping between 2015 and 2019. Outcome measures were SLN detection rates, detection rates of unusual locations for SLN and risk factors for aberrant lymphatic drainage pathways. In addition, studies evaluating factors associated with unusual SLN locations in cervical cancer were assessed in a systematic review.Results. A total of 100 patients were included. The unilateral SLN detection rate was 88%, whereas the bilateral detection rate was 75%. In 37% of all patients, SLN were found in unusual locations, and in 10% of patients SLN were solely found in unusual locations. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with finding SLN in unusual locations, with unusual nodes detected in 52% of patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 and in 28% of patients with BMI >= 25 kg/m2. The systematic review identified three studies, identifying lower BMI, nulliparity and tumor size of >20 mm as factors associated with finding SLN at unusual locations.Conclusion. Aberrant drainage sites represent a significant proportion of SLN detected in cervical cancer. Factors associated with increased rates of unusual nodal locations are a lower BMI, with a possible association with nulliparity and tumor size of >20 mm.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Graph learning and denoising-based weighted sparse unmixing for hyperspectral images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse unmixing is a semisupervised unmixing method based on the linear mixture model, in which the spectral library is known a prior, and has received considerable attention recently. It has been confirmed that the spatial information in hyperspectral images plays a crucial role in improving the performance of sparse unmixing algorithms. However, the spatial information extracted or captured in most unmixing algorithms is inaccurate and robust enough, which leads to artificial block noise or outliers in the estimated abundance maps, especially as the noise level increases. To address these problems and more efficiently utilize the spatial information, this paper proposes a graph learning and denoising-based weighted sparse mixing (GLDWSU) algorithm, which includes three stages in the unmixing procedure: graph learning, denoising and unmixing. In the first stage, the graph Laplacian matrix is adaptively learned to capture the spatial structure of HSI with the relative total variation (RTV) regularization. In the next stage, HSI is denoised with the learned Laplacian matrix by using Laplacian smoothing. In the final stage, the denoised HSI is unmixed with the reweighted-norm regularization based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. The experimental results on both simulated and real data sets show that the proposed GLDWSU algorithm can more accurately capture and utilize the spatial structure information of HSI with a low computational cost and outperforms all the compared methods.

TI  - Countering the Fiction of Neutrality: Pushing for Transparency?
T2  - OXFORD JOURNAL OF LAW AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scholars accept that the principle of neutrality is to a large extent a fictional concept. They often propose different variations that would better realize its prescribed aim of equality. In this contribution, we argue that state agents in general, and judges in particular, cannot be 'neutral' as they are not abstract entities. They do not enter the judiciary with a clean slate but as persons subjected to a myriad of formative experiences, connected to their worldview, gender, nationality, socio-economic background, and so on. Thus, the fiction of neutrality of the State is inevitably linked with a lack of transparency: not showing religious, atheist, or agnostic as well as political convictions is not the same as not having them. An alternative model would be to emphasize transparency, but simultaneously strive for diversity of different convictions represented on the Bench. Such a system would prompt self-conscious reflection on the role of worldviews in the judging process. It would, however, create new dilemmas as it would be impossible to reach an adequate equilibrium and thus undermine the confidence in the judiciary.

TI  - Estimation of biomass burning emission of NO<sub>2 </sub>and CO from 2019-2020 Australia fires based on satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The bushfires that occurred in Australia in late 2019 and early 2020 were unprecedented in terms of their scale, intensity, and impacts. Using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) data measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), together with fire counts and fire radiative power (FRP) from MODIS, we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of NO2 and CO column densities over three selected areas covering savanna and temperate forest vegetation. The delta NO2/delta CO emission ratio and emission factor were also estimated. The delta NO2/delta CO emission ratio was found to be 1.57 +/- 1.71 for temperate forest fire and ranged from 2.0 +/- 2.36 to 2.6 +/- 1.92 for savanna fire. For savanna and temperate forest fires, satellite-derived NOx emission factors were found to be 1.48 and 2.39 gkg(-1), respectively, whereas the CO emission factors are 107.39 and 126.32 gkg(-1), respectively. This study demonstrates that the large-scale emission ratio from the TROPOMI satellite for different biomass burnings can help identify the relative contribution of smoldering and flaming activities in a large region and their impacts on the regional atmospheric composition and air quality. This method can be applied to study the emissions from other large fires, or even the burning of fossil fuel in megacities, and their impact on air quality.

TI  - Estimating canopy height change using machine learning by coupling WorldView-2 stereo imagery with Landsat-7 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height change (CHC) is one of the key characteristics of forest dynamics, associated with the fluctuations in forest above-ground biomass and carbon stocks. Field measurements and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds can be used to detect CHC; however, they have limited availability in space and time, making it challenging to map CHC over large areas. Alternatively, very high-resolution (VHR) satellite stereo imagery plays an increasingly vital role in estimating fine-scaled digital surface models (DSMs) across landscapes. However, its capability and potential to estimate canopy height model (CHM) and CHC has not been widely explored. Using ALS-derived CHM in 2011 and 2015 and the four-year CHC as references, we evaluated stereo-based CHM and CHC from WorldView-2 over five woody parks in Columbus, Ohio, USA. We also integrated stereo-based CHM with vegetation indices from Landsat 7 to improve CHM and CHC estimation with machine learning methods. Our results showed that VHR stereo imagery captured similar spatial patterns of CHM with ALS data but significantly overestimated CHM. Moreover, the ALS-derived CHC ranged from 1.6 +/- 1.9 m (mean +/- standard deviation) to 3.1 +/- 1.2 m, as compared to from -1.3 +/- 0.7 m to 1.1 +/- 1.7 m for stereo-based CHC, indicating the limitation of CHC estimation by stereo imagery alone. Among six widely used machine learning methods, Gradient Boosting Regression method provided the most reliable estimates of CHM, with a correlation coefficient R of 0.64 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.1 m (11.1%). Stereo-based CHM and vegetation indices explained more than 70% of CHM variability, substantially improving the estimation of 4-year CHC. Our results suggested that VHR stereo imagery alone has limitations in estimating CHM and CHC. The combination of remote-sensing structural (stereo-based CHM) and spectral (vegetation indices) information improves the CHM and CHC estimations.

TI  - Carbon uptake in Eurasian boreal forests dominates the high-latitude net ecosystem carbon budget
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic-boreal landscapes are experiencing profound warming, along with changes in ecosystem moisture status and disturbance from fire. This region is of global importance in terms of carbon feedbacks to climate, yet the sign (sink or source) and magnitude of the Arctic-boreal carbon budget within recent years remains highly uncertain. Here, we provide new estimates of recent (2003-2015) vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco), net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE; R-eco - GPP), and terrestrial methane (CH4) emissions for the Arctic-boreal zone using a satellite data-driven process-model for northern ecosystems (TCFM-Arctic), calibrated and evaluated using measurements from >60 tower eddy covariance (EC) sites. We used TCFM-Arctic to obtain daily 1-km(2) flux estimates and annual carbon budgets for the pan-Arctic-boreal region. Across the domain, the model indicated an overall average NEE sink of -850 Tg CO2-C year(-1). Eurasian boreal zones, especially those in Siberia, contributed to a majority of the net sink. In contrast, the tundra biome was relatively carbon neutral (ranging from small sink to source). Regional CH4 emissions from tundra and boreal wetlands (not accounting for aquatic CH4) were estimated at 35 Tg CH4-C year(-1). Accounting for additional emissions from open water aquatic bodies and from fire, using available estimates from the literature, reduced the total regional NEE sink by 21% and shifted many far northern tundra landscapes, and some boreal forests, to a net carbon source. This assessment, based on in situ observations and models, improves our understanding of the high-latitude carbon status and also indicates a continued need for integrated site-to-regional assessments to monitor the vulnerability of these ecosystems to climate change.

T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Our understandings of the effects of war on land and resource access following armed conflicts are often shaped (and limited) by a reliance upon remotely sensed data. Here, we analyze household-level survey and community-level focus group data collected in Sri Lanka following the end of the nation's ethno-religiously rooted civil war (1983-2009) to determine if and how the war differently affected the nation's rice farmers. Our synthetic analyses revealed geographic variation in agricultural livelihood viability in post-war Sri Lanka, demonstrating how the protracted effects of war are exacerbating the vulnerability of rural Sri Lanka's ethno-religious minority (Tamil and Moor) populations by (re-)shaping access to critical natural resources, including both land and irrigation water.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation in response to climate variability in the Borana rangelands of southern Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation and its association with climate variables in the Borana rangelands of southern Ethiopia. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, namely, MODIS/TERRA, MOD09Q1 16-day L3 Global 250 m Version 6 from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) United States Geological Survey (USGS), and climate data from 2000 to 2018 obtained from the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia are used to determine the vegetation dynamics both at annual and seasonal timescales. The results indicate that the NDVI varies between .31 and .41, and the study area is dominated by sparse vegetation, especially shrubs and grasslands. The Borana rangelands were previously dominated by open grasslands, perennial herbaceous and woody vegetations, and some encroaching woody vegetations. The NDVI revealed poorer vegetation growth than the vegetation condition index (VCI) between 2000 and 2018, although variations were observed spatiotemporally. Rainfall was more highly variable both at annual and seasonal scales than the temperature during the studied years. The climate variables significantly determined the condition of vegetation, particularly during the growing seasons compared to other periods. A significant strong positive correlation was observed between the NDVI, VCI, and climate variables during the main (Belg) and short (Meher) rainy seasons in the Borana rangelands. The results of this study are beneficial for the development of proper intervention policies and provide information for sustainable rangeland management.

TI  - Coarse-graining research of the thermal infrared anomalies before earthquakes in the Sichuan area on Google Earth engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seismo-induced Thermal infrared (TIR) anomalies has been proposed as a significant precursor of earthquakes. Several methods have been proposed to detect Thermal infrared anomalies that may be associated with earthquakes. However, there is no comparison of the influence for Thermal infrared extraction methods with a long time statistical analysis. To quantify the effects of various techniques used in Thermal infrared anomaly extraction, in this paper, we offer a complete workflow of their comparative impacts. This study was divided into three parts: anomaly detection, statistical analysis, and tectonic factor research. For anomaly detection, daily continuous nighttime surface temperature (ConLST) data was obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and each different anomaly detection method was used to detect Thermal infrared outliers in the Sichuan region (27 & DEG;-37 & DEG;N, 97 & DEG;-107 & DEG;E). During statistical analysis, The heated core model was applied to explore Thermal infrared anomalies which is to filter anomalies unrelated to earthquakes by setting time-space-intensity conditions. The 3D error diagram offers scores to assume the best parameter set using training-test-validation steps. In the final part, we considered information on stresses, active faults, and seismic zones to determine the optimal parameters for extracting the Thermal infrared anomalies. The Kalman filter method detected the highest seismic anomaly frequency without considerating the heating core condition. The Autoencoder and Isolation Forest methods obtain the optimal alert type and parameter set to determine if the anomaly is likely earthquake-related. The RST method performs optimally in the final part of the workflow when it considers physical factors such as active faults, seismic zones, and stresses. However, The six methods we have chosen are not sufficient to contain the entire Thermal infrared anomaly extraction. The consideration of tectonic factors in the research remains poorly developed, as statistical methods were not employed to explore the role of constructive factors. Nevertheless, it is a significant factor in comparing anomaly extraction methods and precursor studies.

TI  - National high-resolution cropland classification of Japan with agricultural census information and multi-temporal multi-modality datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-modality datasets offer advantages for processing frameworks with complementary information, partic-ularly for large-scale cropland mapping. Extensive training datasets are required to train machine learning algorithms, which can be challenging to obtain. To alleviate the limitations, we extract the training samples from the agricultural census information. We focus on Japan and demonstrate how agricultural census data in 2015 can map different crop types for the entire country. Due to the lack of Sentinel-2 datasets in 2015, this study utilized Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 collected across Japan and combined observations into composites for different prefecture periods (monthly, bimonthly, seasonal). Recent deep learning techniques have been investigated the performance of the samples from agricultural census information. Finally, we obtain nine crop types on a countrywide scale (around 31 million parcels) and compare our results to those obtained from agricultural census testing samples as well as those obtained from recent land cover products in Japan. The generated map accurately represents the distribution of crop types across Japan and achieves an overall accuracy of 87% for nine classes in 47 prefectures. Our findings highlight the importance of using multi -modality data with agricultural census information to evaluate agricultural productivity in Japan.

TI  - Assimilation of FY-4A GIIRS radiance observations in the forecast of Typhoon Bavi
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We assimilated radiance observations from the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FengYun-4A geostationary satellite to evaluate their impact on the forecast of Typhoon Bavi using WRFDA. The temperature channels with high information content, representing 90% of the information content of all temperature channels, were selected for assimilation. All radiance observations above the cloud-top were assimilated by comparing the channel height to the cloud-top height coming from the product of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI). The assimilation of the GIIRS observations decreased the root-mean-square error of the temperature by 2% and improved the precipitation forecast. The rain band in southeast China was reproduced well, thus showing that infrared hyperspectral radiance observations have added value in improving the circulation around typhoons and, therefore, provide better forecasts. The increased relative humidity in the upper layer and stronger typhoon outflow were found to related to the intensify of typhoon in the analysis compared with the control experiment.

T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty years of daily MODIS-Aqua ocean color observations (2002-2022) are used to identify periodic variability of near-surface chlorophyll (Chl a) in the Indonesian seas. The frequency spectrum of Chl a is dominated by the mean and low-frequency monsoonal variability; however, a prominent peak around the fortnightly tidal period, MSf, is present. Harmonic analysis is used to quantify and map the fortnightly Chl a signal, which is discovered to be significant along the continental shelves of NW Australia and at several sites associated with narrow passages between the Lesser Sunda Islands, within the Sulu Archipelago, and at a few other sites in the Philippines Archipelago. Fortnightly variability at the shallow coastal sites is attributed to the spring-neap cycle of barotropic ocean currents, while we hypothesize that the variability in deeper water near the island passages is due to the modulation of vertical nutrient fluxes by baroclinic tidal mixing. The results document the significance of tidal mixing and highlight the heterogeneous character of biophysical processes within the Indonesian seas.

TI  - GWL_FCS30: a global 30 m wetland map with a fine classificationsystem using multi-sourced and time-series remote sensing imagery in 2020
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands, often called the "kidneys of the earth ", play an important role in maintaining ecological balance, conserving water resources, replenishing groundwater and controlling soil erosion. Wetland mapping is very challenging because of its complicated temporal dynamics and large spatial and spectral heterogeneity. An accurate global 30 m wetland dataset that can simultaneously cover inland and coastal zones is lacking. This study proposes a novel method for wetland mapping by combining an automatic sample extraction method, existing multi-sourced products, satellite time-series images and a stratified classification strategy. This approach allowed for the generation of the first global 30 m wetland map with a fine classification system (GWL_FCS30), including five inland wetland sub-categories (permanent water, swamp, marsh, flooded flat and saline) and three coastal tidal wetland sub-categories (mangrove, salt marsh and tidal flats), which was developed using Google Earth Engine platform. We first combined existing multi-sourced global wetland products, expert knowledge, training sample refinement rules and visual interpretation to generate large and geographically distributed wetland training samples. Second, we integrated the Landsat reflectance time-series products and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to generate various water-level and phenological information to capture the complicated temporal dynamics and spectral heterogeneity of wetlands. Third, we applied a stratified classification strategy and the local adaptive random forest classification models to produce the wetland dataset with a fine classification system at each 5 degrees x5 degrees geographical tile in 2020. Lastly, GWL_FCS30, mosaicked by 961 5 degrees x5 degrees regional wetland maps, was validated using 25 708 validation samples, which achieved an overall accuracy of 86.44 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.822. The cross-comparisons with other global wetland products demonstrated that the GWL_FCS30 dataset performed better in capturing the spatial patterns of wetlands and had significant advantages over the diversity of wetland sub-categories. The statistical analysis showed that the global wetland area reached 6.38 million km(2), including 6.03 million km(2) of inland wetlands and 0.35 million km(2) of coastal tidal wetlands, approximately 72.96 % of which were distributed poleward of 40 degrees N. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed method is suitable for large-area wetland mapping and that the GWL_FCS30 dataset is an accurate wetland mapping product that has the potential to provide vital support for wetland management. The GWL_FCS30 dataset in 2020 is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7340516 (Liu et al., 2022).

TI  - A review of 3D reconstruction from high-resolution urban satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Automated 3D reconstruction based on satellite images has become a research hotspot at the interdisciplinary of photogrammetry and computer vision. The 3D results based on satellite images will play a key role in the understanding of global 3D information, monitoring of national geographic and urban construction, with the inherent advantage of satellite images in global coverage. Researchers have devoted substantial effort to develop state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods for two-view satellite images and multi-view satellite images. However, it is still a challenging task to obtain complete and accurate 3D results with satellite images due to the difference in shooting angles between satellite images, exposure differences and building occlusions in urban scenes. In this paper, we execute theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations about the popular 3D reconstruction methods towards satellite images following the order of two views to multiple views: (1) The advanced dense matching methods aimed at satellite images are reviewed theoretically and evaluated experimentally. (2) The state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction based on two-view satellite images are analysed in detail and experimentally evaluated with two-view WorldView-3 satellite images. (3) The popular fusion methods of multi-view DSM are analysed theoretically and assessed on multi-view WorldView-3 satellite images. This review will be helpful for researchers dedicated to enhancing the accuracy and completeness of the results of 3D reconstruction from urban satellite images.

TI  - Photoacoustic signal enhancement in dual-contrast gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-targeted nanobubbles
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Translatable imaging agents are a crucial element of successful molecular imaging. Photoacoustic molecular imaging relies on optical absorbing materials to generate a sufficient signal. However, few materials approved for human use can generate adequate photoacoustic responses. Here we report a new nanoengineering approach to further improve photoacoustic response from biocompatible materials. Our study shows that when optical absorbers are incorporated into the shell of a gaseous nanobubble, their photoacoustic signal can be significantly enhanced compared to the original form. As an example, we constructed nanobubbles using biocompatible indocyanine green (ICG) and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). We demonstrated that these ICG nanobubbles generate a strong ultrasound signal and almost four-fold photoacoustic signal compared to the same concentration of ICG solution; our theoretical calculations corroborate this effect and elucidate the origin of the photoacoustic enhancement. To demonstrate their molecular imaging performance, we conjugated gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) targeting ligands with the ICG nanobubbles. Our dual photoacoustic/ultrasound molecular imaging shows a more than three-fold enhancement in targeting specificity of the GRPR-targeted ICG nanobubbles, compared to untargeted nanobubbles or prostate cancer cells not expressing GRPR, in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model in vivo.

TI  - Towards operational atmospheric correction of airborne hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy: Algorithm evaluation, key parameter analysis, and machine learning emulators
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of airborne hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy (AHIS) to obtain high-quality surface reflectance is the prerequisite for remote sensing applications. Over the last decades, different atmospheric correction methods have been developed based on radiative transfer models (RTMs), however, the relative performances of different algorithms are unclear. Automated operational atmospheric correction methods to process large-volume AHIS data in a high-accurate and high-throughput manner are still lacking. Therefore, this study proposed an operational atmospheric correction pipeline for deriving surface reflectance from AHIS data. To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the pipeline, we focused on three specific aspects: (1) selecting a suitable RTM for the development of atmospheric lookup tables (LUTs) by comparing the commercial MODerate reso-lution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) and open-sourced Library for Radiative TRANsfer (LibRadTRAN) models, where the widely-used software, Atmospheric/Topographic Correction for Airborne Imagery (ATCOR), was used as benchmarks; (2) identifying key atmospheric correction parameters and determining suitable sources for parameter retrievals including AHIS, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET); and (3) testing the performance of using machine learning emulators to speed up the RTM-based atmospheric correction. Results indicate that (1) atmospheric correction based on MODTRAN LUTs can produce surface reflectance accurately with mean absolute errors < 0.05 and cosine similarities > 0.98 compared to field measurements, which is comparable to the software ATCOR and slightly outperforms the LibRadTRAN LUTs; (2) sobol global sensitivity analysis demonstrates that in the atmospheric correction, visi-bility and water vapor are two key parameters that can be accurately derived from AHIS in contrast to MODIS or AERONET data; and (3) Random Forest emulators can produce accurate estimations of surface reflectance with mean absolute errors < 0.03 and cosine similarities > 0.98 for higher processing efficiency and determine a suitable set of wavelengths for retrieving atmospheric visibility and water vapor. The proposed atmospheric correction pipeline also improved the four-stream radiative transfer theory for airborne applications by considering adjacent effects from airborne surrounding pixels and can also be applied for atmospheric correction of hyperspectral data from spaceborne missions.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of index based agricultural drought vulnerability using machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of droughts are far-reaching, impacting the natural environment, water quality, public health, and accelerating economic losses. Applications of remote sensing techniques using satellite imageries can play an influen-tial role in identifying drought severity (DS) and impacts for a broader range of areas. The Barind Tract (BT) is a region of Bangladesh located northwest of the country and considered one of the hottest, semi-arid, and drought-prone regions. This study aims to assess and predict the drought vulnerability over BT using Landsat satellite images from 1996 to 2031. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Differ-ence Water Index (MNDWI), Soil Moisture Content (SMC), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). VHI has been used to identify and predict DS based on VCI and TCI characteristics for 2026 and 2031 using Cellular Automata (CA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms. Results suggest an increasing patterns of DS accelerated by the reduction of healthy vegetation (19 %) and surface water bodies (26 %) and increased higher temperature (>5 degrees C) from 1996 to 2021. In addition, the VHI result signifies a mas-sive increase in extreme drought conditions from 1996 (2 %) to 2021 (7 %). The DS prediction witnessed a possible expansion in extreme and severe drought conditions in 2026 (15 % and 13 %) and 2031 (18 % and 24 %). Understand-ing the possible impacts of drought will allow planners and decision-makers to initiate mitigating measures for enhanc-ing the communities preparedness to cope with drought vulnerability.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Cities are complex and dynamic entities in close proximity of people, implying multi temporal observations to analyse and understand the urban context. At present, open-source data and geospatial intelligence are becoming the important means of exploring, monitoring and predicting urban status of area growth and population increase. In last few decades, unemployment and absence of infrastructures in the rural areas promoted the unplanned and haphazard urbanization across the urban centres in Pakistan. This study focuses on exploring the potential of open-source/freely available datasets for city mapping and monitoring spatially. The study gives a spatial perspective of rapidly growing cities of Pakistan using Google Earth Engine to classify Landsat images over last four decades, and discovers sprawl patterns across cities. The study works out that the built-up area is significantly increasing with population growth over four decades and there is a strong positive correlation between population growth and built-up expansion. Using Open-Source Data (Landsat images and LandScan data), this study has offered a technical solution of Google Earth Engine-supported analysis of statistics and machine learning to spatially monitoring the population change and urban growth of four major Pakistan cities. It is undoubted that our working results will provide the timely and cost-effective information to policymakers, Govt Officials and citizens for more sustainable urbanization.

TI  - Dynamic UAV Phenotyping for Rice Disease Resistance Analysis Based on Multisource Data
T2  - PLANT PHENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial blight poses a threat to rice production and food security, which can be controlled through large-scale breeding efforts toward resistant cultivars. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing provides an alternative means for the infield phenotype evaluation of crop disease resistance to relatively time-consuming and laborious traditional methods. However, the quality of data acquired by UAV can be affected by several factors such as weather, crop growth period, and geographical location, which can limit their utility for the detection of crop disease and resistant phenotypes. Therefore, a more effective use of UAV data for crop disease phenotype analysis is required. In this paper, we used time series UAV remote sensing data together with accumulated temperature data to train the rice bacterial blight severity evaluation model. The best results obtained with the predictive model showed an Rp2 of 0.86 with an RMSEp of 0.65. Moreover, model updating strategy was used to explore the scalability of the established model in different geographical locations. Twenty percent of transferred data for model training was useful for the evaluation of disease severity over different sites. In addition, the method for phenotypic analysis of rice disease we built here was combined with quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to identify resistance QTL in genetic populations at different growth stages. Three new QTLs were identified, and QTLs identified at different growth stages were inconsistent. QTL analysis combined with UAV high-throughput phenotyping provides new ideas for accelerating disease resistance breeding.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial coastal wetland habitat in the transition zone between land and sea, global tidal flats have severely declined by 16% over the last two decades under the dual threats of intense human activities and climate change. The Yangtze River Delta of China, the largest estuary in the western Pacific Ocean, has abundant mudflat resources and a dense human population. It also has some of the most prominent conflicts between economic development and ecological conservation. The current lack of understanding of landscape patterns and influencing factors of the Yangtze River Delta mudflats has severely hampered the region's ecological conservation and restoration efforts. Based on Landsat time-series images, this study generated a 30-m spatial resolution map of mudflats in the Yangtze River Delta, which shrank by 47% during 1990-2020, with a higher density of mudflat loss in Yancheng and Nantong cities of the Jiangsu province and Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo cities of the Zhejiang province. Landscape indices, such as the patch density of tidal flats, have gradually changed since 2000, with most of them showing significant changes in 2010. Mudflats in Lianyungang, northwestern Yancheng, Nanhui, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou showed sharp negative changes in landscape characteristics. Natural and anthropogenic factors had synergistic effects on the above changes in mudflat landscape patterns in the Yangtze River Delta. Mudflat landscape features were mainly influenced by population growth, economic development, reclamation, sediment discharge, and air temperature. Based on the evolving characteristics of mudflat landscape patterns, we recommend improving mudflat landscape management and planning by strengthening mudflat policies, laws, and regulations, developing countermeasures against threats from major stressors, and enhancing the effectiveness of nature reserves for mudflat protection.

TI  - Recent Advances in Contrast-Enhanced Photoacoustic Imaging: Overcoming the Physical and Practical Challenges
T2  - CHEMICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - For decades now, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has been investigated to realize its potential as a niche biomedical imaging modality. Despite its highly desirable optical contrast and ultrasonic spatiotemporal resolution, PAI is challenged by such physical limitations as a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), diminished image contrast due to strong optical attenuation, and a lower-bound on spatial resolution in deep tissue. In addition, contrast-enhanced PAI has faced practical limitations such as insufficient cell-specific targeting due to low delivery efficiency and difficulties in developing clinically translatable agents. Identifying these limitations is essential to the continuing expansion of the field, and substantial advances in developing contrast-enhancing agents, complemented by highperformance image acquisition systems, have synergistically dealt with the challenges of conventional PAI. This review covers the past four years of research on pushing the physical and practical challenges of PAI in terms of SNR/contrast, spatial resolution, targeted delivery, and clinical application. Promising strategies for dealing with each challenge are reviewed in detail, and future research directions for next generation contrast-enhanced PAI are discussed.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Condensation trails (contrails) from aircraft exhausts and contrail cirrus clouds play a significant role in the atmosphere's radiation balance and the climate. The aim of this study is to analyse the physical properties of contrails with the use of satellite data and determine the atmospheric conditions favoring their formation and persistence. The contrails are detected on satellite images provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) radiometer onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites, using a modified version of the contrail detection algorithm by Mannstein et al. Int J Remote Sens 20(8):1641-1660. (1999) for the year 2016. The study area covers central and western Europe. Five contrail detection hotspots are located, with contrail density depending on time of day and season. The length of the detected contrails ranges between 225 and 292.5 km and the mean width between 5.1 and 8.1 km. The spatial contrail cover reaches up to 0.085% of the scene, with larger values being detected between 8 and 10 UTC and during winter. Results of the comparison with the ERA-5 reanalysis database show that contrail formation and persistence is favored in ice saturated areas (RHI asymptotic to 100%), when the air temperature is between 204 and 232 kappa (- 69.2 to - 41.2 degrees C) and the specific humidity between 0.025 and 0.0625 g/kg. The favorable wind direction and speed lie between W and SW (240-300 degrees) and 10 and 30 m/s, respectively.

TI  - Seasonal Acceleration of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, From Changes in Subglacial Hydrology
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Petermann Glacier is a major outlet glacier of northern Greenland that drains a marine-based basin vulnerable to destabilization from enhanced oceanic and atmospheric forcings. Using satellite radar interferometry data from the Sentinel-1a/b missions, we observe a seasonal glacier acceleration of 15% in the summer, from 1,250 to 1,500 m/yr near the grounding line, but the physical drivers of this seasonality have not been elucidated. Here, we use a subglacial hydrology model coupled one-way to an ice sheet model to evaluate the role of subglacial hydrology as a physical mechanism explaining the seasonal acceleration. We find excellent agreement between the observed and predicted velocity in terms of timing and magnitude with the addition of an applied lower limit on effective pressure of 6% of ice overburden pressure. We conclude that seasonal changes in subglacial hydrology are sufficient to explain the observed seasonal speed up of Petermann Glacier.

TI  - InSAR time-series analysis and susceptibility mapping for land subsidence in Semarang, Indonesia using convolutional neural network and support vector regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sea-level rise due to climate change is a critical problem for coastal cities. One of the coastal cities in Indonesia, Semarang, is in danger of being submerged by seawater due to flooding, which is exacerbated by land subsidence. Time-series analysis based on persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry usually suffers from sparse measurement points (MP), and thus does not completely cover the study area with low coherence. In this study, we utilized improved combined scatterers interferometry with optimized point scatterers (ICOPS) to increase the MP density. We also compared the optimization of the ICOPS method based on support vector regression (SVR) with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The ICOPS-CNN showed better model performance and MP density, and was less time-consuming. Further land subsidence analysis was conducted in Semarang using susceptibility mapping. The land subsidence susceptibility map from the standalone deep learning (DL) algorithm (CNN = 0.833) outperformed the standalone machine learning (ML) algorithm (SVR = 0.820). The hybrid DL algorithm with grey wolf optimizer (GWO) (CNN-GWO = 0.907) exhibited the highest accuracy, followed by the hybrid ML algorithm (SVR-GWO = 0.843). The accuracy was consistent with the comparison between the sus-ceptibility maps and the ICOPS measurements, resulting in a susceptibility map based on CNN-GWO with the highest accuracy (0.889). Land subsidence monitoring using ICOPS based on CNN and susceptibility mapping based on a hybrid DL algorithm (CNN-GWO) can be used by local governments to improve urban development planning in Semarang and its surrounding areas.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - After the first impoundment of the reservoir, many landslides seriously threatened the safety of the reservoir. Accurate determination of the relationship between the landslide deformation characteristics and water-level fluctuations is crucial. However, with the increasing number of water-level fluctuation cycles, the deformation characteristics of the landslides were also changing, and long-term continuous monitoring to capture the failure process of reservoir landslides is necessary. A large reacted landslide in the Xiluodu reservoir was set as an example, using InSAR technology to seek its variations of deformation characteristics over nine years. The local deformation rate and annual maximum deformation area variation were analyzed by InSAR technology based on Sentinel-1 descending SAR data from October 2014 to June 2022. According to the regional deformation characteristics, the landslide was divided into three zones: Zone I above the elevation of 950 m; Zone II below it; the front edge of Zone II, where the collapse happened, was further divided into Zone III. In general, the accumulated deformation in Zone I was the largest, followed by Zone III, and Zone II was the smallest. The average deformation rate of Zone II was the smallest. Zone I of NLJL was mainly affected by the drawdown of reservoir water level, and the impacts of water-level rising and drawdown on Zone II and Zone III were similar. After analyzing a nine-year variation of the deformation area, the deformation mechanism of NLJL changed from a retrogressive type to a progressive one after the first impoundment and then changed back to a retrogressive one after 2017. The impact of reservoir impoundment on NLJL was most substantial in the first three years after the first impoundment.

TI  - Forest disturbance decreased in China from 1986 to 2020 despite regional variations
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rate, frequency and extent of forest disturbances decreased in China over 1986-2020 probably due to forest protection policies, but while they intensified in the southeast, they weakened in the northeast, according to 30 m resolution Landsat satellite dataHuman activities have altered disturbance patterns in many parts of world, but there is no quantitative information on patterns and trends of forest disturbance regimes in China. We applied a spectral-temporal segmentation approach over all available Landsat data to map individual disturbance patches and characterize the patterns and trends in disturbance rate, size, frequency, and severity across China's forests. From 1986 to 2020, about 39.7% of China's forests were disturbed with an annual rate of 1.16 +/- 0.41% yr(-1). The disturbance decreased at a rate of -390 +/- 142 km(2) yr(-1), primarily driven by the effective implementation of forest protection policy since 2000s. The rate, frequency, and size of disturbance generally intensified in Southeast, but weakened in Northeast China. Our high-quality, spatially explicit disturbance map provides an essential data layer to understand the landscape-scale drivers of forest dynamics and functions for important but less understood pan-temperate forest regions.

TI  - Trends in COVID-Related Activity in Sentinel Family Medicine Practices: An Observational Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: During the COVID pandemic, data collected in family medicine were scarce. The COVID-FM project aimed to monitor trends of COVID-related activity in family medicine practices of the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, during the year 2021.Methods: Practitioners were invited to join an ad hoc sentinel surveillance system. Online data collection was based on daily activity reports and monthly questionnaires. Participants categorized daily counts of consultations and phone calls into predefined categories. Data were reported and discussed on a weekly basis with public health authorities.Results: On the target of 50 physicians, 37 general physicians from 32 practices finally constituted the COVID-FM sentinel network, contributing to 901 practice-weeks of surveillance in family medicine and 604 in paediatrics. In paediatrics, COVID-related activity corresponded mostly to COVID-19 diagnostic consultations (2911/25990 face-to-face consultations = 11.2%) while in family medicine, other COVID-related topics-such as questions on vaccination-predominated (4143/42221 = 9.8%).Conclusion: COVID-related consultations constituted an important part of primary care practices' activity in 2021. Monitoring COVID-related activity in primary care provided health authorities with valuable information to guide public health action.

TI  - Dogs with cropped ears in the UK: A population-based study using electronic health records
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEar cropping for cosmetic purposes was made illegal in the UK in 2006. Despite this, a lack of import regulations and celebrity and media influences mean cropped dogs are increasingly reported. MethodsThe demographics, temporal trends and patient-level associated factors for dogs with cropped ears were evaluated in a large sentinel population of dogs visiting UK veterinary practices. ResultsA total of 132 dogs with cropped ears were identified, with rates peaking in 2021. In 84 cases (63.6%), there was evidence of importation, most commonly from countries where cropping is also illegal, including Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, Spain, Poland and Ireland. American Bulldogs, Dobermanns, Italian Mastiffs (Cane Corso), Bulldogs and Mastiffs were all significantly overrepresented. Affected dogs were more likely to be unneutered (odds ratio 11.04, 95% confidence interval 5.84-20.90). LimitationsThe study likely underestimates true levels of ear cropping. Identified cases are from a sentinel network of veterinary practices, and as such may not be representative of the wider UK population. ConclusionThese data suggest a need to educate owners and veterinary surgeons about the welfare and legal implications of ear cropping. The data presented can inform future targeted policies in veterinary practices and at a governmental level.

TI  - Haemosporidian infections influence risk-taking behaviours in young male blackcaps, Sylvia atricapilla
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal behaviour becomes essential to the dynamics of parasitism if some behaviours favour pathogen transmission or increase exposure to infection. Infections may also influence host behaviour when health and future fitness are compromised, which predicts infected individuals will adaptively change risktaking behaviours. We studied whether haemosporidian infection influences exploratory, foraging and antipredator behaviours of male young blackcaps before their first migration. The study was conducted in captivity using subjects of a medication experiment with the antimalarial drug primaquine, which had temporarily cleared parasite blood stages of treated individuals 1 month before. In an initial exploration test in a cage unknown to the birds, infected birds started exploring earlier than uninfected ones. Risktaking behaviours were further assessed in a sequence of tests starting with the opening of new feeders to induce a startle response, and continuing with simulations of increased predation risk. We first challenged birds with acoustic cues of predation risk by playing recorded conspecific alarm calls, using heterospecific song as a control for the reaction to sound. Then, we challenged birds with visual cues of risk, showing them a taxidermic sparrowhawk and a bottle as a control for the reaction to an unspecific threat. Uninfected birds showed appropriate sentinel behaviour, turning around more frequently in the presence of the sparrowhawk compared to the bottle, while infected birds tended to behave similarly when faced with both stimuli, a behavioural difference that was driven by individuals with single parasite infections. Throughout the trial, infected medicated individuals tended to alarm-call more often than infected unmedicated individuals, a weak effect of medication which was not observed in parasitefree birds. Our results show that haemosporidian infections can influence blackcap risk-taking behaviours and support the view that host behavioural repertoires are broadly associated with parasitism.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Clinical outcomes of Medical management options for chronic anal fissures in a long term follow up: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - DIGESTIVE DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Topical treatments and botulinum toxin injections are valid options for the management of patients with chronic anal fissures (CAF) but little is known about the efficacy in a long-term follow-up. The aim of this meta-analysis was evaluate the effectiveness, given to clinical outcomes of medical treatments in adults.Method: this manuscript was developed according to PRISMA [23, 25] and registered in PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020120386). A systematic literature search was conducted through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Randomized control trials that compared medical treatment were identified; publications had to have a clinical definition of CAF with at least one of the following signs or symptoms: visible sphincter fibers at the base of the fissure, anal papillae, sentinel piles, and indurated margins. The symptoms had to be chronic for at least 4 weeks.Results: 17 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. Diltiazem showed a superior effect compared with glycerin (RR = 1.16 [95% CI = 1.05-1.30]; I2 = 18%), and with fewer adverse effects (RR = 0.13 [95% CI = 0 , 04-0.042]; I2 = 87%). Similar results were evidenced with the use of nifedipine compared with lidocaine (RR = 4.53 [95% CI = 2.99-6.86]; I2 = 28%). Botulinum toxin did not show statistically significant differences compared to glycerin (RR = 0.81 [95% CI = 0.02-29.36]; I2 = 93%) or isosorbide dinitrate (RR = 1.45 [CI 95% = 0.32-6.54]; I2 = 85%). Regarding recurrence, nifedipine was superior to lidocain (RR = 0.18 [95% CI = 0.08-0.44]; I2 = 31%).Conclusions: Calcium channel blockers performed well regarding the healing of CAF when compared to others in long-term follow-up. The superiority of botulinum toxin was not evidenced compared to topical treatments. More studies are needed to better assess recurrence rates.

TI  - Satellite estimation of suspended particle types using a backscattering efficiency-based model in the marginal seas
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The particle composition of suspended matter provides crucial information for a deeper understanding of marine biogeochemical processes and environmental changes. Particulate backscattering efficiency (Q(bbe)(lambda)) is critical to understand particle composition, and a Q(bbe)(lambda)based model for classifying particle types was proposed. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Q(bbe)(lambda)-based model to satellite observations in the shallow marginal Bohai and Yellow Seas. Spatiotemporal variations of the particle types and their potential driving factors were studied. The results showed that the Q(bbe)(lambda) products generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua agreed well with the in situ measured values, with determination coefficient, root mean square error, bias, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.76, 0.007, 16.5%, and 31.0%, respectively. This result verifies the satellite applicability of the Qbbe(.)-based model. Based on long-term MODIS data, we observed evident spatiotemporal variations of the Q(bbe)(lambda), from which distinct particle types were identified. Coastal waters were often dominated by minerals, with high Q(bbe)(lambda) values, though their temporal changes were also observed. In contrast, waters in the offshore regions showed clear changes in particle types, which shifted from organic-dominated with low Q(bbe)(lambda) levels in summer to mineral-dominated with high Q(bbe)(lambda) values in winter. We also observed long-term increasing and decreasing trends in Q(bbe)(lambda) in some regions, indicating a relative increase in the proportions of mineral and organic particles in the past decades, respectively. These spatiotemporal variations of Q(bbe)(lambda) and particle types were probably attributed to sediment re-suspension related to water mixing driven by wind and tidal forcing, and to sediment load associated with river discharge. Overall, the findings of this study may provide valuable proxies for better studying marine biogeochemical processes, material exchanges, and sediment flux.

TI  - The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Indocyanine green (ICG) with near-infrared fluorescence absorption is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications in angi-ography, blood flow evaluation, and liver function assessment. It has strong optical absorption in the near-infrared region, where light can penetrate deepest into biological tissue. We sought to review its value in guiding prostate cancer treatment.Methods: All related literature at PubMed from January 2000 to December 2020 were re-viewed.Results: Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated the usefulness of ICG in identifying prostate cancer by using different engineering techniques. Clinical studies have demonstrated the usefulness of ICG in guiding sentinel node dissection during radical prostatectomy, and possible better preservation of neurovascular bundle by identifying landmark prostatic ar-teries. New techniques such as adding fluorescein in additional to ICG were tested in a limited number of patients with encouraging result. In addition, the use of the ICG was shown to be safe. Even though there are encouraging results, it does not carry sufficient sensitivity and specificity in replacing extended pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy.Conclusion: Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have shown the usefulness of ICG in iden-tifying and guiding treatment for prostate cancer. Larger randomized prospective studies are warranted to further test its usefulness and find new modified approaches.(c) 2023 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

TI  - Io Hot Spot Distribution Detected by Juno/JIRAM
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present the most updated catalog of Io hot spots based on Juno/JIRAM data. We find 242 hot spots, including 23 previously undetected. Over the half of the new hot spots identified, are located at high northern and southern latitudes (>70 degrees). We observe a latitudinal variability and a larger concentration of hot spots in the polar regions, in particular in the North. The comparison between JIRAM and the most recent Io hot spot catalogs listing power output (Veeder et al., 2015, ; de Kleer, de Pater, et al., 2019, ), shows JIRAM detected 63% and 88% of the total number of hot spots, respectively. Furthermore, JIRAM observed 16 of the 34 faint hot spots previously identified. JIRAM data revealed thermal emission from 5 dark pater AE inferred to be active from color ratio images, thus confirming that these are hot spots.

TI  - Axillary staging in node-positive breast cancer converting to node negativity through neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Current evidence and perspectives
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Over the recent years, axillary staging of initially node-positive breast cancer patients converting to clinical node negativity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has seen rapid changes. This narrative review aims to give a contemporary overview over published evidence and clinical practice, and thus provide some guidance to the surgical community in the process of re-evaluating and re-shaping surgical practice. Methods: The search strategy aimed at finding relevant studies. Only articles in English were considered. Results: The introduction of modern techniques offer more precise staging surgery and thus hopefully reduced arm morbidity. Clinical practice has however diverged both within countries and internationally. While some countries have adapted de-escalated axillary staging techniques such as targeted axillary dissection, targeted lymph node biopsy or sentinel lymph node biopsy, others continue to recommend a full axillary lymph node dissection. With the implementation of new techniques, many questions arise, regarding aspects of oncological safety, technical performance, budget and practicality, patient selection and indications for different levels of axillary staging procedures. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence on de-escalation of axillary surgery in the setting of cN+ -> ycN0 breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, standards differ between countries and future studies are necessary to fully assess the optimal strategy for these patients.

TI  - Infusing satellite data into aerosol forecast for near real-time episode detection and diagnosis in East Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A near-real-time (NRT) aerosol forecast and diagnostic approach is developed based on the system of Infusing satellite Data into Environmental Applications for East Asia, herein denoted as IDEA-EA. The design incorporates a 0.5-degree Global Forecast System (GFS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol and cloud retrievals for meteorological and remote sensing inputs. The primary output of IDEA-EA includes aerosol forward and backward air mass trajectory forecasts, migration visualization, and data synthesis purposed for NRT aerosol detection, monitoring, and source tracing in East Asia. Two aerosol episodes of Southeast Asia (SEA) biomass burning and Chinese haze infusion with Gobi dust are illustrated by IDEA-EA to demonstrate its forecast and source tracing capabilities. In the case of SEA biomass burning (late March 2021), forward trajectories of IDEA-EA forecasted air masses with high aerosol optical depth (AOD) from SEA affecting Taiwan. The IDEA-EA forecasts were verified by increased AOD and sur-face PM2.5 observations at a mountain site. In the case of the Chinese haze (October 30, 2019), backward trajectories from the northern tip of Taiwan traced air masses back to the east coast of mainland China and possibly further to the Gobi Desert. Compared with conventional numerical model simulations, the combination of the state-of-the-art aerosol remote sensing and trajectory modeling in IDEA-EA provides a cost-effective alternative for air quality management.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Procedure in Pediatric Patients with Melanoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, or Sarcoma Using Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging with Indocyanine Green: A Feasibility Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundStandard sentinel lymph node procedure (SNP) in pediatric cancer consists of a preoperative injection with (99m)technetium nanocolloid in combination with an optional intraoperative injection with blue dye. However, blue dye has disadvantages, and the detection rate is low, with only 60% of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) staining blue. In adult oncology, fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has been shown to be a safe and accurate method for visual detection of SLNs, with a higher sensitivity (up to 97%) compared with blue dye. Therefore, our aim is to determine the feasibility of the addition of ICG to (99m)technetium nanocolloid (ICG-TC) for visual detection of SLN in pediatric patients.MethodsA total of 15 pediatric patients with melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sarcoma were prospectively included. Preoperatively, patients were injected with ICG-TC and imaging with lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography- computed tomography was performed. Intraoperatively, SLN was detected with fluorescence and the gamma probe. Postoperatively, fluorescence was quantified by tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and surgeons evaluated the use of ICG using a standardized questionnaire.ResultsIn 10/15 (67%) patients, SLNs were visible transcutaneously. Of all intraoperatively detected SLNs, 35/37 (95%) were fluorescent and 37/37 (100%) were radioactive. Furthermore, ICG-TC led to the identification of six additional SLNs as compared with preoperative imaging. The median TBR in vivo was 6.5 (IQR 5.3). The surgical evaluation showed that ICG assisted in SLN detection and was easy to use.ConclusionsICG-TC for the SNP is a feasible procedure in pediatric patients. It showed an accurate detection rate, was helpful for visual guidance, and no adverse events occurred.

TI  - Wide-field three-dimensional photoacoustic/ultrasound scanner using a two-dimensional matrix transducer array
T2  - OPTICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two-dimensional matrix transducer arrays are the most appropriate imaging probes for acquiring dual-modal 3D photoacoustic (PA)/ultrasound (US) images. However, they have small footprints which limit the field-of-view (FOV) to less than 10 mmx10 mm and degrade the spatial resolution. In this study, we demonstrate a dual-modal PA and US imaging system (using a 2D matrix transducer array and a motorized 2D scanning system) to enlarge the FOV of volumetric images. Multiple PA volumes were merged to form a wide-field image of approximately 45 mmx45 mm. In vivo imaging was demonstrated using rat sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and bladders stained with methylene blue. We believe that this volumetric PA/US imaging technique with a 2D matrix transducer array can be a useful tool for narrow-field real-time monitoring and wide-field imaging of various preclinical and clinical studies.

TI  - Separation of coherent and incoherent light by using optical vortex via spatial mode projection
T2  - OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a spatial light filter method which can distinguish light by its coherency. The unique orbital angular momentum and spiral phase front properties of the vortex beam generate a null intensity center area that can serve as a spatial window to filter out incoherent light. A spatial light modulator can be used to modulate the wavefront of the incident light beam. Thanks to diffraction, the spectra from the coherent and incoherent part are spatially separated at the backfocal plane of a lens. The coherent part forms a ring, and the incoherent part forms a spot in the null intensity center of the ring. This method offers a new perspective to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the field of applied optics, such as optical communication, and active remote sensing, such as light detection and ranging.

TI  - A surplus no more? Variation in krill availability impacts reproductive rates of Antarctic baleen whales
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The krill surplus hypothesis of unlimited prey resources available for Antarctic predators due to commercial whaling in the 20th century has remained largely untested since the 1970s. Rapid warming of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the past 50 years has resulted in decreased seasonal ice cover and a reduction of krill. The latter is being exacerbated by a commercial krill fishery in the region. Despite this, humpback whale populations have increased but may be at a threshold for growth based on these human-induced changes. Understanding how climate-mediated variation in prey availability influences humpback whale population dynamics is critical for focused management and conservation actions. Using an 8-year dataset (2013-2020), we show that inter-annual humpback whale pregnancy rates, as determined from skin-blubber biopsy samples (n = 616), are positively correlated with krill availability and fluctuations in ice cover in the previous year. Pregnancy rates showed significant inter-annual variability, between 29% and 86%. Our results indicate that krill availability is in fact limiting and affecting reproductive rates, in contrast to the krill surplus hypothesis. This suggests that this population of humpback whales may be at a threshold for population growth due to prey limitations. As a result, continued warming and increased fishing along the WAP, which continue to reduce krill stocks, will likely impact this humpback whale population and other krill predators in the region. Humpback whales are sentinel species of ecosystem health, and changes in pregnancy rates can provide quantifiable signals of the impact of environmental change at the population level. Our findings must be considered paramount in developing new and more restrictive conservation and management plans for the Antarctic marine ecosystem and minimizing the negative impacts of human activities in the region.

TI  - Monitoring land subsidence with the combination of persistent scatterer interferometry techniques and distributed fiber optic sensing techniques: a case study in Suzhou, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land subsidence is a global geo-hazard caused by various natural and human factors, and it directly threatens the safety of the environment and infrastructures. Investigating the mechanism of land subsidence is becoming more and more important. In this paper, we use the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique combining the distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) technique to detect the spatial-temporal distributions of land subsidence and investigate the stratum deformation characteristics in Shengze, Suzhou. By analyzing Sentinel-1A date between 2017 and 2019 with the PSI technique and the deformation date derived by the DFOS technique, we conclude that the land surface deformations are mostly affected by the transitional exploitation of groundwater. The average line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rate is mostly concentrated in - 3 to 2.2 mm/yr, and a maximum subsidence rate of up to - 16.9 mm/yr is observed in four industrial areas. Meanwhile, the DFOS-derived results reveal that the compression strata are mostly concentrated in 41.2-137.9 m depth, which is closely associated with the pore water pressure in the second confined aquifer. And it also reveals that the groundwater over-exploitation may be the significant triggering factor of the subsidence in the study area. The InSAR-derived results are also evaluated by the deformation time series obtained by the DFOS technique. The combination of those two new sensing and monitoring technologies enables us to highlight the large deformation area and reveal the mechanism of its subsidence, which is conducive to urban development, disaster risk management, and rational exploitation and management of groundwater in Suzhou, China.

TI  - Mapping clay mineral types using easily accessible data and machine learning techniques in a scarce data region: A case study in a semi-arid area in Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the abundance variability of clay minerals, as fundamental soil components, will help the users to improve land management and address concerns over climate change and soil fertility. Therefore, this investi-gation aimed to model the abundance and spatial distribution of clay types, including palygorskite, illite, and kaolinite, and identify the most significant variables affecting their variability using a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach in Darab district, southern Iran. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) techniques were applied to link clay types and environmental attributes that were obtained from a Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) and digital elevation model (DEM). A ten-fold cross-validation approach was applied to calibrate and validate the models, and 50 bootstrap models were used to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The models accuracy was defined by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ). Findings denoted that the RF model better predicts the abundance and variability of clay minerals in the study area (R2 = 0.56, 0.47, and 0.48, RMSE = 5.3, 1.91 and 0.63 % and RPIQ = 2.82, 3.28 and 2.62 for palygorskite, illite and kaolinite, respectively). Based on the feature selection analysis, topographic covariates and soil properties determined palygorskite and kaolinite content variations, while for illite, only soil properties could explain the spatial distribution. Besides, the RF produced a lower uncertainty for palygorskite compared to the other clay types. The present research can provide new insight into the spatial variability of clay minerals in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran that could be extended to other similar environments. Moreover, the results showed that the easily available environmental variables could provide reliable predictions. However, other environmental covariates, such as XRF analysis, Vis-NIR, and MIR spectroscopy, are also recommended as input variables for further studies.

TI  - Evaluation of ecological space and ecological quality changes in urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and human activities make the contradiction between human and ecological environment more obvious, maintaining ecological balance and achieving harmonious development between living envi-ronment has also become the main goal of sustainable development. The urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) is a typical arid inland emerging urban agglomeration, and the relationship between human activities and the ecological environment here is very sensitive. To reveal the spatiotemporal changes in ecological quality in the UANSTM from 2000 to 2020, this study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, calculating remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the MODIS data products, in addition to achieving an ecological space atlas based on the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC) data sets. At same time, the geographical detector model (GDM) has been used to exploring the main influencing factor of RSEI. The result shows that 1) The mean value of RESI in the study area continued to rise in the first 15 a and decreased slightly in the last 5 a. 2) In the past 20 a, the area of improvement obvious (IO) has gradually expanded, and the proportion has gradually increased. The sum of the areas of deterioration obvious (DO) and deterioration slight (DS) is far smaller than the sum of the areas of improvement slight (IS) and improvement obvious (IO), which indicates that the ecological quality of UANSTMN is tends to improve. 3) The distribution of ecological space in the study area is ecological used land (EL) > semi-ecological used land (SEL) > weak ecological used land (WEL). The area of EL is gradually decreasing, while the area of SEL and WEL is gradually increasing. 4) In the past 20 a, the main influencing factor of RSEI in the study area is greenness, and the interaction of heat, dryness, and greenness had a more obvious effect on RSEI. The value of RSEI is better with higher greenness and wet, and with lower dryness or heat.

TI  - Challenges and implications of predicting the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue fever outbreak in Chinese Taiwan using remote sensing data and deep learning
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Ongoing climate change has accelerated the outbreak and expansion of climate-sensitive infectious diseases such as dengue fever. Dengue fever will remain a threat until safe and effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been developed, distributed, and administered on a global scale. By predicting the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue fever outbreaks, we can effectively implement dengue fever prevention and control. Our study aims to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue fever outbreaks in Chinese Taiwan using a U-Net based encoder - decoder model with daily datasets of sea-surface temperature, rainfall, and shortwave radiation from Remote Sensing (RS) instruments and dengue fever case notification data. Although the prediction accuracy of the proposed model was low and the overlapping areas between the ground truth and pixelwise prediction were few, some of the pixels were located nearby the ground truth, suggesting that the application of RS data and deep learning may help to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue fever outbreaks. With further improvements, the deep learning model might effectively learn a small amount of training data for a specific task.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the retrieval of soil moisture using Sentinel-1 SAR data along with the semi-empirical method modified Dubois model. The C-band SAR data have been collected for March 11 and 30, 2021 that correspond to pre-monsoon season crops (i.e., Rabi) over Khorda and Puri districts in Odisha (India). Fieldwork has been also been carried out for these two dates to collect in situ soil moisture. The soil moisture values have been measured in 40 different sites of crops using time-domain reflectometry (TDR-300) that corresponds to topsoil moisture (i.e., 0-7.6 cm soil depth). The C-band with VV polarization has been processed, and then the modified Dubois model was applied. The dielectric constant was derived, and then volumetric water content (VWC in %) is derived from Topp's model. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 data has been utilized to mask the pixels of soil moisture when NDVI > 0.4 as the Dubois model has a limitation in dense vegetation regions. The derived VWC was compared to in situ soil moisture, which had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.79 (RMSE = 5.37%) and 0.76 (RMSE = 4.87%) on March 11 and 30, 2021, respectively. The spatiotemporal pattern of VWC displayed that the soil moisture ranged from 13 to 53%, and the maximum moisture was found over the deltaic plains of the Puri district characterized by the saline marshy tract along the coast and gentle sloping plain. The approach used in this study gives effective results for soil moisture from SAR data in sparsely cultivated cropland.

TI  - Right-way fire in Australia?s spinifex deserts: An approach for measuring management success when fire activity varies substantially through space and time
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous Australians used fire in spinifex deserts for millennia. These practices mostly ceased following Eu-ropean colonisation, but many contemporary Indigenous groups seek to restore 'right-way fire' practices, to meet inter-related social, economic, cultural and biodiversity objectives. However, measuring and reporting on the fire pattern outcomes of management is challenging, because the spatio-temporal patterns of right-way fire are not clearly defined, and because spatio-temporal variability in rainfall makes fire occurrence highly variable in these desert environments. We present an approach for measuring and reporting on fire management outcomes to account for spatio-temporal rainfall variability. The purpose is to support Indigenous groups to assess perfor-mance against their management targets, and lay the groundwork for developing an accredited method for valuing combined social, cultural and biodiversity outcomes. We reviewed fire management plans of desert Indigenous groups to identify spatial fire pattern indicators for right-way fire in spinifex deserts. We integrated annual rainfall surfaces with time-since fire mapping (using Landsat imagery) to create a new spatial dataset of accumulated rainfall-since-last-fire, that better represents post-fire vegetation recovery as categorised by local Indigenous people. The fire pattern indicators were merged into a single score using an environmental ac-counting approach. To strengthen interpretation, we developed an approach for identifying a control area with matching vegetation and fire history, up to the point of management. We applied these methods to a 125,000 ha case study area: Durba Hills, managed by the Martu people of Western Australia. Using a 20-year time series, we show that since right-way fire management at Durba Hills was re-introduced (2009), the fire pattern indicators have improved compared to those in the matched control area, and the composite result is closer to the fine-scaled mosaic of right-way fire pattern targets. Our approach could be used by Indigenous groups to track performance, and inform annual fire management planning. As the indicators are standardised for rainfall variation, results from multiple sites can be aggregated to track changes in performance at larger scales. Finally, our approach could be adapted for other fire-prone areas, both in Australia and internationally with high spatio-temporal rainfall variability, to improve management planning and evaluation.

TI  - A remote sensing encrypted data search method based on a novel double-chain
T2  - CONNECTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is considered to be a key technology for the development of smart cities. By analysing the data obtained by remote sensing, it is effective to manage and develop smart cities. However, with the rapid urbanisation and the increase in data capacity, how to store and retrieve remote sensing data which have more potential value and privacy with a more effective and safe method has become an imminent issue. In this paper, we propose an efficient verifiable and dynamic multi-keyword searchable encryption scheme for remote sensing data in smart cities. Moreover, we construct a double-chain index to support a multi-keyword search, where the Verification Index Chain is used to identify the users and the Keyword Index Chain is used to store the information of keywords. In addition, we adopt extended bitmap technology to realise update operations and verify the correctness and integrity of the search results. Experiments show that compared to the related existing schemes, the search time of the proposed scheme is reduced by 35% at most, the verification time is reduced by 14% at most and the update time is reduced by 57% at most.

TI  - Evaluation of biogenic emissions from three different vegetation distributions in South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Map of plant functional type (PFT) is one of key information in estimating the bottom-up biogenic emissions. This study investigated the performance of three different maps of PFT on biogenic emissions in South Korea: i) PFT map from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor onboard Terra-/Aquasatellites (MPFT); ii) PFT map from the Environmental Geographic Information System (EGIS) provided by the Korean Ministry of Environment (EPFT); and iii) PFT map from the Forest Geographic Information System (FGIS) established by the Korea Forest Service (FPFT). These three different vegetation distributions were used as input information into the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) model. The biogenic emissions estimated by the MEGAN model simulations were then evaluated by comparisons between the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulated mixing ratios of biogenic species with ground-and aircraft-borne mixing ratios during the period of the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. The analyses found that the simulation using the FPFT map, which has been regarded as 'ground truth', produced the best results in terms of several statistical metrics. For example, among the three experiments, the simulation with the FPFT map produced the best index of agreement (IOA) of 0.76 and the lowest normalized mean bias (NMB) of 5.61%, in comparison with ground-based isoprene observations. The simulations with the MPFT map also performed reasonably, showing low NMBs of-42.13% and-14.87% for the isoprene and the first -generation products of isoprene, respectively, in comparison with the DC-8 airborne observations. In addition, the applications of the MPFT map to the MEGAN modeling showed significant overestimations in the mixing ratios of biogenic species over the SoBaek (SB) mountain ranges. It was believed that this was due to the overestimated density of broadleaf deciduous temperate trees over the SB mountain ranges in the MPFT map. On the other hand, the EPFT map showed the worst performances, which might be related to crude classification of vegetation. This study also suggests two important possibilities. First, the current isoprene-related photochem-istry appears to be highly uncertain, based on large underestimations of the first-generation products of isoprene, in comparison with observations. Second, the emission factors of monoterpenes in the MEGAN model may be too small, based on large underestimations of monoterpenes, in comparison with observations

TI  - "Freedom from Want": A Critical Reflection in the Face of the Anthropocene
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2022 Special Report on Human Security "calls for greater solidarity across borders and a new approach to development; one that allows people to live free from want, fear, anxiety and indignity". This paper analyses the notion of "freedom from want" and argues that human "want", understood from one cultural perspective/worldview, has created the market society with its GDP growth narrative. Such "want" could become the very reason for perceived insecurity, anxiety and indignity, if the "want" is not only to meet the basic human needs, but rather to meet desires artificially fuelled by a market society with its increasingly sophisticated tools, such as digital technology which implicitly manipulate our "wants" and rationalise them within the GDP-growth narrative. This paper proposes a policy shift from focusing on GDP growth to a new paradigm of human flourishment which allows for a "good life" for all (wo)mankind by capitalising on the concept of relational wellbeing. Relational wellbeing advocates for deep connections between humans, and between humans and nature, thereby achieving a greater global solidarity between people and a new mindset towards nature. The next generation of human security shall go beyond the aim of making people secure, and rather focus on how to enable humanity to flourish.

TI  - Free satellite image data application for monitoring land use cover changes in the kon ha nung plateau, vietnam
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery is the most suitable tool for monitoring, managing, and evaluating land -use overlay fluctuations, especially forest cover for large areas. Free-and medium-resolution satellite imagery is a useful tool that allows scientific researchers and management organiza-tions to monitor forest development in developing countries, such as Vietnam. In this study, we used SPOT 4 and Planet remote sensing data to assess land-use status fluctuations in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, between 2000 and 2021 (the overall accuracy was 90.52%, Kappa value = 0.89). The results showed that from 2000 to 2010, the rate of natural forest loss in this area was 0.32%/year, of which, more than 6500 ha were converted to other uses. Between 2010 and 2021, the rate of natural forest loss gradually decreased (0.09%/year) instead of fluctuating between different types of land use. The area of forests, perennial crop land, and annual crop land tended to increase from 2000 to 2010; however, from 2010 to 2021, the area of plantation forests decreased markedly, while the area of perennial crop land and annual crop land continued to expand. The analysis of the policies on forest management, exploitation, and protection was applied locally, to explain the causes of the change in spatiotemporal aspects of the types of land -use cover in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. Restoring forest areas during 2010-2021 initially improved effectiveness in forest management and protection. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the current position and role of the government apparatus, cadres, and ethnic minorities in socioeconomic development associated with forest protection and develop-ment on the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. The results of this study can help managers monitor annual forest-cover fluctuations based on free remote sensing imagery to reduce both the cost of man-agement and surveying, yielding relatively accurate results.

TI  - Validity assessment of SAMOSA retracking for fully-focused SAR altimeter waveforms
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate in this work how we can take advantage of known unfocused SAR (UF-SAR) retracking methods (e.g. the physical SAMOSA model) for retracking of fully-focused SAR (FF-SAR) waveforms. Our insights are an important step towards consistent observations of sea surface height, significant wave height and backscatter coefficient (wind speed) with both UF-SAR and FF-SAR. This is of particular interest for SAR altimetry in the coastal zone, since coastal clutter may be filtered out more efficiently in the high-resolution FF-SAR waveform data, which has the potential to improve data quality. We implemented a multi-mission FF-SAR altimetry processor for Sentinel-3 (S3) and Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6), using a back-projection algorithm, and analysed ocean waveform statistics compared to multilooked UF-SAR. We find for Sentinel-3 that the averaged power waveforms of UF-SAR and FF-SAR over ocean are virtually identical, while for Sentinel-6 the FF-SAR power waveforms better resemble the UF-SAR zero-Doppler beam. We can explain and model the similarities and differences in the data via theoretical considerations of the waveform integrals. These findings suggest to use the existing UF-SAR SAMOSA model for retracking S3 FF-SAR waveforms but the SAMOSA zero-Doppler beam model for S6 FF-SAR waveforms, instead. Testing the outlined approach over short track segments, we obtain range biases between UFSAR and FF-SAR lower than 2 mm and significant wave height biases lower than 5 cm. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Retrieving time series of river water extent from global inland water data sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of the surface water storage as an essential component of the global water cycle requires a realistic representation of river networks and channel characteristics. Since such a representation has not been available for many rivers and is becoming less available even for many gauged rivers, crucial questions about the spatio-temporal dynamics of freshwater in river networks cannot be answered properly.The global coverage and fine temporal resolution of satellite imagery provide the opportunity to obtain time series of surface water extent at the global scale for almost all rivers. However, despite recent advances in satellite imaging sensors, water extraction algorithms, and big data processing capabilities, none of the available global water extent data sets can meet the necessary requirements in terms of accuracy and spatio-temporal resolutions. Due to the inherent complexity of monitoring the river surface extent, efforts have been limited to the development of global river extent data sets with a limited number of temporal layers usually obtained from long-term averaged satellite imagery.In this study, we propose a region-based image restoration algorithm to obtain the river surface extent from a pre-existing global inland water data set by incorporating temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels. We employ our algorithm on the Monthly Water History maps of the Global Surface Water data set (Pekel et al., 2016). We validate the proposed method on 98 river reaches that their average width ranges from approximately 36 m to 3400 m with in situ discharge measurements in the Mississippi, Amazon, Niger and Po river basins. The obtained river width time series exhibit a strong monotonic relationship with discharge measurements as the Spearman correlation coefficients are predominantly larger than 0.70 (on average 0.74 for Mississippi, 0.84 for Amazon, 0.86 for Niger and 0.77 for Po rivers). Such a performance confirms that the proposed method can facilitate the acquisition of a global dynamic river extent data set, which plays a key role in better understanding the distribution and availability of freshwater across continents.

TI  - Range-wide site-occupancy modeling of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus)
T2  - Journal of Urban Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, habitat loss and land conversion are major drivers of bird population decline. To halt the decline, it is essential that habitat conservation and restoration efforts are based on an understanding of how individual species use their habitat. Here, we examine habitat use by Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) by quantifying their probability of occurrence in different land cover types and in association with varying degrees of habitat modification across most of the species' range. To do so, we used the citizen-science eBird dataset, in combination with MODIS land cover data to model site occupancy for two breeding seasons and related presence/absence to the Global Human Modification Index. We found that Red-winged Blackbirds occupy rural and suburban habitats at higher probabilities than they do habitats with high levels of urbanization, and at similar or higher probabilities than they do their historic, natural habitats. Furthermore, we found that occurrence probability peaks at intermediate values of the Global Human Modification Index. The results were consistent across most ecoregions and the geographic range of the species, confirming that the Red-winged Blackbird is a suburban-adaptable species, persisting in moderately disturbed environments. Although more research is needed to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this pattern of habitat use, our results provide novel data on Red-winged Blackbird habitat use in the midst of increasing urbanization. More broadly, they provide insight into how common, widespread avian species may be affected by anthropogenic disturbance and highlight the importance of rural and suburban environments in urban ecology and evolution.

TI  - Lake dynamics in Tibetan Plateau during 1990-2020 and exploratory factor analyses using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes are crucial water resources for many countries, and the region is sensitive to climate change, so the TP lakes' dynamics have always been the focus of TP research. Given the vastness of the TP, the diversity of topography, geomorphology, and meteorological features, and the significant disparities in precipitation between river basins, it is vital to examine lake dynamics and influencing variables from the basin's perspective. Based on Landsat imageries and supported by Google Earth Engine, lakes were mapped from 1990 to 2020. Results show that the TP lake's number and area have increased significantly in recent 30 years except for a noticeable shrinkage from 1990 to 1995 and a slight decrease from 2013 to 2015. The lake area in the endorheic region basin area has grown obviously, with the most significant dynamics in the Qiangtang Basin, where the lake's number and total area have increased by about 30% over the 30 years. In contrast, the lake areas in the outflow region basins were relatively stable. The dynamics were obviously affected by temperature, but the influencing factors and degree of influence on different river basins vary. The lake area in the Amu Dayra Basin and the Yellow Basin was more closely related to precipitation, and the lake area in the Hexi Basin was more related to temperature. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of lake spatial-temporal dynamics in the Tibetan Plateau and its river basins and a reference for studying lake long time series.

TI  - InSAR-based investigation on spatiotemporal characteristics of river sediment behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the purpose of investigating spatiotemporal characteristics of river sediment behavior, we proposed a strategy integrating the PS-InSAR technique together with gridding spatial calculation to estimate time series change of sediment volume over the Baibufan section in Daan River in Taiwan. Firstly, the PS-InSAR performance based on ascending/descending and all-season/dry-season-only images were examined to identify the most optimal Sentinel-1 image data set. Subsequently, the estimated results were validated through internal and external validations. Once the PS-InSAR results were proved reliable, we utilized the advantages of the long-term wide-extent observation to investigate the sediment behavior over sequential wet/dry seasons and relatively long hydrological seasons. Based on the estimation of sediment volume change, the most severe erosion occurred in the wet season starting from 2019/04. The erosion volume reached 1513.652 m3 and 1194.829 m3, respectively, in high and median water coverage areas. Moreover, based on the sediment maps, the sediment distribution along the river was visualized, in which the regions prone to erosion or deposition were also identified. As the strategy for investigating the detailed spatial- and temporal-wise river sediment was proved feasible, we are able to perform a regular observation to determine the deposition and erosion zones. The corresponding change of sediment volume can subsequently be estimated for an early warning of damage of hydraulic facilities or settlements along the river.

TI  - Spatial-temporal evolution of vegetation coverage and its relationship with terrain and human factors in the upper reaches of Ganjiang River Basin, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage is an important indicator for evaluating regional environmental quality. Based on MODIS NDVI and DEM data collected for the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River Basin, China, this study used trend analysis, coefficient of variation, Hurst index, and linear regression to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of vegetation coverage and its relationship with terrain factors in the basin during the years 2000-2020. The vegetation coverage in the study area showed a fluctuating increasing trend at a rate of 5%/10y, and an increasing trend with increasing elevation. The maximum vegetation coverage was identified in the elevation zone of 750-1,000 m, with an average of 83.54%. Vegetation coverage also showed an increasing trend with increasing slope. The maximum vegetation coverage was up to 82.22% in the slope zone of & GE;25 & DEG;. There were no significant differences among the distributions of vegetation coverage in different aspects because the terrain in the study area is not rugged enough to form barriers against sunlight. The vegetation coverage was relatively stable in the study area, with an average coefficient of variation of 14.8%. Hurst analysis showed that the anti-sustainability effect of vegetation change was stronger than that of sustainability, and weak anti-sustainability was dominant. The effects of human activities mainly concentrated in the areas of low elevation and small slopes less than 2 degrees where cities and towns are located. The findings can provide a scientific basis for the management of regional ecosystems in the future.

TI  - How to measure large-scale complex urban network structures using night-time light satellite databases. Application to European metropolitan regions
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article uses new methods and evidence from satellite data on night lighting to assess the urban network structure of 100 European metropolitan regions. Its aim was to develop indicators to test the hypothesis that complex urban networks are more efficient economically and less dependent on energy consumption owing to better information organization. It uses NPP-VIIRS NTL satellite data on night lighting (NTL) and employs a topographical representation of NTL intensities to detect urban centers. Based on the distribution of NTL intensities in urban centers represented as a Lorenz curve, it develops two new indicators of monocentricity and polycentricity to evaluate large-scale urban network structures. The results show that polycentric urban networks create more innovation, which allows them to be more economically efficient and less dependent on energy consumption. Further research should study in greater detail the relationships between urban network structures and their social, economic, and ecological performances.

TI  - Evolution and expansion of the One Health approach to promote sustainable and resilient health and well-being: A call to action
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - One Health is a transdisciplinary approach used to address complex concerns related to human, animal, plant, and ecosystem health. One Health frameworks and operational tools are available to support countries and communities, particularly for the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance and the protection of food safety. However, One Health has yet to be implemented in a manner that fully considers the complexities and interconnectedness of the diverse influences that have impacts at a larger system level. This lack of consideration can undermine the sustainability of any positive outcomes. To ensure the One Health approach can function effectively within the new global context of converging and escalating health, social, economic, and ecological crises, it must evolve and expand in three overlapping dimensions: (1) Scope: the partners, knowledge, and knowledge systems included, (2) Approach: the techniques, methodologies, and scholarship considered, and (3) Worldview inclusivity: the interweaving of other worldviews together with the mainstream scientific worldview that currently predominates. Diverse partners and knowledge from outside the mainstream health and scientific sectors, including Indigenous peoples and representatives of local communities, and traditionally generated knowledge, must be included. These systems of knowledge can then be braided together with mainstream science to comprise a holistic framework for decision-making. Scholarship and methodologies being applied in other fields and contexts to solve complex challenges and manage uncertainty, such as collaborative governance, social-ecologic systems theory, and complexity science, must be recognized and incorporated. The spectrum of considered worldviews must also expand to authentically integrate the expanded scope and approach into action and sustainable impact. By increasing community and social engagement and by recognizing and entwining different worldviews, the plurality of disciplines, and traditional and scientific ways of knowing to address community concerns in the contexts in which they exist, we can ensure that One Health remains effective and true to its paradigm in our rapidly changing and complex world.

TI  - Assessment of Chlorophyll-a Seasonal Cycle in the North Indian Ocean Using Observations from OCM2, MODIS, and SeaWiFS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A study on the seasonal variability of Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in the north Indian Ocean is carried out based on observations from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002-2017, Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) during 1999-2009 and Ocean Color Monitor 2 during 2010-2020. The number of valid data points varied from 40-60% for OCM2 to > 60% for MODIS and SeaWiFS. Although OCM2 exhibits a similar probability distribution as that of the MODIS and SeaWiFS, it differs significantly in its mean and variance. The OCM2 has 80% pixels below 1 mg m(-3) Chl-a in the continental shelf domain (10-150 depth contours) with a mean of 3.5 +/- 5.5 mg m(-3) while MODIS and SeaWiFS are highly coherent with each other and exhibit 60% pixels in the same range with the smaller mean of 2.5 +/- 3.05 mg m(-3). In the continental slope and open ocean domain, 20% of OCM2 pixels vary in the lower range (< 0.25 mg m(-3)) and 60% pixels in the moderate range (0.25-0.75 mg m(-3)), while 60% of the MODIS and SeaWiFS pixels are in the lower range, and 20% in the moderate range. The spatial patterns of the annual and semiannual amplitudes are coherent among the datasets with a high Chl-a climatology (> 0.5 mg m(-3)), intense seasonality in the north Arabian Sea, and north Bay of Bengal and continental shelf around India and Sri Lanka. Moderate magnitudes of Chl-a climatology with reduced seasonality occur in the central Arabian Sea and Somalia offshore and southwestern Bay of Bengal adjacent to Sri Lanka. On the other hand, major parts of the open oceanic domain of the Bay, Equatorial Indian Ocean, and southeastern part of Arabian Sea show a very smaller climatological mean of Chl-a with reduced seasonality. The regions of high climatology and intense seasonality of Chl-a are co-occurring with upwelling and nutrient-rich zones. Chl-a also exhibits significant inter-annual variability in the areas of high climatological mean as a response to the background oceanic conditions and availability of nutrients which needs to be investigated.

TI  - Effect of the continental shelf in seasonal oceanographic conditions at the Northern edge of the Eastern Tropical Pacific
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The continental shelf in front of Nayarit is located in the northern limit of the tropical Eastern Pacific, characterized by constituting a convergence zone of different masses of water, forming an area of significant hydrographic variability. Based on satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis between 2003 and 2019 of sea surface temperature (SST), wind stress, Ekman velocity, and geostrophic velocity, the contribution of the seasonal cycle to the variability of the study area were analyzed through climatological means, Hovmohler diagrams, and Empirical Orthogonal Functions. The results show that in the zone in front of Matanche ' n Bay (21.5 degrees N) and the adjacent continen-tal shelf, there is a core of warm surface water. The distribution of the SST is explained by the seasonal pattern of meridional/zonal variability in the thermal gradient, where the EOFs show the influence of the annual scale in both modes, with the only difference being that the first describes the meridional gradient as the dominant signal (66.2%), and the second shows the zonal behavior of the thermal gradient (16.6%). The summer weakening of the wind stress and Ekman speed is the product of the irregular shape of the coastline, the extension of the continental shelf, and the divergence of the North American monsoon around 21 degrees N, whereas during the rest of the year an intensification of these parameters prevailed in front of Cabo Corrientes. On the other hand, the intense geostrophic flow in summer does not contribute to the increase in SST on the continental shelf because it diverges around 22.5 degrees N. Likewise, during the winter, the formation of a cyclonic geostrophic gyre located inside the continental shelf, between the coast and the Marias Islands, stands out. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Robust extension of the simple sea-surface irradiance model to handle cloudy conditions for the global ocean using satellite remote sensing data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-surface solar radiation (abbreviated as photosynthetically available radiation, PAR) in the visible wavelength (400-700 nm) is an essential parameter to estimate marine primary productivity and understanding phytoplankton dynamics, upper ocean physics and bio-geochemical processes. Although many remote-sensing models were developed to estimate daily PAR (DPAR) from ocean colour data, these models often produce biases in the DPAR products under cloudy-sky and complex atmospheric conditions due to the lack of parameterization to deal with the cloud cover conditions and insufficient in-situ DPAR data. This study presents an Extended Sea -surface Solar Irradiance Model (ESSIM) for estimating DPAR over the global ocean. The ESSIM uses the direct and diffuse components from the Simple sea-surface Solar Irradiance Model (SSIM) along with a new parameter to handle cloudy conditions. The ESSIM pro-duced DPAR products with greater accuracy under both clear and cloudy conditions. Its performance was tested on the time-series MODIS-Aqua images and compared with the concurrent in-situ data and the results from two global models. Results showed that the DPAR values produced by ESSIM agree with in-situ data better than the global models for all-sky conditions (with a mean relative error of 11.267 %; a root mean square error of 5.563 Em-2day-1; and a mean net bias of 2.917 Em-2day-1). The ESSIM performed slightly better than the SSIM for clear conditions and the Frouin's Operational Algorithm (FOA) for all-sky conditions. As the new parameterization accounts for cloudy conditions, the ESSIM produced more accurate results for cloud cover conditions across latitudes (up to 60 degrees). The time-series Level-3 binned MODIS-Aqua data (global gridded) also demonstrated that the ESSIM improved the accu-racy of DPAR products and produced spatially and temporally consistent DPAR products over the global ocean regardless of the sea-sons and sky conditions.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systema-tization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published.In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR-X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel-1 (S1) and RADARSAT-2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X-Band, S1 and RS2 work with C-Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detect -ability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model's uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements.In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X-Band in comparison to C-Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.

TI  - Histology, prevalence, and environmental sources for pulmonary silicates depositions in domestic and wild animals
T2  - VETERINARY PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The source and significance of pulmonary silicate crystals in animals and people are poorly understood. To estimate the prevalence and characterize the pulmonary crystalline material in animals from St. Kitts, tissue samples from dogs, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, mongooses, and monkeys were examined by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDXA), and x-ray diffraction. Crystalline material was seen in 201 of 259 (77.6%) lung samples as perivascular and interstitial accumulations of heterogeneous crystalline particulate material, free or within macrophages (silicate-laden macrophages [SLMs]), mostly lacking evidence of chronic inflammation or fibrosis. The crystalline material was birefringent, basophilic on acid-fast, and composed of silicas on SEM/EDXA. Mongooses (100%) and monkeys (98%) had the highest prevalence of SLM, followed by cattle and chickens. Lesions were graded on a 3-point scale based on the histologic location and extent of silicates and SLM and were significantly more severe in mongooses (median = 3) than in monkeys (median = 2), dogs (median = 2), and chickens (median = 1). On EDXA, the crystalline material from lungs, air, and topsoil was composed of silicon, oxygen, aluminum, and iron, with a particulate matter size between 2.5 and 10 mu m. We hypothesize Saharan dust, volcanic ash, topsoil, and rock quarry dust are potential sources of siliceous dust inhalation and SLM accumulations lacking chronic inflammation (silicosis); dust generation may be potentiated by road vehicle or wind suspension. Future investigations are warranted on the role of silicate inhalation and respiratory comorbidities in people, with monkeys, mongooses, or chickens serving as possible sentinels for exposure.

TI  - Multitemporal SAR image despeckling based on non-local theory
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a multitemporal SAR image despeckling based on non-local theory (NLG-MulSAR) algorithm is proposed, which is improved based on the basic framework of the ratio-based multitemporal SAR image denoising (RABASAR). The temporal and spatial information of a multitemporal SAR image is integrated. The super image and the ratio image acquisition part of the RABASAR algorithm are optimized by the NLG filtering algorithm. The NLG algorithm does not need to transform multiplicative noise into additive noise on a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image and then filter it. The NLG algorithm uses the nonlinear method to eliminate the influence of strong noise points while preserving image edge features. Based on the number of pixels in the non-local image block, the NLG algorithm avoids the generation of fuzzy noise on the filtered image. In this study, we use seven Gaofen three SAR images captured at different times in the Beijing area as experimental data to evaluate the effect of filtering methods in terms of five objective parameters: signal-to-noise ratio, standard deviation, equivalent number of looks, radiative resolution, and speckle noise index. In addition, based on the ratio image, we propose an index, namely the filtering edge coefficient of a multitemporal SAR image, to evaluate the filtering edge retention characteristics of a multitemporal SAR image. The results show that compared with the RABASAR filtering algorithm, the proposed NLG-MulSAR filtering algorithm can better balance the relationship between multiplicative noise and texture detail information and attenuate the speckle while protecting the texture detail information on the SAR image.

TI  - Rice growth period detection and paddy field evapotranspiration estimation based on an improved SEBAL model: Considering the applicable conditions of the advection equation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a vital role in surface energy balance and water management. Paddy rice is one of the most water-intensive crops and a staple food worldwide; thus, paddy field ET estimation is an impactful task. In this paper, an improved Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBALR) model is proposed to estimate the paddy field ET and is validated in different climate zones; it considers the advection effect and its applicable condition at the pixel scale and requires no ground-measured data. SEBALR contains two core modules: rice growth period detection and ET retrieval. SEBALR accurately monitored the planting and harvest dates, with an average error of less than 9 days, except for a paddy field located in the US, which had adopted dry seeding. The comparison between the estimation results and eddy covariance data shows that SEBALR can provide a more precise ET estimation than the original Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land, yielding a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.02 mm center dot d(-1), mean relative error (MRE) of 22.97% and Pearson's correlation (R-2) of 0.790. SEBALR successfully monitored paddy field ET from 2001 to 2019 in Nanchang City (NC), China. Yearly ET did not show an apparent change in trend from 2001 to 2019 in NC. SEBALR can be used to monitor the paddy rice growth period and estimate paddy field ET at a regional scale with limited data, providing helpful information for agricultural practices and water management.

TI  - The 31-gene expression profile test informs sentinel lymph node biopsy decisions in patients with cutaneous melanoma: results of a prospective, multicenter study
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe 31-gene expression profile test (Class 1A: low-risk; 1B/2A: intermediate-risk; 2B: high-risk) is validated to identify patients with cutaneous melanoma who can safely forego sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The objective of the current study is to quantify SLNB reduction by clinicians using 31-GEP.MethodsPatients with T1-T2 tumors eligible for SLNB were seen by surgical oncologists (89.1%), dermatologists (7.8%), and medical oncologists (3.1%). After receiving 31-GEP results but before SLNB, clinicians were asked which clinical and pathological features influenced SLNB decisions (n = 191). The Exact binomial test was used to compare SLNB procedure rates to a contemporary study (78% SLNB baseline rate). Logistic regression modeling (odds ratio [OR], 95% CI) was used to identify features associated with SLNB procedure rates.ResultsOne hundred clinical decisions (52.4%) were influenced by the 31-GEP to forego SLNB and 70% (70/100) were not performed. Of the 30 performed, 0% (0/30) were positive. The 31-GEP influenced sixty-three clinical decisions (33.0%) to perform SLNB, and 92.1% (58/63) were performed. There was a clinically meaningful 29.4% reduction of SLNBs performed in patients with a Class 1A result relative to the baseline rate of 78.0% (p < .01). In patients >= 55 or >= 65-year-old, SLNB reduction was 32.3% (p < .01), 28.3% (p < .01), respectively. Overall, 85.3% of decisions relating to SLNB were influenced by 31-GEP results.ConclusionIn this prospective, multicenter study, clinicians demonstrated clinically meaningful use of the 31-GEP test to forego or pursue SLNB in patients with T1-T2 tumors resulting in a significant, risk appropriate decrease in SLNBs.

TI  - Spatiotemporal fusion of multi-source remote sensing data for estimating aboveground biomass of grassland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of aboveground biomass of grasslands is key to sustainable grassland utilization. However, most satellites cannot provide high temporal and spatial resolution data. Patterns of grassland dynamics asso-ciated with variability in climate conditions across spatiotemporal scales are yet to be adequately quantified. A spatiotemporal fusion model offers the opportunity to combine the resolution advantages of different remote sensing data to achieve a high frequency and high precision monitoring of vegetation. We test a flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) methodology to generate synthetic normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data sets. The meth-odology is tested for the semi-arid grassland of the Xilin River Basin, China. Based on NDVI data fusion and field measured aboveground biomass an aboveground biomass estimation model is established for the watershed. Exploring the temporal and spatial changes of biomass and its relationship with environmental factors. The results show that: (1) The FSDAF model performs well (R2 = 0.75) and has clear textural features. (2) The established Support Vector Machine Aboveground Biomass model not only ensured the accuracy of estimation (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 15.43 g/m2), but also generated spatiotemporal maps of biomass with higher spatial (30 m) and temporal resolution (8 days). (3) The grassland aboveground biomass in this area decreases from southeast to northwest, and the grassland biomass reaches its peak at the end of July. The average biomass of different grasslands decreases in the order of meadow grassland > typical grassland > desert grassland. (4) Aboveground biomass increased linearly with increasing water content, organic carbon and total nitrogen, and was most sensitive to soil water content. During the early growing and rapid growing period, aboveground biomass is mainly affected by both air temperature and precipitation, while the effects of temperature and human activities gradually dominate in the middle and late growing periods. This study helps to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of dynamic monitoring of grassland biomass, and provides a scientific basis for grassland protection and management in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Detecting patterns of post-fire pine regeneration in a Madrean Sky Island with field surveys and remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The American Southwest is experiencing drastic increases in aridity and wildfire incidence, triggering conversion of some frequent surface forests to non-forest. Extensive research has focused on these dynamics in regional ponderosa pine forests, but we know much less about Madrean pine-oak forests, which are broadly distributed from the Sierra Madre in Mexico to the Sky Island mountain ranges in the U.S. Increased fire incidence and drought in these forests are limiting pine regeneration and driving conversion of biodiverse forests to oak shrublands. We investigated regeneration patterns in Pines engelmannii and P. leiophylla during severe drought 10 years after the Horseshoe Two Megafire in the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona-a follow-up to an assessment five years post-fire. In long-term plots, we examined changes in pine seedling and resprout recruitment. Past research demonstrated that topography and fire severity influenced pine recruitment across environmental gradients. We investigated here whether Landsat-8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration estimated by the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) added explanatory value to our understanding of these patterns. Conversion of Madrean pine-oak forest to oak shrublands continued 6-10 years post-fire. A dense, low oak canopy continued to coalesce in sites subject to severe fire. The importance of resprouts in P. leiophylla regeneration accelerated because these plants outgrew competing oak resprouts. Topography and fire severity (dNBR) were important predictors of 2021 patterns of pine recruitment. NDVI added explanatory value to these models, suggesting its potential in tracking forest dynamics. Evapotranspiration did not add value, likely because ECOSTRESS' larger pixel sizes and moving pixel locations created excessive subpixel heterogeneity in this highly dissected landscape. These models suggest that P. engelmannii is more drought sensitive, was more negatively affected by drought and fire, and is more at risk to shifts in climate and wildfires than P. leiophylla.

TI  - Machine learning based object-level crop classification of PlanetScope data at South India Basin
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Crop classification is of great significance as it opens doors to agricultural inventory and research related to crop mapping, crop yield, and economic analysis. In most studies to date, openly accessible satellites like Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS are generally used. These satellites suffer from low spatial resolution as well as high revisit rates. Further, the classification in these studies is carried out at pixel level, which is not reliable as per-pixel spectral analysis often gives ambiguous results. Thus, this study proposes the use of high-resolution temporal PlanetScope imagery with an average spatial resolution of 3.7 m for object-based image analysis (OBIA) at the Southern Indian basin at the River Krishna. This area is abundant with a variety of crops like paddy, chilli, maize, lily, colocasia, curry leaves, mint, bhindi, banana, betel leaves, and sugarcane. The latest available ground truth data was from 2017 and hence, this has been used. Despite this data being a year older than the one used in a previous study, good and commendable accuracies were still produced by this work. The machine learning (ML) modelling and evaluation was carried out in Python while Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used as the primary platform for feature extraction, dataset preparation, and visualization of the final crop-classified image. For the purpose of object-based classification, this paper puts forward Support Vector Machines (SVM). To provide a comparative analysis to justify the performance of modelled SVM, several other ML algorithms like Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Bayes Classifier were then modelled for this methodology in this study area. The results show that SVM performed best, with a high accuracy of 94.3%. All other algorithms modelled showed less accuracy comparatively, but were still above 75%.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nepal-one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world-has witnessed unplanned urbanization in recent decades. Nevertheless, spatial-temporal dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) in major cities of Nepal are not well understood. This study investigates LULC changes in the 12 rapidly urbanizing cities of Nepal from 1990 to 2020. Freely accessible Landsat images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based analysis platform were used to classify the city landscape into five major classes: vegetation, agriculture, barren, water body, and built-up using a random forest algorithm. Built-up areas have continuously increased in the Nepali cities mostly at expense of agricultural lands thus agriculture areas have decreased, and vegetation areas have followed mixed trends during each of the three decades. Biratnagar, Janakpur, Kathmandu, Nepalgunj, and Rajbiraj showed an overall increase in built-up areas at the expense of vegetation and agricultural lands while Bharatpur, Bire-ndranagar, Dhangadhi, Ghorahi, Hetauda, Pokhara, and Tulsipur showed an overall decrease in agricultural areas with increased built-up areas and vegetation from 1990 to 2020. This study will assist the policymakers, city planners, and local governments to formulate sustainable urban development strategies and plans to prevent haphazard urban growth while preserving the city's agricultural lands to promote local food supply and green areas to ensure an uninhibited flow of ecosystem services in the cities.

TI  - Sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic current velocity from altimetry measurements over the Arctic Ocean (2011-2020)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry missions flying over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean have opened the possibility of further understanding changes in the ocean beneath the sea ice. This requires complex processing of satellite signals emerging from the sea surface in leads within the sea ice, with efforts to generate consistent Arctic-wide datasets of sea surface height ongoing. The aim of this paper is to provide and assess a novel gridded dataset of sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic velocity, which incorporates both the ice-covered and open ocean areas of the Arctic. Data from the CryoSat-2 mission in the period 2011-2020 were gridded at monthly intervals, up to 88 & LCIRC; N, using the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) method. To examine the robustness of our results, we compare our dataset to independent satellite data, mooring time series and Arctic-wide hydrographic observations. We find that our dataset is well correlated with independent satellite data at monthly timescales. Comparisons to in situ ocean observations show that our dataset provides reliable information on the variability of sea surface height and surface geostrophic currents over geographically diverse regions of the Arctic Ocean and different dynamical regimes and sea ice states. At all comparison sites we find agreement with in situ observed variability at seasonal to interannual timescales. Furthermore, we find that our geostrophic velocity fields can resolve the variability of boundary currents wider than about 50 km, a result relevant for studies of Arctic Ocean circulation. Additionally, large-scale seasonal features emerge. Sea surface height exhibits a wintertime Arctic-wide maximum, with the highest amplitude over the shelves. Also, we find a basin-wide seasonal acceleration of Arctic slope currents in winter. We suggest that this dataset can be used to study not only the large-scale sea surface height and circulation, but also the regionally confined boundary currents. The dataset is available in netCDF format from PANGAEA at .

TI  - A service-oriented framework for remote sensing big data processing
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In recent years, one of the biggest concerns of researchers has been environmental knowledge. This concern can be resolved by collecting and processing remote sensing data in the shortest possible time and cost with the highest accuracy and efficiency. In remote sensing, various types of satellite data are processed for different purposes and applications. In this process, data storage and processing methods, resource management, scalability, performance improvement, and efficiency are among the issues and challenges in this scope. This paper presents a service-oriented framework using big data and parallel processing in remote sensing to address these challenges. The proposed framework provides scalability, flexibility, and generalization without dependency on specific data or processing techniques. In addition, it provides reasonable results to quality criteria such as response time, efficiency, and performance. The evaluation results of the proposed framework show the effectiveness of the framework for various types of analysis of remote sensing data with acceptable accuracy.

TI  - The potential of combining satellite and airborne remote sensing data for habitat classification and monitoring in forest landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring of habitats are requirements for protecting biodiversity. In this study, we investigated the benefit of combining airborne (laser scanning, image-based point clouds) and satellite-based (Sentinel 1 and 2) data for habitat classification. We used a two level random forest 10-fold leave-location-out cross-validation workflow to model Natura 2000 forest and grassland habitat types on a 10 m pixel scale at two study sites in Vienna, Austria. We showed that models using combined airborne and satellite-based remote sensing data perform significantly better for forests than airborne or satellite-based data alone. For frequently occurring classes, we reached class accuracies with F1-scores from 0.60 to 0.87. We identified clear difficulties of correctly assigning rare classes with model-based classification. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of the workflow to identify errors in reference data and point to the opportunities for integration in habitat mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Impacts of the dry season on rice production using Landsat 8 in West Sumatra
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the impact of the dry season on rice production using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in Ampek Angkek sub-district, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a monitoring system for rice production in the dry season by utilizing Landsat 8 OLI and (ii) to evaluate the impact of the dry season on rice production at the sub-district scales. A supervised classification method was applied to detect rice cultivation during the dry season from Landsat 8 OLI imageries. The reference of NDVI was obtained by a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera. This study shows that the NDVI of Landsat 8 Lv2 had a good correlation with the NDVI of UAV (R = 0.826) compared with Landsat 8 Lv1 (R = 0.783). The result of the error matrix and accuracy of NDVI classification of Landsat 8 Lv2 found that the overall accuracy of NDVI Landsat 8 Lv2 was 87.1%, with Kappa accuracy of 71.8%. This study predicted rice production in the dry season by a linear function of NDVI from Landsat 8 Lv2 with a significant correlation (R = 0.658). The total rainfall during the dry season positively correlated with rice production with a high correlation (R = 0.923). In addition, this study could explain that the dry season parameters (i.e., the amount of rainfall, the onset, the end, and the duration) had an impact on the predicted rice production in Ampek Angkek sub-district.

TI  - Demarcation of subsurface water storage potential zone and identification of artificial recharge site in Vel River watershed of western India: integrated geospatial and hydrogeological modeling approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface water storage potential zone (SWSPz) is used as the source of water for household, agricultural, and industrial activities. The current study uses the integrated approach of geospatial, hydrogeological, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on the influencing parameter for subsurface water storage potential zones and its artificial recharge structure in western India's semi-arid watershed. The thematic map of the influencing parameter will be created using remote sensing data, secondary data, and maps of topography, lithology, drainage density, overland runoff, landform categorization, land use/land cover, type of soil, and vadose zone. The study's findings show that the region's SWSPz is high in about 14.22% of the area, while groundwater recharge potential is intermediate in about 38.05% of the land and low in about 34.70% and 13.03% of poor the area, respectively. The study's validity was validated by superimposing groundwater level point data onto the final output map, which revealed a good accuracy with the findings. The CGWB approach was also utilized to analyze the surplus water availability, and the findings reveal a vadose area of 40.08 MCM with an artificial recharge of 53.31 MCM. Finally, to recharge the rainwater, suitable site was identified within the study area such as Check dam, Nala bund and percolation tank. The fourteen check dams were identified on third-fourth-order stream present at moderate to high storage potential zone. While twenty-three nala bunds and five percolation ponds were also identified in the study area, it showed good accuracy with ground truth data. In nutshell, to increase the subsurface water potential, the integrated geospatial and hydrogeological modeling approach will be useful for decision makers.

TI  - Effect of wind on summer chlorophyll-a variability in the Yellow Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Winds potentially affect primary production in shelf seas during the stratified season by enhancing upwelling and mixing. However, the exact extent and modalities of this effect in the Yellow Sea remain unclear. Here, based on the satellite and in situ observation data, statistical method, and wind-driven upwelling theory, we examined the wind effect on the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) variability in the summer of 2002-2020 and the effect mechanism. The satellite data revealed a significantly positive correlation between anomalies of the monthly mean of the summer sea surface Chl-a and wind speed at the continental slope region (water depth of 20-60 m) in the southwestern Yellow Sea where strong wind-driven upwelling has been indicated by previous studies. The wind-driven upwelling along the continental slope was further verified using two summer in-situ observations. After a fortnight of southeasterly wind, the upwelling patterns of high salinity and rich nutrients from the Yellow Sea cold water mass were observed, and consequently, high Chl-a concentrations occurred in the upper layer of the slope region. The wind-driven upwelling occurred in the region at water depth of similar to 20-60 m, which is consistent with the result of the wind-driven coastal upwelling theory (0.5D < water depth < 1.25D, where D is the thickness of the Ekman layer). The dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate fluxes contributed by wind-driven upwelling were estimated as 1345 +/- 674 mmol/m2/d, 81 +/- 45 mmol/m(2)/d and 1460 +/- 899 mmol/m2/d, respectively, accounting for 30%-40% of total nutrient supply, and were several times larger than that contributed by the turbulent mixing, which can explain why the strong wind-Chl-a correlation only occurred at the upwelling region rather than the entire sea. In addition, in this region, the interannual variability of the summer mean Chl-a was negatively correlated to both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indexes, due to the opposite phase of the summer wind anomaly and the PDO/ENSO. This study revealed the wind effect on the shelf phytoplankton is regional and highlighted that wind could be a pivotal factor driving the climate variability of shelf primary production in the stratified season.

T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of hematoma characteristics and hematoma expansion (HE) in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsThis multicenter prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive adult patients with non-traumatic ICH admitted to three Italian academic hospitals (Salerno, Padova, Reggio Emilia) over a 2-year period. Early noncontrast CT (NCCT) features of the hematoma, including markers of HE, and 3-month outcome were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of poor outcome.ResultsA total of 682 patients were included in the study [mean age: 73 & PLUSMN; 14 years; 316 (46.3%) females]. Pontine and massive hemorrhage, intraventricular bleeding, baseline hematoma volume > 15 mL, blend sign, swirl sign, margin irregularity & GE; 4, density heterogeneity & GE; 3, hypodensity & GE; 1, island sign, satellite sign, and black hole sign were associated with a higher risk of mortality and disability. However, at multivariate analysis only initial hematoma volume (OR 29.71) proved to be an independent predictor of poor functional outcome at 3 months.ConclusionSimple hematoma volume measured on baseline CT best identifies patients with a worse outcome, while early NCCT markers of HE do not seem to add any clinically significant information.

TI  - Estimating building energy efficiency from street view imagery, aerial imagery, and land surface temperature data
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current methods to determine the energy efficiency of buildings generally require on-site visits of certified energy auditors which makes the process slow, costly, and geographically incomplete. To accelerate the identification of promising retrofit targets on a large scale, we propose to estimate building energy efficiency from widely available and remotely sensed data sources only, namely street view, aerial view, footprint, and satellite-borne land surface temperature (LST) data. After collecting data for almost 40,000 buildings in the United Kingdom, we combine these data sources by training multiple end-to-end deep learning models with the objective to classify buildings as energy efficient (EU rating A-D) or inefficient (EU rating E-G). After evaluating the trained models quantitatively as well as qualitatively, we extend our analysis by studying the predictive power of each data source in an ablation study. We find that the end-to-end deep learning model trained on all four data sources achieves a macro-averaged F1 score of 64.64% and outperforms models trained on building energy consumption data by 9.78%. As industry experts use building energy consumption data to approximate a building's energy efficiency prior to a potential on-site inspection, this work shows the potential and complementary nature of remotely sensed data in predicting energy efficiency and opens up new opportunities for future work to integrate additional data sources.

TI  - First results of Antarctic sea ice type retrieval from active and passive microwave remote sensing data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar sea ice is one of the Earth's climate components that has been significantly affected by the recent trend of global warming. While the sea ice area in the Arctic has been decreasing at a rate of about 4 % per decade, the multi-year ice (MYI), also called perennial ice, is decreasing at a faster rate of 10 %-15 % per decade. On the other hand, the sea ice area in the Antarctic region was slowly increasing at a rate of about 1.5 % per decade until 2014, and since then it has fluctuated without a clear trend. However, no data about ice type areas are available from that region, particularly for MYI. Due to differences in the physical and crystalline structural properties of sea ice and snow between the two polar regions, it has become difficult to identify ice types in the Antarctic. Until recently,no satellite retrieval scheme was ready to monitor the distribution and temporal development of Antarctic ice types, particularly MYI, throughout the freezing season and on timescales of several years. In this study, we have adapted a method for retrieving Arctic sea ice types and partial concentrations using microwave satellite observations to fit the Antarctic sea ice conditions. The core of the retrieval method is a mathematical scheme that needs empirical distributions of the microwave brightness temperature and backscatter input parameters for the different ice types. The first circumpolar, long-term time series of Antarctic sea ice types (MYI, first-year ice, and young ice) is being established, and so far covers the years 2013-2021. Qualitative comparison with (a) synthetic aperture radar data, (b) charts of the development stage of the sea ice, and (c) the Antarctic polynya distribution data show that the retrieved ice types, in particular the MYI, are reasonable. Although there are still some shortcomings, the new retrieval allows insight into the interannual evolution and dynamics of Antarctic sea ice types for the first time. The current time series can in principle be extended backwards to start in the year 2002 and can be continued with current and future sensors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of glacier surface area, annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA), and accumulation area ratio (AAR) in Mago basin, Eastern Himalaya, are studied over 1988-2019 using Landsat data. The glacier surface area was mapped using automatic glacier extraction index (AGEI) and 49 glaciers named as G1-G49 were found in 2019. Fifteen glaciers with area greater than 1 km2 in 2019 were selected for analysis. An automatic GIS tool comprising area altitude balance ratio (AABR), AAR, and mean glacier elevation (MGE), and combination of NIR band and Otsu threshold, were used for determining ELA. All glaciers experienced area shrinkage with a total loss of 15.22 km2 (28.48%) @0.49 km2 (0.92%) per annum. G1, G9, G15, G35, G41, and G42 showed significant decreasing trend in area. Glaciers facing South-West showed highest deglaciation. For the annual ELA, all glaciers showed increasing trend and significant increasing trend was observed in G2, G15, and G40. Overall, there was an increase in ELA by 137.3 m @4.43 m/year. The average AAR varied from 0.44 to 0.97. Average AAR of about 0.8 was observed in South, South-East, and North facing, about 0.6 in South-West and West facing, and about 0.7 in East facing glaciers.

I analyse aspects of Chesterton's methodology as an apologist which strongly suggest the influence of Newman. I then argue that Newman may have exercised a greater influence on Lewis's methodology as an apologist, through Chesterton, than has previously been realised. This raises questions for future study concerning Newman's possible influence, not only on Lewis, but on the other Inklings and related thinkers such as Dorothy Sayers.

TI  - An improved algorithm for estimating the Secchi disk depth of inland waters across China based on Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing of the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) in waters is beneficial for large-scale monitoring of the aquatic ecology of inland lakes. Herein, an improved algorithm (termed as Z(SD20) in this work) for retrieving Z(SD) was developed from field measured remote sensing data and is available for various waters including clear waters, slightly turbid waters, and highly turbid waters. The results show that Z(SD20) is robust in estimating Z(SD) in various inland waters. After further validation with an independent in situ dataset from 12 inland waters (0.1 m < Z(SD) < 18 m), the developed algorithm outperformed the native algorithm, with the mean absolute square percentage error (MAPE) reduced from 32.8 to 19.4%, and root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.87 to 0.67 m. At the same time, the new algorithm demonstrates its generality in various mainstreaming image data, including Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Finally, the algorithm's application was implemented in 410 waters of China based on Sentinel-2 MSI imagery to elucidate the spatiotemporal variation of water clarity during 2015 and 2021. The new algorithm reveals great potential for estimating water clarity in various inland waters, offering important support for protection and restoration of aquatic environments.

TI  - Glacial lake outburst flood risk assessment using remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling: a case study of Satluj basin, Western Himalayas, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier-associated hazards are becoming a common and serious challenge to the high mountainous regions of the world. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are one of the most serious unanticipated glacier hazards, with the potential to release a huge amount of water and debris in a short span of time, resulting in the loss of lives, property, and severe damage to downstream valleys. The present study used multi-temporal Landsat and Google earth imageries to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamism of the selected glacial lake (moraine-dammed) in the Satluj basin of Western Himalayas. Furthermore, GLOF susceptibility of the lake was assessed using a multi-criteria decision-based method. The results show that the lake area has increased from 0.11 to 0.26 km(2) over the past 28 years from 1990 to 2018. The susceptibility index value for the lake was calculated as 0.75, which indicates that the lake is highly susceptible to the GLOF. The depth and volume of the lake were estimated to be 16 m and 57 x 10(5) m(3), respectively, using an empirical formula. HEC-RAS, HECGeo-RAS, and Arc-GIS software were utilized in this study to perform unsteady flow analysis and to determine the GLOF impact on the downstream area. The worst-case GLOF scenario (breach width of 75 m) was revealed during an overtopping failure of the moraine dam, resulted in a peak discharge of 4060 m(3)/s and releasing a total water volume of 57 x 10(5) m(3). The breach hydrograph has been routed to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of peak flood, inundation depth, velocity, water surface elevation, and flood peak arrival time along the river channel. The analysis further reveals that the routed flood waves reach the nearest settlement, i.e., Rajpur town, situated at a distance of 102 km in the downstream valley of the lake at 6 h after the beginning of the lake breach event with a peak discharge/flood of 1757 m(3)/s and maximum flow velocity of 1.5 m/s. With the ongoing climate warming and glacier retreat, moraine-dammed lakes are becoming more hazardous and thus increasing the total threat. Therefore, it is mandatory to monitor and assess such lakes at regular intervals of time to lessen the disastrous impacts of GLOFs on the livelihood and infrastructure in the downstream valleys. The findings of this study will aid in the creation of risk management plans, preparatory tactics, and risk reduction techniques for GLOF hazards in the region.

TI  - Drought shocks and price adjustments in local food markets in Chile: Do product quality and marketing channel matter?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lately, economies have been facing an increase in the frequency and magnitude of droughts, which come with potential consequences on food prices. This article aims to analyze how drought disturbances affect price differences in local food markets. Special attention is paid to differences in product quality and marketing channels. To study the mechanism behind price differences, our analysis is framed within the food market integration theory. Our methodology follows a dyadic regression approach, which allows us to exploit the panel data structure of our market price data. We use monthly Asterix potato and long shelf-life tomato market prices from traditional markets and supermarkets in Chile. To measure drought intensity, we use remote sensing data to construct a drought index. Results show that drought shocks reduce market price differentials around harvesting and commercialization periods, which is supported by the existence of market integration. We also find that prices of high-quality products, less perishable products, and those taken from traditional markets respond more intensively to droughts and take more time to be transmitted. A direct link between droughts and crop quality, as well as supermarkets' larger capacity for buffer stock, may be behind these interpretations. Product differentiation and retail price rigidity arguments are also discussed.

TI  - Using DInSAR to inventory landslide geological disaster in Bijie, Guizhou, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are very complicated natural phenomena that create significant losses of life and assets throughout China. However, previous studies mainly focused on monitoring the development trend of known landslides in small areas, and few studies focused on the identification of new landslides. In addition, karst areas, where the vegetation is dense, the mountains are high, the slopes are steep, and the time incoherence is serious, have difficulty in tracking Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) landslides. Therefore, based on DInSAR technology, we use ALOS-2 PALSAR data to conduct continuous monitoring of existing hazards and identify new geological hazards in karst areas. The major results are as follows: 1) From June 11 to 6 August 2017, it was discovered that a hidden point of landslides occurred on the 420 m northwest mountain near the town of Zongling. It was determined that the landslide hidden point had been slipping for two consecutive years, with an average slip of 6.0 cm. From 4 September 2016 to 22 January 2017, undiscovered hidden points in the landslide account were found in Yinjiazhai. On 13 September 2016 and 22 November 2016, the discovered potential hazards in the landslide log book were the mountain hazards in southwestern Shiping village, and the deformation was 7.8 cm. 2) The DInSAR monitoring results from September to November 2016 showed that large deformations occurred in the landslide area of Shiping village. During a field visit, large cracks on the surface were found. The length of surface cracks in the southwest direction of Shiping village was 2.8 m. On 13 July 2017, Shiping collapsed as a result of the collapse of the mountainous area where the disaster occurred. The average slope of the landslide in the landslide area was approximately 65 & DEG;, the height was 95 m, the length and width were 150 m and 25 m, respectively, and the thickness was 5 m. The method has shown great potential in precisely identifying some new geological hazards sites, as well as tracking and monitoring the potential hazards of geological disasters listed on the landslide account.

TI  - Quality monitoring of inland water bodies using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular quality monitoring of inland water bodies is vital for identifying the areas with deteriorating water quality. Satellite remote sensing has been used for obtaining long-term trends that require the processing of many images. The computational load of processing a large number of satellite imageries can be eased by utilizing the cloud computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The present study explores the possibility of using the GEE platform for mapping the Trophic State Index (TSI) of an inland water body. The bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectance retrieved by the SIAC algorithm (used in the GEE platform) is assessed for its accuracy. The algorithm could retrieve only BOA reflectance at bands B3 and B4 of Sentinel 2L1C (S2) with reasonable accuracy. The study has identified the Normalized Difference of B3 and B4 bands of S2 (i.e., ND34) as the tool for mapping TSI of a water body on GEE. TSI from six imageries of three lakes was estimated with a mean error ,17%. The capability of GEE as a rapid water quality monitoring tool is demonstrated by displaying the temporal and spatial variations of water quality across Vembanad Lake for the period 2016-2021.

TI  - Butyrate producers, "The Sentinel of Gut": Their intestinal significance with and beyond butyrate, and prospective use as microbial therapeutics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gut-microbial butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of significant physiological importance than the other major SCFAs (acetate and propionate). Most butyrate producers belong to the Clostridium cluster of the phylum Firmicutes, such as Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Subdoligranulum, and Anaerobutyricum. They metabolize carbohydrates via the butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase pathway and butyrate kinase terminal enzymes to produce most of butyrate. Although, in minor fractions, amino acids can also be utilized to generate butyrate via glutamate and lysine pathways. Butyrogenic microbes play a vital role in various gut-associated metabolisms. Butyrate is used by colonocytes to generate energy, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor to maintain the anaerobic environment in the gut, maintains gut barrier integrity by regulating Claudin-1 and synaptopodin expression, limits pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12), and inhibits oncogenic pathways (Akt/ERK, Wnt, and TGF-beta signaling). Colonic butyrate producers shape the gut microbial community by secreting various anti-microbial substances, such as cathelicidins, reuterin, and beta-defensin-1, and maintain gut homeostasis by releasing anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IgA, vitamin B, and microbial anti-inflammatory molecules. Additionally, butyrate producers, such as Roseburia, produce anti-carcinogenic metabolites, such as shikimic acid and a precursor of conjugated linoleic acid. In this review, we summarized the significance of butyrate, critically examined the role and relevance of butyrate producers, and contextualized their importance as microbial therapeutics.

TI  - UAV hyperspectral imaging for multiscale assessment of Landsat 9 snow grain size and albedo
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo, a measure of the amount of solar radiation that is reflected at the snow surface, plays a critical role in Earth's climate and in regional hydrology because it is a primary driver of snowmelt timing. Satellite multi-spectral remote sensing provides a multi-decade record of land surface reflectance, from which snow albedo can be retrieved. However, this observational record is challenging to assess because discrete in situ observations are not well suited for validation of snow properties at the spatial resolution of satellites (tens to hundreds of meters). For example, snow grain size, a primary driver of snow albedo, can vary at the sub-meter scale driven by changes in aspect, elevation, and vegetation. Here, we present a new uncrewed aerial vehicle hyperspectral imaging (UAV-HSI) method for mapping snow surface properties at high resolution (20 cm). A Resonon near-infrared HSI was flown on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro over the meadow encompassing Swamp Angel Study Plot in Senator Beck Basin, Colorado. Using a radiative transfer forward modeling approach, effective snow grain size and albedo maps were produced from measured surface reflectance. Coincident ground observations were used for validation; relative to retrievals from a field spectrometer the mean grain size difference was 2 & mu;m, with an RMSE of 12 & mu;m, and the mean broadband albedo was within 1% of that measured near the center of the flight area. Even though the snow surface was visually homogenous, the maps showed spatial variability and coherent patterns in the freshly fallen snow. To demonstrate the potential for UAV-HSI to be used to improve validation of satellite retrievals, the high-resolution maps were used to assess grain size and albedo retrievals, and subpixel variability, across 17 Landsat 9 OLI pixels from a satellite overpass with similar conditions two days following the flight. Although Landsat 9 did not capture the same range of values and spatial variability as the UAV-HSI, on average the comparison showed good agreement, with a mean grain size difference of 9 & mu;m and the same broadband albedo (86%).

TI  - Semantic segmentation of water bodies in very high-resolution satellite and aerial images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the performance of convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of water bodies in very high-resolution satellite and aerial images from multiple sensors with particular focus on flood emergency response applications. Different model architectures (U-Net and DeepLab-V3+) are combined with encoder backbones (MobileNet-V3, ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B4) and tested for their ability to delineate inundated areas under varying environmental conditions and data availability scenarios. An unprecedented reference dataset of 1120 globally sampled images with quality checked binary water masks is introduced and used to train, validate and test the models for water body segmentation. Furthermore, independent test datasets are developed to test the generalization ability of the trained models across regions, sensors (IKONOS, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3 and four different airborne camera systems) and tasks (normal water and flood water segmentation). Results indicate that across all tested scenarios a U-Net model with Mobilenet-V3 backbone pretrained on ImageNet performs best. While using R-G-B image bands performs well, adding the near infrared band (if available) slightly improves prediction results. Similarly, adding slope information from an independent digital elevation model increases accuracies. Train-time augmentation and contrast enhancement could improve transferability across sensors and in particular between satellite and aerial images. Moreover, adding noisy training data from freely available online resources could further improve performance with minimal annotation effort.

TI  - Trophic status observations for Honghu Lake in China from 2000 to 2021 using Landsat Satellites
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of lakes harms aquatic organisms, changes the function of lakes and causes water pollution, which has affected global public health. As an internationally important wetland reserve, Honghu Lake is polluted to varying degrees and the eutrophication trend has accelerated. The objective of this study is to quarterly monitor and assess the trophic status of Honghu Lake from 2000 to 2021 using the trophic level index (TLI). The TLI was retrieved by developing a semi-empirical model based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), air temperature and water level data were added to the model as input parameters, forming a control group with the model that did not include air temperature and water level data. Based on 178 Landsat images from 2000 to 2021, the eutrophication status of the Honghu Lake over the last 20 years was successfully determined. The main findings are as follows: 1) The accuracy of TLI retrieval model, with air temperature and water level data included (R2 = 0.723, RMSE = 4.971), is significantly higher than that without air temperature and water level data (R2 = 0.197, RMSE =10.453); 2) The eutrophication level of the waters in the northwestern part of Honghu Lake was higher than those observed in other lake water; 3) There were significant seasonal fluctuations in the eutrophication of Honghu Lake. The highest TLI values were observed in summer and autumn, while the lowest values were observed in winter and spring; 4) The eutrophication trend of the Honghu Lake has significantly accelerated from 2013 onwards, showing a change in eutrophication status, from light eutrophic to mid-eutrophic. Our results indicate that the TLI retrieval method with air temperature and water level is more predictive. Moreover, the eutrophication status for the entire lake from 2000 to 2021 was determined, which may contribute to the protection of the water environment.

TI  - Long-term dynamics and drivers of particulate phosphorus concentration in eutrophic lake Chaohu, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate phosphorus (PP) plays an important biological role in the eutrophication process, and is thus an important water quality parameter for assessing climatic change and anthropogenic activity factors that affect aquatic ecosystems. Here, we used 20-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to explore the patterns and trends of PP concentration (CPP) in eutrophic Lake Chaohu based on a new empirical model. The validation results indicated that the developed model performed satisfactorily in estimating CPP, with a mean absolute percentage error of 31.89% and root mean square error of 0.022 mg/L. Long-term MODIS observations (2000-2019) revealed that the CPP of Lake Chaohu has experienced an overall increasing trend and distinct spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The driving factor analysis revealed that the chemical fertilizer con-sumption, municipal wastewater, industrial sewage, precipitation, and air temperature were the five potential driving factors and collectively explained more than 81% of the long-term variation in CPP. This study provides the long-term datasets of CPP in inland waters and new insights for future water eutrophication control and restoration efforts.

TI  - The association between stand and landscape level factors and red turpentine beetle damage in different infestation stages
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The red turpentine beetle (RTB), an invasive pest species, has infested large areas of pine forests and caused extensive tree mortality in North China. The ensuing substantial economic and ecological losses make under-standing the development and spread of RTB infestations critical. Although some studies have postulated how multiple factors affect bark beetle damage at different stages of population development, knowledge about this mechanism from empirical research is still limited. In recent years, RTB infestations in Heilihe Town of Inner Mongolia and Dahebei Town of Liaoning Province were at different phases (incipient and epidemic stages), which allowed us to explore the possible change mechanism of influencing factors. The present study aimed to identify the critical factors influencing RTB damage and determine whether the primary influencing factors changed during different RTB infestation stages. We established 42 and 40 sample plots in the Heilihe and Dahebei areas and measured the sample plots' canopy cover, slope, aspect, average diameter at breast height (DBH), elevation and RTB attack rate. Sentinel-2 images and trap data were used to obtain landscape-level variables, including host area, edge density and beetle pressure. We then developed generalized linear models to determine the impact of these explanatory variables on RTB damage. Our results found that the average RTB attack rate of the incipient and epidemic areas was, respectively, 5.35% and 31.45%. At the incipient stage, RTB infestations were mainly related to stand-level factors, including canopy cover and aspect. However, at the epidemic stage, RTB infestations were associated with stand (DBH) and landscape-level factors, in which host area and beetle pressure played an important role. Stand and landscape-level factors played diverse roles during different periods of RTB infestations. Such findings are valuable for understanding the colonization pattern of RTB and taking appropriate management interventions in different infestation stages.

TI  - Phytoplankton reaction to an intense storm in the north-western Mediterranean Sea
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of extreme weather events and their impact on ocean physics and biogeochemistry is challenging due to the difficulty involved with collecting in situ data. However, recent research has pointed out the major influence of such physical forcing events on microbiological organisms. Moreover, the occurrence of such intense events may increase in the future in the context of global change. In May 2019, an intense storm occurred in the Ligurian Sea (north-western Mediterranean Sea) and was captured during the FUMSECK (Facilities for Updating the Mediterranean Submesoscale - Ecosystem Coupling Knowledge) cruise. In situ multi-platform (vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler, thermosalinometer, fluorometer, flow cytometer, a moving vessel profiler equipped with a multi-sensor towed vehicle, and a glider) measurements along with satellite data and a 3D atmospheric model were used to characterise the fine-scale dynamics occurring in the impacted oceanic zone. The most affected area was marked by a lower water temperature (1 ? colder), a factor of 2 increase in surface chlorophyll a, and a factor of 7 increase in the nitrate concentration, exhibiting strong gradients with respect to the surrounding waters. Our results show that this storm led to a deepening of the mixed-layer depth from 15 to 50 m and a dilution of the deep chlorophyll maximum. As a result, the surface biomass of most phytoplankton groups identified by automated flow cytometry increased by up to a factor of 2. Conversely, the carbon / chlorophyll ratio of most phytoplankton groups decreased by a factor of 2, evidencing significant changes in the phytoplankton cell composition. These results suggest that the role of storms on the biogeochemistry and ecology of the Mediterranean Sea may be underestimated and highlight the need for high-resolution measurements during these events coupling physics and biology.

TI  - Study of coexisting upstream solitary wave packet and downstream wakes induced by Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands detected by satellite sun glitter
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the advantage of sun glitter (SG) observed from high-resolution satellites Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-6 (GF-6), a new method named Shield and Vortex 1-2 (SAV1-2) for extracting spatial texture information from sun glitter was established. Sea surface texture detail information around Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands was extracted using SAV1-2. Meanwhile, the dynamic characteristics of the water environment were analyzed by combining the water color, temperature and dynamic data. The results show the following information. (1) Stable westward shield effect and eastward Karman vortex streets, extracted from SG, appear upstream (westward) and downstream (eastward) of the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands respectively. (2) The dominant direction of the Kuroshio Current in the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands area is east, the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands interacting with Kuroshio, inducing western shield and eastern shelter and wake. Furthermore, wave intervals of the shield in front of the island range from hundreds to thousands of metres, and extend wider than the island itself. (3) Combining with high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, the directional changes of water color elements are mutually supported and proved with the stable shield (wave packet) effect in the west and vortex street effect in the east. The change of SST upstream of the island (western shield area) is not significant, the temperature in the downstream shelter area decreases slightly, and the SST in the downstream wake area shows a general trend of obvious decrease. The wake area is dominated by Karman vortex streets in shape, supplementing by vortices. The concentration of Chl a in the west shield of island is as low as that in downstream shelter area, while it increases significantly in the downstream wake area with shape in eddy or ribbon. (4) The SAV methods of extracting sea surface texture detail using SG can be widely used in different sea areas and water quality. This paper can provide reference for the protection and development of Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands and its surrounding waters. It is suggested that some kind of current buffer, such as marine wind farm, should be established in the western waters of Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands to protect the islands, and marine pasture should be developed in the downstream of eastern waters of Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands.

TI  - Improved estimation of vegetation water content and its impact on L-band soil moisture retrieval over cropland
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based soil moisture (SM) retrieval within agricultural regions is challenging due to pronounced vege-tation and land cover variations during the growing season. Vegetation water content (VWC)-used to describe vegetation opacity in both the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA) and V-po-larization Single Channel Algorithm (SCA-V)-is approximated using a climatological Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. To understand the impact of VWC algorithms on SMAP SM retrievals, we investigated optimal vegetation indices for VWC estimation, and further evaluated the impact of VWC uncer-tainty on DCA and SCA-V SM retrievals. Besides NDVI, we applied four dynamic vegetation indices (VIs) acquired from Sentinel-2-including two red-edge VIs (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI) and Inverted Red-edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI)) and two non-red-edge VIs (Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI1 and NDWI2)) to estimate growing-season corn VWC and the impact of different empirical relationships on VWC estimates. We find that climatological NDVI from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) significantly underestimates VWC, and therefore underestimates SM over croplands in Northwest China during the growing season, whereas dynamic VIs can improve the accuracy of VWC and SM retrievals. With respect to the choice of VI for VWC estimation, MCARI is more accurate during the peak growing season compared to its counterpart non-red-edge VIs; however, it also overestimates VWC during the early growing stage. In addition, the influence of VWC uncertainty on SM accuracy is shown to be higher in SCA-V than in DCA. The results of this study provide insight into preferred approaches for the accurate estimation of VWC and associated improvement in passive microwave algorithms for SM retrieval.

TI  - Changes in the number of cancer diagnosis practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic: interrupted time-series analysis using the National Database of Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to reveal the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the number of practices commonly used for cancer diagnosis in Japan.Methods The sampling dataset of the National Database of Japan from January 2015 to January 2021 was used to generate 25-point time-series data for the number of practices (21 points before and 4 points during the pandemic outbreak). The decreased number was estimated by interrupted time-series analysis using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. Using the pre-pandemic data, expected counterfactual numbers during the pandemic were predicted, and decreased rate was calculated.Results In most practices, the number dramatically decreased in the early stage of the pandemic and recovered rapidly thereafter. As of April 2020, gastric endoscopy decreased at the top of the practices (- 42.1%, with 95% confidence intervals of - 50.5% and - 33.7%), followed by gastric biopsy (- 38.6%, with 95% confidence intervals of - 46.7% and - 30.6%). The period of declined practices for lung cancer was relatively prolonged. The number of sentinel lymph node biopsies for breast cancer and colposcopies and biopsies for cervical cancer did not decrease in April 2020, but significantly decreased later in July 2020, which is assumed to be the time lapse after the primary testing before surgical treatment or intense scrutiny.Conclusion In general, the number of practices for cancer diagnosis in Japan showed only a temporary decline, which was concordant with reports from several other countries.

TI  - Achieving balance between socioeconomic development and ecosystem conservation via policy adjustments in Guangdong Province of southeastern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization improves socioeconomic development but challenges ecosystem sustainability. Meanwhile, the gradient responses of ecosystem services (ESs) to landscape structures and associated regime shifts of the agriculture-ecosystem-economy nexus (AEEN) have not been sufficiently addressed, preventing an effective balance between socioeconomic prosperity and ecosystem conservation. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study selected the Guangdong Province of southeastern China to explore landscape dynamics from 1985 to 2020 and their spatially heterogeneous impacts on ESs and the AEEN, based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs approach and other biophysical models as well as statistical records about socioeconomic factors. AEEN elements, including ESs, responded directly to policy adjustments in terms of ecosystem restoration and landscape management and presented remarkable regime shifts (i.e., phase changes) and spatial heterogeneity. Aggressive agricultural reclamation before 1999 increased crop productivity but caused vegetation degradation and biomass decline. Accelerated urban expansion and ecosystem restoration efforts have improved economic and ecological benefits but have substantially reduced crop productivity and threatened food security. However, timely policy adjustments since 2009 reversed the declining trend and maintained the grain supply. Landscape composition presented patterns of gradual decline along the urban-rural gradient, which in turn determined ES gradient patterns. For instance, water yield and nitrogen export positively correlated with each other (p < 0.0001) but negatively correlated with other ESs. Our study enriches the understandings of social-ecological systems' response to man-made interventions from AEEN perspective allowing for spatial variabilities and regime shifts, which support policy formulation for coordinating ecological and economic benefits.

TI  - Machine learning and GIS-RS-based algorithms for mapping the groundwater potentiality in the Bundelkhand region, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the groundwater potential zones with high accuracy is always a difficult task. The combination of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) with machine learning techniques provide a reliable method to map the groundwater prospective areas. This research used support vector machine (SVM) learning and random forest (RF) regression algorithms to predict the groundwater potential areas in the Bun-delkhand craton region. All the parameters that affect the groundwater occurrence in this region, such as alti-tude, aspect, distance to drainage, distance to road, distance to faults, geomorphology, distance to river, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, slope, soil, drainage density, land use land cover (LULC), topographic wetness index (TWI), lineament density and curvatures have been prepared by the remote sensing data as well as data taken from different departments and organizations. The training and testing dataset is generated from the groundwater potential zones map prepared through the frequency ratio (FR) technique. A total of 23,917-pixel locations have been selected in the research region. These locations contain the location of groundwater points and non-groundwater points equally. These points were randomly portioned into 70:30 for training and testing the model, respectively. The 2417 unknown points were taken from the study area and given to the trained model to predict the groundwater prospective areas. The maps of groundwater potential zones obtained using machine learning models were categorized into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The outcome of the employed algorithm is validated through the well discharge data and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) method. The developed model's outcome gives valuable information regarding the effective management of groundwater in a particular region to government agencies and private sectors.

TI  - Albumin-based nanoparticle for dual-modality imaging of the lymphatic system
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymphatic system is a complex network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs. The current understanding of the basic mechanism and framework of the lymphatic system is relatively limited and not ideal for exploring the function of the lymphatic system, diagnosing lymphatic system diseases, and controlling tumor metastasis. Imaging modalities for evaluating lymphatic system diseases mainly include lymphatic angiography, reactive dye lymphatic angiography, radionuclide lymphatic angiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. However, these are insufficient for clinical diagnosis. Some novel imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, and near-infrared imaging with agents such as cyanine dyes, can reveal lymphatic system information more accurately and in detail. We fabricated an albumin-based fluorescent probe for dual-modality imaging of the lymphatic system. A near-infrared cyanine dye, IR-780, was absorbed into bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was covalently linked to a molecule of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to chelate gadolinium Gd3+. The fabricated IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ nanocomposite demonstrates strong fluorescence and high near-infrared absorption and can be used as a T1 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. In vivo dual-modality fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging showed that IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ rapidly returned to the heart through the lymphatic circulation after it was injected into the toe webs of mice, facilitating good lymphatic imaging. The successful fabrication of the new IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ nanocomposite will facilitate the study of the mechanism and morphological structure of the lymphatic system.

TI  - Furan Donor for NIR-II Molecular Fluorophores with Enhanced Bioimaging Performance
T2  - RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) molecular fluorophores containing donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) conjugated backbone have attracted substantial attention due to their outstanding advantages, such as stable emission and facilely tuned photophysical properties. However, it is still challenging for them to simultaneously achieve high brightness and red-shifted absorption and emission. Herein, furan is adopted as the D unit to construct NIR-II fluorophores, demonstrating red-shift of absorption, enhanced absorption coefficient and fluorescent quantum yield when compared with the generally used thiophene counterparts. The high brightness and desirable pharmacokinetics of the optimized fluorophore, IR-FFCHP, endows improved performance for angiography and tumor-targeting imaging. Furthermore, dual-NIR-II imaging of tumor and sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) has been achieved with IR-FFCHP and PbS/CdS quantum dots, enabling the in vivo imaging navigated LNs surgery in tumor-bearing mise. This work demonstrates the potential of furan for constructing bright NIR-II fluorophores for biological imaging.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Nitrogen Dioxide and Nighttime Light Dataset of Iranian Metropolises in the COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 lockdown has caused a reduction in traffic volume and industrial activities which are the main sources of air pollution in whole of the world. As tropospheric NO2 pollutant and nighttime light (NTL) are the representative of human activities, this study focused to quantify the annual and monthly change of NO2 concentration and NTL in 14 metropolises of Iran before, during and after the lockdown months such as March, April, October and November. TROPOMI images of Sentinel-5p were used for investigation of NO2 column density in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and the variation of NTL was monitored by VIIRS images. The findings showed the majority of metropolises have an increase of NO2 concentration in March and October and a decrease in April and November in 2020 but a significant increase in 2021. The similar pattern of NTL change as NO2 was observed in the most metropolises. The correlation coefficient between NO2 concentration and NTL was calculated from 0.66 to 0.75. So, in majority of metropolises, the reduction of NO2 was observed with reduction of NTL. According to the results, reducing traffic volume as mobile source does not has an effective contribution in NO2 emission in some metropolises of Iran which the stationary sources are dominant such as Isfahan. Tehran as the capital of Iran showed the highest annual mean NO2 reduction in lockdown, this finding showed the important role of traffic volume on air quality of Tehran compared to industrial activities. The integrated application of TROPOMI and NTL data will help to better decision making for controlling and managing of air quality in country's urban area.

TI  - Remote sensing evaluation of winter cover crop springtime performance and the impact of delayed termination
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, the Maryland Department of Agriculture's Winter Cover Crop Program introduced a delayed termination incentive (after May 1) to promote springtime biomass accumulation. We used satellite imagery calibrated with springtime in situ measurements collected from 2006-2021 (n = 722) to derive biomass estimates for Maryland fields planted to cereal cover crop species (286,200 ha total over two seasons). Cover crop C content remained steady throughout the cover crop growing season (42.6% of biomass), whereas N concentration had an inverse relationship with biomass and ranged from 1.7 to 2.9%. Throughout Maryland, delayed termination fields (n = 19,120; average termination of May 18) were, on average, estimated to accumulate an additional 789 kg of biomass, 15 kg of N, and 336 kg of C per hectare when compared to fields associated with standard termination dates (n = 28,811; average termination of April 16). Over two cover crop seasons (2019-2021), the delayed termination incentive yielded an extra 75,660,000 kg biomass, 1,526,000 kg N, and 32,230,000 kg C across 96,040 hectares. Regularly terminated field incentives cost an average of US$0.10 per kg of biomass and $4.09 per kg of N, with variability associated with agronomic management (species, planting method). Delayed termination fields cost of $0.08 per kg of biomass and $3.51 per kg of N. Late-planted cover crops that were terminated early had minimal environmental benefit, and wheat, which comprised 68% of cover crop area, performed poorly compared with other cereal species. Our findings demonstrate that substantial additional springtime biomass, C, and N accumulation were achieved through the delayed termination incentive.

TI  - Dependency of sanitation infrastructure on the discharge of faecal coliform and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in wastewater from COVID and non-COVID hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater can be used as an indicator of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in specific catchment areas. We conducted a hospital-based study to explore wastewater management in healthcare facilities and analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the hospital wastewater in Dhaka city during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak between September 2020-January 2021. We selected three COVID-hospitals, two non-COVID-hospitals, and one non-COVID-hospital with COVID wards, conducted spot-checks of the sanitation systems (i.e., toilets, drainage, and septic-tank), and collected 90 untreated wastewater effluent samples (68 from COVID and 22 from non-COVID hospitals). E. coli was detected using a membrane filtration technique and reported as colony forming unit (CFU). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step kit for RT-qPCR amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N gene targets and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalent copies (GEC) per mL of sample. None of the six hospitals had a primary wastewater treatment facility; two COVID hospitals had functional septic tanks, and the rest of the hospitals had either broken onsite systems or no containment of wastewater. Overall, 100 % of wastewater samples were positive with a high concentration of E.coli (mean = 7.0 log10 CFU/100 mL). Overall, 67 % (60/90) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The highest SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (median: 141 GEC/mL; range: 13-18,214) were detected in wastewater from COVID-hospitals, and in non-COVID-hospitals, the median SARS-CoV-2 concentration was 108 GEC/mL (range: 30-1829). Our results indicate that high concentrations of E. coli and SARS-CoV-2 were discharged through the hospital wastewa-ter (both COVID and non-COVID) without treatment into the ambient water bodies. Although there is no evidence for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater, this study highlights the significant risk posed by wastewater from health care facilities in Dhaka for the many other diseases that are spread via faecal oral route. Hospitals in low-income settings could function as sentinel sites to monitor outbreaks through wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance systems. Hospitals should aim to adopt the appropriate wastewater treatment technologies to reduce the discharge of pathogens into the environment and mitigate environmental exposures.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles and melanoma: New perspectives on tumor microenvironment and metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer particles without functional nucleus naturally released from cells which constitute an intercellular communication system. There is a broad spectrum of vesicles shed by cells based on their physical properties such as size (small EVs and large EVs), biogenesis, cargo and functions, which provide an increasingly heterogenous landscape. In addition, they are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, EV release is opted by tumor cells as a beneficial process for tumor progression. Cutaneous melanoma is a cancer that originates from the melanocyte lineage and shows a favorable prognosis at early stages. However, when melanoma cells acquire invasive capacity, it constitutes the most aggressive and deadly skin cancer. In this context, extracellular vesicles have been shown their relevance in facilitating melanoma progression through the modulation of the microenvironment and metastatic spreading. In agreement with the melanosome secretory capacity of melanocytes, melanoma cells display an enhanced EV shedding activity that has contributed to the utility of melanoma models for unravelling EV cargo and functions within a cancer scenario. In this review, we provide an in-depth overview of the characteristics of melanoma-derived EVs and their role in melanoma progression highlighting key advances and remaining open questions in the field.

TI  - Evaluating Dermal Bone as a Novel Source of Endocrine Information in Ninespine and Threespine Stickleback Fish
T2  - INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synopsis Monitoring the physiology of small aquatic and marine teleost fish presents challenges. Blood samples, often the first choice for endocrinologists, can be difficult or even impossible to obtain and alternative matrices currently used for hormone analyses do not occur in fishes (e.g., hair, feathers etc.) or are not easily collected from small aquatic organisms (e.g., urine and feces). Some teleosts, however, have enlarged bony dermal elements that possibly accumulate and store steroid hormones in physiological relevant concentrations. Both threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) have a series of external, lateral bony plates, dorsal spines, and a pair of pelvic spines attached to the pelvic girdle. We investigated if cortisol, the primary circulating glucocorticoid in teleosts, could be extracted from stickleback dermal bone and quantified using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA). We successfully validated a cortisol EIA for dermal bone extracts, determined that cortisol was detectable in both species, and found that dermal bone cortisol levels significantly correlated with cortisol levels in whole body homogenate. Ninespine stickleback had significantly higher dermal bone cortisol concentrations than threespine stickleback and female threespine stickleback tended to have over twice the mean dermal bone cortisol concentration than males. Because both stickleback species are widely used for ecotoxicological studies, using dermal bone as a source of endocrine information, while leaving the body for contaminant, genomic, histological, and stable isotope analyses, could be a powerful and parsimonious tool. Further investigation and physiological validations are necessary to fully understand the utility of this new sample matrix.

AB  - This study presents an estimate of historical snowconditions in Iceland and a projection of these conditions, given differentemission scenarios. Historical snow conditions were estimated using in situobservations from manned meteorological stations over the period 1930-2021and by remotely sensed observations from the MODIS instruments over theperiod 2001-2021. Historical and future climate conditions, as described by each of the 21 general circulation models (GCM) from the 5thiteration of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as containedin the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP)dataset, were used to simulate snow conditions in Iceland over the period1950-2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) RCP4.5 andRCP8.5 with the SNOW-17 model. The results show an increase in the averageannual snow cover frequency (SCF) over the historical record detected bothin the in situ (1930-2021) and remotely sensed data (2001-2021). Averageannual snow depth measurements also revealed an increasing trend over thehistorical record. Simulated snow conditions show a substantial decrease inboth snow water equivalent (SWE) and SCF over the period 1950-2100, a trendmore pronounced under RCP8.5 as compared to RCP4.5.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Determining discharge and stage-discharge curves in fluvial environments without hydrometric gauges is a critical challenge in hydrologic studies and river hydraulics. This issue will be more evident in managing flood hazards in the rivers of arid areas without flow measurement gauges, where the reaction time is the critical factor. Researchers and designers have always tried to access simpler, cheaper methods to estimate discharge and rating curves. This research aims to facilitate the determination of the discharge and stage-discharge relationship by applying remote sensing techniques and the concept of isovel contours. For this purpose, the geometry of the river cross section is determined using remotely sensed data from the images of the Sentinel-1 and two satellites, and then discharge passed through the cross section is estimated by the single point velocity measurement method. The observed data were collected from the Mollasani station in Karun River, Iran, to confirm this method. The obtained discharges and stage-discharge relationship curves are used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methodology. Statistical analyses showed that the mean value of the normalized percentage error and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) calculated based on the difference between the estimated and observed discharges are limited to 6.3 and 8.36%, respectively. Also, the stage-discharge curves in these studies were estimated with a maximum MAPE of 9.5%, which is considered a good initial approximation considering the minimum required data.

TI  - Understanding the potential of Sentinel-2 for monitoring methane point emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite instruments to detect and quantify methane emissions from fossil fuel production activities is highly beneficial to support climate change mitigation. Different hyperspectral and multispectral satellite sensors have recently shown potential to detect and quantify point-source emissions from space. The Sentinel-2 (S2) mission, despite its limited spectral design, supports the detection of large emissions with global coverage and high revisit frequency thanks to coarse spectral coverage of methane absorption lines in the shortwave infrared. Validation of S2 methane retrieval algorithms is instrumental in accelerating the development of a systematic and global monitoring system for methane point sources. Here, we develop a benchmarking framework for such validation. We first develop a methodology to generate simulated S2 datasets including methane point-source plumes. These benchmark datasets have been created for scenes in three oil and gas basins (Hassi Messaoud, Algeria; Korpeje, Turkmenistan; Permian Basin, USA) under different scene heterogeneity conditions and for simulated methane plumes with different spatial distributions. We use the simulated methane plumes to validate the retrieval for different flux rate levels and define a minimum detection threshold for each case study. The results suggest that for homogeneous and temporally invariant surfaces, the detection limit of the proposed S2 methane retrieval ranges from 1000 to 2000 kg h-1, whereas for areas with large surface heterogeneity and temporal variations, the retrieval can only detect plumes in excess of 500 kg h-1. The different sources of uncertainty in the flux rate estimates have also been examined. Dominant quantification errors are either wind-related or plume mask-related, depending on the surface type. Uncertainty in wind speed, both in the 10 m wind (U10) and in mapping U10 to the effective wind (Ueff) driving plume transport, is the dominant source of error for quantifying individual plumes in homogeneous scenes. For heterogeneous and temporally variant scenes, the surface structure underlying the methane plume affects the plume masking and can become a dominant source of uncertainty.

AB  - This article reviews the state of the art in the use of space-borne observations for analyzing extreme rainfall and flood events in Africa. Floods occur across many space and timescales, from very localized flash flood events to slow propagation of discharge peaks in large rivers. We discuss here how satellite data can help us understand the genesis and impacts of these flood events, monitor their evolution, and better constrain prediction models, thereby improving early warning and population protection. To illustrate these topics, we reanalyze major flood events that occurred in Niger, Mozambique, Central African Republic and Ivory Coast, using satellite information.

TI  - SMPD: a soil moisture-based precipitation downscaling method for high-resolution daily satellite precipitation estimation
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key component in the water and energy cycle, estimates of precipitation with high resolution and accuracy is of great significance for hydrological, meteorological, and ecological studies. However, current satellite-based precipitation products have a coarse spatial resolution (from 10 to 50 km) not meeting the needs of several applications (e.g., flash floods and landslides). The implementation of spatial downscaling methods can be a suitable approach to overcome this shortcoming. In this study, we developed a soil moisture-based precipitation downscaling (SMPD) method for spatially downscaling the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG) V06B daily precipitation product over a complex topographic and climatic area in southwestern Europe (Iberian Peninsula) in the period 2016-2018. By exploiting the soil-water balance equation, high-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products were used as auxiliary variables. The spatial resolution of the IMERG daily precipitation product was downscaled from 10 to 1 km. An evaluation using 1027 rain gauge stations highlighted the good performance of the downscaled 1 km IMERG product compared to the original 10 km product, with a correlation coefficient of 0.61, root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.83 mm and a relative bias of 5 %. Meanwhile, the 1 km downscaled results can also capture the typical temporal and spatial variation behaviors of precipitation in the study area during dry and wet seasons. Overall, the SMPD method greatly improves the spatial details of the original 10 km IMERG product also with a slight enhancement of accuracy. It shows good potential to be applied for the development of high-quality and high-resolution precipitation products in any region of interest.

TI  - Agricultural productivity and water quality tradeoffs of winter cover crops at a landscape scale through the lens of remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A large body of scientific research studying the impacts of cover crops on crop-water-nutrient dynamics has been based on short-term and/or controlled experimental trials without much consideration of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity that typically exists in the working landscape. As such, those findings are difficult to reproduce on working farms. This study is focused on quantifying the long-term impacts of cover crops on both cash crop (corn and soybean) yields and water quality across the Maumee River watershed (MRW) using publicly accessible historic satellite data, from 2009 to 2019, that leverage spatial and temporal variabilities in the agricultural landscape. Corn and soybean yield maps at 30-m resolution were prepared using regression models that integrated satellite images, weather, and county-scale crop yield data. These yield maps were overlaid with 30-m resolution cover crop maps, which were created for the same period using a machine learning classification model using satellite data and ground-truth observations, to quantify yield differences between corn and soybean fields with and without cover crops. The annual variability in winter cover crop area was compared with publicly accessible data on spring nitrate (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loads and concentrations, that were collected at multiple water quality monitoring stations within the MRW. During the study period, cover crops, typically showed minimal to negative yield impacts on cash crops, with yield reductions of up to 1.35 ton/ha for corn and 0.24 ton/ha for soybean. However, crop yield variabilities were found to decline with a longer cover crop history. The winter cover crop area within the MRW was found to have water quality impact, with a strong negative correlation with the spring NO3-N concentration (correlation coefficient (R) = -0.70) and loads (R = -0.65) at the MRW outlet. There was a mixed relationship between the cover crop area and P load and concentration, with a positive correlation (R = 0.17) with spring TP concentration and a negative one with spring TP load (R = - 0.29), spring SRP concentration (R = - 0.30), and spring SRP load (R = - 0.40). Similar relationships were also observed across sub-watersheds within the MRW, suggesting that cover crops can be more effective in reducing NO3-N losses compared to P. These findings highlight the importance of using satellite-based remote sensing to improve the understanding of cover crops and their impacts on crop productivity and water quality at a broader scale.

TI  - OPTRAM-ET: A novel approach to remote sensing of actual evapotranspiration applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology provides a promising means for near real-time monitoring of crop water status and requirements in agricultural and hydrological applications. Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided by ever-increasing drone-and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally demanding than the LST-VI model.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Discrimination of granitoids bearing iron and corundum mineral deposits in the southeastern part of Banyo (Adamawa region of Cameroon) using Landsat 8 OLI data and provides essential information's for exploration. Field data and remote sensing traditional mapping techniques including false color composites (FCCs), principal component analysis (PCA), Crosta-PCA, band ratios (BR), constrained energy minimization (CEM), classification algorithm as maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM) were applied to the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands of Landsat 8 OLI data. The results of this research demonstrated to be most effective to highlight potential locations of granitoids bearing iron and corundum deposits. In addition, iron deposit was mapped using band ratio 4/2 due to high reflectivity in the visible red region while corundum deposits are detected by applying the constrained energy minimization method to Landsat-8 OLI band ratio 6/7 highlighting bright tones. The results of remote sensing data were validated through fieldwork and laboratory analysis (thin section analysis). Furthermore, lineaments analysis revealed the prevalence of three major structural trends affecting the southeastern part of Banyo ( N-S, E-W, and NE-SW to ENE-WSW) paired with mapped lithologies allows the potential emplacement of mineral deposits. The novelty of the present study relies in the integration of Landsat 8 OLI and field data enabling the identification of highly prospective lithological units, mineral deposits, defining exploration targets, and the minimisation of time consuming field reconnaissance in the study area.

TI  - Synergistic multi-altimeter for estimating water level in the coastal zone of Beibu Gulf using SEL, ALES plus and BFAST algorithms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring and predicting the large-scale dynamic changes of water levels in coastal zones is essential for its protection, restoration and sustainable development. However, there has been a challenge for achieving this goal using a single radar altimeter and retracking technique due to the diversity and complexity of coastal waveforms. To solve this issue, we proposed an approach of estimating water level of the coastal zone in Beibu Gulf, China, by combination of waveform classifications and multiple sub-waveform retrackers. This paper stacked Random Forest (RF), XGBoost and CatBoost algorithms for building an ensemble learning (SEL) model to classify coastal waveforms, and further evaluated the performance of three retracking strategies in refining waveforms using Cryosat-2, SARAL, Sentinel-3 altimeters. We compared the estimation accuracy of the coastal water levels between the single altimeter and synergistic multi-altimeter, and combined Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), Mann-Kendall mutation test (MK) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms to track the historical change process of coastal water levels, and predict its future development trend. This paper found that: (1) The SEL algorithm achieved high-precision classification of different coastal waveforms with an average accuracy of 0.959, which outperformed three single machine learning algorithms. (2) Combination of Threshold Retracker and ALES+ Retracker (TR_ALES+) achieved the better retracking quality with an improvement of correlation coefficient (R, 0.089 similar to 0.475) and root mean square error (RMSE, 0.008 similar to 0.029 m) when comparing to the Threshold Retracker & Primary Peak COG Retracker and Threshold Retracker & Primary Peak Threshold Retracker. (3) The coastal water levels of Cryosat-2, SARAL, Sentinel-3 and multi-altimeter were in good agreement (R>0.66, RMSE<0.135m) with Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) water level. (4) The coastal water levels of the Beibu Gulf displayed a slowly rising trend from 2011 to 2021 with an average annual growth rate of 8mm/a, its lowest water level focused on May-August, the peak of water level was in October-November, and the average annual growth rate of water level from 2022-2031 was about 0.6mm/a. These results can provide guidance for scientific monitoring and sustainable management of coastal zones.

AB  - The present study explores a holistic approach toward better assimilation of the contextual relationship between coal fire-induced land subsidence in the Jharia Coalfield (JCF), India. For the process, 31 consecutive Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 scenes of 2018 were processed to estimate mean Line-of-Sight displacement and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in JCF, respectively. The results indicated that the displacement rate in JCF significantly varies at active mine benches and overburden dump, and high degree of displacement owing to the additive compression inducted along with the volume reduction at the subsurface. The estimated displacement accounts were then spatially correlated with the thermally anomalous pixels to determine the categories of subsidence. Further, the contextual relationship between the displacements estimates (dependent variable) with a set of explanatory variables, i.e. pixel integrated LST was tested using Binary Logistic Regression. The performance of the model was cross-validated using statistical parameters derived from the confusion matrix.

TI  - Exploring secondary school biology teachers' conceptions of scientific laws and methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates how Greek in-service secondary education biology teachers understand the unique features of school biology and physics when considering the biological theoretical edifice and method. Our theoretical framework focuses on important differences that exist between the neo-Darwinian and Newtonian worldviews, while our methodology involves questionnaires and mainly individual interviews with fourteen (14) biology teachers. The study findings indicate that biology teachers encounter difficulties in unraveling the distinction between nomothetic and non-nomothetic natural sciences and in understanding the historical character of biology. They also emphasize the importance of scientific laws and experimentation when considering the epistemological features of biology, and the reason is that they reflect on the issue of what science or scientific knowledge is by simultaneously adopting two contradictory perspectives. On the one hand, they stress what a science should be if it is to be called 'science', and on the other hand, they focus on how a particular science, such as biology behaves. Unavoidably, a logical tension is created in their minds, and as a way of solving this tension, they view biology as being in a state of ongoing change towards an ideal, and, in many aspects, a positivistic pattern of science.

TI  - Uncertainty is not sufficient for identifying noisy labels in training data for binary segmentation of building footprints
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining high quality labels is a major challenge for the application of deep neural networks in the remote sensing domain. A common way of acquiring labels is the usage of crowd sourcing which can provide much needed training data sets but also often contains incorrect labels which can affect the training process of a deep neural network significantly. In this paper, we exploit uncertainty to identify a certain type of label noise for semantic segmentation of buildings in satellite imagery. That type of label noise is known as "omission noise," i.e., missing labels for whole buildings which still appear in the satellite image. Following the literature, uncertainty during training can help in identifying the "sweet spot" between generalizing well and overfitting to label noise, which is further used to differentiate between noisy and clean labels. The differentiation between clean and noisy labels is based on pixel-wise uncertainty estimation and beta distribution fitting to the uncertainty estimates. For our study, we create a data set for building segmentation with different levels of omission noise to evaluate the impact of the noise level on the performance of the deep neural network during training. In doing so, we show that established uncertainty-based methods to identify noisy labels are in general not sufficient enough for our kind of remote sensing data. On the other hand, for some noise levels, we observe some promising differences between noisy and clean data which opens the possibility to refine the state-of-the-art methods further.

TI  - Assessing the response of water use efficiency to climate variability and land-use changes in the mountainous area of North China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is a measure used for evaluating the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water consumption of terrestrial ecosystems. Much attention has been directed on how and to what extent WUE varies with climate variability and land-use changes. In this study, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model and remote sensing data are utilized to analyze the response of WUE to climate variability and land-use changes in the mountainous area of North China from 2000 to 2020. The results show that the annual WUE follows an increasing trend at a rate of 0.012 gC/mm center dot m(2)center dot yr with an average value of 1.027 gC/mm center dot m(2). Spatially, significant heterogeneity was detected in WUE with gradients decreasing from the southeast to the northwest, while significant increases were found in Beijing, Tianjin, and some regions of Hebei. The annual average WUE of different vegetation types decreased following the order of mixed forest > needleleaf forest > broadleaf forest > grassland > shrubland > cropland. Among various meteorologic and vegetation factors, WUE was mainly influenced by temperature, precipitation, and LAI. The cumulative effect of these three factors explained 79.43 % of the variations of WUE. Finally, when precipitation was 490-510 mm, or temperature was 13 celcius, or LAI was 1.27 m(2)m(-2), WUE reached the threshold value, i.e., vegetation had the highest degree of water use. These results have implications for the management of water resources and regional ecosystem optimization in regions with limited water resources.

TI  - Morphology and controls of the mountain-front fan systems of the Hajar Mountains, south-east Arabia
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain-front fans are an important part of the global sediment system, acting as buffers and stores of sediment between upland sources and down-system sinks. Fans emanate from the Hajar Mountains in the eastern UAE and northern Oman which have developed from morphologically and geologically variable catchments and in a range of depositional settings, as well as spanning a wide range of shapes and sizes. There has been little prior research into the drivers of regional fan evolution and morphology at the landform scale, considering specific factors such as source-area morphology and geology and distal settings. We use remotely sensed data to map 438 fans and catchments along mountain fronts in Oman and the UAE. These data provide, for the first time, a regional overview of fan morphology using key morphometric parameters and demonstrate the utility of a remote sensing approach to understanding regional landform morphology of features at a range of spatial scales (10-3-104 km2). Comparing this large dataset to studies of dryland fans globally, we show that Hajar fan morphology spans almost every order of magnitude previously recorded elsewhere. It shows statistically the importance of diverse catchment and depositional setting controls on alluvial fan morphology. Across the different mountain fronts of the Hajar range, fan morphology is controlled by 1) catchment morphology and geology, 2) changes in base level and 3) long-term climatic changes and tectonic processes, although the importance of these factors relative to one another is highly spatially variable. The fans of the Musandam Peninsula drain younger rocks, are situated in an area of subsidence and have experienced foreshortening due to Quaternary sea-level variability, hence pro-duce the smallest, steepest fans. Similarly, many of the fans of the Batinah Coast are influenced by distal fore-shortening by sea-level rise and demonstrate weak regression relationships with their catchment morphologies. By contrast, the large fans of the Rub'al Khali are mostly distally unconfined and drain large catchments composed of relatively older rock types, thus producing large fans and megafans with the strongest fan -catchment morphometric relationships. The Wahiba Sands fans are similar to those of the Rub'al Khali but are limited in their extent by erosion from an axial river system. As such, the fans of the Hajar are an important natural laboratory for investigating alluvial fan morphology, processes and long-term evolution in response to a range of controls. This includes potentially acting as analogues to extra-terrestrial fan systems due to their large scales in some areas dryland context. For example, the largest megafans of the Hajar display morphometric similarities to large fluvial fans reported on Saturn's moon, Titan, perhaps suggesting comparable long-term controls.

TI  - Adaptive enhanced interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy local information clustering with dual-distance for land cover classification
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of remote sensing image is faced with uncertainties such as "significant difference in category density", "the same object with different spectra", and "different objects with the same spectrum". Existing possibilistic fuzzy clustering-related method still cannot fully meet the interpretation requirements of remote sensing data. To accurately classify remote sensing image with complex geographical distribution, this paper proposes a robust interval type-2 dual-distance driven possibilistic fuzzy clustering motivated by interval-valued number for land cover classification. Firstly, interval-valued data model is established by using the local mean and variance of single-valued data. Secondly, Hausdorff distance and MW distance for interval -valued numbers are introduced to realize the maximum separability of overlapping categories in interval-valued data and generate interval uncertainty sets. To further enhance its robustness, weighted local information factors are constructed by making full use of the generated fuzzy membership and possibilistic typicality, and a novel robust interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means clustering is proposed. Finally, the adaptive type reduction method is introduced, meanwhile the adaptive expansion of interval-valued data model is realized by using the adaptive contraction expansion control factor. After the iterative algorithm convergences, the accurate classification of covered objects in remote sensing images is realized. Experimental results indicate that the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of existing interval type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm and its variants, and it is more suitable for the interpretation of remote sensing images in the actual environments.

TI  - Breast implant-associated squamous cell carcinoma in a male patient: A case report and review of the medical literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundPrimary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a rare tumor type. The diagnosis of this tumor type is more frequently made only after microscopy evaluation. Breast implant-associated SCC is rarer with medical literature review indicating only 18 cases reported in female individuals. Case presentationWe reported an unusual case that a man found a 3-cm sized mass on his left breast at first, who had a implant surgery 18 years previously to reconstruct the deformed left breast, as related to the Poland's syndrome. More than 1 year after the mass was detected, the size of the mass gradually increased to 20 cm with swelling and severe pain, and the patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient underwent surgical excision of the tumor, followed by removal of the implant, complete capsulectomy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The microscopy evaluation demonstrated the tumor as moderately and poorly differentiated invasive SCC. Follow-up at 12 months after showed multiple metastases, including the skin of the chest, axillary lymph nodes and pleura. ConclusionBreast implant-associated SCC can occur in male patients. Therefore, it should be considered when the clinical manifestation or histopathological appearance is not typical of other breast neoplasms. Malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells takes about 18 years, after which rapid evolution follows leading to fast growth of the tumor.

TI  - Mapping burn severity and monitoring CO content in Turkiye's 2021 Wildfires, using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P satellite data on the GEE platform
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigated forest fires in the Mediterranean of Turkiye between July 28, 2021, and August 11, 2021. Burn severity maps were produced with the difference normalised burned ratio index (dNBR) and difference normalised difference vegetation index (dNDVI) using Sentinel-2 images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The burned areas were estimated based on the determined burning severity degrees. Vegetation density losses in burned areas were analysed using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. At the same time, the post-fire Carbon Monoxide (CO) column number densities were determined using the Sentinel-5P satellite data. According to the burn severity maps obtained with dNBR, the sum of high and moderate severity areas constitutes 34.64%, 20.57%, 46.43%, 51.50% and 18.88% of the entire area in Manavgat, Gundogmus, Marmaris, Bodrum and Koycegiz districts, respectively. Likewise, according to the burn severity maps obtained with dNDVI, the sum of the areas of very high severity and high severity constitutes 41.17%, 30.16%, 30.50%, 42.35%, and 10.40% of the entire region, respectively. In post-fire NDVI time series analyses, sharp decreases were observed in NDVI values from 0.8 to 0.1 in all burned areas. While the Tropospheric CO column number density was 0.03 mol/m(2) in all regions burned before the fire, it was observed that this value increased to 0.14 mol/m(2) after the fire. Moreover, when the area was examined more broadly with Sentinel 5P data, it was observed that the amount of CO increased up to a maximum value of 0.333 mol/m(2). The results of this study present significant information in terms of determining the severity of forest fires in the Mediterranean region in 2021 and the determination of the CO column number density after the fire. In addition, monitoring polluting gases with RS techniques after forest fires is essential in understanding the extent of the damage they can cause to the environment.

AB  - Accurate assessment of soil C storage patterns and control factors on a regional and global scale is essential for predicting and mitigating soil C feedback to global environmental change. We used soil samples collected in the Shiyang River Basin in 2018, combined with remote sensing data, climate and meteorological data, watershed hydrological data, and soil physical and chemical properties to discuss the change characteristics and influencing factors of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different soil depths in the Shiyang River Basin in an arid area and analyze the storage model and carbon sequestration potential of soil organic carbon in different geomorphic units. The research results show that, (1) in spatial distribution, the SOC content in the Shiyang River Basin shows an obvious regional difference, and the average content of SOC in the oasis area in the middle reaches significantly higher than that in the mountain area in the upstream and desert area in the downstream. In vertical distribution, the content of SOC in the whole watershed decreases with the soil depth increase. (2) Soil carbon sequestration potential decreased with the increase in soil depth, but there were regional differences. The Oasis area in the middle reaches of the Shiyang River Basin is a high-potential area. In contrast, most of the upper mountain areas and the lower reaches of the desert area are low-potential areas. Environmental factors such as vegetation cover, meteorological factors, and physical and chemical properties of soil are important factors that promote the spatial variability of SOC content. The decisive effect of environmental factors on the SOC content is most significant in the surface layer 0-20 cm.

TI  - Intrusion of Coastal Oyashio water to Funka Bay and Tsugaru Strait occasionally disturbed by Kuroshio-originating warm core ring
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water mass property in the southwest of Hokkaido Island, Japan, in the winter-to-spring season has been examined using 9 years' hydrographic data and satellite data as well as ocean reanalysis data for 2010-2018. Hydrographic and moored observations in the eastern mouth of Tsugaru Strait indicate a regime shift in the 2010s; a cold period in 2010-2014 and a warm period in 2016-2018. The regions are known to be influenced by intrusion of Coastal Oyashio water (COW), which is cold fresh water originated from the Okhotsk Sea. Satellite-based sea surface temperature and altimeter data reveal that Coastal Oyashio (CO) flowing westward along the southern coast of Hokkaido Island to Funka Bay in the cold period and further to Tsugaru Strait in 2014. The western limit of COW does not reach Funka Bay in 2016-2018. During warm period, a warm core ring (WCR) originating from the Kuroshio Extension, approaches the southern coast of Hokkaido Island. Our analysis of high-resolution ocean reanalysis data indicates that the WCR disturbs inflow of the COW into Funka Bay and/or provides warm saline water to the COW. The Tsugaru Warm Current (TWC) flowing out of the strait to the east also contributes to this pathway change, but its impact is not large compared to the strong broad flow over the WCR. Our finding suggests that in the winter-to-spring season, the ocean environment of Funka Bay and Tsugaru Strait can be controlled by the Kuroshio-originating WCR that disturbs intrusion of the COW.

TI  - Putting the fish into inland fisheries - A global allocation of historic inland fish catch
T2  - FISH AND FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters support the livelihoods of up to 820 million people and provide fisheries that make an essential contribution towards food security, particularly in the developing world where 90% of inland fisheries catch is consumed. Despite their importance, inland fisheries are overlooked in favour of other water use sectors deemed more economically important. Inland fisheries are also driven by external factors such as climate change and habitat loss, which impedes our ability to manage them sustainably. Using a river basin approach to allocate fish catch, we have provided an integrated picture of how different inland water bodies contribute to global inland fisheries catches. There is a substantial amount of information available on inland fisheries, but it has never been synthesised to build this global picture. Fishery statistics from river basins, lakes, floodplains, hydrobasins, and countries covering a time span from 1960-2018 were analysed. Collation of basin-scale fisheries statistics suggests a global inland catch of approximate to 17.4 million tonnes (PSE = +/- 3.93 million tonnes) in 2010, considerably more than the 10.8 million tonnes published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), but in line with estimates based on household consumption. The figure is considered a likely maximum due to recent reductions in catches because of closures, threats, and fisheries declines in the most productive fisheries. It is recommended that sentinel fisheries, which are important for food provision, employment, or where threats facing a fishery could cause a deterioration in catch, are identified to provide the baseline for a global monitoring programme.

TI  - Improving drought mitigation strategies and disaster risk reduction through MODIS and TRMM-based data in relation to climate change over Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an extreme climatic event that mostly occurs as a result of low rainfall, which leads to lack of water in various agro-ecological conditions of Pakistan. The condition could be further exacerbated by the prevailing dry weather. Therefore, accurate, timely, and efficient drought monitoring is crucial to ensure that its adverse effects are mitigated. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TRMM-based data were used together with remote sensing techniques to improve drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies. In order to monitor drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan, the crop water stress index (CWSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), normalized vegetation supply water index (NVSWI), vegetation health index (VHI), and temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) were chosen as the instrument. Due to low rainfall and significantly low vegetation, CWSI, NDVI, TVDI, and VHI are useful in characterizing drought mitigation strategies in Pakistan. Monthly NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, TVDI, VCI, and VHI values and heat map analysis show that Pakistan suffered from drought in years 2001, 2002, and 2006. Seasonal CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI confirmed that Pakistan was affected by severe drought in 2001, which continued and led to severe drought in 2002 and 2006. We generate spatial correlation coefficients between NDVI and NVSWI, VCI, and VHI, and NVSWI and VCI and VHI, while the VCI and VHI values are significantly positively correlated. CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI show positive signs of effective climate change drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan. Thus, these drought indices have been confirmed to be a complete drought monitoring indicator and reduce the risk of drought in Pakistan.

TI  - Riparian Spiders: Sentinels of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin and Dibenzofuran-Contaminated Sediment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) are persistent, toxic, and bioaccumulative. Currently, PCDD/F monitoring programs primarily use fish and birds with potentially large home ranges to monitor temporal trends over broad spatial scales; sentinel organisms that provide targeted sediment contaminant information across small geographic areas have yet to be developed. Riparian orb-weaving spiders, which typically have small home ranges and consume primarily adult aquatic insects, are potential PCDD/F sentinels. Recent studies have demonstrated that spider tissue concentrations indicate the source and magnitude of dioxin-like chlorinated compounds in contaminated sediments, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Our aim in the present study was to assess the utility of riparian spiders as sentinels for PCDD/F-contaminated sediments. We measured PCDD/F (total [sigma] and homologs) in surface sediments and spiders collected from three sites within the St. Louis River basin (Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA). We then compared (1) patterns in sigma PCDD/F concentrations between sediment and spiders, (2) the distribution of homologs within sediments and spiders when pooled across sites, and (3) the relationship between sediment and spider concentrations of PCDD/F homologs across 13 stations sampled across the three sites. The sigma PCDD/F concentrations in sediment (mean +/- standard error 286 591 +/- 97 614 pg/g) were significantly higher than those in riparian spiders (2463 +/- 977 pg/g, p < 0.001), but the relative abundance of homologs in sediment and spiders were not significantly different. Spider homolog concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with sediment concentrations across a gradient of sediment PCDD/F contamination (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.001). Our results indicate that, as has been shown for other legacy organic chemicals like PCBs, riparian spiders are suitable sentinels of PCDD/F in contaminated sediment.

TI  - Assessment of agricultural drought based on multi-source remote sensing data in a major grain producing area of Northwest China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is considered to be one of the most serious natural disasters in China, which can result in enormous damage to nature and socio-economy. Compared to traditional ground-based monitoring techniques, remote sensing can effectively compensate for spatial discontinuities at ground stations. The use of remote sensing technology for drought monitoring has irreplaceable advantages. The applicability of the TRMM3B43 dataset for precipitation was firstly verified in the Wei River basin, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation were analyzed. Based on the TRMM3B43, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS LST datasets, the spatiotemporal variations of drought were secondly investigated by calculating the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Vegetation Con-dition Index (VCI), and Temporal Condition Index (TCI). Crop yield was employed as the reference of drought impact for evaluating the applicability of the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) based on the combination of the PCI, VCI, and VCI by four kinds of weight determination methods, i.e. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Entropy method, Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC), and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE). Finally, the agricultural drought calculated by the SDCI was evaluated against drought area, disaster area, and crop failure area to verify the applicability of the SDCI for agricultural drought disaster assessment in the Wei River basin. The results showed that the SDCI determined by FCE has better correlations with crop yield (R2 =0.45) than the other methods. The SDCI values exhibited a "W" shape from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons and agricultural drought showed an increasing trend after 2013. The drought-prone areas shifted from north to south, with the degree of drought firstly decreasing and then increasing. In addition, the SDCI has better correlations with the disaster area (R2 =0.35) than the drought area (R2 = 0.16). At the municipal level, the SDCI could well assess agricultural drought. The results demonstrated that the SDCI can effectively monitor and assess drought impacts on agriculture and may provide helpful information for agri-cultural drought disaster prevention.

TI  - Tunnel geothermal disaster susceptibility evaluation based on interpretable ensemble learning: A case study in Ya'an-Changdu section of the Sichuan-Tibet traffic corridor
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An interpretable model based on the efficient combination of ensemble learning and permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plots (PDP), and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm was proposed in this work to facilitate the global and local interpretation of tunnel geothermal disaster sus-ceptibility evaluations. The main goal was to provide more scientific theoretical support for the accurate eval-uation of tunnel geothermal disaster susceptible areas. By considering the Ya'an-Changdu section of the Sichuan-Tibet traffic corridor as the research area - based on Landsat-8 images and other collected spatial data around the causes and distribution of the geothermal disasters in the tunnel - eight different evaluation factors were selected. Random forest (RF) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithms were used as the primary learning unit. In addition, a support vector machine (SVM) was used as the secondary learning unit. Through the implementation of the stacking algorithm, the susceptibility of tunnel geothermal disasters was evaluated. Then, the precision was verified by six evaluation indexes, and the interpretability of the ensemble learning model was studied by using three interpretation algorithms: PI, PDP, and LIME. From the extracted outcomes, it was demonstrated that the stacking algorithm for ensemble learning had the best performance and the highest prediction precision. The number of geothermal sample points in the high-susceptibility tunnel geothermal disaster area and the extremely highly susceptible area accounts for 85.57% of the total geothermal sample points, whereas the area accounts for 7.21% of the total area of the region. According to the model interpretation, land surface temperature (LST), fault density, and earthquake peak acceleration are regarded as the most important factors in the tunnel geothermal disaster susceptibility evaluation. The tunnel geothermal disaster susceptibility evaluation model based on interpretable ensemble learning has high precision, and is of great importance for the practical significance of the project route selection, construction, and operation of the Ya'an-Changdu section of the Sichuan-Tibet traffic corridor.

TI  - Erosion potential model-based ANN-MLP for the spatiotemporal modeling of soil erosion in wadi Saida watershed
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is currently one of the most discussed natural resource degradation phenomena in the world. The depletion of fertile soils and the degradation of terrestrial ecosystems are among the most fatal consequences of soil erosion. The severity of soil erosion results mainly from the dynamics of land use/land cover, hydro-climatic disturbances, and anthropogenic activities. This study aims to quantify and predict soil erosion and sediment yield in the wadi Saida watershed, NW of Algeria (642 km(2)). To estimate the erosion amount and the sediments yield for 2010, 2015, and 2020 with a projected perspective to 2025, we used the EPM model (Erosion Potential Model) in association with artificial neural networks based on multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP) according to two approaches, one based on the LULC producing the EPMLULC model and the second based on the spatial distribution of normalized difference vegetation index NDVI producing the EPMNDVI model. The land use/land cover mapping of the watershed was carried out on a multi-temporal aspect using the MLH classification of Landsat products. Artificial Neural Networks by Cellular Automata (ANN-CA) was used to generate the projected map of LULC for 2025. The results show that in the learning, validation, and test phases, the model based on the NDVI presents excellent behavior (r = 0.98, RMSE = 20.17 m(3)/km(2)/year) for the three stages, while the model based on LULC shows quite a lower correlation and slightly bigger error than the previous model (r = 0.85, RMSE = 64.1 m(3)/km(2)/year). At the prediction stage, the model EPMNDVI presents less root mean square error between the calculated and estimated values than the RMSE from the model EPMLULC, with 48.45 m(3)/km(2)/year of difference between the two models.

TI  - Variations of multiple gaseous emissions associated with the great Sumatra earthquakes in 2004 and 2005
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) temporal variations and correlation analysis of CO, CH4 and O3 concentrations associ-ated with the 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman MW 9.1 Earthquake and 28 March 2005 Sumatra-Nias MW 8.6 Earthquake offshore of Sumatra, Indonesia were investigated using satellite data from AQUA AIRS in order to understand the lithospheric and atmospheric interactions during seismic activities. These great earthquakes occurred in the subduction zone northwest of the Sumatra Island. It was observed that large amounts of gases were emitted from the Earth's crust into the atmosphere before, during and after the earthquakes compared to the earthquake-free periods and background areas. Anomalies in CO, CH4 and O3 concentrations occurred along the NW-trending Sumatra fault system and peak values were found in the epicenter areas. Temporally, the anomalies occurred from 3 months before the Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake to 1 month after the Sumatra-Nias Earthquake and they lasted for 7 months. The correlation coefficients between the gas parameters increased with the period closer to the earthquake occurrence. More CO and CH4 were emitted from the epicenter area and O3 was produced in the background area during earthquake preparation period and occurrence reflected in the correlation analysis. The data indicated that the gaseous anomalies were most probably attributed to the gas emissions caused by the two great earthquakes that were accompanied by intense tectonic activities and fractures produced in the crust. After the underground gases were emitted into the atmosphere, they underwent a series of physical (diffusion, convection, etc.) and chemical reactions, which consequently lead to the gases (e.g. CO, CH4 and O3) anomalies at different altitudes in the atmosphere. The results are helpful in improving the judgment ability to understand geochemical earthquake anomalies and understanding the mechanism of lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LCAIC).

TI  - The onset process of the 2018/2019 Indonesian-Australian summer monsoon: The importance of the air-sea interaction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and its associated air-sea interactions during the onset process of the 2018/2019 Indonesian-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) are investigated based on the in situ data from a moored buoy off the coast of northwest Australia, along with ERA5 reanalysis and satellite data. The results verify that the IASM onset in mid-December 2018 was triggered by the first-branch eastward-propagating MJO (FEMJO) originating from the tropical Indian Ocean. However, the strong negative SST anomaly (SSTA) was evident off northwest Australia, which weakens FEMJO over northern Australia and shifts the convective center further northward. The mixed layer heat budget analysis based on the buoy observations reveals that the increased latent heat loss that occurred before the arrival of the FEMJO convection was primarily attributed to the large air-sea temperature difference and strong winds, resulting in the pronounced SSTA.

T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Fleas in the genus Ctenocephalides are the most clinically important parasitic arthropods of dogs and cats worldwide yet risk factors that might increase the risk of infestation in small animals remains unclear. Here we developed a supervised text mining approach analysing key aspects of flea epidemiology using electronic health records from domestic cats and dogs seen at a sentinel network of 191 voluntary veterinary practices across Great Britain between March 2014 and July 2020. Our methods identified fleas as likely to have been present during 22,276 of 1,902,016 cat consultations (1.17%) and 12,168 of 4,844,850 dog consultations (0.25%). Multivariable logistic regression modelling found that animals originating from areas of least deprivation were associated with 50% reductions in odds of veterinary-recorded flea infestation compared to the most deprived regions in England. Age of the animal was significantly associated with flea presentation in both cats and dogs, with cases peaking before animals reached 12 months. Cases were recorded through each study years, peaking between July and October, with fluctuations between each year. Our findings can be used towards healthcare messaging for veterinary practitioners and owners.

AB  - Every few years, Karachi floods during the summer monsoon. The flooding brings latent manoeuvrings by political actors looking to establish their hold over the city to the surface. Politicians, urban administrators, and relevant state and non-state institutions blame historical planning failures, informal and illegal constructions, institutional conflict, incapable municipal governance, and widespread corruption for the flooding. They move quickly to establish authority and consolidate power while offering "fixes'. Eviction drives against "illegal settlements' built along storm-water drains, heavy taxes, fines, and demolitions of non-conforming constructions, institutional reforms, budget allocations, and project approvals for new infrastructure all happen at once. Once the emergency ceases, key players in urban politics - resident groups, community associations, political parties, municipal authorities, land developers, planners, international non-governmental organisations, and military institutions - start working on projects of accumulation and entrenchment, in preparation for the next crisis. In this paper, we look at the space-time of Karachi's certain and yet uncertain flooding crisis as a moment to study the politics of the maybe in the Pakistani megacity. Outlining marginal and affluent residents' lived experiences in a flooding city and relating their politics with governmental responses to immediate and possible future floods, we study the conditions of inhabitation, citizenship claims, and governmental relations in Karachi. We argue that the monsoon's expectant arrival becomes a locus for articulating and modulating different kinds of popular vernaculars, governmental practices, and political manoeuvrings for institutional and individual actors seeking profit and power in and through Karachi. The politics of the maybe hinges on actors entrenching their political positions without care, taking away any possibility for a shared, coherent worldview for all Karachiites. In conclusion, we argue that distant interests and logics of this politics of governance and inhabitation are inherently exploitative, threatening to pull apart the very city they thrive on.

TI  - A generalized framework for drought monitoring across Central European grassland gradients with Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional cover time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil from remote sensing provide essential detail to understand how grasslands are affected by recent and future drought periods in the 21st century. In this regard, Sentinel-2A/B offer frequent large-area observations, which have not yet been fully exploited for a spatially continuous drought monitoring of highly dynamic Central European grasslands. In this study, we developed a generalized drought monitoring framework for Central European grasslands linking Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing. We first implemented a consistent and repeatable strategy to obtain a grassland spectral library supported by the Europe-wide Land Use/ Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and multitemporal Sentinel-2 data. Our library captured the spectral variability of PV, NPV, and soil cover from 12 grassland areas distributed along typical environmental and land use gradients of Central Europe. We trained a generalized regression-based unmixing model with synthetic data generated from the spectral library and compared fractional cover estimates to a multitemporal reference dataset. PV, NPV, and soil were estimated with good accuracy, achieving MAEs of 6.54%, 13.7%, and 12.2%, respectively. Local unmixing models trained on area-specific library subsets were overall outperformed by the generalized model highlighting the value of a comprehensive grassland library for generalized spectral unmixing. Based on fractional cover time series from 2017 to 2021, we calculated time series of the grassland-specific Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) capturing proportions of NPV and soil relative to PV. Comparison of annual growing season drought metrics derived from the NDFI to annual meteorological drought statistics from the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as well as the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) revealed widespread drought impacts on grasslands during the persistent drought period in Central Europe from 2018 to 2020. While impacts on grasslands overall closely followed meteorological and soil drought conditions, regionally varying drought metrics underline that local to regional environmental and hydrological conditions shaped the drought response of Central European grasslands. Our study emphasizes the value of combining Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing to enable drought monitoring across grassland gradients of Central Europe with Sentinel-2 time series.

TI  - Improving snow albedo parameterization scheme based on remote sensing data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo is an important parameter for determining the energy budget in high-latitude regions in winter, but it is often overestimated in the model and causes a cold bias of air temperature. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to improve the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) snow albedo parameterization in NoahMP by updating the initial value of vegetation snow albedo based on remote sensing data. The modified CLASS scheme resulted in a 0.04 decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) of the albedo, and the mean bias was reduced by 0.07, representing relative decreases of 37.3% and 89.1%, respectively. In addition, the simulation errors for the upward radiation and sensible heat flux were significantly reduced. Furthermore, the bias and RMSE of air temperature were reduced by 12.9% and 7.9%, respectively, compared to those in the original CLASS scheme. These qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrated that our modified CLASS snow albedo parameterization scheme has a robust and positive impact on the simulation of snow cover areas. Our approach provides a preliminary investigation for improving snow albedo estimation, and we plan to conduct a widespread simulation and introduce new vegetation data into the model to improve the estimation of albedo in future research.

TI  - Improving the MODIS leaf area index product for a cropland with the nonlinear autoregressive neural network with eXogenous input model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial descriptive parameter of the dynamic change of ground vegetation. The widely used MODIS LAI product, however, does not satisfy the requirements of regional eco-environment modeling. There is an urgent need to improve the product's overall accuracy. Under this circumstance, this study proposed an improvement scheme based on the nonlinear autoregressive neural network with eXogenous input (NARXNN) model and the high-quality time series LAI inversion result. Case studies were implemented for two seasons a year croplands in Wuzhi, Xinzheng, and Xiangcheng in Henan province. This research acquired 46 periods of the NARXNN model-improved LAI, which went through rigid in situ LAI validation. The in situ measured LAI by LAI-2000 was used to validate the accuracy of NARXNN-enhanced LAI data. The R-2 values of the improved LAI of the three research areas are 0.54, 0.41, and 0.51, while the RMSE decreased by 0.07, 0.1, and 0.03, and the bias also decreased to a certain extent. Direct validation using the in situ measured LAI demonstrates that the NARXNN model-enhanced LAI data were more accurate and had a lower bias than MCD15A2H. A comparison of the time series change indicates that the NARXNN-enhanced LAI shows a smoother bimodal change trend and is more conformed to the actual cropland growth than the original MODIS product. The results indicated that the NARXNN neural network further increased the accuracy of the MODIS product and has a particular practical value in future research.

TI  - Time series phase unwrapping algorithm using LP-norm optimization compressive sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series phase unwrapping is an essential step in the time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique for deformation monitoring. However, traditional unwrapping algorithms are prone to unwrapping errors in the case of intense noise and steep deformation gradients, which directly affect the accuracy of the deformation information interpretation. To address this problem, a time series phase unwrapping algorithm using LP-norm optimization compressive sensing is proposed in this paper. This algorithm first transforms the minimizing L0-norm describing compressive sensing technique into a nonconvex problem with weaker con-straints, that is, minimizing the LP-norm. Then, an optimized compressed sensing model was proposed by combining the constraint criterion of the phase triplet closure in the temporal domain and the solution strategy of the iterative reweighted least squares method. Improved temporal dimensional phase unwrapping and unwrapping error correction algorithms were developed based on this optimized model. Finally, the proposed algorithm was perfected by combining the above improved methods and the pseudo-three-dimensional phase unwrapping framework. Simulated and Sentinel-1A real datasets verify that the proposed algorithm has better noise robustness, unwrapping stability, and efficiency than traditional algorithms, particularly in the case of a steep deformation gradient and intense noise. The temporal coherence estimated by the proposed algorithm for the real dataset is generally greater than 0.99, which is far superior to traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm facilitates high-precision interpretation of deformation information. The cross-validation results show that the deformation results obtained by traditional algorithms are underestimated by at least 73 mm/a and 68 mm at the maximum subsidence than the DSInSAR. However, the deformation result obtained by the proposed algorithm is highly consistent with that of the DSInSAR.

TI  - Extensive responses of lake dynamics to climate change on northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lakes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have undergone substantial changes. As intensive cryospheric components change, the response of the lake dynamics to climatic factors, glacier-snow melting, and permafrost thawing has been complex. Based on Landsat images, meteorological data, and glacier and permafrost data, the spatial-temporal changes in the lake area on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau between 1988 and 2019 were analyzed and the driving factors behind the lake changes were further explored. The results suggest that the regional lake area increased from 1988 to 2019 at rates of 0.01-16.03 km(2)/yr. It decreased during 1988-2000, quickly increased during 2000-2012, and rapidly increased during 2012-2019. The most significant lake expansion occurred in sub-region I, which is the source region of the Yangtze River Basin. There was a sharper increase during 2012-2019 than during 2000-2012 in sub-region II (the source region of the Yellow River Basin and the Qinghai Lake Basin) and sub-region III (the Qaidam Basin). The significant lake expansion occurred about 12 years earlier in sub-region I than in sub-regions II and III. This dramatic change in the lake area was closely associated with the annual precipitation, and precipitation was the primary driving factor. Although serious glacier retreat occurred, most of the lakes in the sub-regions were non-glacier-fed lakes. The correlation between glacier ablation and the change in the lake area was poor, which suggests that glacial meltwater was not the replenishment source of most of the lakes in this region. A more accelerated increase in the active layer thickness occurred (1.90 cm/yr), which was consistent with the more rapid lake expansion, and the permafrost degradation further intensified the lake expansion.

TI  - Comprehensive study of energy and water exchange over the Tibetan Plateau: A review and perspective: From GAME/Tibet and CAMP/Tibet to TORP, TPEORP, and TPEITORP
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Containing elevated topography, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has significant thermodynamic effects for regional environment and climate change, where understanding energy and water exchange processes (EWEP) is an important prerequisite. However, estimation of the exact spatiotemporal variability of the land-atmosphere energy and water exchange over heterogeneous landscape of the TP remains a big challenge for scientific community. Focused on the above scientific question, a series of atmospheric scientific experiments and research programs have been conducted since the 1960s, quantitatively evaluating both the spatial distribution and the multi-timescale variation of EWEP via observation, remote sensing, and numerical simulation. Based on the three main approaches, the major advances on EWEP over the past 25 years are systematically summarized in this work. Observations reveal distinct characteristics of the energy balance components and micrometeorological parameters. The roughness length for momentum is generally one order of magnitude higher than that for heat, and a distinct diurnal cycle of the excess resistance for heat transfer (kB-1) is captured. These progresses via observations further contributed to the improvement of remote sensing parameterization and numerical simulation of EWEP, e.g., the daily sensible heat flux can be overestimated by approximately 50% using a fixed kB(-1), while this overestimation can be mitigated with the observation-captured diurnal variation in kB(-1) taken into consideration. Moreover, multisource (multispectral, thermal, and microwave) satellite data have been successfully used to retrieve key land-atmosphere properties, which offers a feasible way to monitor EWEP at different spatiotemporal scales: A decreasing trend of sensible heat flux and an increasing trend of latent heat flux over the TP from 2001 to 2012 were reported. Hourly data of land surface heat fluxes over the entire TP were first obtained, with root mean square errors of 76.6 W m-(2) (net radiation flux), 60.3 W m(-2) (sensible heat flux), 71.0 W m&(-2) (latent heat flux) and 37.5 W m(-2) (soil heat flux), superior to the previous flux products. The total annual evaporation is approximately 51.7 +/- 2.1 km(3) year(-1) for high-elevation lakes with ice sublimation component accounting for around 10-25%. In addition, different numerical models have been evaluated and improved to study EWEP over heterogeneous land surfaces. The simulation accuracy of land surface temperature and surface energy balance in arid and semiarid areas was improved via an improved heat roughness parameterization scheme in Noah. The sensible heat flux was also effectively improved in the CoLM model by adopting an independent method to determine aerodynamic roughness length. All these results advanced the understanding of different aspects of EWEP over the TP by using in situ measurements, multisource satellite data and numerical modeling. Future studies are recommended to focus on the optimization of the current three-dimensional comprehensive observation system, the development of applicable parameterization schemes and the investigation of EWEP on weather and climate changes over the TP and surrounding regions.

TI  - Forest fire pattern and vulnerability mapping using deep learning in Nepal
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the last two decades, Nepal has experienced an increase in both forest fire frequency and area, but very little is known about its spatiotemporal dimension. A limited number of studies have researched the extent, timing, causative parameters, and vulnerability factors regarding forest fire in Nepal. Our study analyzed forest fire trends and patterns in Nepal for the last two decades and analyzed forest fire-vulnerability risk based on historical incidents across the country. Results We analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of forest fires and the extent of burned area using the Mann-Kendall trend test and two machine-learning approaches maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and deep neural network (DNN). More than 78% of the forest fire burned area was recorded between March and May. The total burned area has increased over the years since 2001 by 0.6% annually. The forest fire-vulnerability risk obtained from both approaches was categorized into four classes-very high, high, low, and very low. Conclusions Although burned area obtained from both models was comparable, the DNN slightly outperformed the MaxEnt model. DNN uses a complex structure of algorithms modeled on the human brain that enables the processing of the complex relationship between input and output dataset, making DNN-based models recommended over MaxEnt. These findings can be very useful for initiating and implementing the most suitable forest management intervention.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessment of regional scale evolution and distribution of glacial lakes in Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are a potential threat to the livelihoods and precious infrastructures in the Himalayan region. The expansion of these lakes under the influence of global warming further poses a grievous risk of natural disasters in the form of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) that necessitates regular monitoring to reduce and mitigate its implications. This research focuses on the regional scale distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the Himalayan mountain range with their causes. We used Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and operational land imager (OLI) images, Google Earth imageries, Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model, and Aphrodite climatic data to study lake evolution and its controlling parameters. A total of the 5,409 glacial lakes was taken for the size expansion analysis, which excludes supraglacial lakes. An expansion rate of 2.98%/yr and 1.01%/yr in glacial lakes number and size was found from 1990 to 2020, respectively. The glacial lakes are distributed mainly in Langtang, Bhutan, Sikkim and Everest region; while, new lakes are forming at higher elevations continuously. The highest lake size expansion was noted in 2015-2020 (36.51%) followed by 2000-2010 (21.72%) and 2010-2015 (10.65%), while 1990-2000 (3.36%) showed a lowest expansion rate. The highest expansion rate was noticed near an elevation band of 5000-5500 m. Moreover, lakes in the central and eastern Himalaya are highly decrease by climatic change, i.e., increase in temperature a decrease precipitation. The feature selection algorithm was used to identify the importance of various controlling parameters, which showed temperature change rate, glacier fed lake, glacier snout steepness, proximal distance, glacier calving frontal width, precipitation change rate and lake type gave higher weightage towards lake size change.

TI  - Assessing factors influencing students' perceptions towards animal species conservation
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The way humans perceive and interact with non-human animals is particular to each person, from antipathetic interactions evidenced by fear, aversion or repulsion, to empathy evidenced by feelings of affection, enchantment and interest in the animal. In this sense, herein we investigated the perception of university students about species belonging to different classes of wild vertebrates and the influence of social and educational factors on that.Methods: Data were obtained through online forms answered by 700 university students from nine Brazilian states, 328 females and 372 males, aged between 18 and 65 years. The form had eight sentences to be answered in relation to 17 species of wild vertebrates. The agreement level for each of these sentences was to be indicated using a five-point Likert scale. The sentences were designed to assess aesthetic, risk, utilitarian, and preservation perceptions attributed to each species by students.Results: We found that species perceived as useful by the students are generally also perceived as beautiful and as those that should be preserved. On the other hand, we found similarity between the species perceived as ugly and those that should not be preserved; and between the species perceived as harmful and those considered dangerous. Female and lower-income students more often agree that animals are harmful. We found that perceptions of danger in relation to animals were predominantly associated with younger respondents. However, this did not lead to less support for conservation among these students, as students of all age groups agree that species should be preserved. Our results show that students' knowledge area was an important predictor associated with empathetic and antipathetic perceptions. Environmental area students showed greater empathy in all analyzed categories (beauty, usefulness, harmlessness, and preservation) than non-environmental areas students. On the other hand, students from the area of the exact sciences showed greater dislike in all analyzed categories than students from other areas. We found a strong relationship between the areas "Environmental" and "Humanities, Languages and Arts" for the attitudinal factors associated with utilityand preservation, suggesting a similar empathetic worldview for students in these areas.Conclusions: We found that the perception directed towards wild vertebrates varies according to the gender, age, income and study area of the students, in addition to the taxon considered. Finally, our results indicate that negative perceptions should be taken into account in environmental education efforts, educational policies and in planning fauna conservation plans which should incorporate the most diverse audiences, and not only encompass charismatic species but extend to animals that arouse great aversion from the part of people.

TI  - The importance of population contextual data for large-scale biomonitoring using an apex predator: The Tawny Owl<i> (Strix</i><i> aluco)</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Top predators are often used as sentinel species in contaminant monitoring due to their exposure and vulnerability to persistent, bioaccumulative and, in some cases, biomagnificable contaminants. Some of their ecological traits can vary in space and time, and are known to influence the contamination levels and therefore information on ecological traits should be used as contextual data for correct interpretation of large-scale contaminant spatial patterns. These traits can explain spatiotemporal variation in contaminant exposure (traits such as diet and dispersal distances) or contaminant impacts (traits such as population trend and clutch size). The aim of our research was to review the spatial variation in selected contextual parameters in the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), a species identified by the COST Action European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility as one of the most suitable candidates for pan-European biomonitoring. A considerable variation in availability of published and unpublished contextual data across Europe was found, with diet being the most exten-sively studied trait. We demonstrate that the Tawny Owl is a suitable biomonitor at local scale but also that taking spa-tial variation of other contextual data (e.g. diet) into account is necessary. We found spatial gaps in knowledge about the species ecology and biology in Southern Europe, along with gaps in certain population parameters (e.g. population trends) in several countries. Based on our findings, we proposed a minimal recommended scheme for monitoring of population contextual data as one of the first steps towards a pan-European monitoring scheme using the Tawny Owl.

TI  - Wastewater monitoring in tourist cities as potential sentinel sites for near real-time dynamics of imported SARS-CoV-2 variants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) complements the clinical surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants' distribution in populations. Many developed nations have established na-tional and regional WBE systems; however, governance and budget constraints could be obstacles for low-and middle -income countries. An urgent need thus exists to identify hotspots to serve as sentinel sites for WBE. We hypothesized that representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two international gateway cities, Bangkok and Phuket, Thailand, could be sentineled for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to reflect the clinical distribution patterns at city level and serve as early indicators of new variants entering the country. Municipal wastewater samples (n = 132) were col-lected from eight representative municipal WWTPs in Bangkok and Phuket during 19 sampling events from October 2021 to March 2022, which were tested by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the US CDC N1 and N2 multiplex and variant (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2) singleplex assays. The variant detection ratios from Bangkok and Phuket followed similar trends to the national clinical testing data, and each variant's viral loads agreed with the daily new cases (3-d moving average). Omicron BA.1 was detected in Phuket wastewater prior to Bangkok, possibly due to Phuket's WWTPs serving tourist communities. We found that the Omi-cron BA.1 and BA.2 viral loads predominantly drove the SARS-CoV-2 resurgence. We also noted a shifting pattern in the Bangkok WBE from a 22-d early warning in early 2021 to a near real-time pattern in late 2021. The potential application of tourist hotspots for WBE to indicate the arrival of new variants and re-emerging or unprecedented infec-tious agents could support tourism-dependent economies by complementing the reduced clinical regulations while maintaining public health protection via wastewater surveillance.

TI  - Assessing the biophysical factors affecting irrigation performance in rice cultivation using remote sensing derived information
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the biophysical factors that affect the performance of irrigated crops in semi-arid conditions is pivotal to the success of profitable and sustainable agriculture under variable climate conditions. In this study, soil physical and chemical variables and plots characteristics were used through linear mixed and random forest -based modeling to evaluate the determinants of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop water productivity (CWP) in rice in the Kou Valley irrigated scheme in Burkina Faso. Multi-temporal Landsat images were used within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model to calculate rice ETa and CWP during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Results showed noticeable spatial variations in PySEBAL-derived ETa and CWP in farmers' fields during the study period. The distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet (DPSI), plot elevation, sand and silt contents, soil total nitrogen, soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in ETa and CWP in the farmers' fields, with DPSI being the top explanatory variable. There was generally a positive association, up to a given threshold, between ETa and DPSI, sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc. For CWP the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non-monotonic; that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in CWP. Our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the Kou Valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower altitudes (e.g. < 300 m above sea level) and closer to the scheme inlet, in conjunction with a good management of nutrients such as nitrogen and potassium through fertilization.

TI  - Assessment of changes in environmental factors in a tourism-oriented Island
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tourism development has influenced industrial structure changes and has become a major driving force for China's new urbanization. However, the development will negatively impact natural resources and the ecological environment and will become an essential driving factor for land use change. Therefore, understanding the impact of tourism urbanization is crucial for sustainable local development. This study selected the Dachangshan Island in the Changhai County, Dalian, China, as the study area, because it is the only coastal island-type border county in China. During the study period, changes in local environmental factors were analyzed based on land use data, Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data of 2009, 2014, and 2019. The results showed that: (1) the overall land surface temperature (LST) in the research region shows an increasing trend; the LST in 2014 and 2019 increased by 6.10 and 5.94 degrees C, respectively, compared with 2009. With respect to specific land types, impervious surfaces maintained a high land surface temperature (25.44, 32.38, and 31.86); however, surface temperatures for cropland, forest, grassland, and water bodies remained stable. (2) The land use land cover (LULC) change analysis from 2009-2019 indicates that impervious surfaces and cropland increased by 0.5653 km(2) and 0.9941 km(2), while the areas of forest, grassland, and water bodies decreased. The results also showed that forests (-1.3703 km(2)) are most affected by urbanization. (3) The results of the landscape index calculation showed that the variation at the patch scale is different for different LULC types. The patch density of impervious surfaces decreased, but the aggregation index increased over time, while the patch density of the forest increased continuously. At the landscape scale, overall patch type and distribution remained stable. The purpose of this study is to explore the environmental changes of islands and provide a reference for the sustainable development of islands.

TI  - Atlantic forest woody carbon stock estimation for different successional stages using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots and environmental impacts has made its landscape fragmented and heterogeneous. The heterogeneity of the fragments is a challenge for the character-ization and quantification of forest resources, such as the stock of biomass and carbon. Methodologies based on remote sensing have been used, to improve these estimates without compromising execution costs. The objective was to estimate, with high spatial resolution passive remote sensing, the aboveground carbon stock in fragments of different successional stages of the Atlantic Forest. Forests were classified into initial, intermediate, and advanced successional stages. In each stratum, 10 plots (20x50 m) were established, and the carbon stock was calculated by adjusted Schumacher and Hall model. The reflectances of the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands and vegetation indices (VIs) were obtained in the dry and rainy seasons, from MSI/Sentinel-2 images, with a resolution of 10 m. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), with different combinations of variables, were trained and validated with simulated reflectance values. Carbon was estimated by ANN with the best perfor-mance in training and validation. The average carbon stock in the initial, intermediate, and advanced strata was 24.99, 35.79 and 82.28 Mg ha -1, respectively, with a general average of 47.68 Mg ha -1. The carbon estimates were better with the ANN trained with the reflectances of the rainy season. The addition of VIs did not improve ANN performance. The simulated spectral data were consistent and adequate to validate the selected ANN. The total carbon stock, modeled was 41,962.15 Mg, ranging from 6.68 to 108.29 Mg ha -1, with an average of 48.70 Mg ha -1. The carbon stock in the advanced stratum is more than three times that observed in the initial stratum, and they were efficiently estimated using high-resolution multispectral data, obtained in the rainy season, as inputs.

TI  - A remote sensing-based method for high-resolution crop water footprint quantification in an irrigation district with complex planting structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop water footprint (WF) refers to the water consumption per unit grain production, which can reflect the quantity and types of water consumption over the entire growth period, providing a comprehensive view that is useful for agricultural water resources management. Generally, crop water consumption and crop yield are the main component of WF, but there are inconsistencies in their spatial resolution, thus it is difficult to effectively evaluate agricultural water usage under complex and variable planting structures. This study quantified crop yield and crop water consumption at fine resolution (250 m) using remote sensing methods and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of the green water footprint (WFg) and blue water footprint (WFb) of Chinese Baojixia Irrigation District (BID). Specifically, we firstly mapped the spatial distribution of the wheat and maize field using a remote sensing-based support vector machine (SVM) method, then the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was used to construct the yield estimation model based on multi-temporal remote sensing data, and a remote-sensing-based water balance assessment tool (RWBAT) model were constructed to quantify water consumption. Finally, the spatiotemporal variability of WFg and WFb at 250 m resolution was analyzed. The results show that the average annual WFg of wheat and maize in BID is 0.525 and 0.469 m3/kg, accounting for 81 % and 93 % of the total WF, respectively. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the low values of the total WF are concentrated in the central BID, while the high values are distributed in northwest part. The remote sensing-based method can effectively reflect the WF at high spatial and temporal resolution under complex planting structures, which can provide a basis for guaranteeing the efficient use and regulation of agricultural water resources.

TI  - A comparison of global mangrove maps: Assessing spatial and bioclimatic discrepancies at poleward range limits
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove distribution maps are used for a variety of applications, ranging from estimates of mangrove extent, defor-estation rates, quantify carbon stocks, to modelling response to climate change. There are multiple mangrove distribu-tion datasets, which were derived from different remote sensing data and classification methods, and so there are some discrepancies among these datasets, especially with respect to the locations of their range limits. We investigate the latitudinal discrepancies in poleward mangrove range limits represented by these datasets and how these differences translate climatologically considering factors known to control mangrove distributions. We compare four widely used global mangrove distribution maps -the World Atlas of Mangroves, the World Atlas of Mangroves 2, the Global Distri-bution of Mangroves, the Global Mangrove Watch. We examine differences in climate among 21 range limit positions by analysing a set of bioclimatic variables that have been commonly related to the distribution of mangroves. Global mangrove maps show important discrepancies in the position of poleward range limits. Latitudinal differences be-tween mangrove range limits in the datasets exceed 5 degrees, 7 degrees and 10 degrees in western North America, western Australia and northern West Africa, respectively. In some range limit areas, such as Japan, discrepancies in the position of mangrove range limits in different datasets correspond to differences exceeding 600 mm in annual precipitation and > 10 degrees C in the minimum temperature of the coldest month. We conclude that dissimilarities in mapping mangrove range limits in different parts of the world can jeopardise inferences of climatic thresholds. We expect that global mapping efforts should prioritise the position of range limits with greater accuracy, ideally combining data from field-based surveys and very high-resolution remote sensing data. An accurate representation of range limits will contribute to better predicting mangrove range dynamics and shifts in response to climate change.

TI  - Mapping crop type in Northeast China during 2013-2021 using automatic sampling and tile-based image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast China is one of the most major grain banks in China and has an overwhelming influence on food security. To mitigate the challenges caused by increasing food demands and soil protection, crop rotation and fallowing policies have been introduced in Northeast China. These soil protection policies change annual crop planting area and crop distribution. To monitor crop type and its changes on a regional scale in time series, we explore the automatic sampling approach by hexagon strategy and tile-based classification by random forest (RF) algorithm using time-series Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images during 2013-2021. The crop maps have high credibility with the overall accuracies (OA) wall-to-wall ranging from 0.89 to 0.97, and also have close agreement with statistical data city by city. This study provides a highly reliable long-term crop maps dataset, which can be helpful for food security and regional agricultural production management.

AB  - This study focuses on the determination and validation of a new global mean sea surface (MSS) model, named the Shandong University of Science and Technology 2020 (SDUST2020), with a grid size of 1 ' x1 '. This new model was established with a 19-year moving average method and fused multi-satellite altimetry data over a 27-year period (from January 1993 to December 2019). The data of HaiYang-2A, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A were first ingested in the SDUST2020 MSS but not in any other global MSS model, such as the CLS15 and DTU18 MSS models. Validations, including comparisons with the CLS15 and DTU18 MSS models, GPS-leveled tide gauges, and altimeter data, were performed to evaluate the quality of the SDUST2020 MSS model, all of which showed that the SDUST2020 MSS model is accurate and reliable. The SDUST2020 MSS dataset is freely available at the site (data DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6555990, Yuan et al., 2022).

TI  - Identifying Emeishan basalt by supervised learning with Landsat-5 and ASTER data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral-sensor images are advantageous in terms of discriminating major lithologies due to their high spatial resolution and intermediate spectral resolution, in addition to their low cost and high accessibility in comparison to hyperspectral images. In this study, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data-which are the most widely used multispectral data for the discrimination of the mixed rock units-are utilized to identify basalts in our study area. Further, prior knowledge regarding basalt-distribution areas in our study region is obtained from the geological-survey results conducted by the Sichuan Geological Survey at 2005, which is used as the reference of correction to assess our identified results. Small portions of this prior area of basalt distribution were verified through field checks, which were then determined as sites for use as training data for remote-sensing imagery. Three supervised-classification algorithms within ENVI 5.3-k-nearest neighbors (KNN), maximum likelihood classification (MLC), and support vertical machine (SVM)-were utilized for model identification. As a result, six models were constructed, including the KNN prediction of basalts by ASTER images, SVM prediction by ASTER, MLC prediction by ASTER, KNN prediction by Landsat-5 images, SVM prediction by Landsat-5, and MLC prediction by Landsat-5. The performances of the six models, in terms of precision and accuracy, show that the optimum model is Landsat-5 by SVM, with a precision of 70.92% and accuracy of 99.97%, followed by the ASTER by SVM model, with a precision of 67.72% and accuracy of 99.89% and the Landsat-5 by KNN model, with a precision of 57.23% and accuracy of 99.85%.

TI  - Effects of climate change and agricultural expansion on groundwater storage in the Amur River Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, the climate in the Amur River Basin (ARB) has changed, and large-scale wetlands in the region have been reclaimed for paddy fields. The study of the influence of climate change and agricultural expansion on groundwater storage is of great significance to the evaluation of regional water resource balance and the promotion of ecological protection and agricultural development. In this work, the groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) in the ARB and its drivers were analyzed for the period 2003-2016 using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, a Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and in situ observations of groundwater levels. Results indicated that 1) the GWSA in the ARB increased at a rate of 2.0-2.4 mm/yr from 2003 to 2016; the GWSA in the upper reaches of the ARB increased, whereas the GWSA in the middle and lower reaches decreased during the study period. 2) The GWSA in the middle and lower reaches of the ARB was greatly influenced by temperature (Tmp) and evapotranspiration (ET). Tmp was positively correlated with GWSA, whereas ET was negatively correlated with GWSA (p < 0.05). 3) Extreme rainfall had a delayed effect on groundwater recharge. Wetland degradation and agricultural development were the main factors causing the decrease of the GWSA in the middle and lower reaches of the ARB. In summary, temperature and evapotranspiration affect groundwater storage by regulating the water-heat balance, wetland reclamation reduces the regional storage capacity, and the irrigation required for reclaimed farmland is the main source of groundwater loss.

TI  - Air Pollution Exposure Based on Nighttime Light Remote Sensing and Multi-source Geographic Data in Beijing
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Air pollution is a problem that directly affects human health, the global environment and the climate. The air quality index (AQI) indicates the degree of air pollution and effect on human health; however, when assessing air pollution only based on AQI monitoring data the fact that the same degree of air pollution is more harmful in more densely populated areas is ignored. In the present study, multi-source data were combined to map the distribution of the AQI and population data, and the analyze their pollution population exposure of Beijing in 2018 was analyzed. Machine learning based on the random forest algorithm was adopted to calculate the monthly average AQI of Beijing in 2018. Using Luojia-1 nighttime light remote sensing data, population statistics data, the population of Beijing in 2018 and point of interest data, the distribution of the permanent population in Beijing was estimated with a high precision of 200 m x 200 m. Based on the spatialization results of the AQI and population of Beijing, the air pollution exposure levels in various parts of Beijing were calculated using the population-weighted pollution exposure level (PWEL) formula. The results show that the southern region of Beijing had a more serious level of air pollution, while the northern region was less polluted. At the same time, the population was found to agglomerate mainly in the central city and the peripheric areas thereof. In the present study, the exposure of different districts and towns in Beijing to pollution was analyzed, based on high resolution population spatialization data, it could take the pollution exposure issue down to each individual town. And we found that towns with higher exposure such as Yongshun Town, Shahe Town and Liyuan Town were all found to have a population of over 200 000 which was much higher than the median population of townships of 51 741 in Beijing. Additionally, the change trend of air pollution exposure levels in various regions of Beijing in 2018 was almost the same, with the peak value being in winter and the lowest value being in summer. The exposure intensity in population clusters was relatively high. To reduce the level and intensity of pollution exposure, relevant departments should strengthen the governance of areas with high AQI, and pay particular attention to population clusters.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) are endemic to grassland and shrub-steppe ecosystems of western North America, yet their distribution has contracted to <10% of their historical range. Primary threats to Columbian sharp-tailed grouse include loss of native habitat and conversion to agriculture, reductions in habitat once provided by the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), wildfire, and drought conditions, yet population-level consequences of these threats and their spatio-temporal scales of effect are poorly understood. We evaluated multi-scale effects of land cover, weather, and fire histories on patterns of abundance and productivity for Columbian sharp-tailed grouse populations during 1995-2020 in Idaho, USA, using mixed-effects generalized regression and remotely sensed data. We demonstrated negative effects of fire, tree encroachment, and bare ground, positive effects of spring and summer precipitation and cover of shrubs and perennial forbs and grasses, and positive effects of CRP on grouse abundance that changed in magnitude with cover of perennials and shrubs near leks (i.e., strongest effects when average cover of shrubs and perennial forbs and grasses were less abundant). We also demonstrated per capita recruitment of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse is positively associated with late-summer greenness. Our results show that several suspected threats have measurable, population-level impacts to Columbian sharp-tailed grouse within Idaho. Moreover, our results suggest ongoing changes occurring within the core range of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, including loss of CRP cover to tilled agriculture and changes to wildfire and precipitation dynamics are likely to have negative effects on populations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Wind farms have been proved to have potential impact on the ecology. As an important ecological factor, soil moisture has a great impact on the ecosystem. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the effect of wind farms on soil moisture. At present, the remote sensing data can be used to calculate the soil moisture of wind farm conveniently, but its spatial resolution is poor. Moreover, the measured soil moisture can't express the spatial difference. Therefore, through the effective combination of remote sensing data and measured data, this method can accurately judge the impact of wind farm on soil moisture. This method investigated wind farms located in the grasslands of China. Remote sensing images and field data were used to explore the area and extent of influence of wind farms on grassland soil moisture. We use Landsat images and field measurements to derive a linear relationship between the soil moisture and the TVDI, which was calculated based on the land surface temperature and NDVI, was developed in this work. The correlation was used to reverse spatial distribution map of soil moisture before and after the construction of wind farms. The diurnal and seasonal variation of the influence of the wind farm on the grassland soil moisture was also judged.center dot This method of combining measurement and remote sensing provides a reference for analysing the influence of wind farms on soil moisture.center dot This method can be used for reference to compare the meteorological factors of different wind directions before and after the construction of wind farms.

TI  - A multi-center cross-sectional investigation of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer with synchronous ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases based on the CSBrs-009
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The diagnosis and management of breast cancer with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases currently lack any applicable criteria or guidelines (ISLM), and diagnostic and treatment strategies are varied by medical centers. This study aimed to determine the current status of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer with ISLM among Chinese patients.Methods Data from 30 hospitals on ISLM breast cancer patients between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018, were systematically analyzed for the detection rate, clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis and treatment strategies of breast cancer with ISLM among Chinese patients.Results A total of 26,723 women presented with breast cancer in 30 hospitals over the study period. A total of 127 ISLM breast cancer patients were finally enrolled. Synchronous ISLM without distant metastases was present in 0.48% of cases. The diagnosis of patients with 86.6% of ISLM was based on ultrasound examinations. The proportion of ISLM diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) or core-needle biopsy (CNB) before surgery was 16.5% and 37.0%, respectively. Moreover, 45.7% of the ISLM patients had no pathological evidence. Regarding treatment strategies, 69.3% of ISLM patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for more than 4 cycles, while 15.7% of patients did not receive NAC. 86.6% of ISLM patients underwent a mastectomy, and breast-conserving surgery was performed in 3.9% of ISLM patients. Moreover, 41.7% of ISLM patients received supraclavicular lymph node dissection (SCLD), while 47.2% were not treated with SCLD.Conclusions The overall detection rate of breast cancer in patients with ISLM is low in China and varies widely between hospitals. There is no consensus on the optimal diagnosis and treatment of patients with ISLM breast cancer.

TI  - Vast ecosystem disturbance in a warming climate may jeopardize our climate goal of reducing CO<sub>2</sub>: a case study for megafires in the Australian ?black summer?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A warming climate is one of the most important driving forces of intensified wildfires globally. The unprecedented wildfires broke out in the Australian 'Black Summer' (November 2019-February 2020), which released massive heat, gases, and particles into the atmosphere. The total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires were estimated at similar to 963 million tons by using a top-down approach based on direct satellite measurements of CO2 and fire radiative power. The fire emissions have led to an approximately 50-80 folds increase in total CO2 emission in Australia com-pared with the similar seasons of 2014-2019. The excess CO2 from wildfires has offset almost half of the global anthro-pogenic CO2 emission reductions due to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 in 2020. When the wildfires were intense in December 2019, they caused a 1.48 watts per square meter additional positive radiative forcing above the monthly average in Australia and the vicinity. Our findings demonstrate that vast ecosystem disturbance in a warming climate can strongly influence the global carbon cycle and hamper our climate goal of reducing CO2.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change detection of land use land cover (LULC) in Fashiakhali wildlife sanctuary (FKWS) impact area, Bangladesh, employing multispectral images and GIS
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change has posed significant concerns to biodiversity and climate change in Bangladesh and globally. Despite the country's designation of forest regions as protected areas to conserve their valuable resources, deforestation and forest conversion remained unabated. Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and its surrounding forested impact area have experienced considerable changes over the years, yet are deficient in extensive assessment. This study evaluated the land use land cover (LULC) changes in the FKWS impact area over almost 3 decades (1994-2021) using multispectral remotely sensed data. The Landsat images of 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2021 were classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm and analyzed for change detection. The comparative potential of vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), in forest cover assessment, and the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI was also assessed. A significant forest cover loss of around 1117.17 ha (16%) was recorded in the FKWS impact area between 1994 and 2021, with the hugest proportion of 867.78 ha (12.24%) deforested in the first period (1994-2001). Agricultural land also declined by 593.73 ha (8.37%) within the entire period, despite its initial increase of 392.04 ha (5.53%) between 2001 and 2010, being the primary driver of earlier deforestation. However, in the recent decade (2010-2021), settlement expansion of 963.90 ha (13.59%) due to massive human migration in the area contributed to the most remarkable overall land cover change of 1731.51 ha (24.42%). Furthermore, NDVI provided a better and more accurate forest cover assessment than SAVI and was recommended to aid in the quick evaluation and monitoring of the future impacts of agriculture, settlement, and other sorts of land use on the forest cover. In tandem with the widely acknowledged issue of increased temperature due to climate change, an absolute negative correlation was found between the NDVI and LST, confirming the negative impact of climate change on forest loss in the FKWS impact area.

TI  - Learning urban region representations with POIs and hierarchical graph infomax
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the hierarchical graph infomax (HGI) approach for learning urban region representations (vector embeddings) with points-of-interest (POIs) in a fully unsupervised manner, which can be used in various downstream tasks. Specifically, HGI comprises several key steps: (1) training category embeddings as the initial features of POIs; (2) interconnecting POIs with a graph structure and performing graph convolution to capture the uniqueness of each POI based on its spatial context; (3) aggregating POIs to the regional level using multi -head attention mechanisms, to consider the multi-faceted influence from POIs to regions; (4) performing graph convolution at the regional level to generate region representations, to incorporate the similarities between adjacent regions; (5) aggregating region representations to produce an embedding at the city level. The model is finally trained through maximizing the mutual information among the POI - region - city hierarchy, which facilitates the information from local (POIs) and global (city) scales flowing to the learned region representations, making them both locally and globally relevant. We perform extensive experiments on three downstream tasks, i. e., estimating urban functional distributions, population density, and housing price, in the study areas of Xiamen Island and Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that HGI considerably outperforms several competitive base-lines in all three tasks, which proves that HGI could produce meaningful and effective region representations. In addition, the learned region representations based on POIs can potentially be used for reinforcing data repre-sentations from other modalities, e.g., remote sensing data. The implementation of HGI can be found at htt ps://github.com/RightBank/HGI.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and urbanization affect the regional energy balance. Accurate estimation of the earth's surface skin temperature and surface thermodynamic variables (temperature, T and relative humidity, RH) is essential to understand regional climate change better. The present study examined the agreeability between the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulated surface skin temperature (TSK) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) over heterogeneous LULC (built-up, crop land, forest cover, and barren land) in south-central India. Model performance metrics were computed for daytime and nighttime surface temperatures in January, May, and July 2021, representing winter, summer, and monsoon seasons. Further, the study compared the WRF-simulated near-surface (2 m from surface) T and RH with the observed hourly data from 20 locations in south-central India representing Tier-I, Tier-II, and Tier-III cities (high to low urbanization) to understand the effect of urbanization. Results indicate an overall high correlation (r > 0.9) between WRF-TSK and MODIS-LST. Nighttime correlations (r > 0.55) are relatively good enough for crop and forest land-use group than daytime simulations. In general, the correlation between TSK and LST is relatively poor for barren and built-up land-use groups during all three seasons (for both daytime and nighttime). Similarly, the WRF-simulated T and RH also differ considerably from the observed data in high and moderately dense urban locations, and the seasonal biases are predominant, especially during summer and winter. The WRF-simulated surface variables are a reasonable alternative in the absence of satellite-observed or surface-measured data in better understanding the environmental processes. However, the trends in the surface meteorological variables needs to be interpreted by duly considering the impact of land use and urbanization.

TI  - Intercomparison and evaluation of ten global ET products at site and basin scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles. ET products have proliferated. This study evaluates ten monthly, globally available products, including one product from the upscaling of in situ observations (FLUXCOM), one ensemble product (SynthesisET), four remote sensing-based products (SSEBop, MOD16, Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) and PT-JPLSM) and four prod-ucts from land surface models (Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), FLDAS, TerraClimate and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)). The assessments are conducted during the period of 2003-2013 using FLUXNET2015 eddy covariance datasets at the site scale, which are grouped by land cover, elevation and climate, and GRACE-based water balance ET at basin scales. The results indicate that all products show com-parable performance and that no single product shows the best performance. FLUXCOM and GLDAS have outstanding performances at both the site and basin scales, respectively. SynthesisET tends to have suboptimal performance at both validation scales, while FLDAS, SSEBop and TerraClimate show relatively poor results. Other products reproduced ET moderately well. The metrics of the two validation methods are compared. The results indicated that the performance of products at the basin scale is usually better than that at the site scale. The anomalies in specific regions and the trends among ET products are observed at both scales. In addition, the special relationship between the products and the validation methods will affect the credibility of their assess-ment results. This study contributes to the assessment of the performance of products to identify proper can-didates for hydrological analysis and improve the ET algorithm.

TI  - Data level and decision level fusion of satellite multi-sensor AOD retrievals for improving PM2.5 estimations, a study on Tehran
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - One of the techniques for estimating the surface particle concentration with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) is using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products. Different AOD products are retrieved from various satellite sensors, like MODIS and VIIRS, by various algorithms, such as Deep Blue and Dark Target. Therefore, they don't have the same accuracy and spatial resolution. Additionally, the weakness of algorithms in AOD retrieval reduces the spatial coverage of products, particularly in cloudy or snowy areas. Consequently, for the first time, the present study investigated the possibility of fusing AOD products from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors retrieved by Deep Blue and Dark Target algorithms to estimate PM2.5 more accurately. For this purpose, AOD products were fused by machine learning algorithms using different fusion strategies at two levels: the data level and the decision level. First, the performance of various machine learning algorithms for estimating PM2.5 using AOD data was evaluated. After that, the XGBoost algorithm was selected as the base model for the proposed fusion strategies. Then, AOD products were fused. The fusion results showed that the estimated PM2.5 accuracy at the data level in all three metrics, RMSE, MAE, and R-2, was improved (R-2=0.64, MAE=9.71 mu g/m(3), RMSE=13.51 mu g/m(3)). Despite the simplicity and lower computational cost of the data level fusion method, the spatial coverage did not improve considerably due to eliminating poor quality data through the fusion process. Afterward, the fusion of products at the decision level was followed in eleven scenarios. In this way, the best result was obtained by fusing Deep Blue products of MODIS and VIIRS sensors (R-2=0.81, MAE=7.38 mu g/m(3), RMSE=10.08 mu g/m(3) ). Moreover, in this scenario, the spatial coverage was improved from 77% to 84%. In addition, the results indicated the significance of the optimal selection of AOD products for fusion to obtain highly accurate PM2.5 estimations.

TI  - Assessing impact of agroecological interventions in Niger through remotely sensed changes in vegetation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is a major challenge in the Sahel region of West Africa. Water scarcity in combination with prevalent soil degradation has severely reduced the land productivity in the region. The decrease in resiliency of food security systems of marginalized population has huge societal implications which often leads to mass migrations and conflicts. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and development organizations have made major investments in the Sahel to improve resilience through land rehabilitation activities in recent years. To help restore degraded lands at the farm level, the World Food Programme (WFP) with assistance from USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance supported the construction of water and soil retention structures called half-moons. The vegetation growing in the half-moons is vitally important to increase agricultural productivity and feed animals, a critical element of sustainable food security in the region. This paper investigates the effectiveness of interventions at 18 WFP sites in southern Niger using vegetative greenness observations from the Landsat 7 satellite. The pre - and post-intervention analysis shows that vegetation greenness after the half-moon intervention was nearly 50% higher than in the pre-intervention years. The vegetation in the intervened area was more than 25% greener than the nearby control area. Together, the results indicate that the half-moons are effective adaptations to the traditional land management systems to increase agricultural production in arid ecosystems, which is evident through improved vegetation conditions in southern Niger. The analysis shows that the improvement brought by the interventions continue to provide the benefits. Continued application of these adaptation techniques on a larger scale will increase agricultural production and build resilience to drought for subsistence farmers in West Africa. Quantifiable increase in efficacy of local-scale land and water management techniques, and the resulting jump in large-scale investments to scale similar efforts will help farmers enhance their resiliency in a sustainable manner will lead to a reduction in food security shortages.

TI  - Effects of compound disturbance on Canada lynx and snowshoe hare: Wildfire and forest management influence timing and intensity of use
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are increasing in scale and impact on the landscape, altering large amounts of wildlife habitat and forest ecosystems. The reduction of fuels through forest management is considered a primary way to reduce the extent and severity of wildfires before they occur but may lead to a decrease in tree density prohibitive of some species' habitat. Alternatively, management actions undertaken after a fire may speed the trajectory of burned areas back into quality habitat but may also impede this development if the wrong type of treatment is un-dertaken. Thus, information on how different management actions, applied either pre-or post-fire, can influence the timing of a burned area's return to suitable habitat will help managers conserve species on the landscape. Our study aims to understand how a rare carnivore, Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), uses stands managed with different silviculture actions at different times relative to wildfire. We used GPS locations from 39 individual lynx collected from 2004 to 2015 to examine the response of lynx to wildfire compounded by active forest man-agement, where time since fire at time of use ranged from 1 to 27 years. To understand the drivers behind lynx use of wildfires, we also focused on the primary prey of Canada lynx, snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), using pellet counts across a similar range of post-fire treatment types in fires between 22 and 28 years old. We also assessed vegetation recovery and forest structure over time since wildfire using remotely sensed data and field measurements. We found that lynx intensity of use differed based on timing and type of management action, with the greatest lynx use similar to 25 years after a wildfire managed with post-fire regeneration cuts (removal of the ma-jority of the canopy). Lynx use was likely driven by hare abundance, which was also highest in post-fire regeneration cuts, characterized at time of use by dense lodgepole pine stands. We conclude that managing landscapes with a mosaic of active (pre-and post-fire treatments) and passive (hands-off) management will best conserve a desirable range of lynx habitat in an increasingly fire-impacted landscape.

TI  - A Hybrid Algorithm for Urban LULC Change Detection for Building Smart-city by Using WorldView Images
T2  - IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Technological advancement in smart cities can have adverse effects on the environment. Timely monitoring of smart cities to preserve environmental sustainability is a thrust area of research. It can be done by using change detection with multi-temporal satellite data. The success of these methods solely depends on the calibre of the backend image segmentation and Land-use Land-cover classification technique. The limitation of using cutting-edge classification algorithms is the availability of a proper dataset and identification of the edge structure of different LULC classes. In contrast, a segmentation algorithm cannot detect LULC classes automatically. In this research, we eliminated these shortcomings by considering a hybrid approach. We proposed a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ISODATA-embedded large-scale change detection method. This method can automatically segment, detect, and perform LULC change analysis. We have considered the multi-sensor dataset of Barasat, West Bengal, India, obtained from the WorldView satellite sensor for the experimental study. The proposed method is validated concerning three different cutting-edge methods.

TI  - Effects of electroacupuncture on rats with cognitive impairment: An iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study explores the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at the governing vessel (GV) on pro-teomic changes in the hippocampus of rats with cognitive impairment. Methods: Healthy male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, model and EA. Cognitive impair-ment was induced by left middle cerebral artery occlusion in the model and EA groups. Rats in the EA group were treated with EA at Shenting (GV24) and Baihui (GV20) for 7 d. Neurological deficit was scored using the Longa scale, the learning and memory ability was detected using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and the proteomic profiling in the hippocampus was analyzed using protein-labeling tech-nology based on the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). The Western blot (WB) analysis was used to detect the proteins and validate the results of iTRAQ. Results: Compared with the model group, the neurological deficit score was significantly reduced, and the escape latency in the MWM test was significantly shortened, while the number of platform crossings increased in the EA group. A total of 2872 proteins were identified by iTRAQ. Differentially expressed pro-teins (DEPs) were identified between different groups: 92 proteins were upregulated and 103 were downregulated in the model group compared with the sham group, while 142 proteins were upregulated and 126 were downregulated in the EA group compared with the model group. Most of the DEPs were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolipid metabolism and synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we also verified 4 DEPs using WB technology. Although the WB results were not exactly the same as the iTRAQ results, the expression trends of the DEPs were consistent. The upregulation of heat-shock pro-tein b1 (Hspb1) was the highest in the EA group compared to the model group. Conclusion: EA can effect proteomic changes in the hippocampus of rats with cognitive impairment. Hspb1 may be involved in the molecular mechanism by which acupuncture improves cognitive impairment.

Geospatial technology approaches that integrate statistical data, spatial models, earth observation satellite data, and climate modeling can be used to conduct strategic analyses for understanding the potential and efficiency of renewable energy development. This study aims to create the first spatial model of its kind in Southeast Asia to develop multi-renewable energy from solar, wind, and hydropower, further broken down into residential and agricultural areas. The novelty of this study is the development of a new priority model for renewable energy development resulting from the integration of area suitability analysis and the estimation of the amount of potential energy. Areas with high potential power estimations for the combination of the three types of energy are mostly located in northern Southeast Asia. Areas close to the equator, have a lower potential than the northern countries, except for southern regions. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plant construction is the most area-intensive type of energy generation among the considered energy sources, requiring 143,901,600 ha (61.71%), followed by wind (39,618,300 ha; 16.98%); a combination of solar PV and wind (37,302,500 ha; 16%); hydro (7,665,200 ha; 3.28%); a combination of hydro and solar PV (3,792,500 ha; 1.62%); and a combination of hydro and wind (582,700 ha; 0.25%). This study is timely and important because it will inform policies and regional strategies for transitioning to renewable energy, with consideration of the different characteristics present in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Assessment of the grassland carrying capacity for winter-spring period in Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The grassland ecosystems of Mongolia are among the most sensitive to global climate change because of the arid and semiarid climate. As a key source of primary productivity for livestock, the quantification of the carrying capacity in grassland for the winter and early spring period is crucial for sustainable livestock management and livelihoods of herders in Mongolia. In this study, we used remote sensing data and ancillary data to propose a framework to estimate the aboveground biomass(AGB) and the carrying capacity of grassland (GCC) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. We analysed the spatial and temporal changes in the GCC for the winter-spring period in Mongolia during 2000-2020, and the grassland carrying status index for winter-spring period (GCSIW) was proposed to reflect grassland utilization and livestock carrying status over the past 21 years. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of AGB and GCC estimation using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model with the root-to-crown ratio method within the GEE environment. The AGB model validation showed good performance with an R2 of 0.67-0.71 and RMSE of 22.91-28.94 g/m2. Significant in-creases in AGB and GCC over the 21 years were found in Mongolian grasslands and most provinces. The average GCSIW increased significantly during 2000-2020 in the whole country and all provinces, indicating the increasing stocking density and the overexploited status of grassland in recent years. The multiregression analysis further showed that the dramatic increase in livestock populations contributed 87.5% and 55%-99% to the variations in the GSCIW for the grassland and seventeen provinces, respectively. These results will be useful and helpful in supporting sustainable grassland management and the sustainable livelihoods of herders in Mongolia.

TI  - An integrated solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence model for more accurate soil organic carbon content estimation in an Alpine agricultural area
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is closely related to vegetation photosynthesis and can sensitively reflect the growth and health of vegetation. Using the advantages of SIF in photosynthetic physiological diagnosis, this study carried out a collaborative study of SIF, land attrib-utes and image reflectance spectra to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) content in typical agricultural areas of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP).Methods The spectral reflectance (R), first deriva-tive of reflectance (FDR), second derivative of reflectance (SDR) of spectral band of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were selected together with land attributes (i.e. elevation, slope, soil temperature, and soil moisture content) and SIF index and vegetation indices to establish the SOC content estimation models using the random forest (RF), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and partial least squares regression (PLSR), respectively.Results SIF index can significantly improve the SOC content estimation compared to the veg-etation indices. The accuracy of the BPNN model established by combining SIF index with the FDR of Landsat 8 OLI data and land attributes was the highest (R-2 = 0.977, RMSEC = 2.069 gmiddotkg(- 1), MAE = 0.945 gmiddotkg(- 1), RPD = 3.970, d-factor = 0.010). Conclusion This study confirmed the good effect of BPNN model driven by SIF index, land attributes, and Landsat 8 OLI data on the estimation of SOC content, which can provide a new way for the accu-rate estimation of the soil internal components in the agricultural areas.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHAP) was adopted as a second-line antimalarial for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana following a review of the country's antimalarial medicines policy. Available data obtained in 2007 had shown PCR-uncorrected therapeutic efficacy of 93.3% using a 28-day follow-up schedule. In 2020, the standard 42-day follow-up schedule for DHAP was used to estimate efficacy levels among febrile children aged 6 months to 9 years in three malaria sentinel sites representing the three main ecological zones of the country- savannah, forest, and coastal. PCR genotyping distinguished between recrudescence and re-infection using merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2)-specific primers for FC27 and 3D7 strains. Per protocol analyses showed day 28 efficacy of 100% in all three sentinel sites with day 42 PCR-corrected efficacy ranging between 90.3% (95% CI: 80.1 - 96.4%) in the savannah zone and 100% in the forest and coastal zones, yielding a national average of 97.0% (95% CI: 93.4 - 98.8). No day 3 parasitemia was observed in all three sites. Prevalence of measured fever (axillary temperature >= 37.5 degrees C) declined from 50.0 - 98.8% on day 0 to 7.1-11.5% on day 1 whilst parasitemia declined from 100% on day 0 to 1.2 - 2.3% on day 1. Mean haemoglobin levels on days 28 and 42 were significantly higher than pre-treatment levels in all three sites. We conclude that DHAP is highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana. This data will serve as baseline for subsequent DHAP efficacy studies in the country.

TI  - Classification of land use/land cover using artificial intelligence (ANN-RF)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because deep learning has various downsides, such as complexity, expense, and the need to wait longer for results, this creates a significant incentive and impetus to invent and adopt the notion of developing machine learning because it is simple. This study intended to increase the accuracy of machine-learning approaches for land use/land cover classification using Sentinel-2A, and Landsat-8 satellites. This study aimed to implement a proposed method, neural-based with object-based, to produce a model addressed by artificial neural networks (limited parameters) with random forest (hyperparameter) called ANN_RF. This study used multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8) and a normalized digital elevation model as input datasets for the Sana'a city map of 2016. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed model (ANN_RF) is better than the ANN classifier with the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellites individually, which may contribute to the development of machine learning through newer researchers and specialists; it also conventionally developed traditional artificial neural networks with seven to ten layers but with access to 1,000's and millions of simulated neurons without resorting to deep learning techniques (ANN_RF).

TI  - Changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of an urban stream fish assemblage: A 30-year perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, freshwater fish diversity is rapidly changing in response to land use change, including urbanization. Time series of freshwater fish communities can help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of species loss and gains, as well as promote conservation strategies. Traditional approaches to understand the dynamics of fish assemblages is traditionally focused on taxonomic diversity, one aspect among many dimensions of biodiversity. Thus, using complementary analytical methods, such as functional diversity, can help researchers to develop a stronger predictive framework on the effects of the species loss or gains in response to urbanization. We assessed temporal changes of fish assemblages in an urban stream in East Texas between four seasonal surveys of 1989-1990 and 2018-2019. We explored the similarities and differences in species richness, composition, and functional diversity of fishes. Although the species richness and functional richness between the two time periods were similar, we observed changes in species composition. We also observed higher functional dispersion and evenness in the 2018-2019 assemblage compared to 1989-1990 assemblage. Some fish species were locally extirpated, while others colonized the system, increasing the functional diversity of the current assemblage. Urbanization has commonly been associated with declines in diversity and richness, however, our findings suggest that the addition of a few invasive generalist species (e.g., blue tilapia) and native tolerant (e.g., redbreast sunfish, blacktail shiner) in this stream system could be associated with increased human activities in this small, urbanized area in East Texas. Streams in East Texas support very diverse fish assemblages, with some sentinel species (e.g., imperiled shiners: Sabine shiner, a habitat-affinity, broadcast spawner) rapidly responding to stream alterations. Multiple stressors can underlie the dynamics and composition of fish assemblages; thus, it is essential for more comparative studies of current and historical data of fish assemblages. Likewise, studies targeting sentinel fish species may have more utility for the evaluation of freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Development and validation of a clinical rule for the diagnosis of chikungunya fever in a dengue-endemic area
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rio de Janeiro is a dengue-endemic city that experienced Zika and chikungunya epidemics between 2015 and 2019. Differential diagnosis is crucial for indicating adequate treatment and assessing prognosis and risk of death. This study aims to derive and validate a clinical rule for diagnosing chikungunya based on 3,214 suspected cases consecutively treated at primary and secondary health units of the sentinel surveillance system (up to 7 days from onset of symptoms) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Of the total sample, 624 were chikungunya, 88 Zika, 51 dengue, and 2,451 were negative for all these arboviruses according to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The derived rule included fever (1 point), exanthema (1 point), myalgia (2 points), arthralgia or arthritis (2 points), and joint edema (2 points), providing an AUC (area under the receiver operator curve) = 0.695 (95% CI: 0.662-0.725). Scores of 4 points or more (validation sample) showed 74.3% sensitivity (69.0% - 79.2%) and 51.5% specificity (48.8% - 54.3%). Adding more symptoms improved the specificity at the expense of a lower sensitivity compared to definitions proposed by government agencies based on fever alone (European Center for Disease Control) or in combination with arthralgia (World Health Organization) or arthritis (Pan American Health Organization, Brazilian Ministry of Health). The proposed clinical rule offers a rapid, low-cost, easy-to-apply strategy to differentiate chikungunya fever from other arbovirus infections during epidemics.

TI  - The de-globalisation of capital? The political economy of community wealth building
T2  - NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Community wealth building (CWB) is a strategy for local economic development that aims to (re-)circulate wealth within the places that produce it - a kind of de-globalisation of capital. CWB has come to prominence in the UK due to its implementation in Preston and endorsements from the Corbyn-led Labour Party. However, CWB has come under criticism for promoting protectionism. As a way into the political economy of CWB, this article analyses this criticism. We do so by bringing the policy debate in the UK into dialogue with political economy literature on protectionism and nationalism. We show that protectionism is as much a political weapon or slur used to discredit interventionist development strategies as it is an analytical concept at home in technical economic discourse. On this basis, we argue that CWB is not protectionist neither in its policy proposal nor in its wider worldview. However, CWB does limit itself to the local without a clear redistributive mechanism between municipalities and so risks siloing local areas from one another.

TI  - Remote sensing and statistical analyses for exploration and prediction of soil salinity in a vulnerable area to seawater intrusion
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils along the Egyptian coast are vulnerable to environmental degradation and soil salinity problems. The main objective of this study is to identify and rapidly predict salt affected soils using remote sensing data and multivariate statistical analysis. To achieve this objective, the Operational Land Imager 8 (OLI) of Landsat im-agery acquired in March 2022 was processed through the Maximum Likelihood classifier to assess Landscape features and to produce Normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Water and soil samples were collected from 13 field sites as ground truth data and to investigate representative physical and chemical properties. Linear regression model was used to predict soil salinity while soil parameters were mapped using Inverse Distance Weight (IDW) in ArcGIS 10.5. In order to explore the soil salinity content using VNIR-SWIR spectra, this work investigated the potential of Partial least squares regression (PLS regression) and SVM (Support vector machine). For simulating salinity in the investigated area, a total number of 65 different sites were identified considering that almost 75 % (50 sites) were used to develop the model and 25 % (15 sites) for validation of the established model. The results indicated that EC levels of water samples are not suitable for irrigation (> 3 mS/cm). Majority of the collected soil samples represent saline-alkaline soils. NDSI ranged from-0.83 to 0.57 with mean of-0.25. Based on the variance of components, 90 % of data were obtained from the first three PCA. The PLS model's R2 score of 0.763 and extremely lowp value indicates how well it predicts soil salinity. SVM model R2, on the other hand, is 0.719. Further, Ca++ and Mg++ are the main significant parameters selected in the predicted model. This shows that remote sensing data and multivariate analysis are very important tools to map spatial variation and predict soil salinity. The developed model for salinity considered both the spectral retrieved parameters and lab analyses of cations giving higher accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain regions are vital to the provision of ecosystem services. "Cofre de Perote" volcano is the eighth highest mountain in Mexico and provides various goods and services to the people living in the central region of Veracruz. Despite being a protected area as a national park, it shows processes of landscape change in recent years. We mapped land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC) based on remote sensing data (Sentinel-2) from 2017 and 2021. The best classifier was the support vector machine with an overall accuracy value of 0.908 +/- 0.003 and 0.916 +/- 0.004 for 2017 and 2021, respectively. We estimated that 21.77% of the area changed in only four years. The main trajectory of change was from forests to agricultural, with an area of 1224.81 ha and an annual rate of change of -2.39%. Updating knowledge on the dynamics of LULCC will allow better conservation actions for the mountain ecosystems.

TI  - TROPOMI/S5P Total Column Water Vapor validation against AERONET ground-based measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor plays an important role in the greenhouse effect, rendering it an atmospheric constituent that requires continuous and global monitoring by different types of remote sensing instruments. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument Sentinel-5 Precursor (TROPOMI/S5P) Total Column Water Vapor (TCWV) is a new product retrieved from the visible blue spectral range (435-455 nm), using an algorithm that was originally developed for the GOME-2/MetOp sensors. For the purposes of this work, 2.5 years of continuous satellite observations at high spatial resolution are validated against co-located (in space and in time) precipitable water Level 2.0 (quality-assured) ground-based measurements from the NASA AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork). The network uses Cimel Sun photometers located at approximately 1300 stations globally to monitor precipitable water among other products. Based on data availability, 369 of the stations were used in this study. The two datasets, satellite- and ground-based, were co-located, and the relative differences of the comparisons were calculated and statistically analyzed. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the two products is found to be 0.91, and the mean bias of the overall relative percentage differences is of the order of -2.7 %. For the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (30-60 & LCIRC; N), where the density of the ground-based stations is high, the mean relative bias was found to be -1.8 %, while in the tropics (& PLUSMN;15 & LCIRC;) the TROPOMI TCWV product has a relative dry bias of up to -10 %. The effect of various algorithm and geophysical parameters, such as air mass factor, solar zenith angle, clouds and albedo, is also presented and discussed. It was found that the cloud properties affect the validation results, leading the TCWV to a dry bias of -20 % for low cloud heights (cloud top pressure (CTP) > 800 hPa). Moreover, cloud albedo introduces a wet bias of 15 % when it is below 0.3 and a dry bias up to -25 % when the clouds are more reflective. Overall, the TROPOMI/S5P TCWV product, on a global scale and for moderate albedo and cloudiness, agrees well at -2.7 & PLUSMN;4.9 % with the AERONET observations but probably within about -8 % to -13 % with respect to the "truth ".

TI  - Plant species richness prediction from DESIS hyperspectral data: A comparison study on feature extraction procedures and regression models
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of terrestrial vascular plants plays a key role in maintaining the stability and productivity of ecosystems. Monitoring species compositional diversity across large spatial scales is challenging and time consuming. Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were r = 0.76 and RMSE = 5.89 for the Southern Tablelands region, and r = 0.68 and RMSE = 5.95 for the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of plant species richness. Our results provide a quantitative reference for future studies exploring the potential of spaceborne hyperspectral data for plant biodiversity mapping.

TI  - Simulation and prediction of sediment loads using MUSLE-HEC-HMS model in the Upper Ewaso Nyiro River Basin, Kenya
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment management in the river basins is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed. Sediment loads over time have been varying due to extensive changes in the climatic, biophysical, and anthropogenic activities carried out in the river basin. These changes threaten the natural sustainability of the basin and cause negative impacts on local, social, and economic development, including pastoralism, ranching, and agriculture. This study aimed at modeling the sedimentation rate in the Upper Ewaso Nyiro River Basin (UENRB) using the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) model and Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model. The study utilized remotely sensed data for the UENRB: Landsat imageries, soil data, a digital elevation model, and rainfall data. The MUSLE parameters generated from the datasets included the practice factor, cover management, soil erodibility, topography, and precipitation for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The models were calibrated, and the simulated results indicated that the sedimentation loads varied in the various sub-basins as the years progressed from 1990 to 2020. In 2020, the highest river sediment load experienced in one of the sub-basins was 415,803.5 tons, while the lowest sediment load was 34,137.70 tons. It is essential to regulate the variables that aid in the variability of the sediment loads in the river sub-basins. Thus, there is a need to formulate a framework and concrete measures to ensure the river basin's protection and restoration, in line with Kenya's Vision 2030.

TI  - Multi-agent hyperspectral and lidar features fusion for urban vegetation mapping
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urban vegetation recognition based on remote sensing data is highly affected by the complexities of urban areas due to the existence of various kinds of objects and their relations. Spectral similarities between tree canopies and types of grass lands, spatial adjacency between houses and tall trees, shadow and occluded areas make some difficulties for recognition of the plant species. In this research, the capabilities of multi-agent systems are utilized for feature fusion of hyperspectral imagery and lidar data for improving the vegetation recognition results in urban areas. The proposed algorithm has two main steps composed of generating a knowledge base containing spectral and height features extracted from input hyperspectral and Lidar data, respectively, and performing the hierarchical classification process to generate vegetation classification map based on parallel processing by object recognition agents. Evaluation of the capabilities of the proposed methodology is performed on hyperspectral and lidar DSM over Houston University and its surrounding areas. According to the obtained results, fusion of hyperspectral and Lidar DSM with the capabilities of multi-agent processing can improve the overall accuracy of vegetation recognition results for about 15.53% and 6.58% comparing with performing multi-agent and maximum likelihood classifier only on hyperspectral image, respectively.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of DOC concentration of reservoirs in Northeast China based on CDOM absorption
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) widely exists in water, accounting for 10%-90% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In order to analyze the distributions of DOC concentrations in the reservoirs in the northeastern China, five field campaigns were carried out in Baishan Reservoir and Fengman Reservoir in the Songhua River Basin from 2015 to 2020. Based on the analysis of the absorption characteristics of CDOM coefficient (355 nm), the remote sensing inversion model of CDOM absorption coefficient at 355nm (R-2 = 0.82) is established by band ratio method based on Landsat series satellites and the DOC concentrations of the reservoirs are estimated according to the strong correlations between CDOM and DOC. The results show that: The CDOM concentrations of inland reservoirs in the northeastern China can be well retrieved by using the in-situ sampling data and Landsat datasets; The annual spatial -temporal distributions of CDOM and DOC concentrations in the Baishan Reservoir and the Fengman Reservoir from 2000 to 2020 are with low fluctuations, and the concentration of CDOM and DOC appeared an upward trend after 2010. The Baishan Reservoir and the Fengman Reservoir have lower M values (the ratio of absorption coefficient of CDOM at 250 nm and 365 nm) and S275-295(the slope of the absorption spectrum of CDOM at the 275-295 nm), and higher SUVA(254)(the ratio of CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm to DOC concentration), indicating that the humic contents in the CDOM compositions are higher, and tend to be consisted of terrigenous macromolecules. Using multiple regression analysis method to analyze the annual driving factors of CDOM distributions of the reservoirs is mainly affected by rainfalls, fertilizer applications and sewage discharges. Finally, this study enriches the understanding of the variations of CDOM concentrations in typical reservoirs in the northeastern China and provides a reference for the construction of DOC inversion models and contributes to the accuracy estimation of DOC concentrations.

TI  - Evaluation of adjuvant therapy for T1-2N1miM0 breast cancer without further axillary lymph node dissection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFor breast cancer (BC) with sentinel lymph node micrometastases (SLNMs), there are limited data to guide the selection of postoperative adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to identify target populations who might benefit most from adjuvant therapy and examine prognostic factors among patients with T1-2N1miM0 BC with one or two SLNMs who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. MethodsThere were 7,423 patients diagnosed with T1-2N1miM0 BC between 2010 and 2015, and patients with one or two SLNMs were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. All the patients underwent SLNB alone without further axillary lymph node dissection, and they were stratified according to adjuvant therapy. The statistical significance of categorical variables was analyzed using the chi(2) test. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were used to analyze characteristics predictive of Breast-cancer-specific survival and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier methods with the log-rank test was analyzed to compare survival difference between the different treatments. ResultsAdjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved 5-year OS rates. Multivariate analysis revealed that age >= 70 years, high grade, T2 stage, triple-negative subtype, and absence of radiotherapy were poor prognostic factors for OS. Patients who received breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), luminal A, luminal B, or basal-like subtype, and T1c or T2 stage benefited from adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients who received BCS, and those with IDC, luminal A subtype, and T1b, T1c, or T2 stage benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy. ConclusionOur findings provide a clinical evaluation of treatment choice after surgery, which may help clinicians make individualized clinical decisions.

TI  - Research on user-generated photos in tourism and hospitality: A systematic review and way forward
T2  - TOURISM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Visual content has become an integral component of consumers' experience sharing. People increasingly search for visual content posted by others prior to making purchase decisions. This work adopts a systematic review methodology to examine user-generated photo-related tourism and hospitality research published in academic journals between 2006 and 2021 by topics, methods, and theoretical underpinnings. The 106 articles analyzed fall under four themes: 1) motivation for photo sharing; 2) tourists' destination image perception; 3) tourists' spatiotemporal behavior; and 4) impact of user-generated photos. Analytical methods have progressed in their abilities to collect, process, and analyze large volumes of imagery data. Techniques range from traditional manual qualitative content-semiotic analysis to advanced spatial analysis and artificial intelligence-based quantitative approaches. Theoretical development has varied topically given the descriptive nature of research questions in some domains. A multi-dimensional framework is developed to offer a holistic view of the progress, limitation, and future directions for user-generated photo research.

TI  - Watershed-level spatial pattern of degraded alpine meadow and its key influencing factors in the Yellow River Source Zone of West China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to characterize the watershed-level distribution patterns of severely degraded alpine meadows commonly known as "heitutan" in the Yongqu River basin of the Source Zone of Yellow River. Topographic data were analyzed in ArcGIS to derive several variables and delineate multi-level watershed units. In addition, remotely sensed data were analyzed to map ground covers in two-level watershed units (i.e. first-level and second-level watershed units), including heitutan degraded grassland. The two sets of results were intersected to identify the correlation of land covers and spatial proximity with heitutan and their possible influences on it. The results show that the alpine meadow in the Yongqu watershed comprised 51.39 % of the total area, and shrub grassland accounted for 45.45 % of the total area. At the first-level tributary unit of the Yongqu watershed, heitutan-degraded grassland is the most common feature at 4.75 km2, accounting for 2.46 % of all alpine meadows. Heitutan patches on average have a minimal size of 1007 m2. Most heitutan patches are distributed on gentle, mainly sunny, and semi-sunny slopes of 7-18 degrees in gradient. They are situated within 1000 m of roads, accounting for 90.53 % of total "heitutan", while 96.56 % are distributed within 0-1500 m of settlements. At the second-level tributary unit of the Hallaqu and Chayangwa, heitutan is the most common at 1.23 and 0.41 km2, respectively, accounting for 0.79 % and 1.01 % of the total alpine meadows. However, the highest proportion in the Chayangwa River basin is in the 0-3 degrees beach areas. The areas widely distributed with heitutan heavily overlap with those affected by overgrazing and rodent activities. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling indicate that slope exerts the greatest influence on the formation and distribution patterns of the heitutan degraded grassland, followed by slope aspect and distance to roads. In comparison, distance to river channels and settlements and the annual temperature has an insignificant influence on the heitutan degraded grassland.

TI  - Synergetic use of DEM derivatives, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for mapping soil properties of a sloped cropland based on a two-step ensemble learning method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial variability of soil organic matter (SOM), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), and soil total potassium (STK) is important to support site-specific agronomic management, food production, and climate change adaptation. High-resolution remote sensing imageries have emerged as an innovative solution to investigate the spatial variation in agricultural soils with machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the predic-tive power of the individual and combined effects of Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral images for mapping soil properties, especially STN, STP, and STK, have rarely been investigated. Moreover, single ML model may achieve unstable performance for predicting multiple soil properties due to strong spatial heterogeneity. This study explored the combine use of S1, S2, and DEM derivatives to map SOM, STN, STP, and STK content of a sloped cropland of northeastern China. A two-step method with a weighted sum of four ML models was proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness in predicting multiple soil properties. Our results showed that single ML model has various performance in predicting the four soil properties. The optimal ML models could explain approximately 56 %, 53 %, 56 % and 37 % of the variability of SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Using the weights estimated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the two-step ensemble learning model was retrained and showed more robust performance than the four ML models, in which the prediction accuracy was im-proved by 2.38 %, 1.40 %, 3.52 %, and 3.29 % for SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Our results also showed that the optical S2 derived features, especially the two S2 short-wave infrared bands, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index, were more important for soil property prediction than S1 data and DEM derivatives. Compared with individual sensor, a combination of S1 and S2 data yielded more accurate predictions of STN and STP but not for SOM and STK. The results of this study highlight the potential of high-resolution S1 and S2 data and the two-step method for soil property prediction at farmland scale.

TI  - Estimation of sea surface <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux in the East China Sea using in-situ and satellite data over the period 2000-2016
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) is an important variable to characterize the state of the seawater carbonate system. It is required to calculate the air-sea CO2 flux (FCO2) and for understanding ocean acidification. Surface ocean pCO(2) is influenced by thermodynamic process, physical mixing, biological activity and air-sea gas exchange. Knowledge of the surface pCO(2) in the East China Sea (ECS) is limited due to a lack of observations and well-informed models. This study employed in situ hydrographic (sea surface temperature and salinity) and carbonate system observations combined with satellite observations of chlorophyll a to develop a regional multiple non-linear regression (MNR) model to estimate pCO(2) for three different physical-biogeochemical domains of the ECS. Comparison of the pCO(2) from in situ observations with the MNR model had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 45.19 mu atm and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87 in the transitional domain, an RMSE of 11.59 mu atm and R-2 of 0.92 in the shelf-dominated domain and an RMSE of 3.73 mu atm and R-2 of 0.97 in the open water domain. The reliability of the MNR model was also validated using an independent dataset with a good accuracy (RMSE of 9.15 mu atm for domain II and RMSE of 7.71 mu atm for domain III). The MNR model was applied to estimate the surface pCO(2) and FCO2 for ten cruises on the period of 2013-2018, and also used to predict monthly surface pCO(2) by using Changjiang Biology Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) outputs for the period of 2000-2016 on the ECS inner shelf, and analyzed the seasonal and interannual variability of surface pCO(2) and FCO2. The seasonal dynamics of sea surface pCO(2) were mainly attributed to temperature changes, biological activities and water mixing process over the seasons. The time series of surface pCO(2) and FCO2 on the ECS inner shelf showed an increasing trend of 3.32 +/- 0.79 mu atm yr(-1) and 0.018 +/- 0.0125 mol CO2 m(-2) yr(-2), and the region was a CO2 sink with an CO2 uptake of 0.12 +/- 0.48 Tg C yr(-1).

TI  - Predictive accuracy of elevated mitotic rate on lymph node positivity and recurrence in thin melanomas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMitotic rate (MR) is considered an important prognostic factor for melanoma but is not currently used for staging because its nuanced effect is not yet well-delineated. We sought to determine if T category-specific MR is predictive of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity, recurrence, and melanoma-specific mortality (MSM). MethodsA retrospective review of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma from 1994 to 2020 at a single academic center was performed. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were recorded. MR was considered elevated for each AJCC8-defined T category if it was >= 2 mitoses/mm(2) for T1, >= 4 mitoses/mm(2) for T2, >= 6 mitoses/mm(2) for T3, or >= 7 mitoses/mm(2) for T4. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the predictive accuracy of MR on selected outcomes while controlling for ulceration. ResultsData from 2,984 patients with complete records were analyzed. Along with Breslow thickness and ulceration, elevated MR was associated with higher risk of MSM (HR 1.816, P=0.0001). There was no difference among patients with ulcerated T1 or T2 tumors regardless of MR, but those with non-ulcerated T1 or T2 tumors and elevated MR were more likely to have positive SLNs (PP=0.0043, respectively) and recurrence (P=0.0007 and P=0.0004, respectively) compared to counterparts with low MR. There were no notable differences for T3 or T4 tumors based on MR. ConclusionsElevated MR is associated with SLN positivity and recurrence in thin melanomas, independent of ulceration. SLN biopsy should therefore be strongly considered for patients with non-ulcerated lesions <0.8 mm thick if the MR is >= 2 mitoses/mm(2).

TI  - Evaluating the effect of the incidence angle of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 on detecting aquaculture facilities for sustainable use of coastal space and resources
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Driven by the growing world population, aquaculture plays a key role in meeting the increasing demand for food. However, aquaculture facilities in Japan are widely installed in coastal waters where natural disasters, such as typhoons and tsunamis, might wash these facilities away, thereby interfering with maritime navigation safety. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently monitor the state of aquaculture facilities daily, particularly after a disaster in real time. To this end, several new space-borne L-band synthetic aperture radars (SARs) continue to be launched now and in the future, whose utilizations are expected to increase nationally and internationally. An example is the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, currently operating a SAR that can be operated day and night, and even under cloudy conditions, called ALOS-2 PALSAR-2.Methods: Based on the above facts, this study evaluated the effect of the incidence angle of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 HH single-polarization data, using 3 m spatial resolution, on aquaculture raft detection. As the study site, we selected Ago Bay, located on the Pacific coast of Mie Prefecture in central Japan since the Nankai Trough Megathrust Earthquake and tsunamis have been predicted to occur in the future around this area. Then, we analyzed the sigma zero (backscattering coefficient) of aquaculture rafts and their surrounding sea surfaces, including the relationships between satellite orbits and aquaculture raft directions.Results: Investigations revealed that the optimum incidence angle for detecting aquaculture rafts in this study was 33.8 degrees-45.1 degrees. Differences in the sigma zero values existed between the ascending and descending orbits. However, the incidence angles differed on the orbits. Then, differences in the median sigma zero values across a range of incidence angles were evaluated under the descending orbit. In addition, when the directions of the aquaculture rafts were closely perpendicular to the satellite orbit, aquaculture rafts tended to show the highest values of sigma zero due to Bragg resonance scattering. Hence, this knowledge may allow for the rapid detection of aquaculture rafts during an emergency without going on-site.

TI  - An Algorithm for Selecting Buoy Skin Paddle Design for Flap Monitoring in Total Autologous Breast Reconstruction After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Monitoring buried flaps in reconstructive breast surgery is challenging, and the ideal technique is controversial. Established options include leaving an exterior ("buoy" or "sentinel") skin paddle versus invasive implantable devices to avoid removing the paddle later. Technical modifications and an algorithm for strategic skin paddle positioning to circumvent this while avoiding complex monitoring equipment are proposed.Patients and methods Patients in whom buoy skin paddles were utilized for breast flap monitoring by a single surgeon were reviewed. Indications, demographic details, precise monitoring paddle location, and flap outcomes were evaluated. An algorithm and classification system were then formulated.Results Thirteen buoy skin paddles were utilized in seven patients (mean age: 43.5 years; range: 31-65) to monitor reconstructive flaps performed for risk-reducing mastectomies (four patients and seven breasts), therapeutic mastectomy (one breast), and revision surgery (three patients and five breasts). The flaps comprised seven deep inferior epigastric artery perforators (DIEPs), four superficial inferior epigastric arteries (SIEAs), and two pedicled latissimus dorsi (LDs) (mean free flap weight: 809 g; average mastectomy weight (n = 10 breasts): 467 g; range: 248-864). The skin paddles were located horizontally along the inframammary crease or vertically inferior to the nipple-areola or both. All flap transfers were successful with no re-explorations. All patients declined the monitoring paddle excision, and none have requested breast mound revision for poor cosmesis or contour deformities.Conclusion Vertical and horizontal skin paddles proved reliable for buried flap monitoring without recourse to invasive and expensive equipment. When designed appropriately, they do not require revision surgery. An algorithmic classification of skin paddle location to enable this is proposed.

TI  - A framework for the sustainable risk assessment of in-river hydraulic structures: A case study of Taiwan's Daan River
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Taiwan has frequently suffered from extreme rainfall in the past decades. A rainfall-induced flood tends to cause the failure of the in-river structure, ecological catastrophe, and even loss of human life and property. This study proposes a risk assessment framework balancing in-river structures' design strength and ecological impact. The Daan River of Taiwan is examined as a case study to test the proposed framework. First, the study applied persistent scatterer differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) techniques to analyze the interferometric images captured from the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify large-scale terrain deformation zones of the watershed. A numerical simulation was then applied to assess the impact of different protective in-river structures. Finally, calculations examined the Froude numbers to assess the ecological effects of landscape and fish habitat indicators. In addition, the study applied a wireless monitoring method (i.e., float-out device) to assess riverbed scouring near piers in high-risk regions. The results indicated that the majority habitat type of the stream during base flow is a glide, with an area of about 32%, with run accounting for about 10%. Riffles with high flow velocity and low water depth occupy only about 1%. The primary habitat type during the period of flooding is run with pools near the shore, providing an essential refuge habitat for fish during floods. During the constant current period, exposed sand bars occupy about 55% of the total study area of the river. When a flooding event occurs, the size of the sand bars can be reduced by 40%. Flooding hurts the quality of the habitat of the two fish species considered in this study, with the adverse ecological effects leading to degraded or scattered habitats. The creation of sufficient pool areas on the right bank of the river channel should facilitate the foraging and utilization of fish during regular flow and as a refuge during periods of flooding.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing data on habitat suitability and functional connectivity to inform multitaxa roadkill mitigation plans
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ContextRoad impacts on biodiversity are increasing worldwide. Few attempts have been made to integrate multiple taxonomic groups into roadkill mitigation plans, while using remotely sensed habitat suitability and functional connectivity.ObjectivesWe pinpoint high-risk road locations (road planning units) for 19 woodland species from different taxonomic groups (non-flying mammals, birds, and bats) to enhance prioritisation and versatility of roadkill mitigation plans.MethodsIn Southern Portugal, we collected species occurrence data, roadkill, and high-resolution satellite imageries, along 15 years. We identified remotely sensed habitat metrics, in turn weighted together with functional connectivity models and road metrics to estimate roadkill vulnerability, using random forests. The roadkill cumulative risk across species is then estimated, as well the likelihood variation within and between taxonomic groups to verify prediction consistency.ResultsRemote sensing information thoroughly explained habitat suitability, identifying similar metrics within each group, and non-uniform environmental tolerance across species. Functional connectivity and habitat suitability significantly explained mortality, highlighting connected woodlands and neighbouring matrices. The roadkill cumulative risk endorses a conspicuous prioritisation of road planning units for implementing mitigation structures useful for multiple species, with high precision and low probability variation within each group. Some discrepancies in prediction consistency still emerge after group comparisons regarding bats.ConclusionsWe provide novel insights for multitaxa ecological responses and roadkill evaluations, demonstrating a possible spatial prioritisation in mortality patterns from species with different traits. The identified road units support resilience and multifunctionality over long-term, enabling to assist cost-effective mitigation plans. Findings ultimately offer versatility during the mitigation planning phase throughout the identification of road sub-optimal units, and opportunity costs given their potential for different taxa.

TI  - An ecologically-constrained deep learning model for tropical leaf phenology monitoring using PlanetScope satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forests, leaf phenology signals leaf-on/off status and exhibits considerable variability across scales from a single tree-crown to the entire forest ecosystem. Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine-and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. We developed an index -guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (percentage of upper tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices charac-teristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470-2819 mm year -1). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness against corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n = 9 sites) and local phenocams (n = 9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90 m x 90 m) with r2 = 0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale sea-sonality with r2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.

TI  - Characteristics and influence factors of the glacial lake changes in China from 1990 to 2020
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 505 scenes of Landsat images, the distributions and variations of the glacial lakes within Chinese territory were investigated by combining automated glacial lake boundary extraction and artificial visual interpretation in 2000 and 2020. Compared with the glacial lake inventory data in 1990, the characteristics and affecting factors of the glacial lake changes in China during the period of 1990-2020 were analyzed. The results showed that the glacial lake area in China increased by (180.1 +/- 0.1) km(2) from 1990 to 2020, with a change of 17.9%. Thereinto, the glacier-fed lake area expanded significantly, with the area expansion of 22.9%, while the non-glacier-fed lake area changed only 4.9%. The glacial lake area showed a rapid growth trend at high altitude during 1990-2020. During this period, the glacial lake area expanded the most at above 5500 m, reaching 30.5%. At the subregional scale, precipitation and evaporation mainly affect the changes of non-glacier-fed lakes, where evaporation played a more significant role. Temperature rise and glacier retreat are the main reasons for rapid expansion of glacier-fed lakes.

TI  - Remote sensed analysis of spatial and temporal variation in phenology of algal blooms in Lake Chaohu since 1980s
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal changes of harmful algal blooms (HABs) indicate the phenological characteristics of algal blooms to some extent, the study of the phenological variations in HABs can provide a scientific reference for lake management and ecological restoration. Previous studies with MODIS data cannot monitor the situation before 2000, largely limiting the understandings on the spatiotemporal variation in HABs in Lake Chaohu. Here, we employed heritage Landsat missions and MODIS data to extend the time series of HABs based on the floating algae index and a threshold segmentation technique, the spatiotemporal changes and driving factors of HABs in Lake Chaohu from 1987 to 2020 were analyzed on the basis of ensuring the consistency of HABs results between Landsat and MODIS. The results showed that: (1) Comparing to 1987-1999, the area of algal blooms increased significantly after 2000 and a peak of 608.4 km(2) was found in 2011. (2) The temporal variations in cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Chaohu were divided into three stages in the period of 1987-2020. From 1987 to 2004, the annual start time of HABs was earlier significantly, while the duration of HABs increased significantly. The start time of the outbreak delayed significantly, and the duration of HABs did not change significantly from 2005 to 2010. From 2011 to 2020, the start time, termination time, and duration of HABs showed fluctuating changes with an insignificant decrease. (3) Changes in the timing of HABs in Lake Chaohu were mainly related to climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration and were influenced by nutrients as well. During 1987-2004, the earlier start of the outbreak was dominated by the mean annual temperature in the previous year. From 2005 to 2010, the delay in the start of the outbreak was due to the combined effect of temperature, sunshine and precipitation in the spring; the earlier termination time and shorter duration of outbreak were associated with annual precipitation. This study established a four decades of long-term series variations of algal blooms in Lake Chaohu which provided insights to the spatio-temporal characteristics and driving forces of cyanobacterial blooms and largely improved the scientific disposal and response of algal blooms under the context of climate changes.

TI  - Estimating vertically growing crop above-ground biomass based on UAV remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) can assist in crop growth monitoring and grain yield prediction. Remote sensing has been widely used for AGB estimation at regional and local scales in recent years. However, optical remote sensing spectral indices (SIs) become saturated at medium-to-high crop covers. The combined use of remote sensing techniques and statistical regression models is not based on an under-standing of how crop leaves and vertical organs contribute to the crop AGB. This causes difficulties in measuring the biomass stored in vertical organs (e.g., plant stem, wheat-spike, maize-tassel; abbreviated as AGBv) using optical remote sensing. This study aims to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based vertically growing crop AGB (VGC-AGB) model. We defined Csm (g/m) to describe the crop stem and reproductive organs' average dry mass content. This was done to improve the estimation of AGBv. The crop leaf area index (LAI, m(2)/m(2)), leaf dry matter content (Cm, g/m(2)), height (Ch, m), and density (Cd, m(-2)) were used in the VGC-AGB. The VGC-AGB calculated crop leaf AGB (AGBl) using LAI x C-m (g/m(2)) and AGBv using C-d x C-h x C-sm (g/m(2)). The proposed VGC-AGB (AGB = LAI x C-m + C-d x C-h x C-sm) was verified using field and UAV-based hyperspectral datasets of winter-wheat and summer-maize at three growth stages. Our results indicate that UAV-based VGC-AGB (R-2 = 0.92-0.93, RMSE = 68.82-75.15 g/m(2)) is superior to the statistical regression model that is based on remote sensing SIs and CSMs (R-2 - 0.77, RMSE - 134.94 g/m(2)). The results indicate that the UAV-based VGC-AGB supports the analysis of crop photosynthetic product transfers and high-performance UAV-based high-performance non-destructive AGB monitoring.

TI  - Remote sensing drought factor integration based on machine learning can improve the estimation of drought in arid and semi-arid regions
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Drought usually occurs as a result of an imbalance between water supply and demand. Drought indices, an important tool for studying drought, are commonly used for drought monitoring and drought risk assessment. The ground-based drought indices, with high accuracy, are limited in the area monitored. In contrast, the remotely sensed drought index covers a large area but with poor accuracy. Data-driven data fusion-based estimation of ground indices helps to fill this gap. The overall objective is to determine whether various remotely sensed drought factors can effectively monitor drought in arid and semi-arid northern China. In this study, the ground-based drought index SPEI was reconstructed by using remotely sensed drought factors, divided from the Global Precipitation Measuring Mission GPM, GLDAS, and MODIS satellite sensors as well as environmental covariates. Based on climate elements, soil elements, vegetation, and environmental covariate elements, a composite drought index CDIS was established in this study. In this study, the single drought index, multivariate linear integrated drought index, and bias-corrected random forest method were used as the prediction model. Based on ground truth historical climate data as reference data, the performance of the model-predicted composite drought index CDIS in drought monitoring was evaluated. Our results indicate that the drought index on 1-month time scale has no significant advantage over the maximum single drought index. The bias-corrected random forest model with drought index predictions outperformed multiple linear regression and single drought index, with higher prediction accuracy in semi-arid and semi-humid regions than in arid regions. Compared with the ground station drought indices, the drought map based on bias-corrected random forest shows visual and statistical consistency. Under the background of a non-homogeneous and complex surface environment, the model prediction results integrating environmental covariates performed best, and the method used in the study was effective and could be extended and applied. For areas where information is scarce, remote sensing data can be easily extended to regional scale monitoring, which can better achieve high-precision drought monitoring at the regional scale.

TI  - Monitoring Uruguay?s freshwaters from space: An assessment of different satellite image processing schemes for chlorophyll-a estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Uruguay's freshwater network is threatened by widespread Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) known to be triggered by human-related stressors such as land-use change and urban/industrial efflu-ents. Existing field-based monitoring practices are limited due to their sparse spatial and tempo-ral coverage. A complementary approach these techniques is to utilize remotely sensed observa-tions for estimating optically relevant water-quality (WQ) parameters, of which chlorophyll -a (Chla) is a robust proxy for HAB quantification. There is, however, a lack of information on apt country-scale image processing schemes, i.e., the best combination of Chla algorithms, atmos-pheric correction (AC) methods, and satellite sensors that agree best with in situ Chla across Uruguay's inland and coastal waters. Here, we analyze the accuracy of three different combina-tions of ACs (SeaDAS, POLYMER, and ACOLITE) and 17 Chla models applied to the Operational Land Imager (OLI), Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) on-board Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A/B, Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. The performance of different pro-cessing schemes was assessed both in terms of their numerical consistency with in situ Chla and classification accuracy for discriminating low vs. high Chla with an 8 mg m-3 decision boundary. Our results show that the Mixture Density Networks (MDN) algorithm is often among the top per-formers. Other strong results were achieved by Gons (2 bands), Moses (3 bands) and Normalized Difference Chla Index algorithms. Regarding the atmospheric correction processors, POLYMER works better for OLCI, and SeaDAS for the OLI, while no clear distinction among AC methods was found for MSI. Furthermore, the MDN model was also among the most reliable for assigning wa-ter pixels to low or high Chla ranges. This could represent a key criterion for discriminating water bodies with good ambient conditions critical for reporting nationwide Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3.2 and other monitoring applications.

TI  - Weekly to monthly terminus variability of Greenland's marine-terminatingoutlet glaciers
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal terminus-position variability of Greenland'smarine-terminating outlet glaciers is superimposed on multidecadal trendsof glacier retreat. To characterize this seasonal variability, we manuallydigitized terminus positions for 219 marine-terminating glaciers inGreenland from January 2015 through December 2021 using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mosaics. We digitized at a monthly frequency for 199 glaciers and at a6 d frequency for 20 glaciers. We found that nearly 80 % of glaciertermini in Greenland vary significantly on a seasonal basis. For theseseasonally varying glaciers, on average, seasonal retreat typically beginsin mid-May, and seasonal advance generally commences in early October. Thetiming of the initiation of the retreat period may be related to the timingof the onset of ice-sheet surface melt. The rate of retreat events peaks inlate summer and reaches a minimum in late winter and early spring. Themedian magnitude of terminus-position seasonality, the difference betweenglacier length at the dates of peak advance and retreat, is about 220 m. We find a stronger correlation between this magnitude and glacier velocity than between magnitude and glacier width. Terminus-position seasonality caninfluence longer-term glacier dynamics and, consequently, ice-sheet massbalance. This study contributes to our understanding of terminus-positionseasonality for individual glaciers and collectively for glaciers around the entire Greenland Ice Sheet.

TI  - Hidden Cycles of Time in the Layout of Mesoamerican Ballcourts
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thousands of ballcourts are known throughout Mesoamerica, as they are usually a main component of public architecture at mostly high-ranking archaeological sites. These buildings appear in different designs and layouts and were deeply tied to politics, religion, sacred belief, ritual, ceremonies, and sport. Considering that the construction of public buildings followed well-established architectural standards in accordance with social norms and religious concepts, I hypothesize that ballcourts were designed using closed polygon layouts with lengths and areas that displayed significant worldview numbers and time counts. Analysis of the layouts of 28 ballcourts from 17 archaeological sites indicates that Mesoamericans intentionally plotted short- and long-term annual and ritual calendric counts, and lunar and Venus synodic cycles. It is concluded that these buildings hosted public events to commemorate the completion or beginning of a new time cycle and to honor the related deities for whom they were built.

TI  - Effect of an Asthma Exacerbation on Medication Adherence
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have looked at the effect of an asthma exacerbation on asthma medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: To measure asthma medication adherence in the 12 months after an asthma exacerbation and the influence of care type (specialist vs primary care provider) as well as social economic status on adherence.METHODS: We measured portion of days covered (PDC) during the 12 months before and after an exacerbation in a cohort of patients with asthma who were aged 18 years and older. Subanalyses looked at PDC in those who had more than one exacerbation after the sentinel exacerbation, by type of care received (primary care, allergist or pulmonologist, or no care) during both periods and by socioeconomic status (SES), defined as the lower quartile of annual income for the group.RESULTS: In a cohort of 1,697 patients, PDC improved significantly (from 0.44 to 0.53; P < .001) after an asthma exacerbation. Improvement in PDC was even greater (from 0.45 to 0.57; P < .001) if they had more than one exacerbation after the sentinel exacerbation. Being seen by a specialist after the exacerbation but not before it, resulted in the greatest improvement in PDC (0.17 mean change). Patients not seen by a specialist either before the exacerbation or after had a mean change of just 0.07. Those with a lower SES had an overall lower PDC before the exacerbation (0.37 vs 0.43) but saw a similar improvement in the PDC compared with those in a higher SES (0.09 vs 0.10).CONCLUSIONS: An asthma exacerbation is associated with a significant and sustained effect on medication adherence.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of the Zabuye Salt Lake in Tibet, China using LightGBM algorithm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zabuye Salt Lake in Tibet, China is the only salt lake in the world that contains natural crystalline lithium carbonate. The grade and spatial distribution of mineral resources are of great importance to the development and utilization of salt lake mineral resources. The use of remote sensing technology for salt lakes observations can overcome the disadvantages of traditional station observations, such as spatial discontinuity, high time consumption, and high labor costs. In addition, machine learning algorithms can efficiently analyze the information from remote sensing data. In this study, Landsat-8 remote sensing image data and the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm were used to perform inversions of the depth, salinity, and lithium concentration of the Zabuye Salt Lake. Moreover, the water volume, total salinity, and total lithium content of Zabuye Salt Lake in 2000 and 2017 were estimated, and the distribution of mineral resources and changes during the study period were analyzed. The results show that the water depth and volume of the entire lake increased sharply in 2017, resulting in a decrease in salinity and lithium concentration in the lake. Due to the inflow from the surrounding dry salterns, the South Lake experienced a relatively small change. Furthermore, the amount of lithium resources in North Lake decreased significantly in 2017 compared to 2000, possibly due to higher temperatures during the month of observation, which led to precipitation of lithium carbonate. Our study proves the feasibility and accuracy of the LightGBM machine learning algorithm for rapid inversion of salt lakes, which provides technical insight into remote sensing inversion of other mineral resources in salt lakes. Thus, the development of remote sensing technology in recent years can provide increasingly detailed assessments of salt lake resources in the future.

TI  - Contrasting changes of snow cover between different regions of the Tibetan Plateau during the latest 21 years
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal resolutions of snow remote sensing data have been increasing, but the unique snow characteristics such as thin snow depth and high frequency of change on the Tibetan Plateau have limited their applicability in this region. In this study, five commonly used snow remote sensing data were evaluated based on snow observations at 139 stations during the latest 20 years, and the advantages of each data were integrated to develop a multi-source data fusion snow cover dataset for the Tibetan Plateau. Based on these data, we conducted snow zonation and comparative snow variability analysis on the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated that the snow cover days on the Tibetan Plateau are not only influenced by the longest snow cover duration (SCD) but also controlled by the short-term snow cycles. More than 70% of the annual snow cover days come from short-term snow cycles, except the Amu Darya and Indus. From 2000 to 2021, 23.0% of the plateau has experienced a significant decrease in snow cover days (mainly in the southeast) and 4.9% has experienced a significant increase (mainly in the northwest). As the altitude increases, the area and magnitude of the decreased and increased snow cover increases, and at high altitude the areas with increased snow are greater than that with decreased. The significant reduction in the snow cover days over large areas of the plateau stems from the superimposed effect of the simultaneous reductions in the longest SCD and the short-term snow cycles, but the reduction in the Amu Darya and Indus comes mainly from the reduction in the short-term snow cycle. The significant increase in the snow cover days in the Amu Darya, Indus, Tarim, and Hexi mainly comes from the increase in the longest SCD, while that in the Yellow River and Qaidam mainly comes from the increase in the short-term snow cycles. This contrasting change in the snowpack on the Tibetan Plateau, which decreases in the southeast and increases in the northwest, with a large decrease at lower elevations and an increase at higher elevations, will bring new challenges to water resource management in the region.

Previous studies focused mainly on extracting phenological metrics (e.g., the start of season, and end of season) from time-series remote sensing data for a complete growing season. The existing NRT crop phenology detection methods are difficult to implement at the sub-field scale using available high spatial resolution satellite datasets with a low temporal resolution. In addition, these existing approaches can only estimate specific phenological events from the remote sensing perspective, which is different from the commonly used Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry (BBCH) scale used in crop phenology. In this study, an NRT phenology framework was proposed to detect and forecast phenology for winter wheat and corn from Sentinel-2 time-series data in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The framework incorporated both the canopy structure dynamics model (CSDM) and the shape model-fitting approach to capture crop growth of development over time. The framework can be performed in NRT using timely available Sentinel-2 data during the growing season. The day of year (DOY) for each phenological stage and the BBCH scale on a specific date can be obtained. The resultant Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs, days) of BBCH scales were less than 2.9 for winter wheat and less than 3.7 for corn. The RMSEs of detected DOY of all the phenological stages were less than 4 days for winter wheat and less than 3.7 days for corn except for the senescence and the end of season (EOS) stage.

TI  - Why so moderate? Understanding millennials' views on the urban housing affordability crisis in the post-socialist context of the Czech Republic
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The housing affordability crisis is one of the most pressing issues in urban centres around the globe, affecting especially young adults. Some theorists have in response begun calling for the provision of more public housing or less housing financialisation (free market). The goal of our article is to demonstrate the housing attitudes of Czech millennials towards state interventions that are designed to address the decline in housing affordability, using a quantitative attitude survey and a series of qualitative interviews. The results of our study reveal that young Czechs are sceptical about increased public housing provision as a solution, and on the whole their views align more with the neoliberal ideas, the very ideas that are criticised by critical theorists. We show that there are contextual reasons that explain why young Czechs are not calling for radical policy change - reasons such as familialism, which facilitates the intergenerational transmission of norms, habitus, and resources within families; the legacy of socialism and society transformation; a belief that more redistribution of resources could be unfair; and stronger support for competition, individualism and right-wing politics. There is also, however, some inconsistency and uncertainty in their attitudes, especially between their general worldview and their suggestions for concrete action. This study contributes to the research in the field of youth studies that looks at young people's strategies for dealing with the problem of decreasing housing affordability, and to the discussions surrounding diverse housing policy responses to a common global challenge.

TI  - Prediction of flash flood susceptibility using integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) algorithms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape of Pakistan is vulnerable to flood and periodically affected by floods of different magnitudes. The aim of this study was aimed to assess the flash flood susceptibility of district Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan using geospatial model and Frequency Ratio and Analytical Hierarchy Process. Also, the study considered eight most influential flood-causing parameters are Digital Elevation Model, slop, distance from the river, drainage density, Land use/Land cover, geology, soil resistivity (soil consisting of different rocks and soil formation) and rainfall deviation. The rainfall data was collected from weather stations in the vicinity of the study area. Estimated weight was allotted to each flood-inducing factors with the help of AHP and FR. Through the use of the overlay analysis, each of the factors were brought together, and the value of drainage density was awarded the maximum possible score. According to the study several areas of the region based on the parameters have been classified in flood zones viz, very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, and very low risk. In the light of the results obtained, 4% of the study area that accounts for 86.25 km(2) is at high risk of flood. The areas like Bagham, Sohawa, Domeli, Turkai, Jogi Tillas, Chang Wala, Dandot Khewra were located at the very high elevation. Whereas Potha, Samothi, Chaklana, Bagrian, Tilla Jogian, Nandna, Rawal high-risk zones and have been damaged badly in the flood history of the area. This study is the first of its kind conducted on the Jhelum District and provides guidelines for disaster management authorities and response agencies, infrastructure planners, watershed management, and climatologists.

TI  - Automatic retrieval of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emission source from TROPOMI products
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) satellite observations are key for monitoring volcanic activity, and for mitigation of the associated risks on both human health and aviation safety. Automatic analysis of this data source, including robust source emission retrieval, is in turn essential for near real-time monitoring applications. We have developed fast and accurate SO2 plume classifier and segmentation algorithms using classic clustering, segmentation and image processing techniques. These algorithms, applied to measurements from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor platform, can help in the accurate source estimation of volcanic SO2 plumes originating from various volcanoes. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of different pixel classification methodologies to retrieve SO2 source emission with a good accuracy. We compare the algorithms, their strengths and shortcomings, and present plume classification results for various active volcanoes throughout the year 2021, including examples from Etna (Italy), Sangay and Reventador (Ecuador), Sabancaya and Ubinas (Peru), Scheveluch and Klyuchevskoy (Russia), as well as Ibu and Dukono (Indonesia). The developed algorithms, shared as open-source code, contribute to improving analysis and monitoring of volcanic emissions from space.

TI  - Non-linear phase linking using joined distributed and persistent scatterers
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a python package for nonlinear phase linking of full resolution SAR images using both distributed and persistent scatterers. In the workflow, the first step is to find for each pixel the set of self-similar pixels in order to identify persistent and distributed scatterers. Next the phase linking is performed using the full complex coherence matrix containing the wrapped phase values of each distributed scatterer. Our package uses a hybrid approach consisting of eigenvalue decomposition-based maximum likelihood phase linking and the classic eigenvalue decomposition method. The latter is used for pixels with a non-invertible covariance matrix. A sequential mode achieves computational efficiency. The next step is to unwrap the phase by selecting an opti-mum unwrapping network of interferograms and invert for the unwrapped phase time-series which is converted to the displacement time-series. We show how the performance of phase linking depends on the temporal cor-relation behavior using simulations of the coherence matrix. The sequential approaches better retrieve the simulated phases compared to the non-sequential approaches for all temporal coherence models. Phase linking methods retrieve the simulated phase with residuals close to the Crame ' r-Rao lower bound for coherent seasons where the absolute values of coherence matrix are high and provide a tool for obtaining InSAR measurements over areas with seasonal snowfall. We furthermore show that unwrapping errors propagate differently depending on the unwrapping network. For single-reference networks there is no error propagation, but for sequential networks it compromises the accuracy of the final displacement time-series. Delaunay networks provide an optimum solution in terms of accuracy and precision if there are several years of data with frequent temporal decorrelation or strong seasonal decorrelation. We present applications using Sentinel-1 data in different natural and anthropogenic environments.

TI  - Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over time among pregnant women admitted to delivery units: Suitability for surveillance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over time and risk factors among pregnant women at delivery in Sao Paulo, Brazil; and to evaluate the suitability of pregnant women as a sentinel population for SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance. MethodsUnselected consecutive pregnant women presenting at the labor ward of a single large hospital between July 20(th) 2020 to February 21(st) 2021 were enrolled and tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology using two assays: the rapid chromatic Wondfo One Step (for total IgA and IgG detection) and Roche Elecsys assay (detecting anti-nucleoprotein [N] IgG). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was computed as smooth spline function over time with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Risk factors were evaluated for positivity by each assay. We compared timepoint seroprevalence by the two assays with four concomitant community household surveys (HHS), in which the Roche assay was used, to determine the sensitivity and relevance of the pregnant women population as sentinel population. ResultsOverall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 28.9% (221/763) by Roche and 17.9% (137/763) by Wondfo. Reported symptoms experienced during pregnancy were all significantly correlated with being SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at delivery with any assay (with odds-ratios ranging from 3.0 [95% CI: 2.1-4.3] for coryza to 22.8 [95% CI: 12.3-46.6] for ageusia). Seropositivity by either assay was high in women at delivery in the early period of the pandemic (June 2020), compared with seropositivity in women from the concomitant HHS: 44.1% (95% CI: 21.8-66.4) for Roche, 54.1% (30.9-78.5) for Wondfo, versus 11.4% (95% CI: 9.2-13.6) for HHS. For later periods (October 2020 and January 2021), the seropositivity in women at delivery measured by Roche corresponded well with the prevalence found among women in the HHS using the same assay, whilst prevalence measured by Wondfo dropped. ConclusionsWomen at delivery represent a highly exposed and readily accessible population for sentinel surveillance of emerging infections such as SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Self-harm emergency department visits in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from a sentinel surveillance system
T2  - INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Self-harm is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, though the prevalence tends to be highest among adolescents. As an indicator in suicide surveillance, the incidence of self-harm is useful because it is sensitive to social, environmental, and economic conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiology of self-harm has varied across contexts. This study aims to investigate the changes in self-harm emergency department visits in 2020 compared to a pre-pandemic period in 2018-2019.Methods Self-harm emergency department visits were extracted from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program database from 2018 to 2020. We compared the data in 2020 with the pre-pandemic baseline in 2018-2019. We examined the changes in volume, the percentages of self-harm cases among all intentional injuries by sex, age group, and the proportions of self-harm cases by method of injury. We also quantified the time trends of the percentages of self-harm cases among all intentional injuries using Joinpoint regression.Results The overall volume of emergency visits related to self-harm was higher in 2020 during weeks 24-51 compared to the average volumes for the same weeks of 2018-2019. Percentage of self-harm among all intentional injury emergency department visits was significantly higher by 6.1% among females (p < 0.05) and by 5.3% among males in 2020 than in 2018-2019 (p < 0.05). The 11-to-18-year age group showed an increase in the percentage of self-harm among all intentional injury emergency department visits by 7.4% in 2020 when compared to 2018-2019. Time trend analyses showed that the percentages of self-harm among all intentional injury emergency department visits were higher during weeks 4-52 in 2020 than in 2018-2019, for both males and females.Conclusions The percentage of emergency department visits related to self-harm among all intentional injury visits were higher during 2020 than in 2018-2019. These results underscore the importance of continued surveillance of self-harm in Canada to better understand the sociodemographic factors affecting self-harm and to inform the prevention strategies and policies.

TI  - Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is superior to satellite vegetation indices for predicting summer maize yield under drought conditions
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is one of the most important food crops in the world and its demand has increased dramatically in recent decades. Traditional vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI) reveal a significant lag in response to drought events, which may affect the accuracy of maize yield estimation, especially under drought conditions. Although solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is recognized to be more sensitive to water stress, the potential of SIF for maize yield prediction under drought conditions requires further investigation. To this end, this study takes a major corn production region (Hebei Province) in China as an example to predict maize yield under both normal and drought years. We have utilized three satellite data (SIF, NDVI, and EVI), meteorological data, and soil data from 2000 to 2019 to predict the summer maize yield at the county level, using a machine learning (ML) method (random forest, RF) and a deep learning (DL) method (long and short-term memory, LSTM). The results showed that the overall accuracy of the predicted yield reached 90% and that the ML method was slightly better than the DL method. In normal years, the three satellite data (SIF, NDVI, and EVI) can generally predict maize yield with comparable accuracy. Nonetheless, the performance using SIF (743.53 kg/ha) was better than EVI (791.88 kg/ha) and NDVI (814.48 kg/ha) in a recognized severe drought year (2002) over the study area, indicating that SIF has a certain superiority in predicting summer maize yield under drought conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of a marine mammal status and trends contaminants indicator for European waters
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine mammals are vulnerable to the bioaccumulation, biomagnification and lactational transfer of specific types of pollutants, such as industrial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), due to their long-life spans, feeding at a high trophic level and unique fat stores that can serve as depots for these lipophilic contaminants. Currently, European countries are developing indicators for monitoring pollutants in the marine environment and assessing the state of biodiversity, re-quirements under both Regional Seas Conventions and European legislation. As sentinel species for marine ecosystem and human health, marine mammals can be employed to assess bioaccumulated contaminants otherwise below cur-rent analytical detection limits in water and lower trophic level marine biota. To aid the development of Regional Seas marine mammal contaminants indicators, as well as Member States obligations under descriptor 8 of the EU Ma-rine Strategy Framework Directive, the current study aims to further develop appropriate methodological standards using data collected by the established UK marine mammal pollutant monitoring programme (1990 to 2017) to assess the trends and status of PCBs in harbour porpoises. Within this case study, temporal trends of PCB blubber concentra-tion in juvenile harbour porpoises were analysed using multiple linear regression models and toxicity thresholds for the onset of physiological (reproductive and immunological) endpoints were applied to all sex-maturity groups. Mean PCB blubber concentrations were observed to decline in all harbour porpoise Assessment Units and OSPAR Assessment Areas in UK waters. However, a high proportion of animals were exposed to concentrations deemed to be a toxicological threat, though the relative proportion declined in most Assessment Units/Areas over the last 10 years of the assessment. Recommendations were made for improving the quality of the assessment going forward, including detailing monitoring requirements for the successful implementation of such an indicator.

TI  - Inflammatory brain lesions preceding primary central nervous system lymphoma: a case report and genetic analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive extranodal lymphoma exclusively occurring within the central nervous system. Inflammatory brain lesions as "sentinel lesions " of PCNSL are very rare. We present a rare case of PCNSL with preceding inflammatory lesions in an immunocompetent patient who underwent two biopsies, one craniotomy and two genetic testing. Case report A 66-year-old male patient presented with left limb weakness and ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast-enhancing lesion with perifocal brain edema in the near midline of right frontal lobe. Histological examination of a brain biopsy specimen revealed inflammatory lesion characteristics with infiltration of T-cell dominant lymphocytes and few B-cell. Given that the patient developed cerebral hematoma after biopsy, lesion resection by craniotomy was performed. An excised sample demonstrated mixed T-cell and B-cell infiltrating inflammatory lesions. Four months after total resection of the right frontal lobe lesion, another lesion appeared in the left frontal parietal lobe, which was diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by biopsy. In addition, genetic testing of the lesions at two different locations was performed, and the results showed that the inflammatory lesions had the same three gene (RELN, PCLO, and CREBBP) mutations as PCNSL. Interestingly, the three mutated genes are associated with tumor. Conclusion Our present case is the first to demonstrate inflammatory brain lesions heralding PCNSL from genetic and pathological perspectives. This may help clinicians to select new auxiliary diagnostic methods for timely diagnosis of patients with suspected PCNSL.

TI  - Analysis of vertical distribution differences of global stratospheric ozone based on weighted multiplication algebraic algorithm br
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change and the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole have prompted people to payattention to the changes in atmospheric ozone content. The global continuous observation of ozone is achievedby retrieving the global total column concentration from nadir satellite data. In this work, the weightedmultiplication algebraic algorithm is combined with the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN, by using the 2011Chappuis-Wulf band SCIAMACHY limb radiation data to retrieve the stratospheric ozone profile between15- and 40 km altitude, solving the ozone global stratified observation problems. In the ozone globalstratification map, the whole process of the global transmission of ozone formed in low latitude regions to highlatitude regions is observed, which is directly related to the Brewer-Dobson circulation. During the most severeperiod of the Antarctic ozone hole from September to October, the Antarctic polar vortex has an obvioushindering effect on ozone transmission, and the polar vortex has a "transparent wall" effect. On the one hand, itis difficult to transfer ozone from the equatorial region to the Antarctic region for replenishment. On the otherhand, the retention of ozone-depleting substances over the Antarctic region leads to the acceleration of ozonedepletion, and the combination of low replenishment and high depletion contributes to the Antarctic ozone hole.Compared with the global total column concentration of ozone, the observation of global ozone stratification isvery valuable for scientific research and will promote the detailed study of the whole process of ozone formation, transmission, and consumption

TI  - Multi-source remote sensing data shows a significant increase in vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau since 2000
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been growing concern that vegetation changes on the Tibetan Plateau are associated with climate change (temperature and precipitation) and human activities. This study used six types of remote sensing vegetation data, including GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI, MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), SPOT Vegetation (Spot-VGT) NDVI, LAI (Leaf Area Index) and NPP (Net Primary Productivity), and applied the maximum synthesis method, trend analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistical analysis to investigate vegetation change processes since the 1980s. The study showed that the amount of vegetation on the TP had increased significantly since 2000 (p < .01), especially in the northeastern part of the TP. There was no significant change prior to 2000. The different vegetation data sources varied greatly. Four remote sensing indices, MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP, showed a significant increase in vegetation from 2000, accounting for 16.18%, 44.55%, 30.44% and 8.94% of the total area, respectively (p < .05). Multiple data sources provided a more comprehensive understanding, whereas a single data source had substantial uncertainty. Human activities, such as the implementation of large-scale ecological projects, played a dominant role in increasing vegetation, while climate change played a subsidiary role. The MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP data showed that the area of increased vegetation caused by human activities accounted for 53.51%, 45.68%, 37.52%, and 31.79% of the total area of the TP, respectively. The relative increase from climate change was 10.28%, 17.49%, 13.15%, and 8.82%, respectively. The current study applied multi-source remotely sensed vegetation data, which effectively reduced the uncertainty caused by individual data sources and provided more rigorous and scientific research conclusions.

TI  - Fault slip of the 2022 Mw6.7 Menyuan, China earthquake observed by InSAR, and its tectonic implications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article the ascending and descending Sentinel-1A satellite data are used to investigate the coseismic slip model of the 2022 Mw6.7 Menyuan earthquake in Qinghai, China. The optimal slip model indicates that this event ruptured two fault segments. The main rupture concentrated on the western Lenglongling fault (LLLF) with a purely left-lateral striking-slip motion. A small part of the eastern Tuolaishan fault (TLSF) section was also ruptured, and the motion on it is mainly oblique slip at depth, with an obvious thrust component. Combined with the rupture characteristics of historical events, GPS velocity map, and slip rate studies, we suggest that the TLSF-LLLF junction is a demarcation point where the deformation partitioning pattern has changed. Along the whole LLLF segment, the oblique convergence has completely partitioned into slip on the purely strike-slipping LLLF and thrusting faults in the north. The TLSF segment accommodates a fraction of compressional shortening, which compensates for the discrepancy in the left-lateral slip rate between the LLLF and TLSF. Such transformation in the strain partitioning pattern is likely to be determined by the geometric relationship between the fault strike and the direction of regional block movement.

TI  - Panchromatic and multispectral image fusion for remote sensing and earth observation: Concepts, taxonomy, literature review, evaluation methodologies and challenges ahead
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Hardware Review
AB  - Panchromatic and multispectral image fusion, termed pan-sharpening, is to merge the spatial and spectral information of the source images into a fused one, which has a higher spatial and spectral resolution and is more reliable for downstream tasks compared with any of the source images. It has been widely applied to image interpretation and pre-processing of various applications. A large number of methods have been proposed to achieve better fusion results by considering the spatial and spectral relationships among panchromatic and multispectral images. In recent years, the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) has significantly enhanced the development of pan-sharpening techniques. However, this field lacks a comprehensive overview of recent advances boosted by the rise of AI and DL. This paper provides a comprehensive review of a variety of pan-sharpening methods that adopt four different paradigms, i.e., component substitution, multiresolution analysis, degradation model, and deep neural networks. As an important aspect of pan-sharpening, the evaluation of the fused image is also outlined to present various assessment methods in terms of reduced-resolution and full-resolution quality measurement. Then, we conclude this paper by discussing the existing limitations, difficulties, and challenges of pan-sharpening techniques, datasets, and quality assessment. In addition, the survey summarizes the development trends in these areas, which provide useful methodological practices for researchers and professionals. Finally, the developments in pan-sharpening are summarized in the conclusion part. The aim of the survey is to serve as a referential starting point for newcomers and a common point of agreement around the research directions to be followed in this exciting area.

TI  - The effect of relative humidity on eddy covariance latent heat flux measurements and its implication for partitioning into transpiration and evaporation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the eddy covariance (EC) technique is a well-established method for measuring water fluxes (i.e., evap-oration or 'evapotranspiration', ET), the measurement is susceptible to many uncertainties. One such issue is the potential underestimation of ET when relative humidity (RH) is high (>70%), due to low-pass filtering with some EC systems. Yet, this underestimation for different types of EC systems (e.g. open-path or closed-path sensors) has not been characterized for synthesis datasets such as the widely used FLUXNET2015 dataset. Here, we assess the RH-associated underestimation of latent heat fluxes (LE, or ET) from different EC systems for 163 sites in the FLUXNET2015 dataset. We found that the LE underestimation is most apparent during hours when RH is higher than 70%, predominantly observed at sites using closed-path EC systems, but the extent of the LE underesti-mation is highly site-specific. We then propose a machine learning based method to correct for this underesti-mation, and compare it to two energy balance closure based LE correction approaches (Bowen ratio correction, BRC, and attributing all errors to LE). Our correction increases LE by 189% for closed-path sites at high RH (>90%), while BRC increases LE by around 30% for all RH conditions. Additionally, we assess the influence of these corrections on ET-based transpiration (T) estimates using two different ET partitioning methods. Results show opposite responses (increasing vs. slightly decreasing T-to-ET ratios, T/ET) between the two methods when comparing T based on corrected and uncorrected LE. Overall, our results demonstrate the existence of a high RH bias in water fluxes in the FLUXNET2015 dataset and suggest that this bias is a pronounced source of uncertainty in ET measurements to be considered when estimating ecosystem T/ET and WUE.

TI  - Consistency of six<i> in</i><i> situ,</i><i> in</i><i> vitro</i> and satellite-based methods to derive chlorophyll a in two optically different lakes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton and its most common pigment chlorophyll a (Chl-a) are important parameters in characterizing lake ecosystems. We compared six methods to measure the concentration of Chl a (CChl-a) in two optically different lakes: stratified clear-water Lake Saadjarv and non-stratified turbid Lake Vortsjarv. CChl-a was estimated from: in vitro (spectrophotometric, high-performance liquid chromatography); fluorescence (in situ automated high-frequency measurement (AHFM) buoys) and spectral (in situ high-frequency hyperspectral above-water radiometer (WISPStation), satellites Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI) measurements. The agreement between methods ranged from weak (R-2 = 0.26) to strong (R-2 = 0.93). The consistency was better in turbid lake compared to the clear-water lake where the vertical and short-term temporal variability of the CChl-a was larger. The agreement between the methods depends on multiple factors, e.g., the environmental and in-water conditions, placement of sensors, sensitivity of algorithms. Also in case of some methods, seasonal bias can be detected in both lakes due to signal strength and background turbidity. The inherent differences of the methods should be studied before the synergistic use of data which will clearly increase the spatial (via satellites), temporal (AHFM buoy, WISPStation and satellites) and vertical (profiling AHFM buoy) coverage of data necessary to advance the research on phytoplankton dynamics in lakes.

TI  - GIS and remotely sensed data-based morphometric elements analysis for determination of Bengal Basin evolution
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the current study, hypsometric integral (HI) using polynomial fitting, morphometric parameters (MP) and tectonic elements (TE) like iso-base map, stream length-gradient index, hydraulic gradient and sinuosity index were determined to understand the basin evolution. For this analysis, the study area was divided into four sections; (1) Area 1 (34,492 km(2)) covering the stable platform (2) Area 2 (48,137 km(2)) covering basin part (3) Area 3 (37,301 km(2)) also covering basin part (4) Area 4 (18,219 km(2)) covering the hilly area. Arc hydro tool and CalHypso extension were used with the ArcGIS for HI calculations. Streams of eighth order for Area 1 and Area 4, tenth order for Area 2, ninth order for Area 3 were identified from 30 m x 30 m shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM). Sixth-order watershed for the four regions were used for HI calculation. Principal component analysis was carried out on the morphometric parameters, but there is no significant correlation among MP; although few parameters show strong, moderate and good correlation. To achieve HI values, watersheds were selected randomly- 25 nos. out of 59, 64 nos. out of 118, 36 nos. out of 74 and 22 nos. out of 31 for the four areas, respectively. Area 1 possesses 92% mature and 8% young watersheds, Areas 2 and 4 possess 43% and 55% old, 54% and 40% mature, and 3% and 5% young watersheds, respectively. But Area 3 possesses 25% old and 75% mature watersheds. Based on HI, MP and TE it can be concluded that the study area is almost stable and passing through a quite state and no tectonic activity exists in this area. This information would facilitate to the planner, engineer and decision taker to develop this zone for infrastructure development regarding the venture.

TI  - Quantification and modelling of post-seismic deformation following the 2013 September 24 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.7 earthquake in the Makran region, Pakistan
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 2013 September 24, an earthquake of magnitude M-w 7.7 occurred on the Hoshab Fault in southern Pakistan, south of the 650-km-long Chaman Fault, within the eastern Makran accretionary wedge. This earthquake was caused predominantly by strike-slip faulting. To quantify the post-seismic deformation following this large earthquake, we used ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data over the period 2014 November-2017 December. The deformation time-series over these 3 years shows that the post-seismic deformation was not linear over the time. To determine the mechanisms that may have driven post-seismic deformation, such as after-slip or a combination of after-slip and viscous relaxation, we explored some models, including after-slip only, and a combination of after-slip and viscous relaxation, to identify the best fit between the observed and simulated deformation time-series. Our results indicate that after-slip was the main mechanism controlling the post-seismic deformation. The introduction of a basal flat fault in the modelling improves the fit between the model results and the time-series obtained from the satellite images This basal fault is located at a depth of 18 km, has a northward dip of 7 degrees and corresponds to the basal decollement level of the Makran accretionary prism.

TI  - CACPU-Net: Channel attention U-net constrained by point features for crop type mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping is an indispensable topic in the agricultural field and plays an important role in agricultural intelligence. In crop type mapping, most studies focus on time series models. However, in our experimental area, the images of the crop harvest stage can be obtained from single temporal remote sensing images. Only using single temporal data for crop type mapping can reduce the difficulty of dataset production. In addition, the model of single temporal crop type mapping can also extract the spatial features of crops more effectively. In this work, we linked crop type mapping with 2D semantic segmentation and designed CACPU-Net based on single-source and single-temporal autumn Sentinel-2 satellite images. First, we used a shallow convolutional neural network, U-Net, and introduced channel attention mechanism to improve the model's ability to extract spectral features. Second, we presented the Dice to compute loss together with cross-entropy to mitigate the effects of crop class imbalance. In addition, we designed the CP module to additionally focus on hard-to-classify pixels. Our experiment was conducted on BeiDaHuang YouYi of Heilongjiang Province, which mainly grows rice, corn, soybean, and other economic crops. On the dataset we collected, through the 10-fold cross-validation experiment under the 8:1:1 dataset splitting scheme, our method achieved 93.74% overall accuracy, higher than state-of-the-art models. Compared with the previous model, our improved model has higher classification accuracy on the parcel boundary. This study provides an effective end-to-end method and a new research idea for crop type mapping. The code and the trained model are available on https://github.com/mooneed/CACPU-Net.

TI  - Mapping intertidal macrophytes in fjords in Southwest Greenland using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the distribution of coastal macrophytes in Greenland, and elsewhere in the Arctic are difficult to quantify as the region remains challenging to access and monitor. Satellite imagery, in particular Sentinel-2 (S2), may enable large-scale monitoring of coastal areas in Greenland but its use is impacted by the optically complex environments and the scarcity of supporting data in the region. Additionally, the canopies of the dominant macrophyte species in Greenland do not extend to the sea surface, limiting the use of indices that exploit the reflection of near-infrared radi-ation by vegetation due to its absorption by seawater. Three hypotheses are tested: I) 10-m S2 imagery and commonly used detection methods can identify intertidal macrophytes that are exposed at low tide in an optically complex fjord system in Greenland impacted by marine and land terminating glaciers; II) detached and floating macrophytes accu-mulate in patches that are sufficiently large to be detected by 10-m S2 images; III) iceberg scour and/or turbid melt-water runoff shape the spatial distribution of intertidal macroalgae in fjord systems with marine-terminating glaciers. The NDVI produced the best results in optically complex fjord systems in Greenland. 12 km2 of exposed intertidal macrophytes were identified in the study area at low tide. Floating mats of macrophytes ranged in area from 400 m2 to 326,800 m2 and were most common at the mouth of the fjord. Icebergs and turbidity appear to play a role in structuring the distribution of intertidal macrophytes and the retreat of marine terminating glaciers could allow macrophytes cover to expand. The challenges and solutions presented here apply to most fjords in Greenland and, therefore, the methodology may be extended to produce a Greenland-wide estimate of intertidal macrophytes.

TI  - Climatology and landscape determinants of AOD, SO2 and NO2 over Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) experiences high loading of particulate and gaseous pollutants all year around and is considered to be the most polluted regions of India. Understanding the effect of landscape determinants on air pollution in IGP regions is crucial to make its environment sustainable. We examined satellite retrievals of OMI NO2 and SO2, and MODIS AOD to analyse the long-term trend, spatio-seasonal pattern and dynamics of aerosols, NO2 and SO2 over three IGP regions, namely Upper Indo-Gangetic plain (UIGP), Middle Indo-Gangetic plain (MIGP) and Lower Indo-Gangetic plain (LIGP) over the period 2005-2019. IGP experienced an overall increment in AOD (R2 = 0.63) and SO2 (R2 = 0.67) values, with LIGP (AOD, R2 = 0.8 & SO2, R2 = 0.8) experiencing the largest rate of enhancement. The levels of NO2 (R2 = 0.2) experienced a decrement after 2012 (owing to implementation of vehicle emission policy) except in MIGP, with UIGP (R2 = 0.23) exhibiting the largest rate of decrement. Seasonal heterogeneity in the nature of sources was observed over IGP regions. AOD (0.61 +/- 0.1) and NO2 value (3.82 +/- 0.98 x 1015 molecules/cm2) were found highest during post-monsoon in UIGP owing to crop residue burning activity. The value of NO2 (3.8 +/- 1.4 x 1015 molecules/cm2) in MIGP was found highest during pre-monsoon due to high consumption of coal in power plants for summer cooling demand. The highest SO2 level (0.09 +/- 0.06 DU) was observed during post-monsoon in UIGP, as a large number of brick kilns are fired during this period. Correlations among landscape determinants and pollutants revealed that topography is the dominant variable that affect the spatial pattern of AOD compared to vegetation and land use. Lower elevation tends to have high AOD values compared to higher elevation. Vegetation-AOD relationship showed an inverse association in IGP regions and is influenced by factors such as seasonal meteorology and size of the airborne particles. Vegetation possesses positive relationship with SO2 and NO2, implying no pollution abatement effect on SO2 and NO2 pollutants. Built-up change has deteriorating effect as well as quenching effect on pollutants. Increase in built terrain have deteriorated the air quality in UIGP whereas it favored in suppressing the aerosol level in LIGP.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the difficulties of flood plain quality assessment, red-edge spectral remote sensing data acquired from the Jilin-01 satellite were used. The Grassland Quality Index (GQI) was formed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) related to the determination of grassland quality and the first principal component of the red-edge Chlorophyll Index obtained by principal component analysis. The GQI was applied to evaluate grassland quality in the flooded plain, which is an important grassland ecological-barrier area in the western area of Jilin Province, and was then verified using field measurement data. Results show that 1) 80% of grasslands in Xianghai Nature Reserve are of a medium quality, and the grasslands with good growth status account for approximately 15% and are mainly concentrated in the wetland and swamp areas in the central south part of the reserve and that 2) the correlation of the evaluation results was verified using the survey field biomass, and the coefficient of the empirical correlation model is 0.96, which indicates good consistency. This study is of practical significance for the timely and accurate monitoring of grassland growth, which is beneficial for the development of livestock husbandry and the protection of the ecological environment in northern China.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land cover dynamics were analyzed temporally and spatially in the Al-Hubail wetland (Al-Ahsa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) to determine the evolution of the environmental status of this biologically and ecologically interesting area in Saudi Arabia. Using remote sensing data, land cover changes were estimated for 36 years (1985-2021). For this analysis, three images from 1985 (Landsat 5 MSS), 2003 (Landsat 7 ETM +), and 2021 (Sentinel-2) were used to classify and detect changes. A machine learning algorithm was used, and the images were classified into four main land cover classes: Water bodies, hydromorphic areas, vegetation, and open ground. Change detection was performed for the year pairs 1985 to 2003 and 2003 to 2021. The results of this classification showed a significant increase in the area of hydromorphic areas and vegetation. The results were checked with a confusion matrix indicating an overall accuracy between 89.3 and 92.8%. The qualitative trend data show that the Al-Hubail wetland has changed significantly during the study period. Thus, a significant expansion of the wetland was observed in conjunction with an increase in agricultural drainage toward the wetland. This analysis shows the strong anthropogenic pressure on the area and highlights the need to strengthen the existing laws to preserve local biodiversity in the long term. It suggests that more efforts should be made to manage the water resources of the region effectively.

TI  - Integrating random forest and crop modeling improves the crop yield prediction of winter wheat and oil seed rape
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast and accurate yield estimates with the increasing availability and variety of global satellite products and the rapid development of new algorithms remain a goal for precision agriculture and food security. However, the consistency and reliability of suitable methodologies that provide accurate crop yield outcomes still need to be explored. The study investigates the coupling of crop modeling and machine learning (ML) to improve the yield prediction of winter wheat (WW) and oil seed rape (OSR) and provides examples for the Free State of Bavaria (70,550 km2), Germany, in 2019. The main objectives are to find whether a coupling approach [Light Use Efficiency (LUE) + Random Forest (RF)] would result in better and more accurate yield predictions compared to results provided with other models not using the LUE. Four different RF models [RF1 (input: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), RF2 (input: climate variables), RF3 (input: NDVI + climate variables), RF4 (input: LUE generated biomass + climate variables)], and one semi-empiric LUE model were designed with different input requirements to find the best predictors of crop monitoring. The results indicate that the individual use of the NDVI (in RF1) and the climate variables (in RF2) could not be the most accurate, reliable, and precise solution for crop monitoring; however, their combined use (in RF3) resulted in higher accuracies. Notably, the study suggested the coupling of the LUE model variables to the RF4 model can reduce the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) from -8% (WW) and -1.6% (OSR) and increase the R2 by 14.3% (for both WW and OSR), compared to results just relying on LUE. Moreover, the research compares models yield outputs by inputting three different spatial inputs: Sentinel-2(S)-MOD13Q1 (10 m), Landsat (L)-MOD13Q1 (30 m), and MOD13Q1 (MODIS) (250 m). The S-MOD13Q1 data has relatively improved the performance of models with higher mean R2 [0.80 (WW), 0.69 (OSR)], and lower RRMSE (%) (9.18, 10.21) compared to L-MOD13Q1 (30 m) and MOD13Q1 (250 m). Satellite-based crop biomass, solar radiation, and temperature are found to be the most influential variables in the yield prediction of both crops.

TI  - Version 2 of the global catalogue of large anthropogenic and volcanic SO2 sources and emissions derived from satellite measurements
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite spectrometers were used to update and extend the previously developed global catalogue of large SO2 emission sources. This version 2 of the global catalogue covers the period of 2005-2021 and includes a total of 759 continuously emitting point sources releasing from about 10 ktyr(-1) to more than 4000 ktyr-1 of SO2, that have been identified and grouped by country and primary source origin: volcanoes (106 sources); power plants (477); smelters (74); and sources related to the oil and gas industry (102). There are several major improvements compared to the original catalogue: it combines emissions estimates from three satellite instruments instead of just OMI, uses a new version 2 of the OMI and OMPS SO2 dataset, and updated consistent site-specific air mass factors (AMFs) are used to calculate SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs). The newest TROPOMI SO2 data processed with the Covariance-Based Retrieval Algorithm (COBRA), used in the catalogue, can detect sources with emissions as low as 8 ktyr(-1) (in 2018-2021) compared to the 30 ktyr(-1) limit for OMI. In general, there is an overall agreement within +/- 12 % in total emissions estimated from the three satellite instruments for large regions. For individual emission sources, the spread is larger: the annual emissions estimated from OMI and TROPOMI agree within +/- 13 % in 50 % of cases and within +/- 28 % in 90 % of cases. The version 2 catalogue emissions were calculated as a weighted average of emission estimates from the three satellite instruments using an inverse-variance weighting method. OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI data contribute 7 %, 5 %, and 88 % to the average, respectively, for small (< 30 ktyr(-1)) sources and 33 %, 20 %, and 47 %, respectively, for large (> 300 ktyr(-1)) sources. The catalogue data show an approximate 50 % decline in global SO2 emissions between 2005 and 2021, although emissions were relatively stable during the last 3 years. The version 2 of the global catalogue has been posted at the NASA global SO2 monitoring website (, Fioletov et al., 2022).

TI  - Amazon forest spectral seasonality is consistent across sensor resolutions and driven by leaf demography
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Controversy surrounds the reported dry season greening of the Central Amazon forests based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). As the solar zenith angle decreases during the dry season, it affects the sub-pixel shade content and artificially increases Near -infrared (NIR) reflectance and EVI. MODIS' coarse resolution also creates a challenge for cloud and terrain filtering. To reduce these artifacts and then validate MODIS seasonal spectral patterns we use 16 years of 1 km resolution MODIS-MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) images, corrected to a nadir view and 45 degrees solar zenith angle, together with an improved cloud filter. Then we show that the 30 m Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance over two Landsat scenes provides independent evidence supporting the MODIS-MAIAC seasonality for EVI, NIR, and GCC (an additional important vegetation index, green chromatic coordinate). Our empirical method for controlling for sun-sensor geometry effects in Landsat scenes encompasses the use of seasonally distinct images that have similar solar zenith angles and cloud-free pixels on flat uplands having the same phase angle. We extended this validation to nine Amazon sub-basins comprising similar to 546 Landsat-8 images. Our study shows that the dry-season green-up pattern observed by MODIS is corroborated by Landsat-8, and is independent of satellite data artifacts. To investigate the mechanisms driving these seasonal changes we further used Central Amazon tower-mounted RGB cameras providing a 4-year record at the Amazon Tall Tower (ATTO, 2 degrees 8 ' 36 '' S, 59 degrees 0 ' 2 '' W) and a 7-year record at the Manaus k34 tower (2 degrees 36 ' 33 '' S, 60 degrees 12 ' 33 '' W) to obtain monthly upper canopy green leaf cover (a proxy for Leaf Area Index -LAI) and monthly leaf age class abundances (based on the age since leaf flushing, by crown). These were compared to seasonal patterns of GCC and EVI in small MODIS-MAIAC windows centered on each tower. MODIS-MAIAC GCC was positively correlated with newly flushed leaves (R-2 = 0.76 and 0.44 at ATTO and k34, respectively). EVI correlated strongly with the abundance of mature leaves (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.80) but was poorly correlated with LAI (R-2 = 0.20 and 0.41, respectively). Therefore, seasonal spectral patterns in the Central Amazon are likely controlled by leaf age variation, not quantity of leaf area.

TI  - Assessing GEDI-NASA system for forest fuels classification using machine learning techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of forest fuels is a key step for forest fire prevention since they provide valuable information of fire behavior. This study assesses NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system to classify fuel types in Mediterranean environments according to the Prometheus model in a forested area of NE Spain. We used 59,554 GEDI footprints and extracted variables related to height metrics, canopy profile metrics, and aboveground biomass density estimates from products L2A, L2B, and L4A, respectively. Four quality filters were applied to discard high uncertainty data, reducing the initial footprints to 9,703. Spectral indices from Landsat-8 OLI scenes were created to test the effect of their integration with GEDI variables on fuel types estimation. Ground-truth data were comprised of Prometheus fuel types estimated in two previous studies. Only the types that matched in each GEDI footprint in both studies were used, resulting in a final sample of 1,112 footprints. Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests determined the variables to be included in the classification models: the relative height at the 85th percentile, the Plant Area Index, and the Aboveground Biomass Density from GEDI, and the brightness from Landsat-8 OLI. Best performances were achieved with Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with radial kernel (SVM-R), which were lower including only GEDI variables (accuracies: RF and SVM-R = 61.54 %) than integrating the brightness from Landsat-8 OLI (accuracies: RF = 83.71 %, SVM-R = 81.90 %). These results allow validating GEDI for fuel type classification of Prometheus model, constituting a promising information for forest management over large areas.

TI  - The Myth of Social Mobility: Subjective Social Mobility and Mental Health
T2  - COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - A common assumption is that upward mobility produces positive psychological outcomes. However, status-based identity framework and social class worldview model propose that perceived social mobility in either direction will lead to increased distress. Based on this claim, we examined relations among subjective social mobility, life satisfaction, and mental health using polynomial regression with response surface mapping. In Study 1, groups that experienced both subjective downward and upward mobility reported more depressive symptomatology than groups that remained in middle or upper social statuses in a sample of 567 adults. We did not find significant relations between subjective social mobility and life satisfaction. In Study 2, both groups that experienced subjective downward and upward mobility reported more depressive and academic distress symptomatology than groups that remained in middle or upper social social statuses in a sample of 7,598 clients from college counseling center data. The results provide insights relevant to multicultural counseling and training.

TI  - Preclinical Identification Of Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes Using a Multimodal Non-invasive <i>In vivo</i> Imaging Approach
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose Resection of the tumor-draining lymph-node (TDLN) represents a standard method to identify metastasis for several malignancies. Interestingly, recent preclinical studies indicate that TDLN resection diminishes the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based cancer immunotherapies. Thus, accurate preclinical identification of TDLNs is pivotal to uncovering the underlying immunological mechanisms. Therefore, we validated preclinically, and clinically available non-invasive in vivo imaging approaches for precise TDLN identification.Procedures For visualization of the lymphatic drainage into the TDLNs by non-invasive in vivo optical imaging, we injected the optical imaging contrast agents Patent Blue V (582.7 g mol-1) and IRDye (R) 800CW polyethylene glycol (PEG; 25,000- 60,000 g mol-1), subcutaneously (s.c.) in close proximity to MC38 adenocarcinomas at the right flank of experimental mice. For determination of the lymphatic drainage and the glucose metabolism in TDLNs by non-invasive in vivo PET/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), we injected the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glu-cose (18F-FDG) [181.1 g mol(-1)]) in a similar manner. For ex vivo cross-correlation, we isolated TDLNs and contralateral nontumor-draining lymph nodes (NTDLNs) and performed optical imaging, biodistribution, and autoradiography analysis.Results The clinically well-established Patent Blue V was superior for intraoperative macroscopic identification of the TDLNs compared with IRDye (R) 800CW PEG but was not sensitive enough for non-invasive in vivo detection by optical imaging. Ex vivo Patent Blue V biodistribution analysis clearly identified the right accessory axillary and the proper axillary lymph node (LN) as TDLNs, whereas ex vivo IRDye (R) 800CW PEG completely failed. In contrast, functional non-invasive in vivo 18F-FDG PET/MRI identified a significantly elevated uptake exclusively within the ipsilateral accessory axillary TDLN of experimental mice and was able to differentiate between the accessory axillary and the proper LN. Ex vivo biodistribution and autoradiography confirmed our in vivo 18F-FDG PET/MRI results.Conclusions When taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of 18F-FDG-PET/MRI as a valid method for noninvasive in vivo, intraoperative, and ex vivo identification of the lymphatic drainage and glucose metabolism within the TDLNs. In addition, using Patent Blue V provides additive value for the macroscopic localization of the lymphatic drainage both visually and by ex vivo optical imaging analysis. Thus, both methods are valuable, easy to implement, and cost-effective for preclinical identification of the TDLN.

TI  - Novel algorithms for pair and pixel selection and atmospheric error correction in multitemporal InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Entering the SAR's golden era began with the launch of Sentinel-1A/B satellites in 2014 and 2016 with 6-12 day revisit time, much larger stacks of high-resolution SAR images are available over a given area to perform time series analysis. Algorithms that deal with large stack sizes face several challenges, including interferometric phase quality degradation due to signal decorrelations, phase closure error caused by applied multilooking, and tropospheric phase delay. Here, we present an improved SBAS-type algorithm suitable for processing a large stack of SAR images at an arbitrary resolution. We develop a new pair selection strategy that applies dyadic downsampling combined with widely used Delaunay Triangulation to identify an optimal set of interferometric pairs that minimize systematic errors due to short-lived signals and closure errors. We develop and apply a novel statistical framework that selects elite pixels accounting for distributed and permanent scatterers. Also, we implement a new tropospheric error correction that takes advantage of smooth 2D splines to identify and remove error components with fractal-like structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms by applying them to 3 large datasets of Sentinel-1 SAR images measuring non-linear surface deformation over various terrains. Compared with independent GNSS observations, we find that over the rural/natural terrains adjacent to San Andreas fault in southern California, our approach yields a standard deviation of 0.48 cm for time series differences in both ascending and descending tracks. While in urban areas, such as Los Angeles, standard deviation difference with GNSS time series is 0.30 cm.

TI  - A competition-species model for water vapour-aerosol-cloud-rain interactions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a non-linear bulk model inspired from species competition dynamics is proposed in order to describe the physics of water vapour-aerosol-cloud-rain interactions. Despite the complexity of such interactions, certain non-trivial aspects of the macro behavior of a cloud are predictable without concerning the full complexity of the dynamical system. The model is for warm clouds (no ice) and it consists in a set of three non-linear differential equations. This species-competition model is confronted with in situ measurements in different situations: for pristine environments (1) at the high-altitude Maido Observatory (Indian Ocean, Reunion Island) and (2) in a pure oceanic context around the Reunion Island (AEROMARINE field campaign) and for a continental urban context (3) in Lille (North of France). Compared with observations (radar, radiometric measurements), it is shown that, whatever the situation considered, the model reproduces efficiently the macro features of clouds, like cloud occurrences, cloud water content magnitudes, and cloud-rain links. The model is adapted to a two-dimensional (horizontal) grid and its predictions are compared with the ERA5 reanalyses above the Hauts-de-France region and in the pristine Southwest Indian Ocean (around Reunion Island). Furthermore, satellite data enable to corroborate that the model clearly shows promising results for the horizontal cloud field orga-nization. The spatiotemporal resolution of this model is adaptable according to the needs and it can be used in any region and at the desired altitude provided that data be available for implementation. In this paper, it is also suggested that the model may be fruitful to derive from measurements, by means of an optimization scheme, different theoretical parameters not easy to determine. The model runs on a laptop with a relatively short time (of the order of the minute); it is not intended to supplant comprehensive models, but it may be fruitful to understand the essential mechanisms in warm cloud formation.

TI  - Suitability of band angle indices for burned area mapping in the Maule Region (Chile)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In January 2017, 114 active fires burned throughout Chile at the same time. These fires spread quickly due to high temperatures, fast dry winds, and low vegetation water content. The fire events burned more than 570,000 ha, from which 20% of the area was endangered native forest. Timely and accurate burned area mapping is crucial for the evaluation of damages and management of the affected areas. As Chile is a diverse country with many types of ecosystems and vegetation, the use of novel spectral indices may improve the accuracy of satellite data-based burned area mapping algorithms. In this study, we explored the contribution of band angle indices (BAnI) to burned area mapping. The BAnI are based on trigonometric equations that proved to be sensitive to moisture conditions. Then, we aimed to test their sensitivity to the burned area spectral signature. We used Sentinel-2 data at 20 m resolution to calibrate and implement a random forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) computing platform. We ran the RF classifier with and without BAnI to evaluate their potential to identify burned areas and performed two accuracy assessments comparing the results with visually digitized fire perimeters from (1) WorldView 3 (WV3) images, and (2) Sentinel at 10 m resolution. We determined that both BA classifications were more accurate than the perimeters created by the Chilean National Forest Corporation (CONAF), which overestimates the area burnt. The overestimation of CONAF perimeters is produced by considering as burned the inner unburned areas and omitting some small, burned areas. The first assessment showed no significant differences between the two RF classifications. However, the second validation showed lower omission and commission errors for the RF classifier with the BAnI (5 and 17.8%, respectively). On the other hand, comparing both BA classifications with and without BAnI, we observed differences in the spatial distribution of the errors. However, the RF classification with BAnI offered fewer commission errors located in agricultural areas. The burned area algorithms developed in GEE showed their potential to map the fire-affected area quickly, efficiently, and accurately, accounting for all the areas burned in the season, including the small and agricultural fires the official perimeters did not consider.

TI  - A new method for classifying maize by combining the phenological information of multiple satellite-based spectral bands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Using satellite data to identify the planting area of summer crops is difficult because of their similar phenological characteristics.Methods: This study developed a new method for differentiating maize from other summer crops based on the revised time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method, a phenology-based classification method, by combining the phenological information of multiple spectral bands and indexes instead of one single index. First, we compared the phenological characteristics of four main summer crops in Henan Province of China in terms of multiple spectral bands and indexes. The key phenological periods of each band and index were determined by comparing the identification accuracy based on the county-level statistical areas of maize. Second, we improved the TWDTW distance calculation for multiple bands and indexes by summing the rank maps of a single band or index. Third, we evaluated the performance of a multi-band and multi-period TWDTW method using Sentinel-2 time series of all spectral bands and some synthetic indexes for maize classification in Henan Province.Results and Discussion: The results showed that the combination of red edge (740.2 nm) and short-wave infrared (2202.4 nm) outperformed all others and its overall accuracy of maize planting area was about 91.77% based on 2431 field samples. At the county level, the planting area of maize matched the statistical area closely. The results of this study demonstrate that the revised TWDTW makes effective use of crop phenological information and improves the extraction accuracy of summer crops' planting areas over a large scale. Additionally, multiple band combinations are more effective for summer crops mapping than a single band or index input.

TI  - Mesenteric location of lymph node metastasis for colorectal cancer
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe number of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a strong prognostic factor in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the impact of the mesentery location on LNM remains unclear. We assessed the impact LNM location on the recurrence of stage III CRC. MethodsSubjects with CRC and pathologically positive LNM were enrolled retrospectively. We defined three groups: LNM adjacent to the tumour (group A), metastases with horizontal or vertical spread (group B), and metastases with both horizontal and vertical spread (group C). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was the primary outcome measure used for the study. ResultsA total of 241 (Group A: 121, B: 90, and C: 30) patients were recruited for the study. Multivariate analysis by Cox regression model indicated LNM location to be an independent predisposing risk factor for recurrence [group B: Hazard ratio (HR) 2.01, 95% Confidential interval (CI) 1.12-3.60, P = 0.019; group C: HR 3.00, 95% CI 1.34-6.72, P = 0.008]. Addition of mesentery spread to the N classification was significant risk factor for recurrence (mN2a: HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.07-3.78, P = 0.029; mN2b: HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.12-7.40, P < 0.01). Comparison of Harrell's C-index values was conducted, and the modified N staging risk was 0.6377, whereas the TNM N stage classification was 0.5869. ConclusionMesentery location of LNM was a risk factor and consideration of it might be beneficial for accurate prediction of CRC prognosis.

TI  - Remote sensing of fluorescent humification levels and its potential environmental linkages in lakes across China
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The pollution or eutrophication affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and sources of inland waters had attracted concerns from the public and government in China. Combined with remote sensing techniques, the fluorescent DOM (FDOM) parameters accounted for the important part of optical constituent as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was a useful tool to trace relative DOM sources and assess the trophic states for large-scale regions comprehensively and timely. Here, the objective of this research is to calibrate and validate a general model based on Landsat 8 OLI product embedded in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for deriving humification index (HIX) based on EEMs in lakes across China. The Landsat surface reflectance was matched with 1150 pairs fieldtrip samples and the nine sensitive spectral variables with good correlation with HIX were selected as the inputs in machine learning methods. The calibration of XGBoost model (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.29) outperformed other models. Our results indicated that the entire dataset of HIX has a strong association with Landsat reflectance, yielding low root mean square error between measured and predicted HIX (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.42) for lakes in China. Finally, the optimal XGBoost model was used to calculate the spatial distribution of HIX of 2015 and 2020 in typical lakes selected from the Report on the State of the Ecology and Environment in China. The significant decreasing of HIX from 2015 to 2020 with trophic states showed positive control of humification level of lakes based on the published document of Action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 of China. The calibrated model would greatly facilitate FDOM monitoring in lakes, and provide indicators for relative DOM sources to evaluate the impact of water protection measures or human disturbance effect from Covid-19 lockdown, and offer the government su-pervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems.

TI  - Story shear distribution of high strength steel frame with D-eccentric braces based on multi-seismic-hazard levels
T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-strength steel frame with D-eccentric braces (D-HSS-EBF) refer to the link that uses Q355 steel (The yield strength fy <= 355 MPa), while the non-energy element, such as column and beam, uses the high-strength steel Q460 or Q690 (fy = 460 MPa or 690 MPa), which is a new seismic resistant structure. The links developed full plastic deformation when the structure suffered rare earthquakes, to protect the high-strength steel frame. The story shear distribution is not suitable for the capacity-based design method, due to the stiffness of D-HSS-EBF being changed under plastic state. Therefore, this paper presents the elastic-plastic story shear distribution of DHSS-EBF under various seismic hazard levels, including frequent earthquakes, moderate earthquakes, rare earthquakes and super-rare earthquakes. Based on this, the prototype structures of D-HSS-EBF are designed considering different stories (4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-stories) and different link lengths (900 mm, 1000 mm and 1100 mm), and the story shear distribution modes under various seismic hazard levels are raised under near-fault ground motions and far-fault ground motions. Furthermore, the parameters of story shear distribution under rare earthquakes are determined by the elastic-plastic lateral force. The time history analysis results indicated that the link length has little impact on the story shear distribution, and the near-fault and far-fault earthquakes show different story shear distribution due to the velocity pulse effect. The story shear distribution coefficient beta i declines with seismic acceleration increasing. Besides, the proposed inelastic story shear models of D-HSS-EBFs have a better reflect the actual seismic response.

TI  - Analysis and forecasting of air quality index based on satellite data
T2  - INHALATION TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe air quality index (AQI) forecasts are one of the most important aspects of improving urban public health and enabling society to remain sustainable despite the effects of air pollution. Pollution control organizations deploy ground stations to collect information about air pollutants. Establishing a ground station all-around is not feasible due to the cost involved. As an alternative, satellite-captured data can be utilized for AQI assessment. This study explores the changes in AQI during various COVID-19 lockdowns in India utilizing satellite data. Furthermore, it addresses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical approaches for forecasting short-term AQI.Materials and methodsGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) has been utilized to capture the data for the study. The satellite data has been authenticated against ground station data utilizing the beta distribution test before being incorporated into the study. The AQI forecasting has been explored using state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning approaches like VAR, Holt-Winter, and LSTM variants (stacked, bi-directional, and vanilla).ResultsAQI ranged from 100 to 300, from moderately polluted to very poor during the study period. The maximum reduction was recorded during the complete lockdown period in the year 2020. Short-term AQI forecasting with Holt-Winter was more accurate than other models with the lowest MAPE scores.ConclusionsBased on our findings, air pollution is clearly a threat in the studied locations, and it is important for all stakeholders to work together to reduce it. The level of air pollutants dropped substantially during the different lockdowns.

TI  - Community forest management led to rapid local forest gain in Nepal: A 29 year mixed methods retrospective case study
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite widespread implementation of community forest (CF) management over the last 40 years, limited knowledge exists on CF-level processes that link introduction of CF management to long-term forest cover change. CF management has been widely adopted in Nepal but research on effects of CF management on forest cover change often lacks long-term forest cover data and does not attempt to directly link changes in local forest cover with forest management decisions by local forest users. This study used a mixed methods approach integrating a 29 year-long satellite record of annual forest cover (1988-2016) and local interview data from 2018 to 2020 across eight CFs in Nepal to evaluate the spatially explicit impacts of CF management on long-term forest cover change. Information on historical forest management practices and forest conditions were collected from qualitative open-ended interviews with 28 CF user group managers, forest management records, and field observations. Annual forest cover change from 1988 to 2016 was measured using Landsat satellite time series data. For each CF, the impacts of local forest management decisions on forest cover trends were then characterized before and after the local introduction of CF management. Although study CF user groups had a wide range of initial forest cover (11-93%) before CF management, forest cover increased in all eight study sites under CF management to between 58% and 99% by 2016. Forest cover gains were evident during an informal period of CF management that preceded formal registration and management in most CFs and were maintained over the ensuing period of formal CF management. Interview data show that forest cover gains directly followed the introduction of informal and formal CF management activities such as tree planting, forest patrols, and grazing regulations. In our case study CFs, the early success of CF management motivated the continued investment in forest management leading to long-term forest conservation. This study demonstrates that CF management has been effective at conserving and expanding forest cover in community forests, and that yearly forest change and management data can be used to assess both the immediate impact and long-term sustainability of CF management.

TI  - The Oncologic Safety of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Node-Positive Breast Cancer with Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Single-Center Experience
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer with complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods. Ninety-two consecutive (T1-4 and N1-2) patients with breast cancer who had pathologic and/or clinical and radiologic axillary lymph node involvement were included. All patients received NAC. Patients with a clinical and radiologic complete response in the axilla after NAC underwent SLNB. Pathologic complete response (ypCR) was defined as the absence of residual invasive and in situ cancer, and near-complete response (ypNCR) represented in situ and/or <= 1 mm residual tumor in the breast and/or presence of malignant cell clusters (& LE;0.2 mm) and/or micrometastases (<= 2.0 mm) in the axillary lymph nodes (ALN) (ypTis/T1mi, ypN0i+/pN1mi). Results. The mean age of the 92 patients was 49.6 +/- 10.3 years and the mean follow-up was 34.0 +/- 17.8 months. With respect to breast tumors, 23 (25.0%) patients had complete and 14 (15.2%) had a near-complete response to NAC. Complete response in ALN was obtained in 39 (42.4%) patients and near-complete in six (6.5%) patients. The overall survival of the 33 patients who achieved ypCR and ypNCR was 100% and the remaining 59 patients with partial or no response to NAC was 83.1% at a mean follow-up of 34 months (p=0.063). Conclusions. In this study, no event developed in cases with ypCR and ypNCR in the breast and axilla. The persistence of the same results in long-termfollow-ups may enable the use of ypNCR as a positive prognostic marker in addition to ypCR.

TI  - An adapted protocol for magnetic localisation of nonpalpable breast cancer lesions and sentinel lymph nodes using a magnetic seed and superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLocalisation techniques for nonpalpable breast cancer lesions and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are associated with several drawbacks. A complete magnetic technique using magnetic seeds and superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer could be an interesting alternative. This study describes a clear protocol and the results of a combined magnetic approach. MethodsFrom August 2021 to February 2022 40 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery with SLNB were eligible for inclusion. Localisation was performed under ultrasound or stereotactic guidance, 1 week before surgery. Subsequently, 1 ml of tracer was injected at least 4 cm away from the tumour. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) was injected 1 day before surgery as control procedure. Outcomes were SLNB time, a number of nodes detected with magnetic tracer including comparison with Tc-99m, a success rate of malignant lesion detection and pathological margin assessment. ResultsIn total, 40 procedures were performed on 39 patients. A median of one node was retrieved. Sentinel nodes were retrieved using MagTrace (R) with a 92.5% detection rate compared to Tc-99m. Wide local excision under magnetic guidance was successful in 35 cases. ConclusionsThis paper describes a combined magnetic approach for breast-conserving surgery and SLNB. An adapted protocol is described and could be used for implementation.

TI  - Resilience to unusual flooding after 2021 tropical storms in part of mainland Southeast Asia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southeast Asian countries, flooding is common and occurs a few weeks after tropical storms. In Thailand, the government's approach to dealing with flooding is focused on the construction of anthropogenic megastructures. The loss of life, property, and ecosystem from flooding still occurs and will likely become increasingly more severe soon due to global climate variation. Here, in this brief report, we show a case study analyzing the cause of unusual flooding that occurred from September to November 2021 during the tropical depression "Dianmu" and the tropical cyclone "Kompasu" that hit the Khorat Plateau, northeastern Thailand. These two tropical storms left behind vast flooded urban and agricultural areas in the upstream part of the Chi River on this, the largest plateau in mainland Southeast Asia. The flood water stagnated for a month and unusually drained downslope in the upstream zone. In this work, a series of free online access satellite images taken by the Sentinel-1 C band GRD and Sentinel-2 available in the Google Earth engine platform was analyzed. As a result, we confirmed that the normal nature of water flow was problematic due to the presence of anthropogenic structures, especially roads. The installation of different design and dimensions of culverts are urgently recommended, particularly in the floodplain zone. The quick responsible idea provided in this paper highlights and simplifies the resilience to future extreme weather events of the rural community and ecosystem.

TI  - Variation characteristics of frozen ground degradation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau observed using time series data of MODIS from 2000 to 2020
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As an important component of the cryosphere, the frozen ground is sensitive to climate change. With global warming, frozen ground in most regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is degrading. The Stefan model and the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP) model were adopted to estimate the spatial distribution of frozen ground and maximum soil freezing depth (SFD) based on multiple datasets across the QTP from 2000 to 2020. Results were then evaluated. The objective of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the frozen ground in the QTP in the past 20 years. In the QTP, permafrost mainly distributes in the central and the western regions, covering an area of about 9.69 x 10(5) km(2) and accounting for 39.5% of the total area of QTP. The mean area of seasonally frozen ground was similar to 1.39 x 10(6) km(2), and the mean SFD was similar to 1.28 m. The SFD showed a spatial distribution pattern of being deep in the west and north and shallow in the east and south. In the past 2 decades, permafrost areas in the QTP decreased by about 8.52 x 10(4) km(2). The regions with permafrost disappearing were mainly located in the transition areas from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground. There was an obvious disappearance of permafrost in the Qilian Mountains, the source region of the Yangtze River, and the source region of the Yellow River. The SFD decreased at about 60.82% of the QTP, and the annual average decreasing rate was - 4.3 cmmiddot(10a)(-1). Regions with a significant decrease in the SFD were mainly located at the center of the Qaidam Basin in the northern regions and the Western Sichuan Plateau and the Hengduan Mountains in the southwest regions, and their decreasing rate was about - 12 similar to - 5 cmmiddot(10a)(-1).

TI  - A coastal wetlands mapping approach of Yellow River Delta with a hierarchical classification and optimal feature selection framework
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in ecological health and sustainable development, their spatial distribution and explicit thematic information are crucial for developing management and conservation measures. The Yellow River Delta is an important coastal wetland reserve in China, its wetland types are complex and diverse, natural and artificial wetlands are easily confused, making refined classification more difficult. To address this challenge, we proposed a new wetland mapping approach by combing hierarchical classification framework (HCF) and optimal feature selection. First, inheritance-based multiscale segmentation was carried out to obtain object -oriented images, and decision tree classification was used for preliminarily identify wetland and non-wetland. Second, recursive feature elimination and cross-validation (RFECV) was used to select optimal features, which was then utilized for wetland refinement extraction by using random forest (RF) algorithm. The experiments were performed based on Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and NASADEM datasets. The results show that effective wetland classification features can be selected by using RFECV. The feature scores are as follows, red edge index > spectral features > vegetation/water body index > backscatter coefficient > topographic features > texture features > location feature > urban index > geometric feature. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the method in this paper are 92.36 % and 0.915, which are 14.62 % and 6.68 % higher than using only HCF or only RFECV. Compared with the GlobeLand30 and CAS_Wetlands datasets, the refinement of wetland mapping in this paper is higher. This study provides a new idea in methodological selection for wetland information extraction, and the resulting coastal wetland map can be used for sustainable management, ecological assessment and conservation of the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Strategy for mapping soil salt contents during the bare soil period through a satellite image: Optimal calibration set combined with random forest
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt is a basic soil parameter that is especially sensitive to land degradation and global climate warming. Machine learning combined with satellite images offers the potential for effectively surveying soil salt contents (SSC) in the spatial and temporal dimensions. However, outlier spectral samples caused by environmental factors (e.g., particle size distribution, moisture, and vegetation) have interfered with the determination of the mapping relationship between ground-truth SSC and corresponding spectral features, resulting in a random forest (RF) mapping model with low generalization capability. Therefore, a spatial association module was introduced into the RF to remove the outlier spectral samples for building an optimal sample set in order to calibrate an improved random forest (IRF) model for SSC mapping. A total of 233 soil samples and a simultaneous Sentinel-2B mul-tispectral image were acquired for the Weibei Plain of China. The spectral absorption features of SSC were characterized by three indices (band difference, band ratio, and band normalized). Then a spatial association function was developed to identify the outlier spectral samples for optimizing the calibration samples. Lastly, the SSC-responding bands and SSC-related indices were used as input variables to build the improved random forest (IRF) model for regional SSC mapping. Results showed that: (1) bands 3, 8, and 11 in the Sentinel-2B image were the SSC-responding bands, and band 11 had a significant correlation with SSC; (2) the band ratio index syn-thesized the multi-band spectral information, and effectively enhanced the spectral absorption signal of soil salt; the optimal SSC-related indices included RI34 (reflectance ratio of band 3 and band 4), RI711, NDI611 (normalized reflectance values of band 6 and band 11), and DI45 (reflectance difference value of band 4 and band 5); (3) when the SSC-responding bands and optimal SSC-related indices were input into the IRF remote sensing estimation model, the accuracy parameters R2v and RPIQ were greater (0.89 and 3.52, respectively) than the comparable values with the RF model (R2v = 0.69; RPIQ = 2.90), with accuracy improved by 28.99 % and 21.38 %, respectively, indicating that satisfactory results for regional SSC mapping had been obtained; (4) SSC distribution showed that the values in the central part of the study area were slightly higher than in the southern and northern parts; the highest SSC area was mainly related to the distribution of saltern; additionally, agricultural activities and microtopography contributed significantly to the distribution of SSC at the farm scale. The IRF model based on the SSC-responding bands and optimal SSC-related indices provides a strategy for supporting regional mapping of SSC, and will be useful for environmental policy-making.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability and key factors of evergreen forest encroachment in the southern Great Plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant encroachment has been long observed in the southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States. However, our understanding of its spatiotemporal variability, which is the basis for informed and targeted management strategy, is still poor. This study investigates the encroachment of evergreen forest, which is the most important encroachment component in the SGP. A validated evergreen forest map of the SGP (30 m resolution, for the time period 2015 to 2017) from our previous study was utilized (referred to as evergreen_base). Sample plots of evergreen forest (as of 2017) were collected across the study area, based on which a threshold of winter season (January and February) mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIwinter) was derived for each of the 5 sub-regions, using Landsat 7 surface reflectance data from 2015 to 2017. Then a NDVIwinter layer was created for each year within the four time periods of 1985-1989, 1995-1999, 2005-2009, and 2015-2017, with winter season surface reflectance data from Landsat 4, 5, and 7. By applying the sub-region specific NDVIwinter thresholds to the annual NDVIwinter layers and the evergreen_base, a SGP evergreen forest map was generated for each of those years. The annual evergreen forest maps within each time period were composited into one. According to the resulting four composite evergreen forest maps, mean annual encroachment rate (km(2)/year) was calculated at sub-region and ecoregion scales, over each of the three temporal stages 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2017, respectively. To understand the spatiotemporal variability of the encroachment, the encroachment rate at each temporal stage was related to the corresponding initial evergreen forest area, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean annual burned area (MABA) through linear regression and pairwise comparison. Results suggest that most of the ecoregions have seen a slowing trend of evergreen forest encroachment since 1990. The temporal trend of encroachment rate tends to be consistent with that of MAP, but opposite to that of MABA. The spatial variability of the encroachment rate among ecoregions can be largely (>68%) explained by initial evergreen forest area but shows no significant relationship with MAP or MABA. These findings provide pertinent guidance for the combat of woody plant encroachment in the SGP under the context of climate change.

TI  - Satellite-based assessment of the anthropogenic impacts on environmental sustainability in Jazan region, Red Sea
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities in urban areas could degrade the natural environment by emitting huge quantities of pollutants over land, water, and air. In the last decade, Jazan province along the Red Sea has been exposed to vast urban development, particularly along the coastline which has led to environmental degradation. Evaluation of these anthropogenic activities is very important for environmental sustainability. Consequently, this study was carried out to assess the environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities in Jazan including air and water quality, land cover variations, and coastal change detection using earth observations from 2010 to 2022. Landsat imagery (TM-5&OLI-8) was used to detect the changes in land cover and the coastal area between 2010 and 2022. Moreover, the water quality was investigated in 2022 based on the biogeochemical dataset from Copernicus. Furthermore, air quality was monitored from OMI data during the same duration. Results revealed that the urban areas increased by 0.8 % in 2022 than in 2010. The majority of urban development was distributed along the coast due to Jazan's topography with a total change in the shoreline of about 6.5 km2. As well, the vegetation cover reached 9 % of the total area in 2022 which reflects the development that occurred in the region in different sectors that attract population. As a result, the water quality is highly influenced by the natural runoff from valleys and artificially from residential and industrial wastes. In addition, the air quality showed great variations between 2010 and 2021, particularly in urban areas such as desalination plants. Therefore, these environmental issues should have more consideration to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development goals in the province.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Rapid biodegradation of atrazine by a novel <i>Paenarthrobacter ureafaciens</i> ZY and its effects on soil native microbial community dynamic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An atrazine-utilizing bacterium, designated as ZY, was isolated from agricultural soil and identified as Paenarthrobacter ureafaciens. The P. ureafaciens ZY demonstrated a significant degradation capacity of atrazine, with the degradation efficiency of 12.5 mg L-1 h(-1) in liquid media (at pH 7, 30 degrees C, and the atrazine level of 100 mg L-1). The P. ureafaciens ZY contained three atrazine-degrading genes (i.e., trzN, atzB, and atzC) could metabolize atrazine to form cyanuric acid, which showed lower biotoxicity than the parent atrazine as predicted by Ecological Structure Activity Relationships model. A laboratory-scale pot experiment was performed to examine the degradation of atrazine by P. ureafaciens ZY inoculation and investigate its effects on the native microbial communities. The results exhibited that the P. ureafaciens ZY was conductive to the degradation of atrazine, increased the total soil phospholipid fatty acids at the atrazine level of 50, 70, and 100 mg kg(-1). By using high-throughput sequencing analysis, Frateuria, Dyella, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia were considered as the most important indigenous atrazine-degrading microorganisms due to their relative abundances were positively correlated with the atrazine degradation rate. In addition, P. ureafaciens ZY also increased the abundance of atrazine-degrading genus Streptomyces and Bacillus, indicating that there may be a synergic relationship between them in the process of atrazine degradation. Our work provides a new insight between inoculums and native microorganisms on the degradation of atrazine.

TI  - Prediction of the concentration of cadmium in agricultural soil in the Czech Republic using legacy data, preferential sampling, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and ensemble models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study assesses and predicts cadmium (Cd) concentration in agricultural soil using two Cd datasets, namely legacy data (LD) and preferential sampling-legacy data (PS-LD), along with four streams of auxiliary datasets extracted from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) bands. The study was divided into two contexts: Cd prediction in agricultural soil using LD, ensemble models, 10 and 20 m spatial resolution of S2 and L8 (context 1), and Cd prediction in agricultural soil using PS-LD, ensemble models and 10 and 20 m spatial resolution of S2 and L8 (context 2). In context 1, ensemble 1, L8 with PS-LD was the cumulative optimal approach that predicted Cd in agricultural soil with a higher R2 value of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.66, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.35, and median absolute error (MdAE) of 0.13. However, with R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.63, MAE = 0.34, and MdAE = 0.15, ensemble 1, S2 of PS-LD was the best prediction approach in predicting Cd concentration in agricultural soil in context 2. Overall, the predictions from both contexts indicated that ensemble 1 of S2 combined with PS-LD was the most appropriate and best model for Cd prediction in agricultural soil. The modeling approaches' uncertainty in both contexts was assessed using ensemble-sequential gaussian simulation (EnSGS), which revealed that the degree of uncertainty propagated in the study area was within 5% in both contexts. The combination of the PS dataset and the LD along with ensemble models and the remote sensing dataset, produced promising results. Nonetheless, the results demonstrated that the 20 m spatial resolution band dataset used in the prediction of Cd in agricultural soil outperformed the 10 m spatial resolution. When PS is combined with LD, an appropriate modeling approach, and a well-correlated remote sensing dataset are used, good results are obtained.

AB  - The present article is devoted to the study of ethnic representation in the works of Kurdish painters. Specific features of the Kurdish ethnic worldview and its relation to the representation of ethnic themes in the works of various artists were revealed. The purpose of the analysis of Kurdish ethnic components in the works of Iranian Kurdish painters was to classify the themes according to important ethnic values Kurds into more comprehensive groups. In the first stage, the ethnic components used in the works of the painters were extracted, secondly, they were categorized into more comprehensive groups. The components adopted in the works of Kurdish painters were categorized in more inclusive categories, which eventually were classified into six groups: Nature, Myths and Heroes, Typical Kurdish Appearance, Cultural Traditions, History and Native Architecture.

TI  - Space-time modelling of a tropical wetland using multiscale images, vegetation indices and landscape metrics: case-Ayapel Wetland Complex, Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ayapel Wetland Complex (AWC) is part of the so-called Momposina Depression, one of the largest alluvial plains in South America and a strategic ecosystem for Colombia. This research used multiscale images, vegetation indices and landscape metrics for modelling the AWC over a period of 33 years. Three hydrological conditions were assessed: (a) permanent water storage capacity, (b) flood buffering capacity and (c) hydrological pulse. PlanetScope and RapidEye images were used to compare the efficiency of Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI), Emergent Vegetation Spectral index (EVSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Water Adjusted Vegetation index (WAVI), derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, for mapping the AWC landscape. The most efficient index was WAVI from which the water body cartography was carried out for the annual and inter-seasonal periods. Landscape metrics such as class area (CA), patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI) and cohesion index (PC) were compared between annual and inter-seasonal periods to determine changes in the AWC. Space-time modelling showed the wetland's progressive deterioration; 29.8% of the water bodies were lost (19,683.5 ha) and the surfaces flooded in the wet season gradually increased. This is an indication of the decrease in the wetland's ability to buffer floods. The gradual increase in surface differences between dry and wet seasons, which reached 62.8% in 2017, is a possible indication of imbalance in the hydrological pulse of the AWC. The approach addressed in this research becomes a practical, fast and low-cost methodological strategy, easily replicable for other wetland ecosystems in the tropics.

TI  - High-resolution quantification of building stock using multi-source remote sensing imagery and deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, urbanization has led to an increase in building material stock. The high-resolution quantification of building stock is essential to understand the spatial concentration of materials, urban mining potential, and sustainable urban development. Current approaches rely excessively on statistics or survey data, both of which are unavailable for most cities, particularly in underdeveloped areas. This study proposes an end-to-end deep-learning model based on multi-source remote sensing data, enabling the reliable estimation of building stock. Ground-detail features extracted from optical remote sensing (ORS) and spatiotemporal features extracted from nighttime light (NTL) data are fused and incorporated into the model to improve accuracy. We also compare the performance of our feature-fusion model with that of an ORS-only regression model and traditional NTL regression for Beijing. The proposed model yields the best building-stock estimation, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.69, weighted root mean square error of 0.58, and total error in the test set below 14%. Using gradient-weighted class activation mapping, we further investigate the relationship between ORS features and building-stock estimation. Our model exhibits reliable predictive capability and illustrates the tremendous value of the physical environment for estimating building stock. This research illustrates the significant potential of ORS and deep learning for stock estimation. Large-scale, long-term building-stock investigations could also benefit from the end-to-end predictability and the data availability of the model.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A World Natural Heritage Site, Jiuzhaigou, is the first nature reserve in China whose primary purpose is to protect natural scenery. On August 8, 2017, a M-s 7.0 earthquake caused many unstable slopes in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan Province, China. In the extreme storm conditions that follow, the unstable slopes tend to develop into potential landslides, which can cause many casualties and property losses in scenic areas. Sentinel-1A ascending orbit data were obtained in this paper to establish a SAR database. The large-scale deformation rate map of the study area was obtained using a small baseline set InSAR technology. The potential landslides in the deformation area are preliminarily confirmed with remote sensing interpretation. The field verification is further carried out by studying the deformation information of the characteristic points on the potential landslides. The results show that 13 deformation zones were preliminarily identified, and three typical deformation zones were selected for coupling verification and identified as potential landslides. At the same time, further analysis shows that the four potential landslides have been in continuous linear deformation for a long time since the earthquake, posing a severe threat to the safety of local people's lives and property. The research results provide a reference for the early identification and warning of potential landslides in earthquake-prone regions.

TI  - Identifying Dust Sources Affecting Southwestern Iran (Khuzestan Province) Using Remote Sensing Techniques and HYSPLIT Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Southwest Iran is most affected by foreign dust sources due to its proximity to the main dust sources of the Middle East region, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In order to identify foreign dust sources affecting southwestern Iran from 2003 to 2018, dust was retrieved from MODIS images, one day before, on the day and on the next day of the dust event, by selecting the appropriate algorithm. Two conditions were applied for the occurrence of dust: spatially, dust is reported in more than 50% of synoptic stations, and temporarily, the visibility is less than 5000 m and in more than three consecutive synoptic reports. Using the AOD index, for one day before reporting the dust phenomenon in Khuzestan synoptic stations, and tracking the incoming flow path in different atmospheric levels applying HYSPLIT Model, the areas that had a greater role in dust events in southwestern Iran of foreign origin were identified. Examining parts of the area that were identified as areas of dust formation or intensification at least 100 times, using AOD concentrations in the days before the occurrence of dust, Al-Anbar Province in the east, Muthanna in the southeast and Najaf in Iraq, and Al-Hudood and Al-Sharqawiyah in Saudi Arabia had the largest share among different parts of neighboring countries in the production of dust entering southwestern Iran. Identifying the areas that have the greatest impact on the incoming dust of southwestern Iran will inform and help the country's planners and decision-makers adopt appropriate.

T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Understanding the complex mechanisms of climate change and its environmental consequences requires the collection and subsequent analysis of geospatial data from observations and numerical modeling. Multivariable linear regression and mixed-effects models were used to estimate daily surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in the megacity of Pakistan. The main parameters for the multivariable linear regression model were the 10-km-resolution satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and daily averaged meteorological parameters from ground monitoring (temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and planetary boundary layer height). Ground-based PM2.5 was measured in two stations in the city, Korangi (industrial/residential) and Tibet Center (commercial/residential). The initial linear regression model was modified using a stepwise selection procedure and adding interaction parameters. Finally, the modified model showed a strong correlation between the PM2.5-satellite AOD and other meteorological parameters (R-2 = 0.88-0.92 and p-value = 10(-7) depending on the season and station). The mixed-effect technique improved the model performance by increasing the R-2 values to 0.99 and 0.93 for the Korangi and Tibet Center sites, respectively. Cross-validation methods were used to confirm the reliability of the model to predict PM2.5 after 10 years.

TI  - Forecast Sensitivity-based Observation Impact (FSOI) in an analysis-forecast system of the California Current Circulation
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecast Sensitivity-based Observation Impacts (FSOI) in an analysis-forecast system of the California Current System (CCS) are quantified using an adjoint-based approach. The analysis-forecast system is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and a 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation approach. FSOI was applied to four different metrics of forecast skill that target important features of the CCS circulation along the central California coast. A particular focus of the FSOI analysis is the impact of assimilation of measurements of the radial component of surface currents from a network of high frequency (HF) radars since this is a new data stream in the near-real-time system considered here. On average, similar to 50-60% of all observations assimilated into the model yielded improvements in the forecast skill. Conversely, the remaining similar to 40-50% of data degrade the forecasts, in line with similar findings in numerical weather prediction systems. Much of the improvement in forecast skill arises from remotely sensed observations, including HF radar data; on average only similar to 50% of in situ measurements contribute to a reduction in forecast error. This is partly due to the large volume of remote sensing observations compared to in situ observations. However, in situ observations are an order of magnitude more impactful than remotely sensed data when viewed in terms of the average impact per observation.

TI  - Reversal of soil moisture constraint on vegetation growth in North China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of vegetation growth to soil moisture varies greatly from space and time under climate change and an-thropogenic activities. As an important grain producer in China, the vegetation growth and grain production of North China are constrained by the region's water resources. With the significant increase in vegetation greenness in North China over the last 40 years, it is essential to explore the changes in soil moisture constraints on vegetation growth to water management. However, to what degree vegetation growth responds to soil moisture and how the re-sponse varies spatiotemporally in North China remain unclear. In this study, the response patterns of vegetation growth to soil moisture at different depths and the spatiotemporal trend patterns of their relationships were explored thoroughly based on long time series remote sensing data in North China over the past 40 years. The results showed that compared to forests, the growth of grasslands and crops with one maturity per year and two maturity per year in North China was more constrained by soil moisture. Due to the combined effects of climatic conditions and human activities, vegetation growth in North China has been significantly less constrained by soil moisture over the last 40 years. This was especially seen in one maturity per year crop and natural vegetation in Shanxi and central Shan-dong. However, with the significant increase in temperature, potential evapotranspiration and water demand of the crop, the moisture constraints on vegetation growth in North China have begun to show an increasing trend since the early 2000s, especially for irrigated crop in central and southern North China. These findings highlight a compre-hensive understanding of the vegetation response to soil moisture from the time-varying perspective and provide a the-oretical basis for water management and appropriate planning of agricultural water use in North China.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the vertical accuracy of multiple open-source digital elevation models for the mountainous terrain of the north-western Himalaya
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital elevation model (DEM), a quantitative depiction of the topography, is crucial for hydrological and Earth Science applications. It is essential to assess the precision of the parameters obtained from the various DEMs available for morphometric study of the catchment region and extraction of the elevation. The accuracy of these datasets, which varies from one dataset to the next, is not always evident. We evaluated DEMs from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and CARTOSAT in terms of vertical accuracy, morphometric characteristics, and longitudinal river profile. The investigation was conducted in the Himalayan basin-Lohawati, in the Eastern Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, India. The SRTM performance was found to be more accurate than the ASTER and CARTOSAT DEMs in terms of overall vertical accuracy, as measured by mean absolute error, mean bias error, root-mean-square error, normalized root-mean-square error, relative root-mean-square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency. The morphometric analysis revealed that the basin was elongated with a low relief ratio, gentle slopes, and low drainage density. The results from various DEM sources were comparable, indicating that the majority of morphometric parameters were not significantly scale- and source-dependent. SRTM and ASTER DEMs produced better results than CARTOSAT DEM, as demonstrated by the longitudinal river profile. Researchers employing such products in a variety of modelling exercises may find these results to be extremely useful. However, the findings of this study must be evaluated and validated across a broader range of geographies and lithologies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a relationship between spectral indices, urban morphology, and spatial patterns with land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, LST and spectral indices in Tehran have been calculated using Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2019. LST was improved and the results were evaluated using synoptic stations in Tehran. Pearson correlation coefficient and mean root error are used to evaluate the accuracy of temperature difference. The spatial variables affecting LST are examined including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Building Density (BD), and Road Density (RD). The rise in the temperature of the land surface temperature, which causes the formation of heat islands, is continuously increasing over time and can be seen in some parts of the city. The findings indicate that LST relative accuracy was 0.98 and the root-mean-square error is 2.65 & DEG;C. The distance pattern based on the Pearson correlation test showed an effective relationship between LST and the examined indicators. Spots prone to heat islands were identified. Each of the heat island areas of Tehran was studied according to population centers (dense areas using residential, commercial, and industrial lands). The built-up and barren areas index had the highest correlation with surface temperature in most areas. The results showed that regions 9, 13, 18, 21, and especially region 22, which has the most barren land, have the highest surface temperature compared to the surrounding areas. The findings of this study can be used in future urban planning and policy-making.

TI  - Simultaneous retrieval of sugarcane variables from Sentinel-2 data using Bayesian regularized neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying biophysical and biochemical vegetation variables is of great importance in precision agriculture. Here, the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate multiple outputs is exploited to simultaneously retrieve Leaf area index (LAI), leaf sheath moisture (LSM), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) of sugarcane from Sentinel-2 spectra. We apply a type of ANNs, Bayesian Regularized ANN (BRANN), which incorporates the Bayes' theorem into a regularization scheme to tackle the overfitting problem of ANN and improve its generalizability. Quantitatively assessing the result accuracy indicated RMSE values of 0.48 (m2/m2) for LAI, 2.36 (% wb) for LSM, 5.85 (mu g/cm2) for LCC, and 0.23 (%) for LNC, applying simultaneous retrieval. It was demonstrated that simultaneous retrievals of the variables outperformed the individual re-trievals. The superiority of the proposed BRANN over a conventional ANN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was confirmed through statistical comparison of their results. The model was applied over the entire Sentinel-2 images to map the considered variables. The maps were probed to qualitatively evaluate the model performance. The results indicated that the retrievals reasonably represent spatial and temporal variations of the variables. Generally, this study demonstrated that the BRANN simultaneous retrieval model can provide faster and more accurate retrievals than those obtained from conventional ANNs and individual retrievals.

TI  - Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer: An American Society for Radiation Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: With the results of several recently published clinical trials, this guideline informs on the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and systemic therapy in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Updated evidence-based recommendations provide indications for adjuvant RT and the associated techniques, the utilization and sequencing of adjuvant systemic therapies, and the effect of surgical stag-ing techniques and molecular tumor profiling.Methods: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a multidisciplinary task force to address 6 key questions that focused on the adjuvant management of patients with endometrial cancer. The key questions emphasized the (1) indications for adju-vant RT, (2) RT techniques, target volumes, dose fractionation, and treatment planning aims, (3) indications for systemic therapy, (4) sequencing of systemic therapy with RT, (5) effect of lymph node assessment on utilization of adjuvant therapy, and (6) effect of molec-ular tumor profiling on utilization of adjuvant therapy. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for quality of evidence grading and strength of recommendation.Results: The task force recommends RT (either vaginal brachytherapy or external beam RT) be given based on the patient's clinical -pathologic risk factors to reduce risk of vaginal and/or pelvic recurrence. When external beam RT is delivered, intensity modulated RT with daily image guided RT is recommended to reduce acute and late toxicity. Chemotherapy is recommended for patients with Interna-tional Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ito II with high-risk histologies and those with FIGO stage III to IVA with any histology. When sequencing chemotherapy and RT, there is no prospective data to support an optimal sequence. Sentinel lymph node mapping is recommended over pelvic lymphadenectomy for surgical nodal staging. Data on sentinel lymph node pathologic ultra -staging status supports that patients with isolated tumor cells be treated as node negative and adjuvant therapy based on uterine risk fac-tors and patients with micrometastases be treated as node positive. The available data on molecular characterization of endometrial cancer are compelling and should be increasingly considered when making recommendations for adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: These recommendations guide evidence-based best clinical practices on the use of adjuvant therapy for endometrial cancer.(c) 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

TI  - Mapping <i>Ulva prolifera</i> green tides from space: A revisit on algorithm design and data products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the first report in 2008, macroalgal blooms of Ulva prolifera (often called green tides) in the Yellow Sea have occurred every year, with their origins, transport pathways, temporal changes, as well as causes and consequences studied extensively. Of these studies, satellite remote sensing has been used widely to detect the bloom presence and quantify the bloom size (i.e., U. prolifera coverage in km2 or biomass in kilotons). However, substantial variability has been found in the refereed literature in the remote sensing methodology, results, and interpretation of the U. prolifera coverage, especially in the attempts to study inter-annual changes or long-term trends. There are often inconsistent or contradicting results even from the same satellite sensor. Such in-consistencies or contradictions create difficulty not only within the remote sensing community when presenting new methodology or results, but also to researchers when attempting to use the remote sensing results to make predictions or perform impact assessments. Here, we review the literature on the remote sensing methodology to detect and quantify U. prolifera blooms, and make recommendations based on physical principles. Specifically, we propose the following conceptual guidelines: 1) a reliable index or algorithm should be relatively tolerant to perturbations by non-optimal observing conditions (thick aerosols, thin clouds, moderate sun glint, cloud-adjacent straylight, which can all be found frequently in the study region) for presence/absence detection, as well as to small errors in the selected thresholds to quantify U. prolifera; 2) a reliable index or algorithm should also make it relatively easy to account for variability in subpixel coverage of U. prolifera (i.e., through pixel unmixing) in order to obtain an accurate estimate of total U. prolifera coverage from an image; 3) a reliable data product (i.e., U. prolifera maps) should be able to account for the variable clouds when interpreting spatial patterns or temporal changes, with uncertainty estimates provided whenever possible; and 4) both the algorithm and the data product should minimize manual work in order to make them more objective and repeatable by other researchers. Finally, we show different types of time series of U. prolifera amounts in the Yellow Sea using

TI  - Performance assessment and validation of ocean color sensor-specific algorithms for estimating the concentration of particulate organic carbon in oceanic surface waters from satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global observations of ocean color from space provide a unique capability to conduct multi-decadal studies of biogeochemical constituents and processes in the upper ocean layers at the regional, basin, and global scales. The concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean waters is one of the biogeochemically important data products derivable from satellite ocean color observations. The data record of standard global POC product is available from NASA and has been obtained from the empirical power-function relationship between POC and a single blue-to-green band ratio of ocean remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs(lambda), which is here referred to as the BR-PF algorithm. Recently, we formulated a new suite of satellite ocean-color sensor-specific global POC algorithms that are referred to as hybrid algorithms because they contain two components, one based on the maximum band-ratio (MBR) and the other on the band ratio difference index (BRDI) of reflectance (Stramski et al., 2022). The present study describes the validation analysis and provides performance assessment of hybrid algorithms for SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS-SNPP satellite ocean color sensors. For comparison, the standard global (BR-PF) algorithms and the color-index (CI) algorithm from the literature were also analyzed. The analyses were made with an in situ validation dataset containing concurrent measurements of POC and Rrs(lambda) as well as three satellite validation datasets containing data matchups of field measurements of POC and satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) from the SeaWIFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP missions. The hybrid algorithms showed an overall improvement of performance compared to other algorithms, in particular in waters with relatively high POC compared to the standard BR-PF algorithms. The aggregate bias of hybrid algorithm-derived POC is small or negligible (<10%) for the validation datasets, and a measure of median percentage difference is about 20% for the in situ validation dataset and ranges between about 20% and 30% for the satellite validation datasets. In addition, comparisons of POC retrievals from the three sensor-specific hybrid algorithms show good inter-sensor consistency. The validation results of this study indicate that hybrid algorithms have high potential to provide improved POC retrievals within a broader range of POC than the predecessor global algorithms and the capability for generating a consistent long-term POC data record from multiple satellite missions.

TI  - Estimating local-scale forest GPP in Northern Europe using Sentinel-2: Model comparisons with LUE, APAR, the plant phenology index, and a light response function
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern forest ecosystems make up an important part of the global carbon cycle. Hence, monitoring local-scale gross primary production (GPP) of northern forest is essential for understanding climatic change impacts on terrestrial carbon sequestration and for assessing and planning management practices. Here we evaluate and compare four methods for estimating GPP using Sentinel-2 data in order to improve current available GPP es-timates: four empirical regression models based on either the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) or the plant phenology index (PPI), an asymptotic light response function (LRF) model, and a light-use efficiency (LUE) model using the MOD17 algorithm. These approaches were based on remote sensing vegetation indices, air temperature (Tair), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The models were parametrized and evaluated using in-situ data from eleven forest sites in North Europe, covering two common forest types, evergreen needleleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest. Most of the models gave good agreement with eddy covariance-derived GPP. The VI-based regression models performed well in evergreen needleleaf forest (R2 = 0.69-0.78, RMSE = 1.97-2.28 g C m 2 d 1, and NRMSE = 9-11.0%, eight sites), whereas the LRF and MOD17 performed slightly worse (R2 = 0.65 and 0.57, RMSE = 2.49 and 2.72 g C m 2 d 1, NRMSE = 12 and 13.0%, respectively). In deciduous broadleaf forest all models, except the LRF, showed close agreements with the observed GPP (R2 = 0.75-0.80, RMSE = 2.23-2.46 g C m 2 d 1, NRMSE = 11-12%, three sites). For the LRF model, R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 3.21 g C m 2 d 1, NRMSE = 16%. The results highlighted the necessity of improved models in evergreen needleleaf forest where the LUE approach gave poorer results., The simplest regression model using only PPI performed well beside more complex models, suggesting PPI to be a process indicator directly linked with GPP. All models were able to capture the seasonal dynamics of GPP well, but underesti-mation of the growing season peaks were a common issue. The LRF was the only model tending to overestimate GPP. Estimation of interannual variability in cumulative GPP was less accurate than the single-year models and will need further development. In general, all models performed well on local scale and demonstrated their feasibility for upscaling GPP in northern forest ecosystems using Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Beveridge at Eighty: Learning the Right Lessons
T2  - POLITICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The eightieth anniversary of the Beveridge inquiry is a timely moment to consider how the landmark report is used within contemporary UK politics. Calls for a 'new Beveridge' reflect a desire for a rupture with the past and the creation of a radical new welfare consensus. But this reflects a misunderstanding: Beveridge's approach was organic in nature, building on decades of experimentation, politically contested rather than consensual, and intellectually pluralist rather than moored to a single ideological worldview. The real insight Beveridge offers us today flows not from his substantive agenda-which was rooted in a particular set of historic circumstances-but as an approach to securing social reform. Successful welfare advances over the last generation have drawn on these 'Beveridgean instincts'. Rather than calling for a new twenty-first century blueprint to be handed down from above, reformers should build on experimentation and successful incremental change, from within the UK and abroad.

TI  - Iris Metastasis From Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A 73-year-old man with hypopharyngeal carcinoma underwent total pharygolaryngectomy, both cervical lymph node dissection, and free jejunal-reconstruction followed by postoperative radiotherapy concurrent with tri-weekly cisplatin. After completion of postopera-tive radiotherapy, multiple lung metastases were detected, and he was prescribed Nivolumab. Three months after five cycles of Nivolumab, he had a single brain metastasis. He received radiotherapy for brain metastasis. However, he began to have difficulty seeing out of his right eye. Examination of the right eye revealed a red vascularized and lobulated lesion in the iris with associated bunching of the adjacent iris and a prominent sentinel scleral vessel. He received a diagnosis of iris metastasis of hypopharyngeal carcinoma, a rare condition with poor prognosis.

TI  - Water accounting of a trans-boundary river basin using satellite observations and WA plus framework
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of total water consumptions is useful for watershed management aspect such as for the development of agricultural and environmental services in a trans-boundary river basin. The freely available open access satellite observations viz. CHIRPS and PERSIANN precipitation were evaluated with India Meteorological Department (IMD) precipitation. The satellite observations including MODIS land use/land cover dataset was used in the WA + framework for calculation of water accounting; land use map (WALU) and outcomes from WALU suggested the Rainfed crops-cereals as 40.50% (highest percent) followed by Forest plantation (13.29%) in the study area. The CHIRPS dataset is more close with the observed precipitation than PERSIANN. The value of R2, RMSE, NSE and PBIAS were 0.87, 45.22, 0.86 and-0.91%, respectively for the CHIRPS. The maximum mean water yield (2003-2019) in the basin was accounted as 125 mm/month for CHIRPS. However, for the PERSIANN, it was 40 mm/month. The total water consumptions in the basin for wet year (2018-19) and dry year (2010-11) were 110.0 and 105.3 BCM/year for the PERSIANN. Further, for the CHIRPS, the total water consumptions in the basin for 2013-14 (wet year) and 2015-16 (dry year) are 106.3 and 101.8 BCM/year. The findings from study suggested that non-beneficial component of total water consumptions in the basin was higher than beneficial part. Among the satellite observations, CHIRPS precipitation data is more suitable over the central Himalayan river basin for the study of the hydrological processes.

TI  - Modeling the biogenic isoprene emission and its impact on ozone pollution in Zhejiang province, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Isoprene is the most abundantly emitted biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), which plays an essential role in producing tropospheric ozone (O3). However, the simulations of isoprene emissions have not been sufficiently verified over Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and few studies have specifically addressed its impact on O3 formation. In this study, we simulated the isoprene emissions in Zhejiang Province (ZJ), a region with the largest BVOC emission in YRD, in August 2020 using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) and the latest Moderate Res-olution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, and investigated its contributions to O3 using the Weather Re-search and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The model has a good performance on isoprene simulations over urban and suburban areas, with mean biases of -0.16-0.12 ppb, but underestimated the concentrations at forest sites (mainly due to bamboo). Regionally, the simulated formaldehyde concentrations over forests agree well with the satellite observations. In August 2020, the total isoprene emission in ZJ was 125.1 GgC, with higher emissions in western ZJ and relatively lower emissions in eastern coastal regions. The spatial pattern of isoprene concentrations is similar to its emissions, and the maximum daytime average concentrations are above 3.5 ppb. The spatial pattern of its contribution to daily maximum 8 h average O3 concentrations is significantly different from the emissions and concentrations, which shows a higher impact in northern ZJ (>6 ppb) and relatively lower im-pact in southern ZJ (1-3 ppb). The mean contribution over ZJ is 8.9 %, with daily variation in the range of 3.1 % to 13.4%. For different cities, the monthly mean contribution is in the range of 4.6 % to 14.3 %, and the maximum daily contribution reaches about 25 %. These findings help understand the summertime O3 pollution in ZJ and the YRD re-gion of China.

TI  - Phytoplankton diversity and chemotaxonomy in contrasting North Pacific ecosystems
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Phytoplankton is the base of majority of ocean ecosystems. It is respon-sible for half of the global primary production, and different phytoplankton taxa have a unique role in global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, phytoplankton abundance and diversity are highly susceptible to climate induced changes, hence monitoring of phytoplankton and its diversity is important and necessary.Methods. Water samples for phytoplankton and photosynthetic pigment analyses were collected in boreal winter 2017, along transect in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) and the California Current System (CCS). Phytoplankton community was analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy and photosynthetic pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography. To describe distinct ecosystems, monthly average satellite data of MODIS Aqua Sea Surface temperature and Chlorophyll a concentration, as well as Apparent Visible Wavelength were used.Results. A total of 207 taxa have been determined, mostly comprised of coccol-ithophores (35.5%), diatoms (25.2%) and dinoflagellates (19.5%) while cryptophytes, phytoflagellates and silicoflagellates were included in the group "others" (19.8%). Phytoplankton spatial distribution was distinct, indicating variable planktonic dispersal rates and specific adaptation to ecosystems. Dinoflagellates, and nano-scale coccol-ithophores dominated NPSG, while micro-scale diatoms, and cryptophytes prevailed in CCS. A clear split between CCS and NPSG is evident in dendogram visualising LINK -TREE constrained binary divisive clustering analysis done on phytoplankton counts and pigment concentrations. Of all pigments determined, alloxanthin, zeaxanthin, divinyl chlorophyll b and lutein have highest correlation to phytoplankton counts.Conclusion. Combining chemotaxonomy and microscopy is an optimal method to determine phytoplankton diversity on a large-scale transect. Distinct communities between the two contrasting ecosystems of North Pacific reveal phytoplankton groups specific adaptations to trophic state, and support the hypothesis of shift from micro -to nano-scale taxa due to sea surface temperatures rising, favoring stratification and oligotrophic conditions.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite precipitation products are one of the sources of precipitation estimates. However, their spatial resolution is often too coarse for use in local areas or parameterization of meteorological and hydrological models at basin and plain scales. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty analysis of the downscaled monthly precipitation modeling of the CHIRPS satellite product based on rain gage station data. Five high-resolution ancillary data were used for this purpose including land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) extracted from the MODIS/Terra satellite database, and elevation data obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of NASA JPL satellite database. In addition, precipitation data were extracted from CHIRPS satellite data. Four machine learning models were used to model the downscaling, including support vector machine (SVM), gradient tree boost (GTB), random forest (RF), and classification and regression tree (CART). For accuracy evaluation, root mean square error (RMSE), Bias, multiplicative bias (mBias), correlation coefficient (CC), and optimum index factor (OIF) error estimators were applied. The results of the accuracy evaluation results showed that the CART and GTB models with the best performance according to the error estimators were the best models for stations at lower altitudes and latitudes (Karim Abad, Najm Abad, and Somea) and stations at higher altitudes and latitudes (Valian, Sorheh, and Fashand), respectively. The uncertainty analysis was performed using the bootstrap method. The results showed that the CART and GBT models had a more reliable estimate and lower uncertainty than the other models. This study highlights the power of the Google Earth Engine and machine learning algorithms in downscaling modeling to improve the resolution of satellite precipitation data.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analyses of land use changes with special focus on seasonal variation in snow cover in District Chitral; a Hindu Kush mountain region of Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and glacier changes and increase in temperature due to climate change in Hindu Kush Hi-malayas (HKH) and its impacts are important for water resource management in the world and specifically for Pakistan, which is a water-stressed country. Being a mountainous region, the peo-ple living in HKH are highly susceptible to the adverse impacts induced by climate change. This paper therefore mainly focused on monitoring snow cover changes in district Chitral using USGS satellite images (Landsat5-TM, Landsat7-ETM+, and Landsat8-OLI) for the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The maximum likelihood method was used for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification. For a better understanding of the pattern of seasonal variation in snow cover over time, the total study period was distributed in four quadrennials, and the dataset for each period was taken only for early winter (Oct-Nov). A marked increase (266.7%) in the built-up area and 135.9 km2 of agriculture expansion in this remote and mountainous area is quite sig-nificant. Results of the current study showed that in the year 2000, more than half (51.6%) of the total land of District Chitral was covered with snow in early winter, but it drastically decreased to only 6.8% in the year 2008. During the first two quadrennials, 44.7% (5694.6 km2) of glaciated area exposed the barren rocks, while the overall changes in snow-cover areas are approximately 43.3% (5514.6 km2). The most significant impact of melting snow and glaciers is Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs). GLOFs may cause human deaths and injuries, while these are also a threat to agricultural land, forest, and residential areas. Based on the current study, it is recom-mended to enhance institutional capacity in the country to face different environmental hazards, including early warning systems on the local scale. Keeping in view the water stress and based agriculture-based economy of Pakistan, proper analysis and monitoring of snow should be carried out for the sack of water availability, drought or floods, and other environmental vulnerabilities.

TI  - Remote sensing of dissolved CO2 concentrations in meso-eutrophic lakes using Sentinel-3 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observation can significantly reduce the uncertainties in CO2 emission estimations compared to insuf-ficient field data. However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 estimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data from 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China (N = 248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a), water temperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were tested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and validation (R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 6.35 mu mol L-1, MAPE < 30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations, showed the model's estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. Spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (>= 10 km2) in the ML_YHR basins were mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of variation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as weak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 +/- 1.13 mu mol L-1) while the rest were sources (19.22 +/- 2.02 mu mol L-1), compared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 mu mol L-1). CO2 concentrations decreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p < 0.05). This study advances current knowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can expand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.

TI  - Enhancing spatial resolution of GRACE-derived groundwater storage anomalies in Urmia catchment using machine learning downscaling methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urmia lake in north-west Iran has dried up to perilously low levels in the past two decades. In this study, we investigate the drivers behind the decline in lake water level with the help of in-situ and remote sensing data. We use total water storage (TWS) changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. TWS from GRACE includes all the water storage compartments in a column and is the only remote sensing product that can help in estimating groundwater storage (GWS) changes. The coarse spatial (approx. 300 km) resolution of GRACE does not allow us to identify local changes that may have led to the Urmia lake disaster. In this study, we tackle the poor resolution of the GRACE data by employing three machine learning (ML) methods including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The methods predict the groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA), derived from GRACE, as a function of hydro-climatic variables such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on a finer scale of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. We found that i) The RF model exhibited highest R (0.98), highest NSE (0.96) and lowest RMSE (18.36 mm) values. ii) The RF downscaled data indicated that the exploitation of groundwater resources in the aquifers is the main driver of groundwater storage and changes in the regional ecosystem, which has been corroborated by few other studies as well. The impact of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the GWSA was found to be rather weak, indicating that the anthropogenic derivers had the most significant impact on the GWSA changes. iii) We generally observed a significant negative trend in GWSA, having also significant positive correlations with the well data. However, over regions with dam con-struction significant negative correlations were found.

TI  - A continual learning-guided training framework for pansharpening
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised learning-based methods for pansharpening were criticized since their appearance because they rely on scale-shift assumption, i.e. those methods usually perform much better at reduced resolution than at full resolution. To address this issue, here we propose a general training framework for supervised learning-based pansharpening. Our training process consists of two stages: the first one is a conventional supervised method, which is applied to the reduced resolution dataset to obtain the converged model, while in the second model, obtained from stage one, is trained through an unsupervised learning scheme. Moreover, we developed a novel loss function made up of two terms that guarantees model high performance, both at reduced and full resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce the continual learning concept into pansharpening. The proposed framework is general and can be applied to any supervised learning-based pansharpening network. Also, the proposed method shows robustness with respect to the changing of the satellite sensor used to provide the data to be fused. Extensive tests on images from QuickBird, GaoFen-2, WorldView-3, and WorldView-2 show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Estimating leaf mass per area with leaf radiative transfer model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf mass per area (LMA) is an important leaf trait but challenging to be accurately estimated. This article proposes a simple leaf radiative transfer model called ISPECT. It explains the difference in optical properties observed on the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) sides of leaves, i.e., their dorsiventrality, with a limited number of structural parameters. The performance of ISPECT in estimating LMA is compared to that of five other leaf radiative transfer models (FASPECT, DLM, PROSPECT-D, PROSPECT-5B, and Leaf-SIP). We tested six experimental datasets with 962 leaf samples and two spectral ranges: the solar domain (0.4-2.5 mu m) and the shortwave infrared (1.7-2.4 mu m). Results show that PROSPECT-D and PROSPECT-5B accurately estimate LMA using the shortwave infrared spectra, while ISPECT and FASPECT perform well in both spectral ranges. Further analysis demonstrates that leaf dorsiventrality is likely to be an influential factor for LMA estimation: thus ISPECT can accurately estimate LMA in the solar and shortwave infrared domains, with NRMSE of 26.0% and 28.8%, respectively. This motivates further studies on LMA mapping from spaceborne imaging spectrometers (e.g., PRISMA, GaoFen-5, EnMAP) by coupling ISPECT with canopy radiative transfer models.

TI  - The Performance Analysis of Different Water Indices and Algorithms Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Images in Determining Water Surface: Demirkopru Dam Case Study
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the most appropriate algorithm and water index to determine the boundaries of the dam water surface using remote sensing (RS) techniques were investigated. Water surface boundaries of Demirkopru Dam were determined using Sentinel-2 L2A (MSI) and Landsat-8 (OLI) satellite images. Demirkopru Dam was chosen as the study area as it is suitable for floating photovoltaic (FPV) solar power plant installation. Normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified NDWI indices were used to determine the water surface boundaries of the dam. Thirty-six classification results were obtained using K-means, maximum likelihood classification (MLC), and random forest (RF) algorithms. The best classification accuracies of the produced maps have been calculated as 80.3%, 73.1%, and 73.2% by RF, MLC, and K-means, respectively. In addition, the water coastlines determined by classifications were compared with the continuously operating reference station (CORS-TR) data in a local area by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE). Compared with the CORS-TR measurements of the dam coastline obtained from the images classified by the RF algorithm, the minimum RMSE values were calculated as 13.8 m and 10.1 m for Landsat and Sentinel images, respectively. While the minimum RMSE value for coastlines obtained with various layer stacks of Landsat images classified by the MLC algorithm is 36.7 m, it could not be calculated in Sentinel images due to poorer classification results. For the coastlines obtained from the images classified by the K-means algorithm, the minimum RMSE values were calculated as 14.5 m and 9.6 m for Landsat and Sentinel images, respectively. According to the comparisons based on classification accuracy and CORS-TR measurements, it is concluded that the RF algorithm performs better than others for the dam water surface. Moreover, it was determined that the NDWI presented better results when the water level was the lowest for Demirkopru Dam. Also, in this study, the MLC algorithm has better results in detecting water surfaces using Landsat images. It was concluded that the K-means algorithm is also very effective in water surface detection. In this study, various water extraction indices, algorithms and free Landsat and Sentinel images were used to extract the water surface in a selected reservoir for the FPV installation. This study guides a series of algorithms and indexes used to detect water surfaces. In addition, it has been shown that the use of RS techniques, which are more practical than classical approaches in determining water boundaries, will be more effective in planning and design in terms of engineers, investors and various organizations who will realize the FPV installation.

TI  - Art as spirituality: The paradigmatic case of Marina Abramovic
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to illustrate through an empirical case how art in a secular age can function as a spiritual-but-non-religious (SBNR) environment for both artists and art followers. It examines contemporary performance artist Marina Abramovic as an example of a post-modern spiritual figure, rooted in the artworld. Her relevance for a secular age is as a contemporary artist who has developed her own brand of art-based spirituality with no theological nor religious content whatsoever. Although nonreligious, she does not conform to a materialistic worldview. She holds many so-called 'New Age' beliefs which place her among the growing SBNR demographic. She has developed her own 'spiritual' method to teach people beyond the 'elitist' artworld, and has created the immaterial Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI) to carry on her legacy. Arguably, therefore, she has effectively transformed herself into a 'spiritual' teacher. Drawing on Denita Benyshek's construct of artist-shaman, scientific explanations about the relieving of pain, and Victor Turner's concept of spontaneous communitas, the article concludes that Abramovic is a nonreligious spiritual charismatic figure who is generating countercultural communitas through her performances, her institute and her teachings, providing an empirical demonstration that art can indeed function as a spiritual but not religious context.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Empirical and Machine Learning Models for Chla Extraction Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat OLI Data: Opportunities, Limitations, and Challenges
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote retrieval of near-surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in small inland waters is challenging due to substantial optical interferences of various water constituents and uncertainties in the atmospheric correction (AC) process. Although various algorithms have been developed to estimate Chla from moderate-resolution terrestrial missions (similar to 10-60 m), the production of both accurate distribution maps and time series of Chla has proven challenging, limiting the use of remote analyses for lake monitoring. Here, we develop a support vector regression (SVR) model, which uses satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs(d)) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images as input for Chla retrieval in a representative eutrophic prairie lake, Buffalo Pound Lake (BPL), Saskatchewan, Canada. Validated against in situ Chla from seven ice-free seasons (N 200; 2014-2020), the SVR model outperformed both locally tuned, Rdrs-fed empirical models (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index, 2 and 3-band, and OC3) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) by 15-65%, while exhibiting comparable performance to a locally trained MDN, with an error of similar to 35%. Comparison of Chla retrieval models, AC processors (iCOR, ACOLITE), and radiometric products (Rayleigh corrected, surface, and top-of-atmosphere reflectance) showed that the best Chla maps and optimal time series (up to 100 mg m(-3)) were produced using a coupled SVR-iCOR system.

TI  - Derivation and assessment of forest-relevant polarimetric indices using RCM compact-pol data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three radar polarimetric indices, Radar Vegetation Index (RVI), Canopy Structure Index (CSI) and Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI)-normally associated with quad-pol (QP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors-were derived using compact polarimetry (CP) data from the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM). Indices were generated over a 10,000-hectare temperate mixedwood forest containing a range of complex forest structures. For comparative purposes, the same indices were generated using Radarsat-2 QP data. Agreement between CP and QP indices were assessed across broad vegetated land cover types, at the forest stand-level wherein ground plots and airborne LiDAR data were available, and at the pixel level within validation stands representing different forest types. Agreement was consistently strong for the RVI and weak for the CSI, with agreement stronger when generalized to the stand level. Indices were more informative on differences between vegetation types (e.g. forest and open wetland) than between forest types with different structures. With a radar nominal off-nadir incidence angle at 38 degrees, RCM CP indices had narrower dynamic ranges compared to Radarsat-2 QP indices, especially the CSI, contributing to a lower level agreement for the CSI. CP data enables derivation of RVI, CSI and RFDI indices simultaneously, and provides large spatial coverage and capacity for dense time-series collection, features which are unavailable from current QP sensors.

TI  - Automated mucilage extraction index (AMEI): a novel spectral water index for identifying marine mucilage formations from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine mucilage that threatens marine habitats is one of the natural disasters, mainly resulting from global warming and marine pollution. Monitoring sea surface mucilage formations and mapping their spatial distributions provide valuable information to the local authorities and decision-makers in developing prevention and rehabilitation strategies. This study proposes a new spectral index called Automated Mucilage Extraction Index (AMEI) that allows effective and accurate detection of surface mucilage aggregates using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The index uses four bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery (Bands 3, 4, 8, and 12) covering visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared regions. The index was formulated considering the image acquired on 19 May 2021, when mucilage formations were most intensively observed in the Sea of Marmara. The performance of the developed index was then evaluated using the images acquired on 14 and 24 May and 13 June 2021. The Jenks Natural Breaks (JNB) algorithm was applied to estimate the threshold values for separating mucilage formations from the water surface background and classify index maps into two classes: 'mucilage' and 'others'. To statistically analyse the effectiveness of the indices in distinguishing water background and mucilage formations, the proposed index was compared with 21 widely used water indices by applying Bhattacharyya Distance, Jeffries-Matusita Distance, and M-Statistic measures. Results confirm the robustness of the proposed spectral index, offering superior separation performance (above 1.5 in terms of M-Statistic) compared to other water indices on both cloud-free images and images with cumulus clouds. Visual interpretations also verified that boundaries of the mucilage formations in the cloudless and thin cloudy images were accurately identified by the proposed index, and different types of mucilage (i.e. yellow and white) can be identified when an appropriate histogram thresholding is applied.

TI  - Agricultural expansion and land use land cover changes in the Mount Bamboutos landscape, Western Cameroon: implications for local land use planning and sustainable development
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the extent of degradation and pattern of land use land cover change (LULCC) in the Mount Bamboutos landscape in Western Cameroon, using Landsat satellite images of 1980, 2000 and 2018. The researchers surveyed 261 household farmers to understand the different agricultural activities in the landscape. Grassland, sparse primary forest and sparse secondary forest decreased by a magnitude of 818%, 101% and 53%, respectively, from 1980 to 2018. Farmland, tea plantation, eucalyptus plantation and built-up areas increased by 16,799.8 ha (69%), 1009.6 ha (84%), 3757 ha (94%) and 3385.5 ha (97%), respectively, from 1980 to 2018. Agriculture, settlement and grazing land expansion are the key drivers of the LULCC. A conceptual model to increase inclusive stakeholder participation and sustainability in local land use planning is proposed.

TI  - Estimating leaf moisture content at global scale from passive microwave satellite observations of vegetation optical depth
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The moisture content of vegetation canopies controls various ecosystem processes such as plant productivity, transpiration, mortality, and flammability. Leaf moisture content (here defined as the ratio of leaf water mass to leaf dry biomass, or live-fuel moisture content, LFMC) is a vegetation property that is frequently used to estimate flammability and the danger of fire occurrence and spread, and is widely measured at field sites around the globe. LFMC can be retrieved from satellite observations in the visible and infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is however hampered by frequent cloud cover or low sun elevation angles. As an alternative, vegetation water content can be estimated from satelliteobservations in the microwave domain. For example, studies at local andregional scales have demonstrated the link between LFMC and vegetationoptical depth (VOD) from passive microwave satellite observations. VODdescribes the attenuation of microwaves in the vegetation layer. However,neither were the relations between VOD and LFMC investigated at large orglobal scales nor has VOD been used to estimate LFMC. Here we aim to estimate LFMC from VOD at large scales, i.e. at coarse spatial resolution,globally, and at daily time steps over past decadal timescales. Therefore,our objectives are: (1) to investigate the relation between VOD from different frequencies and LFMC derived from optical sensors and a global database of LFMC site measurements; (2) to test different model structures to estimate LFMC from VOD; and (3) to apply the best-performing model to estimate LFMC at global scales. Our results show that VOD is medium to highly correlated with LFMC in areas with medium to high coverage of short vegetation (grasslands, croplands, shrublands). Forested areas show on average weak correlations, but the variability in correlations is high. A logistic regression model that uses VOD and additionally leaf area index as predictor to account for canopy biomass reaches the highest performance in estimating LFMC. Applying this model to global VOD and LAI observations allows estimating LFMC globally over decadal time series at daily temporal sampling. The derived estimates of LFMC can be used to assess large-scale patterns and temporal changes in vegetation water status, drought conditions, and fire dynamics.

TI  - Anti-colonial connectivity between Islamicate movements in the Miadle East and South Asia: the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamati Islam
T2  - POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With almost every part of the Muslim world having suffered from European colonisation, the roles and relations of Islamicate movements in anti-colonial history cannot be ignored. And yet, despite intellectual overlaps, mutual opposition to British colonialism, and a shared spiritual worldview, little has been written within postcolonial studies on the historical relationship between the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jamati Islam in South Asia. I explore the link between both movements as an example of anti-colonial connectivity that transcended territory. Though disconnected by geography and language, both groups were nevertheless tied by the deep connection of a shared belief system and the common experience of British imperialism. In particular, I argue their theology was not incidental but fundamental to both their anti-colonialism and their connectivity. I consider how that connectivity and solidarity evolved through time and shifting locations, reflecting the rich inheritance not just of post-colonies, but also of diasporic communities in the imperial metropole, inhabiting liminal spaces of unbelonging who often found community via these transnational movements. The purpose of the article is a recovery of history and a recognition of (at times overlooked) anti-colonial struggles and solidarities that do not fit neatly within disciplinary postcolonial norms.

TI  - Black and Odorous Water Detection of Remote Sensing Images Based on Improved Deep Learning
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black and odorous water seriously affects the ecological balance of rivers and the health of people living nearby. Satellite remote sensing technology with its advantages of a large range, long-time series, low cost, and high efficiency, has provided a new area for water quality detection. Much archived remote sensing satellite data can be further processed and used as a data source for black and odorous water detection. In this paper, Gaofen-2 remote sensing data with a spatial resolution of 1 m is leveraged as the data source. To enrich the data source in the northern coastal zone of China, we have built a high-quality remote sensing dataset, called the remote sensing images for black and odorous water detection (RSBD) dataset, which is collected from the Gaofen-2 satellite in Yantai, China. In addition, we propose a network with an encoder-decoder discriminant structure for black and odorous water detection. In the network, an augmented attention module is designed to capture a more comprehensive semantic feature representation. Further, the median balancing loss function is adopted to solve the imbalance issues. Experimental results demonstrate that the network is superior to other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on our dataset.

TI  - Paget's disease of the breast: diagnosis and management
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Paget's disease of the breast typically affects postmenopausal women and is associated with an underlying malignancy. Skin changes are a common presenting symptom, as well as a lump, nipple discharge, pain and changes to the nipple shape. Imaging options include ultrasound for women under the age of 35 years or mammogram and ultrasound for women over the age of 40 years. The definitive diagnostic investigation is a tissue core biopsy. Cases are discussed by a multidisciplinary team to decide on the optimal management strategy. Management options are typically surgical and include breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy in addition to oncoplastic techniques. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in all patients undergoing surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or endocrine therapy can be used to treat concomitant invasive disease or ductal carcinoma in situ.

TI  - Performance evaluation of solar power plants for excess energy based on energy production
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar is future of the world's energy. It will become the leading source of energy to reduce the global energy deficit over the next two decades. In this performance analysis of the solar energy production has been examined at a LSSP (large-scale solar plant) to evaluate the theoretical excess energy (EE). The novel energy-based performance ratio (PR) is used as a performance benchmark based on solar energy production and is proposed as an industrial technique for analyzing the EE of large-scale solar projects. In order to analyze the EE, the solar plant's PR is an important PV parameter utilized by the plant operators to know the performance of solar power utility by measuring its PV performance parameters. Based on this PV performance parameter, the novel energy-based PR has been applied to determine the EE and bonus energy (BE) amount of the 100MW-Quaid-e-Azam Solar Plant (QASP) grid-connected solar project. In this case, it has been proposed a one-year onsite real-time data FY (2020-2021) for energy inputs variables such as data on PR, production, and irradiance to investigate the EE and BE. According to theoretical calculations, these energy inputs are used in an energy-based PR formula model to figure out the PR % value and how much EE or BE is remained. This paper also includes a detailed discussion of 100MW-QASP plant performance between quarterly and annual targets, and yearly performance comparisons are illustrated. At the end, the detailed information of PR, capacity factor (CF), and power generation of the plant and its comparisons with quarterly and yearly graphs are defined, as well as an overview of the difference in annual energy yield, EE, and shortfall/LD also demonstrated in the graphs.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Modelling and forecasting the effects of increasing sea surface temperature on coral bleaching in the Indo-Pacific region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coral Triangle (CT) and the South China Sea (SCS) are the world's great tropical seas, located in the Indo-Pacific (IP) region. It is home to the richest marine ecosystem on Earth, with a total of 76% reef-building coral species as well as 37% coral reef fish species. Unfortunately, this sensitive area is now vulnerable to Sea Surface Temperature (SST) warming. This research explored the possible consequences of SST warming on the rich ecosystems of the IP region, specifically on bleaching of its coral reefs. Reefbase provided coral bleaching records together with the daily NOAA AVHRR Optimum Interpolation (OI) SST V2 dataset (OISSTv2) were used to explore the relationship between coral bleaching and SST in the IP region. Three different categories of monthly mean SST were tested as potential covariates: minimum SST, mean SST and maximum SST, obtained from the OISSTv2. The fitted logistic regression (LR) model revealed a significant and large correlation between coral bleaching and annual maximum monthly mean SST in the study area using the bleaching data from an online database and the time-series of AVHRR images. Predicted maps of coral bleaching based on the LR model were highly consistent with NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) Degree heating Weeks (DHW) maps. However, some important discrepancies resulted from the more specific local fitting used in the LR model. The maximum SST was forecasted from 2020 to 2100 based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) dataset under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6) scenario. The fitted logistic regression model was employed to transform the forecasted maximum SST values into maps of the probability of coral bleaching from 2020 to 2100. The results provide considerable cause for concern, including the likelihood of widespread coral bleaching in many places in the IP region over the next 30 years.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgical Excision Using Lymphosonography
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis study evaluated the efficacy of lymphosonography in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in post neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients with breast cancer scheduled to undergo surgical excision. MethodsSeventy-nine subjects scheduled for breast cancer surgery with SLN excision completed this IRB-approved study, out of which 18 (23%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. Subjects underwent percutaneous Sonazoid (GE Healthcare) injections around the tumor area for a total of 1.0 mL. Lymphosonography was performed using CPS on an S3000 HELX scanner (Siemens Healthineers) with a linear probe. Subjects received blue dye and radioactive tracer as part of their standard of care. Excised SLNs were classified as positive or negative for the presence of blue dye, radioactive tracer and Sonazoid. The results were compared between methods and pathology findings. ResultsSeventy-two SLNs were surgically excised from 18 subjects, 29 were positive for blue dye, 63 were positive for radioactive tracer and 57 were positive for Sonazoid. Comparison with blue dye showed that both radioactive tracer and lymphosonography achieved an accuracy of 53% (P > .50). Comparison with radioactive tracer showed that blue dye had an accuracy of 53%, while lymphosonography achieved an accuracy of 67% (P < .01). Of the 72 SLNs, 15 were determined malignant by pathology; the detection rate was 47% for blue dye (7/15), 67% for radioactive tracer (10/15) and 100% for lymphosonography (15/15) (P < .001). ConclusionsLymphosonography achieved similar accuracy as radioactive tracer and higher accuracy than blue dye for identifying SLNs. The 15 SLNs positive for malignancy were all identified by lymphosonography.

TI  - Evaluation insight into Abu Zenima clay deposits as a prospective raw material source for ceramics industry: Remote Sensing and Characterization
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development and mutations have heightened ceramic industrialization to supply the countries' requirements worldwide. Therefore, the continuous exploration for new reserves of possible ceramic-raw materials is needed to overwhelm the increased demand for ceramic industries. In this study, the suitability assessment of potential applications for Upper Cretaceous (Santonian) clay deposits at Abu Zenima area, as raw materials in ceramic industries, was extensively performed. Remote sensing data were employed to map the Kaolinite-bearing formation as well as determine the additional occurrences of clay reserves in the studied area. In this context, ten representative clayey materials from the Matulla Formation were sampled and examined for their mineralogical, geochemical, morphological, physical, thermal, and plasticity characteristics. The mineralogical and chemical compositions of starting clay materials were examined. The physicochemical surface properties of the studied clay were studied utilizing SEM-EDX and TEM. The particle-size analysis confirmed the adequate characteristics of samples for white ceramic stoneware and ceramic tiles manufacturing. The technological and suitability properties of investigated clay deposits proved the industrial appropriateness of Abu Zenima clay as a potential ceramic raw material for various ceramic products. The existence of high kaolin reserves in the studied area with reasonable quality and quantity has regional significance. It would significantly help reduce the manufacturing cost and overwhelm the high consumption rate. The ceramic manufacturers in the investigated areas are expected to bring steady producers into the industry in the long term to gain the advantage of low-cost raw materials, labor, and factory construction.

TI  - Assessing the resilience of ecosystem functioning to wildfires using satellite-derived metrics of post-fire trajectories
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire disturbances can profoundly impact many aspects of both ecosystem functioning and resilience. This study proposes a satellite-based approach to assess ecosystem resilience to wildfires based on post-fire trajec-tories of four key functional dimensions of ecosystems related to carbon, water, and energy exchanges: (i) vegetation primary production; (ii) vegetation and soil water content; (iii) land surface albedo; and (iv) land surface sensible heat. For each dimension, several metrics extracted from satellite image time-series, at the short, medium and long-term, describe both resistance (the ability to withstand environmental disturbances) and re-covery (the ability to pull back towards equilibrium). We used MODIS data for 2000-2018 to analyze trajectories after the 2005 wildfires in NW Iberian Peninsula. Primary production exhibited low resistance, with abrupt breaks immediately after the fire, but rapid recoveries, starting within six months after the fire and reaching stable pre-fire levels two years after. Loss of water content after the fire showed slightly higher resistance but slower and more gradual recoveries than primary production. On the other hand, albedo exhibited varying levels of resistance and recovery, with post-fire breaks often followed by increases to levels above pre-fire within the first two years, but sometimes with effects that persisted for many years. Finally, wildfire effects on sensible heat were generally more transient, with effects starting to dissipate after one year and overall rapid recoveries. Our approach was able to successfully depict key features of post-fire processes of ecosystem functioning at different timeframes. The added value of our multi-indicator approach for analyzing ecosystem resilience to wildfires was highlighted by the independence and complementarity among the proposed indicators targeting four dimensions of ecosystem functioning. We argue that such approaches can provide an enhanced characterization of ecosystem resilience to disturbances, ultimately upholding promising implications for post-fire ecosystem management and targeting different dimensions of ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Near-term forecasting of cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms in lakes using simple univariate methods with satellite remote sensing data
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-term forecasting of cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms (HABs) in lakes is essential to reduce risks to human and animal health and water treatment. Cyanobacteria forecasting models are typically complex, requiring input of biophysical and chemical measurements or DNA sequencing in situ. Satellite imagery presents a unique opportunity to estimate cyanobacteria concentration directly at low cost and over wide spatial and long timescales. This study explores the hypothesis that simple univariate forecasting methods can reliably forecast cyanobacterial blooms in the near-term (1 week ahead) detected using satellite remote sensing. A simple univariate model based on logical decomposition with a moving average and seasonal component was developed to forecast chlorophyll a concentrations from cyanobacteria and algal blooms in lakes using spatially aggregated satellite remotely sensed data. A small test set of 15 spatially distributed waterbodies was used to assess forecast performance on 1-week, 2-week, and 4-week forecast horizons using a year-long hold-out time series. For a 1-week time horizon, cyanobacterial blooms posing a high health risk could be forecast with 80% accuracy. The 2-week and 4-week forecast accuracy dropped to 71% and 69%, respectively. Forecast performance was only weakly influenced by lake size, suggesting that the spatial-aggregation approach may be valid even for large lakes. Additionally, longer time series reduced the observed forecast error, presumably because of better seasonal characterization. This study is the first to demonstrate that simple univariate models with remotely sensed time series can forecast cyanobacteria and HABs with almost the same reliability as complex models.

TI  - Multi-Source Remote Sensing Based Modeling of Vegetation Productivity in the Boreal: Issues &amp; Opportunities
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the processes driving terrestrial vegetation productivity dynamics in boreal ecosystems is critical for accurate assessments of carbon dynamics. Monitoring these dynamics typically requires a fusion of broad-scale remote sensing observations, climate information and other geospatial data inputs, which often have unknown errors, are difficult to obtain, or limit spatial and temporal resolutions of productivity estimates. The past decade has seen notable advances in technologies and the diversity of observed wavelengths from remote sensing instruments, offering new insights on vegetation carbon dynamics. In this communication, we review key current approaches for modeling terrestrial vegetation productivity, followed by a discussion on new remote sensing instruments and derived products including Sentinel-3 Land Surface Temperature, freeze & thaw state from the Soil Moisture & Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, and soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We outline how these products can improve the spatial detail and temporal representation of boreal productivity estimates driven entirely by a fusion of remote sensing observations. We conclude with a demonstration of how these different elements can be integrated across key land cover types in the Hudson plains, an extensive wetland-dominated region of the Canadian boreal, and provide recommendations for future model development.Il est essentiel de comprendre les processus regissant la dynamique de la productivite de la vegetation terrestre des ecosystemes boreaux pour pouvoir evaluer avec precision les flux de carbone. Le suivi de cette dynamique necessite la fusion d'observations de teledetection a grande echelle, d'informations climatiques, et d'autres donnees geospatiales, lesquelles comportent des erreurs inconnues, sont difficiles a obtenir, et limitent les resolutions spatiales et temporelles des estimations de la productivite. Au cours de la derniere decennie, des progres technologiques notables ont diversifie les longueurs d'onde observees par les instruments de teledetection, ce qui a permis de mieux comprendre la dynamique du carbone liee a la vegetation. Dans cette communication, nous passons en revue les principales approches pour la modelisation de la productivite de la vegetation terrestre, suivies d'une discussion sur les nouveaux instruments de teledetection et leurs produits derives, notamment la temperature de la surface terrestre extraite de Sentinel-3, l'etat de gel ou de degel du sol derive de la mission SMOS, et l'humidite du sol derivee de la mission SMAP. Nous decrivons comment ces produits peuvent ameliorer le detail spatial et la representation temporelle des estimations de la productivite boreale entierement basees sur une fusion d'observations de teledetection. Nous concluons par une demonstration de la facon dont ces differents elements peuvent etre integres dans les principaux types de couverture terrestre des plaines hudsoniennes, une vaste region de la foret boreale canadienne dominee par des zones humides, et nous formulons des recommandations pour de futures ameliorations du modele.

TI  - Beyond the Environmental Kuznets Curve: An Empirical Study Taking China's Poverty Alleviation Campaign as a Quasi-Experiment
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty-stricken areas in China have the dual task of alleviating poverty and safeguarding national ecological security. Based on statistical surveys and satellite remote sensing data, we construct a staggered difference-in-difference model to empirically analyze the dual impact of poverty alleviation on the economic development and eco-environment of poverty-stricken areas. This study also examines viable pathways for economic development in poor areas in the context of ecological conservation. The results show that the poverty eradication campaign under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has significantly improved the rate of economic growth in poverty-stricken areas while also significantly improving the quality of the local eco-environment. Further analysis shows that ecological projects and ecological compensation make the greatest contribution to promoting the conversion of ecological resources into economic output in poverty-stricken areas. China's successful experience in green poverty alleviation can not only provide important policy enlightenment for the nation's continuation of its comprehensive revitalization drive in rural areas, but also provide new options for other developing countries to achieve their green take-off.

TI  - Assessing the Parameterization of RADARSAT-2 Dual-polarized ScanSAR Scenes on the Accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network for Sea Ice Classification: Case Study over Coronation Gulf, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic amplification has many impacts on sea-ice extent, thickness, and flux. It becomes critical to monitor sea-ice conditions at finer spatio-temporal resolution. We used a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) on the RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized ScanSAR wide archive available over Coronation Gulf, Canada, to assess which SAR parameter improves model performances to classify sea ice from water on a large volume of data covering 11 years of ice and surface water conditions. An overall accuracy of 90.1% was achieved on 989 scenes of 100% ice cover or ice-free conditions. An accuracy of 86.3% was achieved on the last year of data (134 scenes) which was kept out of the training process to test the model on an independent dataset. A better accuracy is obtained at lower incidence angles and the HH polarization provides the most information to classify ice from water. To achieve the best accuracy, the incidence angle and the noise equivalent sigma-nought had to be included as input to the model. A comparison done with the ASI passive microwave product shows similar errors in total sea ice concentration when using the Canadian Ice Service regional charts as reference. Nonetheless, errors from both datasets differ and the CNN outputs show greater potential to reduce masked areas, given the better spatial resolution, enabling data classification closer to land and identify features not captured by the ASI dataset.L'amplification arctique a eu de nombreux impacts sur l'etendue, l'epaisseur et le flux de la glace de mer. Il devient critique de surveiller les conditions des glaces de mer a une resolution spatio-temporelle plus fine. Nous avons utilise un simple reseau neuronal convolutif (CNN) sur l'archive ScanSAR a double polarization RADARSAT-2 disponible sur le golfe du Couronnement, Canada, pour evaluer quels parametres RSO ameliorent les performances du modele pour separer la glace de mer de l'eau sur un grand volume de donnees couvrant 11 ans. Une precision globale de 90,1% a ete obtenue sur 989 scenes de couverture de glace a 100% ou de conditions sans glace. Une precision de 86,3% a ete obtenue sur la derniere annee de donnees (134 scenes) qui a ete tenue a l'ecart du processus d'entrainement pour tester le modele sur un ensemble de donnees independant. Une meilleure precision est obtenue a des angles d'incidence plus faibles et la polarisation HH fournit le plus d'informations pour distinguer la glace de l'eau. Pour obtenir la meilleure precision, l'angle d'incidence et l'equivalent de bruit sigma-zero ont du etre inclus comme intrants au modele. Une comparaison avec le produit de concentration de glace de mer ASI derivees des micro-ondes passives montre des erreurs similaires dans la concentration totale de glace de mer lors de l'utilisation des cartes regionales du Service canadien des glaces comme reference. Neanmoins, les erreurs des deux ensembles de donnees different et les sorties CNN montrent un plus grand potentiel pour reduire les zones masquees, pour permettre une classification des glaces plus proche de la terre ferme et identifier des caracteristiques non prises en compte par les produits ASI.

TI  - Building profile reconstruction based on double subspace TomoSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) is an attractive technology for the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of buildings through multiple coherent SAR images. This technique can overcome the limitations of interferometry in multi-scatterer resolution and play a significant role in the analysis of urban areas. The robustness of the many advanced nonparametric spectral estimation approaches is founded on a high number of observations. In this work, we evaluate the abilities of five nonparametric spectral estimation methods, including double subspace (DS), maximum entropy (ME), minimum norm (MN), Capon, and beamforming (BF), to separate scattering contributions with a small number of SAR images in the tomographic reconstruction of urban environments. DS is a high-resolution estimator based on the existence of non-uniform noise, which assesses the noise subspace via eigendecomposition of some appropriately designed matrix without comprehending the noise covariance matrix. The study results indicate that DS can distinguish the scatterers in one azimuth-range resolution and satisfactorily dissuade the appearance of unpleasant side lobes. To investigate the effectiveness of DS and compare that with other expressed methods, both simulated and real SAR datasets were acquired from TerraSAR-X strip-map images of the city of Tehran, Iran. The experimental results on real SAR images demonstrate that the DS can remarkably enhance building reconstruction in the urban environment. The estimated height of the scatters utilizing the DS technique is similar to the data obtained from ground observations.

TI  - Inter-comparison of optical and SAR-based forest disturbance warning systems in the Amazon shows the potential of combined SAR-optical monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half a decade after the launch of the Sentinel-1A C-band SAR satellite, several near real-time forest disturbances detection systems based on backscattering time series analysis have been developed and made operational. Every system has its own particular approach to change detection. Here, we have compared the performance of the main SAR-based near real-time operational forest disturbance detection systems produced by research agencies (INPE, in Brazil, CESBIO, in France, JAXA, in Japan, and Wageningen University, in the Netherlands), and compared them to the state-of-the-art optical algorithm, University of Maryland's GLAD-S2. We implemented an innovative validation protocol, specially conceived to encompass all the analysed systems, which measured every system's accuracy and detection speed in four different areas of the Amazon basin. The results indicated that, when parametrized equally, all the Sentinel-1 SAR methods outperformed the reference optical method in terms of sample-count F1-Score, having comparable results among them. The GLAD-S2 optical method showed superior results in terms of user's accuracy (UA), issuing no false detections, but had a lower producer accuracy (PA, 84.88%) when compared to the Sentinel-1 SAR-based systems (PA,90%). Wageningen University's system, RADD, proved to be relatively faster, especially in heavily clouded regions, where RADD warnings were issued 41 days before optical ones, and the one that better performs on small disturbed patches (< 0.25 ha) with a UA of 70.11%. Of all the high-resolution SAR methods, CESBIO's had the best results regarding UA (99.0%). Finally, we tested the potential of three hypothetical combined optical-SAR systems. The results show that these combined systems would have excellent detection capabilities, exceeding largely the producer's accuracy of all the tested methods at the cost of a slightly diminished user's accuracy, and constitute a promising and feasible approach for the forthcoming forest monitoring systems.

TI  - Science diplomacy on display: mobile atomic exhibitions in the cold war: Introduction to Special Issue
T2  - ANNALS OF SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Despite the increasing interest in science exhibitions, there has been hardly any work on mobile science exhibitions and their role within science diplomacy - a gap this thematic issue is meant to fill. Atomic mobile exhibitions are seen here not only as cultural sites but as multifaceted strategic processes of transnational nuclear history. We move beyond the bipolar Cold War history that portrays propagandist science exhibitions as instances of a one-way communication employed to promote the virtues of the two major and conflicting political powers. Instead, Science Diplomacy on Display follows mobile atomic exhibitions as they move across national borders and around the world, functioning as spaces for diplomatic encounters. Exhibitions play a vital role not only in the production of knowledge and the formation of political worldviews but also as assets in diplomatic negotiations and as promoters of a new worldview in which nuclear stands at the centre. They are powerful iconic diplomatic devices, that is systems of representations that capture the diplomatic processes in action and make the nitty-gritty details of international relations visible. This issue seeks to trace the multiple and often contradictory meanings that mobile exhibitions took on for various actors.

TI  - The perceived link between dreams and the spiritual life: An exploratory qualitative survey
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent gains in the understanding of dreams and their meaning, the topic of dreams in relation to spirituality has remained largely unexplored. This study investigates the perceived relationship between dreams and the spiritual life in a multi-national sample. It explores the proposition that dreams contain spiritual messages or realisations, and/or whether experiences of apparently paranormal phenomena in dreams inform a spiritual worldview. A sample of 118 people took part in an online survey in which they responded to closed-ended and open-ended questions about dreams, learning, personal development and spirituality. Ninety-eight out of 118 participants (83%) reported having dreams that informed their spiritual life in some way. Thematic analysis revealed four themes within the domain of dreams and spirituality: 1. Bringing the unconscious into the conscious for healing and insight; 2. Accessing spiritual knowledge via intuition and feeling; 3. Spiritual Messages via encounters with other beings in dreams; and 4. Spiritual messages as precognitive information about upcoming events. The findings have implications for an understanding of the formative role of dreams in the spiritual life. Limitations and future implications of this study are also discussed.

TI  - Model-Based Data Augmentation Applied to Deep Learning Networks for Classification of Micro-Doppler Signatures Using FMCW Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a relevant subject in the classification of radio frequency signals and remote sensing data. A primary challenge is a tradeoff between obtaining data that are suitable for DNN training and the effort that making experimental measurements requires. Hence, the quality and quantity of data used for the training and testing of models are crucial for effective classifier development. The training dataset should cover a wide range of cases that synthesize the actual scenarios being classified. This work proposes a novel data augmentation method based on a deterministic model to generate a simulated dataset of radar micro-Doppler signatures suitable for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target classification, without requiring measurement data. It is shown that the DNN trained using the properly generated model-based data offers improved classification accuracy performance. Results are presented for a two-class classification of the number of UAV motors using a 77-GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) automotive radar system. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proven: a classification accuracy of 78.68% is achieved using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using the synthetic dataset, while an accuracy of 66.18% is achieved by using a typical signal processing data augmentation method on a limited measured dataset.

TI  - Reflections on KPD Maphalla's poetry: political, spiritual and social perspectives
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AFRICAN LANGUAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the poetry of KPD Maphalla as a distinguished creative writer who left his footprint on African literature, Basotho literature in particular. His creative writings has brought significant changes in the lives of Africans who found hope in poetry. His creative writing reflects an African worldview because his poetry is like a mirror that Africans can hold up to look at themselves. It a mirror that shows them who they have been and who they are now. His artistic expression gave Africans a voice, and his creative works are viewed as having a positive impact in many societies. Maphalla's creative art played an important role in the social and cultural development of the Basotho community, and his creative expressions in different genres expressed the political, spiritual, historical as well as social concerns for his people. His creative writing covers dimensions such as political, historical, and sociological issues. For this article, both thematic discourse analysis and multiplicity of meaning will be employed as guiding frameworks to examine Maphalla's poetry under discussion.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Thermal Fronts in Relation to Potential Fishing Zones in the Continental Shelf Sea Around India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mapping the thermal fronts is one of the important near-real-time applications of high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) retrieved from the infrared satellite sensors such as MODIS and AVHRR to help in demarcating the areas of the potential fishing zone (PFZ). The thermal fronts are considered a proxy for the identification of PFZ from numerous studies. However, the complexity of the region and persistent cloud cover generate huge data gaps in SST images, making it challenging to provide thermal front information on a daily and synoptic scale. To overcome such difficulties, we use gap-free and blended Global 1 km SST (G1SST) products with MODIS SST to understand the inherent relationship between the datasets and their coherency to resolve spatiotemporal characteristics at a daily scale. In this regard, an edge detection algorithm developed by Cayula and Cornillon (1992) has been implemented to extract the thermal fronts from the SST datasets during 2014-2020. The algorithm is modified to suit Indian coastal oceans corresponding to MODIS SST and G1SST to resolve thermal gradients based on sensitivity experiments related to satellite-measured Chlorophyll-a and primary productivity datasets. We found that the gradient value of 0.075 & DEG;C/km is suitable for MODIS, while a relatively weaker value of 0.07 & DEG;C/km for the G1SST. The weekly composite datasets of thermal front density (TFD) generated from the daily time series during the study period have been used in the least square-based harmonic analysis to investigate their observed seasonality in the continental shelf region of India. Simulation and analysis from a high-resolution ocean general circulation model have been used to investigate circulation features and associated topographic modulation for elucidating causes of the high-persistent thermal front regimes and their intra-seasonal dynamics.

TI  - Characterizing Tree Species in Northern Boreal Forests Using Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis and Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern boreal forests are characterized by open stands whereby trees, understory background, and shadow are all significant components of the spectral response within a pixels' spatial footprint. To overcome this mixed pixel problem, accurate spectral characterization of these (endmember) components is necessary for spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to generate forest classifications at the species level. Obtaining these endmember spectra in the field, however, can be difficult or impossible. This study examined whether image endmember spectra can be identified using forest inventory information to derive dominant tree species classifications. This was tested using multiple-endmember SMA (MESMA) and single- and multi-date Landsat imagery of a forested area in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Image classifications (n = 80) were generated based on 20 image-date combinations and four unmixing models. Accuracies of 80% and 82% were achieved for open and medium dense forest stands, respectively using multi-date imagery, which outperformed single-date imagery acquired at peak phenology. The overall accuracy is 72%; lower due to challenges in very open stands. The multi-date MESMA approach was robust for both compositionally pure and mixed stands. The approach merits further investigation, particularly within the context of the increasing availability of regional-scale satellite imagery enabling composite time-series and spectral-temporal image features.

TI  - Radarsat Constellation Mission Derived Winter Glacier Velocities for the St. Elias Icefield, Yukon/Alaska: 2022 and 2023
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we use high resolution (5 m) Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) imagery acquired in winters 2022 and 2023 to determine motion across glaciers of the St. Elias Icefield in Yukon/Alaska. Our regional velocity mapping largely conforms with previous studies, with faster motion (>600 m/yr) for the glaciers originating in the Yukon that drain southward and westward to the coast of Alaska and relatively slower motion (100-400 m/yr) for the land terminating glaciers that drain eastward and northeastward and stay within the Yukon. We also identify two new glacier surges within the icefields: the surge of Naluday (Lowell) Glacier in Winter 2022, and Chitina Glacier in Winter 2023, and track the progression of each surge from January to March utilizing similar to 4-day repeat RCM imagery. To evaluate the quality of RCM-derived velocities, we compare our results with 50 simultaneous measurements at three on-ice dGPS stations located on two Yukon glaciers and find the average absolute difference between measurements to be 6.6 m/yr. Our results demonstrate the utility of RCM data to determine glacier motion across large regions with complex topography, to support process-based studies of fast flowing and surge-type glaciers and continue the legacy of velocity products derived from the Radarsat-2 mission.

TI  - Coupling of deep learning and remote sensing: a comprehensive systematic literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study is conducted in accordance with a systematic literature review (SLR) protocol. SLR is tasked with finding publications, publishers, deep learning types, enhanced and adapted deep learning techniques, impacts, proactive approaches, key parameters, and applications in the field of remote sensing. It is also expected to identify current research directions, gaps, and unsolved issues in order to provide understanding and recommendations for future studies. The data is collected from important research papers published in recognized journals between the years 2015 and 2021, however, conference/seminar proceedings and other online resources are excluded to minimize unnecessary complications. Based on previously established exclusion, inclusion, and quality parameter criteria, a total of 122 primary studies are considered. The literature review overcomes a number of significant problems, including key variables taken into account by researchers in the remote sensing (RS) domain, various deep learning (DL) solutions proposed for RS analysis, various proactive strategies recommended in the literature to reduce risks linked to the RS domain, and various DL applications reported in the remote sensing domain. The results show that there is still a lack of structured information that enables DL to be employed for crucial applications in the field of remote sensing, despite substantial research and development of numerous DL algorithms. Furthermore, it is evident that DL approaches in the remote sensing domain have not been thoroughly exploited, thus demanding further research. The findings suggest that deep learning techniques need further investigations and the development of an authentic mechanism is essential for accurate results retrieved from remote sensing data. The proposed study would let scientists examine previous investigations into deep learning methods, which can then be utilized as support for further investigations.

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping in breast cancer: Anoverview.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Standard operative management for breast carcinoma has significantly shifted from extensive procedures to minor interventions.Although axillary dissection was a fundamental component of operative management, sentinel biopsy is an actual process for axillary staging. Axillary dissection may be postponed for cases that have negative SLNs or 1 or 2 infiltrated lymph nodes undergoing breast or axillary radiation. Contrarily, axillary dissection is still the conventional management for patients with clinically positive nodes.Arm lymphedema is a frequent and overwhelming complication of axillary dissection, with a worse impact on the patient's life.Axillary reverse mapping was recently introduced to map and conserve the lymph drain of the upper limb throughout axillary dissection or sentinel biopsy. A technique based on the theory that the breast's lymphatic drainage differs from those that drain the arm, so preserving lymphatic drainage of the upper limb can prevent lymphedema, thereby not raising the risk of axillary recurrence.Therefore, this technique is the reverse of sentinel biopsy, which remove the lymph nodes that drain the breast.

AB  - Planted forests are critical to climate change mitigation and constitute a major supplier of timber/non-timber products and other ecosystem services. Globally, approximately 36% of planted forest area is located in East Asia. However, reliable records of the geographic distribution and tree species composition of these planted forests remain very limited. Here, based on extensive in situ and remote sensing data, as well as an ensemble modeling approach, we present the first spatial database of planted forests for East Asia, which consists of maps of the geographic distribution of planted forests and associated dominant tree genera. Of the predicted planted forest areas in East Asia (948,863km2), China contributed 87%, most of which is located in the lowland tropical/subtropical regions, and Sichuan Basin. With 95% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.77, our spatially-continuous maps of planted forests enable accurate quantification of the role of planted forests in climate change mitigation. Our findings inform effective decision-making in forest conservation, management, and global restoration projects.

TI  - Integration of Landsat-8 and Reflectance Spectroscopy data for Mapping of Late Neoproterozoic Igneous Ring Complexes in an Arid Environment: a Case Study of Gebel El-Bakriyah Area, Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work aims to enhance the utilization of Landsat-8 data in geological mapping when they are paired with spectroscopic measurements and field observations. This is applied to map and differentiate the different plutonic rocks in the Gebel El-Bakriyah pluton, a peculiar igneous body in the central Eastern Desert of Egypt. Therefore, we use a combination of remote sensing techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), band ratios, fusion technique, and spectroscopic measurements to interpret igneous lithologies, and produce a new geologic map of the Gebel El-Bakriyah area. A false-color composite principal component image PC1, PC2, and PC3 in red, green, and blue (RGB) discriminates between alkali feldspar granite, syenogranite, and younger gabbro. In general, the spectral profiles of granites exhibit three distinct absorption features in the 1.4, 1.9, and 2.2 mu m wavelength regions. These features are attributed mainly to altered mineral products such as kaolinite, sericite, and chlorite. The spectral profiles of pink and alkali feldspar granites show a broad absorption feature at 0.9 mu m, which is attributed to a considerable Fe content. The spectral profiles of fresh, younger gabbros exhibit absorption features around 1 mu m and 2.2 mu m. A false-color composite image provides the most accurate discrimination of the three varieties of younger granites with band ratios of 7/4, 6/3, and 3/1 in RGB. The data that appear in the present work strengthen the usefulness of Landsat-8 imagery and spectroscopic measurements as a prevailing grouping to discriminate and map Neoproterozoic shield rocks in the Eastern Desert of Egypt.

TI  - Responses to pathogen exposure in sentinel juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River, CA
T2  - CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated how the deployment of juvenile Chinook salmon in ambient river conditions and the subsequent exposure to and infection by pathogens was associated with the changes in the expression of genes involved in immune system functioning, general stress and host development. Juvenile fish were deployed in sentinel cages for 21 days in the Sacramento River, CA, USA. Gill, kidney and intestinal tissue were sampled at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days post-deployment. Pathogen detection and host response were assessed by a combination of molecular and histopathological evaluation. Our findings showed that fish became infected by the parasites Ceratonova shasta, Parvicapsula minibicornis and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, and to a lesser extent, the bacteria Flavobacterium columnare and Rickettsia-like organisms. Co-infection was common among sentinel fish. Expression of investigated genes was altered following deployment and was often associated with pathogen abundance. This study provides a foundation for future avenues of research investigating pathogens that affect out-migrating Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River, and offers crucial knowledge related to conservation efforts.

TI  - Integration of RUSLE Model, Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Assessing Soil Erosion Hazards in Arid Zones
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion constitutes one of the main environmental and food security threats, derived from the loss of its productive capacity. With the help of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and a revised version of the universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), this research has mostly focused on measuring the potential soil erosion hazard and soil water conservation ratio (SWCR) in the El-Minia region of Egypt. Based on the integration of S2A images and the digital elevation model (DEM), geomorphological units of the study area were identified. The RUSLE model includes parameters that allow for mapping soil erosion, such as rain erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, soil cover and management, and soil conservation practices. The outcomes revealed that the classes of annual erosion rates of the study area are those of "slight erosion", "low erosion", "moderate erosion" and "moderately high erosion", which represent percentages of 29%, 18%, 33% and 20%, respectively, of the total area. The rate of erosion decreases from east to west. The main erosion factors in the research area are the low vegetation cover and the high slope values. This study highlights the utility of combining the classic RUSLE equation with techniques such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) as a basis for assessing current erosion conditions in arid environments and, specifically, for the application of soil management patterns aimed at increasing soil organic matter and any other soil conservation actions. The findings of this study can be used by policymakers to implement soil conservation measures if development projects are to proceed in areas with a high risk of soil erosion. The approach described here is therefore adaptable to similar environments in arid regions.

TI  - Authentication for Satellite Communication Systems Using Physical Characteristics
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite communication networks have gained a lot of attention recently as a solution to mitigate the limitations of terrestrial networks such as stability and coverage. However, integrating satellite and terrestrial networks makes the system more vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Thus, robust and effective authentication is required. Physical layer authentication (PLA) has emerged as an alternative paradigm that uses physical characteristics to achieve authentication. In this paper, PLA is proposed for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites using the Doppler frequency shift (DS) and received power (RP) characteristics. Hypothesis testing using a threshold or machine learning (ML) is considered to discriminate between legitimate and illegitimate satellites. For ML, a one-class classification support vector machine (OCC-SVM) is employed which uses training data from only legitimate users. The performance is evaluated using real satellite data from the system tool kit (STK). Results are presented which show that the authentication rate (AR) with DS is higher than with RP at low elevation angles for both schemes, but is higher with RP at high elevation angles. Further, the ML authentication scheme provides a higher AR than the threshold scheme for a small percentage of the training data considered as outliers, but at larger percentages the OR threshold scheme is better.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Degradation and Hazards of Some Heavy Metals, Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques in the Northern Part of the Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation and pollution is one of the main problems threatening the sustainable development of agriculture. This study used remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to assess the risks of soil degradation and the risks of heavy metals in some soils north of the Nile Delta. The study area suffers from salinity, alkalinity, and water logging, so a spatial degradation model was used. Relying on landsat ETM+ images and the digital elevation model (DEM), it was possible to produce a geomorphological map, and it showed that the studied area consists of two landscapes, i.e., flood plain and lacustrine plain. The results indicated that salinization, alkalization, compaction, and water logging were the main types of soil degradation in the studied area. The spatial land degradation model showed that 16.61% of soils were affected by low degrees of degradation, 74.03% were affected by moderate degrees, and 9.36% were affected by high degrees of degradation. The studied area was affected by chemical degradation risks between low and high at 90.62% and 9.37%, respectively, while the physical degradation risks varied between low, moderate, high, and very high with percentages of 9.37%, 41.53%, 40.14%, and 8.93%, respectively. The environmental risks of heavy metals were assessed in the studied area using pollution indices including, the enrichment factor (EF), the pollution load index (PLI), and the potential ecological risk index (PER).

TI  - Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma of the breast: A rare case presentation.
T2  - Journal of cancer research and therapeutics
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma of the breast is a rare variant of metaplastic mammary carcinoma. It shows indolent behavior contrary to the usual aggressive nature of metaplastic carcinomas and has a good prognosis despite being triple negative. Recurrence rates tend to be high and a consequence of incomplete excision. Although this variant has an infiltrative growth pattern, owing to its bland cytologic features, it is liable to be confused with benign sclerosing adenotic breast lesions. We present here a case of a 55-year-old postmenopausal female, who presented with a painless, mobile, hard, and nontender lump in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast, with normal overlying skin and nipple-areola complex. No associated axillary lymphadenopathy was seen. On mammography, a high-density mass of architectural distortion, characterized as BIRADS category 4C, was found. Core-needle biopsy showed haphazard glands lined by a double layer of epithelium and nests of squamoid cells arranged in an infiltrative fashion within a fibromyxoid stroma. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells showed a lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptor and were positive for CK 5/6 and CK7. There was counterintuitive, but characteristic positivity for myoepithelial markers calponin and CD 10 around the neoplastic nests and stromal cells expressed smooth muscle myosin. Subsequently, the patient underwent a wide local excision with free margins and sentinel lymph nodes were negative for tumor deposits. This patient remains well and free of recurrence well into follow-up.

TI  - Digital Twin of Atmospheric Environment: Sensory Data Fusion for High-Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation and Action Policies Recommendation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is one of the main pollutants that has considerable detrimental effects on human health. Estimating its concentration levels with ground monitors is inefficient for several reasons. In this study, we build a digital twin (DT) of an atmospheric environment by fusing remote sensing and observational data. An integral part of the DT pipeline is the presence of feedback that can influence future input data. Estimated values of PM2.5 obtained from an ensemble of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are used to provide recommendations for decreasing the agglomeration levels. We formulate a simple optimization problem for suggesting the recommendations and identify possible action policies, such as cloud seeding, scheduling of air filtering, and SMS notifications. The PM2.5 estimation part of the proposed DT pipeline has achieved RMSE and R-2 of 38.94 and 0.728 (95%, CI 0.717-0.740). In addition, we investigate different approaches for quantitatively examining the contribution of each independent variable.

T2  - HASER-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE FILOSOFIA APLICADA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper will demonstrate how philosophical counselling would invaluably contribute to the arena of conflict resolution via mediation and civil justice generally. Mediation is a conflict resolution process that involves a third party who facilitates disputants in arriving at a self-determined resolution. This process is being incorporated into civil justice systems globally, but how mediation should be conducted to achieve truly just outcomes needs immediate and thoughtful attention. At its best, mediation empowers parties to co-create a just and fair resolution to their conflict through a dialogical exploration of their interests, needs, and relevant norms and values.1 This is dramatically different from the adjudicative process, where parties rely on legal frameworks and authoritative judicial decision-making to resolve conflict. In mediation, parties need to recognize and think critically about their worldviews and values. Philosophical counseling can provide mediators with an empathetic and dialogical method of helping parties think critically and rationally and to cultivate clarity, depth, and coherence in their worldview and value system.2 Enabling such deepened self-understanding would best empower participants to engage in authentic and critical dialogue, which, I argue, is essential to legitimate mediation that leads to just outcomes. This paper will demonstrate how several essential principles of philosophical counselling align precisely with the values, goals, and needs of just mediation (including deep self-understanding, critical awareness of worldviews/values, and propensity for rational dialogue). This paper lays an introductory foundation, ultimately calling for an interdisciplinary/interprofessional approach that would use the insights of philosophical counseling to bring significant benefits to the development of mediation programs and civil justice systems world-wide.

TI  - Road Network Planning in Tropical Forests Using GIS
T2  - CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study intended to develop a road network planning for timber harvesting in tropical forests in Peru using georeferenced and field data and Geographic Information System (GIS). The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Alos Palsar 12.5 m was used. The DEM was processed to generate the hydrography and terrain slope maps. A weighted raster was created using overlapping weights of the slope raster and the hydrography map. We created a least cost path raster by using the weighted raster origin and destination points. We used a Triangular Ir-regular Network (TIN) to validate the Least Cost Path. In addition, histograms of the trajec-tory of each path with altitude and slope values were generated. We observed that the forest road planning using GIS provided better definition (economically and environmentally) of road networks in our forest site than those traditionally defined using conventional mapping techniques.

TI  - Detection of Land-Use Change and Rapid Recovery of Vegetation after Deforestation in the Congo Basin
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo Basin is severely understudied compared to other tropical regions; this is partly due to the lack of meteorological stations and the ubiquitous cloudiness hampering the use of remote sensing products. Clustering of small-scale agricultural deforestation events within the basin may result in deforestation on scales that are atmospherically important. This study uses 500-m MODIS data and the Global Forest Change dataset (GFC) to detect deforestation at a monthly and subkilometer scale and to quantify how deforestation impacts vegetation proxies (VPs) within the basin, the time scales over which these changes persist, and how they are affected by the deforestation driver. Missing MODIS data meant that a new method, based on two-date image differencing, was developed to detect deforestation on a monthly scale. Evaluation against the yearly GFC data shows that the highest detection rate was 79% for clearing sizes larger than 500 m2. Recovery to predeforestation levels occurred faster than expected; analysis of postdeforestation evolution of the VPs found 66% of locations recovered within a year. Separation by land-cover type also showed unexpected regrowth, as over 50% of rural complex and plantation land recovered within a year. The fallow period in the study region was typically short; by the sixth year after the initial deforestation event, -88% of the locations underwent a further considerable drop. These results show the importance of fine spatial and temporal information to assess Congo Basin deforestation and highlight the large differences in the impacts of land-use change compared to other rain forests.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Synthetic Aperture Radar Complex Data by Deep-Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the greatest limitations of Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery is the capability to obtain an arbitrarily high spatial resolution. Indeed, despite optical sensors, this capability is not just limited by the sensor technology. Instead, improving the SAR spatial resolution requires large transmitted bandwidth and relatively long synthetic apertures that for regulatory and practical reasons are impossible to be met. This issue gets particularly relevant when dealing with Stripmap mode acquisitions and with low carrier frequency sensors (where relatively large bandwidth signals are more difficult to be transmitted). To overcome this limitation, in this paper a deep learning based framework is proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of low-resolution SAR images while retaining the complex image accuracy. Results on simulated and real SAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TI  - A Comparison between Supervised Classification Methods: Study Case on Land Cover Change Detection Caused by a Hydroelectric Complex Installation in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Volta Grande do Xingu (VGX) in the Amazon Forest of Brazil was chosen to analyze the land use and land cover changes (LULCC) from 2000 to 2017, with the aim of assessing the most suitable classification method for the area. Three parametric (Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood and minimum distance) and three non-parametric (neural net, random forest and support vector machine) classification algorithms were tested in two Landsat scenes. The accuracy assessment was evaluated through a confusion matrix. Change detection of the landscape was analyzed through the post-classification comparison method. While maximum likelihood was more capable of highlighting errors in individual classes, support vector machine was slightly superior when compared with the other non-parametric options, these being the most suitable classifiers within the scope of this study. The main changes detected in the landscape were from forest to agro-pasture, from forest/agro-pasture to river, and from river to non-river, resulting in rock exposure. The methodology outlined in this research highlights the usefulness of remote sensing tools in follow-up observations of LULCC in the study area (with the possibility of application to the entire Amazon rainforest). Thus, it is possible to carry out adaptive management that aims to minimize unforeseen or underestimated impacts in previous stages of environmental licensing.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate potential archaeological proxies at a large Bronze Age fortification in Hungary, namely the Csanadpalota-Juhasz T. tanya site, using open-access satellite data. Available Sentinel-2 images acquired between April 2017 and September 2022 were used. More than 700 images (727) were initially processed and filtered, accounting at the end of more than 400 (412) available calibrated Level 2A Sentinel images over the case study area. Sentinel-2 images were processed through image analysis. Based on pan-sharpened data, the visibility of crop marks was improved and enhanced by implementing orthogonal equations. Several crop marks, some still unknown, were revealed in this study. In addition, multi-temporal phenological observations were recorded on three archaeological proxies (crop marks) within the case study area, while an additional area was selected for calibration purposes (agricultural field). Phenological observations were performed for at least four complete phenological cycles throughout the study period. Statistical comparisons between the selected archaeological proxies were applied using a range of vegetation indices. The overall results indicated that phenological observations could be used as archaeological proxies for detecting the formation of crop marks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has been a major public health concern requiring continuous efforts for understanding its epidemiology. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a wide range of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild or severe illness with fatal outcomes or recovery. Population-based seroepidemiological studies are an effective method for measuring the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring the pandemic's progress.Methods We conducted repeated cross-sectional community-based sentinel surveillance between January and June 2021 in the rural parts of the Pune district of Maharashtra, India to assess the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in three age categories. We selected 30 clusters for each round using a proportional population sampling method and 30 individuals in each of the three age groups (1-17 years, 18-49 years, and >= 50 years). We took blood samples from consenting study participants to check for the presence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all five rounds.Results We included 14 274 individuals across five rounds; 29% were from the 1-17, 39% from the 18-49, and 32% from the >= 50-year-old group. Overall seroprevalence combining all rounds was 45%. There was an increase in seropositivity in rounds four (51.15%) and five (58.32%) contributed mostly by adults. We found that about 72% of elderly individuals >= 50 years in round five were seropositive. The factors strongly associated with the seropositivity were being in contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) = 7.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.2-12.14), receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 3.13 (95% CI = 0.70-14.07), being aged >= 50 years (OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.81-2.15), and being in an occupation belonging to a high-risk category (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.65-2.26). Among 135 hospitalizations reported due to COVID-19-like illness, 91 (67%) were in the elderly age group of >= 50 and 33 (24%) were in the 18-49-year-old age group.Conclusions Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was high in the last two rounds (April to June 2021) which coincide with the second wave of the pandemic (Delta variant B.1.617.2) in India. Overall, one in three children and one in two adults had antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. The suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 emerged as the significant factor strongly associated with the seropositivity followed by COVID-19 vaccination.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study monthly Temperature Lapse Rates and basic downscaling technique of subtracting means are used to construct temperature (T) series over East Rathong glacier by using multiple data sets from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) at Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI), Gangtok Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Yuksum and ERA5reanalysis data. Precipitation (P) over glacier is estimated using Gangtok IMD data and downscaled ERA5 data. The P data is downscaled using local scaling factor method. Change in volume of 0.180 km3(from 1962 to 2020) estimated using satellite data are used to construct Mass Balance (MB) series for the glacier. It is observed that the glacier is losing its mass with increasing T, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (from 0.1 in 1980 to 0.2 in 2020), and increasing Pmainly during June-July-August months when temperatures are already high. This study is important as it used multiple data sets along with field data extracted from the literature to study climatic impacts on East Rathong glacier. Data generated from this study may be used in mass balance projection of the glaciers in the absence of field data.

TI  - An Improved Altimetry Wet Tropospheric Correction Retrieval Over Coastal Regions for the Sentinel-3 Mission
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wet tropospheric correction (WTC) retrieval over coastal regions is still nowadays a challenging task. The open-ocean retrieval algorithms, which rely on microwave radiometers (MWR) brightness temperatures (TBs) measurements, fail to provide accurate WTC values over these transition surfaces, due to the land contamination on the TBs. The retrieval errors rapidly increase with the approach of the satellite to the coastline. In this article, an improvement of the WTC retrieval over coastal regions for the Sentinel-3 mission is proposed, based on the dual-band MWR measurements, complemented with additional parameters to account for surface effects. Methods of modification of the MWR TBs and the synthetic aperture radar altimeter backscatter coefficient sigma(0), at Ku band, are presented, which aim to mitigate land contamination effects. On a first phase, these modified inputs are used in the open-ocean retrieval algorithm to compute the WTC. On a second phase, the same modified inputs are used in developed WTC retrieval algorithms specifically trained in coastal regions. The comparison against independent Global Navigation Satellite Systems derived WTC at coastal stations show that the use of coastal WTC retrieval algorithms with modified inputs is able to significantly reduce the retrieval errors over these regions, with rms values of 3.1 cm between 5 and 10 km from the coast and 3.3 cm up to 5 km from the coast. For the Sentinel-3 MWR-derived operational WTC retrieval algorithm, these values are 9.2 cm between 5 and 10 km from the coast and 16.2 cm up to 5 km from the coast.

TI  - The Effects of Covid-19 on Financial-Economic and Performance Efficiency of Hospitals.
T2  - Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: During the pandemic of COVID-19, the function and performance of hospitals have been affected by various economic-financial and management aspects. The aim of the current study was to assess the process of therapeutic care delivery and also the economic-financial functions of the selected hospitals before and after COVID-19.Methods: This research is a descriptive-analytical study and a cross-sectional-comparative study in terms of time, and it was conducted in several selected teaching hospitals of Iran University of Medical Sciences. A purposeful and convenient sampling method was used. The data has been collected using the standard research tool (standard checklist of the Ministry of Health) in the two areas of financial-economic and healthcare performance (such as Data of financial and economic indicators such as direct and indirect costs, liquidity ratio and profitability index as well as key performance indicators of hospitals such as bed occupancy ratio (BOR; %), average length of stay (ALOS), bed turnover rate (BTR), bed turnover distance rate (BTIR) and hospital mortality rate (HMR), physician-to-bed ratio and nurse-to-bed ratio) of hospitals in two times before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 (time period 2018 to 2021). The data was collected from 2018 to 2021. Pearson/Spearman regression was used for the evaluation of the relationship between variables using SPSS 22.Results: This research showed the admission of COVID-19 patients caused a change in the indicators we evaluated. ALOS (-6.6%), BTIR (-40.7%), and discharge against medical advice (-7.0%) decreased from 2018 to 2021. BOR; % (+5.0%), occupy bed days (+6.6%), BTR (+27.5%, HMR (+50%), number of inpatients (+18.8%), number of discharges (+13.1%), number of surgeries (+27.4%), nurse-per-bed ratio (+35.9%), doctor-per-bed ratio (+31.0%) increased in the same period of time. The profitability index was correlated to all of the performance indicators except for the net death rate. Higher length of stay and turnover interval had a negative effect on the profitability index while higher bed turnover rate, bed occupancy ratio, bed day, number of inpatient admission, and number of surgery had a positive effect on the profitability index.Conclusion: It has been shown from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance indicators of the studied hospitals were negatively affected. As a consequence of the COVID-19 epidemic, many hospitals were not able to deal with the negative financial and medical outcomes of this crisis due to a significant decrease in income and a double increase in expenses.

TI  - Assessment of Long-Term Rainfall Variability and Trends Using Observed and Satellite Data in Central Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the spatio-temporal distribution and trends on monthly, seasonal, and annual scales of rainfall in the central Punjab districts of Punjab province in Pakistan by using observation and satellite data products. The daily observed data was acquired from the Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) between 1983 and 2020, along with one reanalysis, namely the Climate Hazard Infrared Group Precipitation Station (CHIRPS) and one satellite-based daily Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks climate data record (PERSIANN-CDR) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) web-based API platform to investigate the spatio-temporal fluctuations and inter-annual variability of rainfall in the study domain. Several statistical indices were employed to check the data similarity between observed and remotely sensed data products and applied to each district. Moreover, non-parametric techniques, i.e., Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope estimator were applied to measure the long-term spatio-temporal trends. Remotely sensed data products reveal 422.50 mm (CHIRPS) and 571.08 mm (PERSIANN-CDR) mean annual rainfall in central Punjab. Maximum mean rainfall was witnessed during the monsoon season (70.5%), followed by pre-monsoon (15.2%) and winter (10.2%). Monthly exploration divulges that maximum mean rainfall was noticed in July (26.5%), and the minimum was in November (0.84%). The district-wise rainfall estimation shows maximum rainfall in Sialkot (931.4 mm) and minimum in Pakpattan (289.2 mm). Phase-wise analysis of annual, seasonal, and monthly trends demonstrated a sharp decreasing trend in Phase-1, averaging 3.4 mm/decade and an increasing tendency in Phase-2, averaging 9.1 mm/decade. Maximum seasonal rainfall decreased in phase-1 and increased Phase-2 during monsoon season, averaging 2.1 and 4.7 mm/decade, whereas monthly investigation showed similar phase-wise tendencies in July (1.1 mm/decade) and August (2.3 mm/decade). In addition, as district-wise analyses of annual, seasonal, and monthly trends in the last four decades reveal, the maximum declined trend was in Sialkot (18.5 mm/decade), whereas other districts witnessed an overall increasing trend throughout the years. Out of them, Gujrat district experienced the maximum increasing trend in annual terns (50.81 mm/decade), and Faisalabad (25.45 mm/decade) witnessed this during the monsoon season. The uneven variability and trends have had a crucial imprint on the local environment, mainly in the primary activities.

TI  - The Cellular Automata Approach in Dynamic Modelling of Land Use Change Detection and Future Simulations Based on Remote Sensing Data in Lahore Pakistan
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has become an immense problem in Lahore city, causing various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, it is noteworthy to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) change detection and future LULC patterns in Lahore. The present study focuses on evaluating the current extent and modeling the future LULC developments in Lahore, Pakistan. Therefore, the semi-automatic classification model has been applied for the classification of Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. And the Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was implemented to simulate future land use trends for the years 2030 and 2040. This study project made use of Landsat, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, and vector data. The research methodology includes three main steps: (i) semi-automatic land use classification using Landsat data from 2000 to 2020; (ii) future land use prediction using the CA-ANN (MOLUSCE) model; and (iii) monitoring change detection and interpretation of results. The research findings indicated that there was a rise in urban areas and a decline in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both the past and future projections. The results also revealed that about 27.41% of the urban area has been increased from 2000 to 2020 with a decrease of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. The urban area is also expected to grow by 23.15% between 2020 and 2040, whereas vegetation, barren land, and water bodies will all decline by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respec-tively. Results can also aid in the long-term, sustainable planning of the city. It was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found to have occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions. This research also suggests that decision-makers and municipal Government should reconsider city expansion strategies. Moreover, the future city master plans of 2050 must emphasize the relevance of rooftop urban planting and natural resource conservation.

TI  - Does land use change, waterlogging, and salinity impact on sustainability of agriculture and food security? Evidence from southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nation's sustainable development goal is to achieve zero hunger by 2030 and achieve food security throughout the world. In this context, we analyze the anthropogenic factors such as land use and land cover change, waterlogging, and soil salinity which combinedly affecting the agricultural sustainability and threatening the food security in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021 were used to detect the changes and identify how anthropogenic activities have altered the land cover and land use and impede the sustainability of agriculture. Terra MODIS vegetation indices from 2000 to 2020 were used to detect waterlogging. Soil salinity was measured from the soil samples and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI) from Landsat images. Findings of the study revealed that agricultural lands have decreased because of an increase in shrimp farming. Waterlogging and soil salinity are increasing due to increased shrimp farms also for poor drainage infrastructure and human modification. The area of agricultural land in 2011 was 19,657.12 acres,12,750.14 acres, and 38,774.70 acres in Keshabpur, Abhaynagar, and Manirampur, which changed to 12,668.70 acres (-36%), 7151.27 acres (-44%), and 32,809.30 acres (-16%) in 2021. Our hotspot analysis reveals that very high vulnerability to waterlogging due to floods was highest in Manirampur (15,464.09 acres). Finally, we proposed a new framework called IDCEM designed for monitoring land-use change, salinity, and waterlogging in the interior coast, which will indirectly help to promote food security and help in achieving sustainable development goal.

TI  - Statistical Study of the Geology, Topography, and Pore Fluid Salinity Controls on the Large Slope Failures Observed in North Dakota
T2  - GEO-CONGRESS 2023: GEOTECHNICS OF NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Geo-Congress on Sustainable Infrastructure Solutions from the Ground Up

AB  - A geospatial database of over 24,000 slope failures across the state of North Dakota was developed. The database revealed that nearly 1,500 slopes failures were larger than 100,000 m(2) in area posing significant safety concerns and engineering issues. To better understand the influence of various conditioning factors, a statistical study was undertaken in this paper. The slope failures were found to be concentrated in western North Dakota primarily occurring in the Sentinel Butte Formation. Statistical analyses suggest that this is likely due to the steeper topography and the abundance of Sentinel Butte Formation in this region in comparison to eastern North Dakota. The number of slope failures were log-normally distributed with the slope inclination. The mean slope inclination on which slope failures occurred was found to be 9.5 degrees with a standard deviation of 5.7 degrees. Interestingly, despite the presence of high salt concentrations in the soils underlying the majority of the state, the slope failures were found to be concentrated in areas with low salt concentrations. This may be attributed to the lower shear strengths of the soils with lower pore fluid salinity than that of soils with greater concentrations of salinity in the pore fluid.

TI  - Analysis of land use/land cover changes and prediction of future changes with land change modeler: Case of Belek, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the areas declared to be a tourism center by state planning, a rapid tourism-related development occurs depending on the investments in tourism, which causes a dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) change. Determining, monitoring, and modeling of LULC changes are required in order to ensure the conservation-use balance and sustainability within such vulnerable areas that are under development pressure. This study consists of four steps. In the first step, the Landsat images dated 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2021 were classified using the maximum likelihood method and the LULC of Belek Tourism Center located in Turkey were determined. The second step included the identification of areal and spatial changes between the LULC classes for the four periods. In the third step, the LULC changes in Belek Tourism Center for 2040 were modeled using the land change modeler. Last step evaluated the relationship between the modeled spatial development pattern and the current planning decisions. According to the results obtained during 36 years, the rates of built-up, forest, and water body areas have increased by 11.91%, 13.67%, and 0.82%, respectively, whereas the rates of barren land and agricultural areas have reduced by 22.25% and 4.15%, respectively. The LULC map modeled for 2040 predicts the built-up areas to expand by 8.25% and the agricultural areas to shrink by 5.42% by comparison with 2021. This study will contribute as a key measure for planners, policy-, and decision-makers to make decisions related to sustainable land use in the areas declared to be a tourism center.

AB  - Due to the fire incidents taking place in our country in recent years, it has become increasingly important to analyze the effects of the fire with various metrics on the basis of burned areas. The size of the burned areas by area determines the performance of the field analysis. With the advancement of technology, analysis from satellite images has become popular, especially in cases with wide spread areas, for the analysis of fire, examination of vegetation, and comparison with the old state of the region. In this study, NBR (Normalized Combustion Rate) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) indexes of Bodrum-Milas and Marmaris fire zones were analyzed using remote sensing techniques using Sentinel 2 satellite images, and the intensity of burning and the ratio of these intensities to the percentile area were calculated. A comparison was made with other studies conducted for these regions and the performance was measured by accepting them as separate references.

TI  - Exploring the Addition of Airborne Lidar-DEM and Derived TPI for Urban Land Cover and Land Use Classification and Mapping
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification and mapping accuracy of urban land cover and land use has always been a critical topic and several auxiliary data have been used to improve the classification accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited knowledge of the addition of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) for urban land cover and land use classification and mapping. The aim of this study was to explore the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI to reflect data of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in improving the classification accuracy of urban land cover and land use map-ping. Specifically, this study explored the mapping accuracies of urban land cover and land use classifications derived using: 1) standalone Landsat OLI satellite data; 2) Landsat OLI with acquired airborne lidar-DEM; 3) Landsat OLI with TPI; and 4) Landsat OLI with airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI. The results showed that the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and TPI yielded the best overall urban land cover and land use classification accuracy of about 88%. The findings in this study demonstrated that both lidar-DEM and TPI had a positive impact in improving urban land cover and land use classification.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Agricultural Water Management in Jordan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study shows how remote sensing methods are used to support and provide means for improving agricultural water management (AWM) in Jordan through detailed mapping of irrigated areas and irrigation water consumption (IWC). Digital processing and classification methods were applied on multi-temporal data of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 to derive maps of irrigated areas for the period 2017-2019. Different relationships were developed between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc) to map evapotranspiration (ET). Using ground data, ET maps were transferred to IWC for the whole country. Spatial analysis was then used to delineate hotspots where shifts between ET and groundwater abstraction were observed. Results showed that the applied remote sensing methods provided accurate maps of irrigated areas. The NDVI-Kc relationships were significant, with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.89 to 0.93. Subsequently, the ET estimates from the NDVI-Kc relationships were in agreement with remotely sensed ET modeled by SEBAL (NSE = 0.89). In the context of Jordan, results showed that irrigated areas in the country reached 98 thousand ha in 2019, with 64% of this area located in the highlands. The main irrigated crops were vegetables (55%) and fruit trees and olives (40%). The total IWC reached 702 MCM in 2019, constituting 56% of the total water consumption in Jordan, with 375 MCM of this amount being pumped from groundwater, while reported abstraction was only 235 MCM. The study identified the hotspots where illegal abstraction or incorrect metering of groundwater existed. Furthermore, it emphasized the roles of remote sensing in AWM, as it provided updated figures on groundwater abstraction and forecasts for future IWC, which would reach 986 MCM in 2050. Therefore, the approach of ET and IWC mapping would be highly recommended to map ET and to provide estimates of present and future IWC.

TI  - Monitoring land cover dynamics utilizing a change vector analysis approach: a case study of al Najaf Province, Iraq
T2  - KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysing information relevant to land cover changes is a fundamental issue in studies linked to environmental diversity. The use of multi-time satellite images at different scales allowed continuous observation of land cover changes. Due to significant changes in land cover, specifically in the decades 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, al Najaf Province was selected as the study area. This work aimed to study changes in land cover in Al Najaf Province from satellite imagery, using change vector analysis (CVA), through the last two decades (2000-2010 and 2010-2020). The enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) and the dry bare soil index (DBSI) represented the vegetation and soil condition in the study region. They were estimated via images from the satellite Landsat-5 TM for March for the two years 2000 and 2010, and Landsat 8 OLI 2020 for the same month, then were considered the parameters for a land cover change analysis using the CVA. The outputs of the CVA were assessed on maps of land cover obtained through the supervised classification for the above-mentioned images. The results of the change vector magnitude found that the ratio of the changed area reached 46.58% and 56.35%, and the unchanged area was 53.42% and 43.65% for the periods (2000-2010) and (2010-2020), respectively. The results of the change direction revealed that the moisture reduction ratio was 26.93% and 4.85%, while the vegetation regrowth ratio was 15.81% and 38.79% for the same two periods, respectively. The results of the two periods considered exhibited that the EVI2DBSI combination presented promising performance results with the overall accuracy of 0.90 and 0.92 and a kappa index of 0.867 and 0.852, respectively. As a result, the CVA technique offers a promising way to track environmental changes that are connected to the dynamics of land use/land cover in this region.

T2  - Anuario do Instituto de Geociencias
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the wide dissemination of information access, open data scarcity in fisheries science is still seen as a challenge. Thus, initiatives such as Sea Around Us and Fish Stats stand out. Particularly in developing countries, fishery data collection systems are precarious and there is a lack of national platforms to make fisheries data available. In Brazil, some states such as Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina have their own data repositories in web platforms, but there are limitations for dynamic queries. In addition, fisheries management based on the "Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries" (EAF) have been discussed and adopted, and environmental variables have been used as indicators to increase the robustness of fishery models. In this sense, the present work proposes a fishery data compilation platform named O mar esta para peixes? (Are there fish in the sea?), which contains fishery data and fishery-related satellite remote sensing data (i.e. sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration) for the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The platform is divided in five sections: Fishery, Habitat, Map, Satellite and Download. These sections make data available for dynamic and personalized consultations, with the option of downloading the data. A standard spreadsheet developed for users to submit their own data is presented, with the goal of promoting participation and the collective construction of the platform. This is a new step towards the development of an EAF in Rio de Janeiro, which will potentially open the pathway for the integration of public agencies, research institutions, fishing industry and artisanal fishermen.

AB  - The issues of climate warming and permafrost thawing are considered. A procedure for assessing the Arctic landscapes thawing based on the calculation of the normalized differential snow index (NDSI) is proposed. The factual material over the data of the global permafrost monitoring network is presented. Monitoring studies have shown that according to the results of NDSI calculation, abnormally early snowmelt was detected in 5 cases out of 23 years of observation at the Urengoy meteorological station and in 4 cases out of 23 years at the Tarko-Sale meteorological station. The absence of snow was observed during the indicated period in 13 cases at the technogenic sites of the Urengoy field, and in 8 cases at the Tarko-Sale field. With early snowmelt, the snow index NDSI decreases, and the depth of the seasonally thawed layer increases at the sites of the Urengoy field. The NDSI index can be used directly in assessing the duration of snow cover and early snowmelt, and indirectly in studying the depth of seasonally thawed layer. The results obtained are important for predictive estimates of the rate and extent of thawing and permafrost deformation, and for the prevention of emergency situations in the oil and gas complex.

TI  - Models for the estimation of sugarcane yield in Costa Rica with field data and vegetation indices
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing offers important inputs for sugarcane yield estimation, since its temporal and spatial approaches allow monitoring the phenological cycle of the crop. The objective of this research was to apply an operational method for the estimation of sugarcane yield and sugar content through the combination of field variables with vegetation indices, calculated with the satellite sensors on board Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 in a cooperative from Costa Rica. In addition, historical harvest data and start months of phenological cycle were used to estimate sugarcane yield and sugar content per ton using multiple linear regressions. The integration of historical data and Simple Ratio (SR) vegetation index, calculated in different steps of the phenological cycle (in the months of September, December and January), allowed us to obtain an estimation model of sugarcane yield (tons of sugarcane per hectare) with a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.64 and a RMSE of 8.0 tons/ha. While for sugar content (kilograms of refined sugar per ton) we obtained a R2 of 0.59 integrating historical variables and the vegetation indexes SR and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI); in this case the RMSE was 4.9 kg/tons. Ultimately, this operational method of yield estimation provides tools for decision making before, during and after the harvest stage.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Potentially Toxic Elements in Agricultural Soils of Al-Ahsa Oasis, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contamination of soil with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is receiving great attention worldwide due to its apparent toxicity and hazards to local residents. The assessments of soil PTE distribution, sources, and environmental risks are, therefore, the first steps of high-efficiency pollutant degradation and sustainable utilization. The current study used a variety of contamination indicators and multivariate methods to evaluate the environmental risk of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn in Al-Ahsa soils in eastern Saudi Arabia. For analysis, 30 surface soil samples were collected from palm fields irrigated with groundwater and treated sewage water. Landsat images of Al-Ahsa indicated an increase in the total vegetative area and the residential area, and a decrease in the bare land area from 1985 to 2021. The average concentrations of PTEs (mg/kg(-1)) were lower than the maximum admissible concentrations and had the following decreasing order: Zn (54.43) > Cr (28.67) > Ni (14.53) > Cu (10.83) > Pb (5.23) > As (2.27) > Hg (0.35) > Cd (0.26). The enrichment factor (EF) findings confirmed that the Al-Ahsa soil is significantly enriched with Hg, moderately to severely enriched with As, and moderately enriched with Cd. The potential ecological risk index (RI) demonstrates a moderate ecological risk, with only certain parts presenting a high risk. The different PTE levels in agricultural soils may be caused partly by the various qualities of groundwater that originate from various aquifers and sewage-treated water. The results of a multivariate analysis showed that most of the anthropogenic sources of Hg, As, and Cd may come from using a lot of fertilizers and insecticides. Levels of the remaining PTEs indicated natural sources from earth crust materials.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes are constantly changing as farmers adopt new production practices and respond to changing environmental conditions. Some of these changes alter landscape structure with impacts on natural pest control, pesticide use, and conservation of biodiversity. In rice agroecosystems the effect of landscape structure on natural enemies and pest suppression is often poorly understood. Here we investigate the effect of landscape composition and configuration on a key pest of rice, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). Using N. lugens as sentinel prey coupled with predator exclusions, we investigated landscape effects on herbivore suppression and rice grain yield at multiple spatial scales in two regions of Bangladesh. Ladybird beetles and spiders were the most abundant natural enemies of N. lugens with landscape effects observed at all scales on ladybird beetles. Specifically, ladybird beetles were positively influenced by road edges, and fallow land, while spiders were strongly influenced only by rice phenology. Predator exclusion cages showed that N. lugens abundance significantly increased in caged plots, reducing rice gain yield. We also used an estimated biocontrol service index that showed a significant positive relationship with landscape diversity and a significant negative impact on pest density and yield loss. These results suggest that promoting fallow lands and fragmented patches between rice fields could lead to more sustainable insect pest management in rice agroecosystems, potentially reducing the practice of prophylactic insecticide use.

TI  - Evaluation of tumor load in sentinel lymph node in patients with cutaneous melanoma.
T2  - Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: cutaneous melanoma (MC) is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytic cells with an aggressive behavior. It is usually associated with the multifactorial interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure, usually ultraviolet radiation. Despite advances in treatment, the disease remains relentless with poor prognosis. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a technique used to screen patients in need of lymph node dissection.OBJECTIVES: to correlate the tumor burden in the SLN with the mortality of patients undergoing SLN biopsy.METHODOLOGY: the medical records and histological slides of patients with MC who underwent SLN biopsy treated at HC-Unicamp from 2001 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The positive SLN were measured according to the size of the tumor infiltration area, for analysis of the depth of invasion (DI), closest proximity to the capsule (CPC) and tumor burden (TB). For statistical analysis, associations between variables were analyzed using Fishers exact test, with post Bonferroni test and Wilcoxon test.RESULTS: 105 records of patients who underwent SLN biopsy of MC were identified. Of these, nine (8.6%) had positive SLN and 81 (77.1%) had negative SLN. The performed lymphadenectomies resulted in 55.6% (n=5) affected, 22.2% (n=2) without disease and 22.2% (n=2) were not performed. Mean CPC, TB, and DI were 0.14mm, 32.10mm and 2.33mm, respectively. Patients with T2 and T3 tumors were more likely to show the SLN affected (p=0.022). No patient with positive SLN died during follow-up.CONCLUSION: patients who presented T3 staging are the ones who most presented positive SLN.

TI  - A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF GRIDDED SNOW PRODUCTS IN THE UPPER EUPHRATES
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - . Snow observations are important in many mountain areas to quantify the water stored in snowpacks and to predicting runoff during the melting period. In this study we compare the performance of five different regional-scale gridded snow products to reproduce snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Upper Euphrates region (Karasu Basin, 10,275 km2), with observations from automatic weather stations in the catchment through Taylor diagrams. The products compared are the ERA5, ERA5-Land, MERRA-2, snow data from a dynamical downscaling of ERA-5 (period 2000-2018) and SWE generated from microwave satellite data (SWE-E(H13) period 2013-2015 product of the EUMETSAT H SAF project). The H13 product presented deficiencies in terms of not being able to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of the snowpack. ERA-5 and, in particular, ERALand products, at 30 and 9 km grid size, respectively, showed good performance in reproducing snow evolution compared to four available observation sites. MERRA2 at 50 km resolution showed lower skills compared to the above-mentioned products. Resulting snow data from WRF at 10 km resolution did not show any improvement with respect to the global datasets. The impossibility of testing different configurations due to the lack of observations to compare and the computational constraints to test different parametrizations may be the reasons to explain the low performance although they remain speculative. All the gridded datasets showed good performance in reproducing snow duration over the basin, compared to remotely sensed data. Results highlight ERA-Land dataset as a very promising tool for regional snow studies in mountainous regions with limited observations, in a cost-effective way.

TI  - GIS-based assessment of land use for predicting increase in settlements in Al Ahsa Metropolitan Area, Saudi Arabia for the year 2032
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Al Ahsa Metropolitan Area (AMA), located in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia, has witnessed rapid population growth with remarkable urban expansion during the past few decades due to the discovery of oil. Because of this rapid growth, AMA is currently exposed to many short and long-term social, economic, and environmental challenges that need to be studied and assessed to provide solutions for the betterment of the population. This study examines the historical growth of AMA by using Geographical Information System data and satellite image classification tech-niques for the last 30 years. The results show that the total urban area of AMA has significantly increased from 199 sq. km. to 276 sq. km. during the past 30 years from 1992 to 2022 with a sharp increase of 25.5 % in the last 10 years only. Statistical analysis of the historical data predicted an increase of 26.8 % in the area of settlements during the next decade up to the Year 2032. After a study of land use maps it was also observed that the increase in settlements caused a decrease in vegetation to 18 % in the last decade. The research presents beneficial statistics which shall help the decision-makers and related authorities in managing the development process in the area in a better and more sustainable manner.(c) 2022 THE AUTHOR.

TI  - Cropping Pattern Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks and Evapotranspiration Estimation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES-TARIM BILIMLERI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining cropping patterns is crucial for quantifying irrigation water requirements at a catchment scale. For this reason, new and innovative technologies such as remote sensing (RS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are robust tools for generating the spatiotemporal variation of crops. In line with this, this study aims to classify each crop type using the ANN algorithm and calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). This study was conducted in the Akarsu Irrigation District (9495 ha) in the Lower Seyhan Plain in southeastern Turkey in the 2021 hydrological year. Crop types were classified using the ANN algorithm in the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) program based on combined data from Sentinel-2 images with a 10-m resolution and ground truth data collected during the winter and summer seasons. The image analysis results demonstrated that bare soil and citrus made up 3666 ha and 3742 ha respectively in the winter season, while first crop corn (1586 ha) and citrus (4121 ha) were preponderant in summer. The confusion matrix of the ANN algorithm showed high agreement (wheat 89.76%, onion 91.67%; citrus 97.67% in winter and 98.98% in summer; 100% for lettuce, potato, sesame-2, palm, and watermelon) and medium agreement (fruit 58.33% in winter, 42.86% in summer) with ground truth data in growing seasons. Furthermore, the agreement was more than 80% for the first and second crops (cotton, soybean, peanut, and corn) in the summer season. Annual reference evapotranspiration and ETc were around 1308 mm and 890 mm, respectively. The ETc values for wheat, citrus, first -crop corn, and second-crop soybean were found to be consistent with previous studies of direct evapotranspiration methods conducted in the Cukurova region. Overall, RS and ANNs can be used to classify crop types accurately in the growing season. This study builds upon and expands the application of RS and ANNs in large-scale irrigation schemes.

TI  - Analysis of Groundwater Storage Fluctuations Using GRACE and Remote Sensing Data in Wadi As-Sirhan, Northern Saudi Arabia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity has led to a rise in the demand for water, prompting Saudi Arabia to search for alternative groundwater supplies. Wadi As-Sirhan is one area that has experienced extensive agricultural growth and the severe over-exploitation of its groundwater resources. The groundwater drawn from the wadi should be continuously monitored to determine the best management options for groundwater resources and economic growth. The most recent Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and outputs of land surface models were combined to estimate the depletion rate of the groundwater of the Wadi As-Sirhan drainage basin in the northern region of Saudi Arabia throughout the period of April 2002-December 2021. The findings are: (1) the average GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage variation (Delta TWS) was calculated at -13.82 +/- 0.24 mm/yr; (2) the soil moisture storage variation was averaged at +0.008 +/- 0.004 mm/yr; (3) the GRACE-derived groundwater depletion rate was estimated at -13.81 +/- 0.24 mm/yr; (4) the annual precipitation data over the Wadi As-Sirhan was averaged at 60 mm/yr; (5) The wadi has a minimal recharge rate of +2.31 +/- 0.24 mm/yr, which may partially compensate for a portion of the groundwater withdrawal; (6) the sediment thickness shows an increase from 0 m at the southern igneous and volcanic rocks to more than 3000 m close to the Saudi-Jordanian border; (7) The wadi's eastern, southern, and western portions are the sources of its tributaries, which ultimately drain into its northwestern portion; (8) change detection from the Landsat photos reveals considerable agricultural expansions over recent decades. The integrated method is useful for analyzing changes to groundwater resources in large groundwater reservoirs and developing environmentally appropriate management programs for these resources.

AB  - Deforestation is a critical environmental issue that has far-reaching impacts on climate change, biodiversity, and the livelihoods of local communities. Conventional methods such as field surveys and map interpretation are not feasible, especially in vast regions like the Brazilian Amazon. In this paper, we adapt ChangeFormer, a transformer-based change detection model, to detect deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, leveraging the attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in bi-temporal satellite images. To evaluate the model's performance, we implemented a rigorous methodology to create a deforestation detection dataset using Sentinel-2 images of selected conservation units in the Brazilian Amazon during 2020 and 2021. The model achieved a high accuracy of 94%, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based networks for accurate and efficient deforestation detection.

TI  - Estimating the Population of a Middle Eastern City Based on a Normalized Difference Built-Up Index and Urban Morphology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOSPATIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to introduce a method for estimating the population of a Middle Eastern city, the city of Hillah, in the absence of a census which was last conducted in 1997. The method incorporates the normalized difference built-up index and land use-land cover information to identify residential areas for four years 1987, 1997 (the last census), 2008, and 2018 using Landsat imagery. Dasymetric mapping is employed to rezone residential pixels to the city's administrative districts or mahallahs. Mahallah populations for each year are estimated using local and historical urban morphology characteristics combined with standardized housing and household sizes. The result of this study is a range of estimates for mahallah populations, but a reasonable estimate of the city of Hillah's population is developed. The use of historical information, urban design, and environmental data with remote sensing methods in a Middle Eastern context provides an added tool in the arsenal of population estimation techniques.

TI  - On Satellite Imagery of Land Cover Classification for Agricultural Development
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Distribution of chronological land cover modifications has attained a vibrant concern in contemporary sustainability research. Information delivered by satellite remote sensing imagery plays momentous role in enumerating and discovering the expected land cover for vegetation. Fuzzy clustering has been found successful in implementing a significant number of optimization problems associated with machine learning due to its fractional membership degrees in several neighbouring constellations. This research establishes a framework on land cover classification for agricultural development. The approach is focused on object-oriented classification and is organized with a Fuzzy c-means clustering over segmentation on CIE L*a*b* colour scheme which provides analysis of vegetation coverage and enhances land planning for sustainable developments. This research investigates the land cover variations of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia throughout an elongated span of period from 1984 to 2018 to recognize the possible roles of the land cover alterations on farming. The Landsat satellite imagery and Geographical Information System (GIS), in tandem with Google Earth chronological imagery are employed for land use variation analysis. Experimental results exhibit a reasonable spread in the cultivated zones and reveal that this Colour Segmented Fuzzy Clustering (CSFC) strategy achieves better than the relevant counterpart approaches considering classification accuracy.

AB  - In the research work, the issues of modeling cities located on the Mil and Mugan plains were analyzed. These cities include Sabirabad, Saatly and Imishli. Only 3 % of the Earth is covered by cities. However, more than 50 % of the world's population lives in cities. Rapid population growth in cities makes their planning and modeling important. Therefore, our study is devoted to an actual problem. Goal. The main goal of our study is to study the development of cities and determine the correct management and modeling of them. Method. In the course of the study, for the first time in Azerbaijan, we applied the building density coefficient. To do this, we used Geographic Information Systems. As a result, all cities were modeled. Result. As a result of the research, it was found that these cities, located on the banks of the Araz and Kura rivers, are intensively expanding. Such development may also create a food problem in the near future.

TI  - The understanding of "intelligence" between artificial intelligence, philosophy and theology
T2  - RIVISTA ITALIANA DI FILOSOFIA DEL LINGUAGGIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The common perception of intelligence is associated with positive values and has historically been considered a unique attribute of human beings in Western philosophy. The connection between calculating machines and intelligence through Turing's imitation game will kick off John McCarthy's project on Artificial Intelligence. Since then, the question of how to understand what is commonly called intelligence has been constantly re-proposed. Indeed, the understanding of intelligence is not free from personal and social biases and has even become a worldview that includes anthropology. In the paper, starting from the way of understanding intelligence in the context of Artificial Intelligence, an attempt is made to disambiguate the term in question within the understandings present in Western philosophy and in the Judeo-Christian theology. Through an interdisciplinary examination of various forms of intelligence, such as calculative, intuitive, sensitive, adoring, ethical-wise, and agapic, the paper suggests the possibility of a broader and more integrated understanding into a unitary, transdisciplinary vision. This new perspective can broaden horizons and inspire future creative thinking and research in science, philosophy, and theology.

TI  - A hybrid approach: a safe option for surgical treatment of early-stage cervical cancer.
T2  - European review for medical and pharmacological sciences
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the surgical treatment of early-stage cervical cancer (CC) via minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and a sequential hybrid approach combining MIS and mini-Pfannenstiel. Evaluate sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using a hybrid tracer (ICG-99m Tc nanocolloid).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational,descriptive,single-center study conducted at Son Espases University Hospital between January 2019 and September 2021. Patients with early-stage CC (FIGO 2018 IA1 with ILV-IIA1) who underwent surgical treatment with a follow-up of at least one year were included.RESULTS: Thirty early-stage CC patients were included, of whom four (13.3%) were upstaged due to positive SLNs. In these cases, laparotomy was avoided, and paraaortic lymphadenectomy was performed via MIS approach. Twenty-six patients had a radical hysterectomy: 15 underwent a hybrid approach, 10 laparoscopy, and one laparotomy. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had a smaller estimated tumor size than those undergoing the hybrid approach. The overall SLN detection rate was 96.1%, with 88.5% of cases occurring bilaterally. Five out of 26 patients (19.2%) presented SLN macrometastases, and five (19.2%) had atypical drainage. Surgery refined staging in 33.3% (10/30) of cases. No recurrences were reported after an average follow-up of 32 months.CONCLUSIONS: MIS for SLN avoids laparotomy leading to rapid recovery and early adjuvant treatment initiation in nodal metastasis. In our study, tumor size is an important clinical implication in the surgical approach to be used. The hybrid tracer provided a high detection rate and combined the advantages of the two tracers. The hybrid approach has a quick recovery and optimal results.

TI  - Machine learning, meaning making: On reading computer science texts
T2  - BIG DATA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Computer science tends to foreclose the reading of its texts by social science and humanities scholars - via code and scale, mathematics, black box opacities, secret or proprietary models. Yet, when computer science papers are read in order to better understand what machine learning means for societies, a form of reading is brought to bear that is not primarily about excavating the hidden meaning of a text or exposing underlying truths about science. Not strictly reading to make sense or to discern definitive meaning of computer science texts, reading is an engagement with the sense-making and meaning-making that takes place. We propose a strategy for reading computer science that is attentive to the act of reading itself, that stays close to the difficulty involved in all forms of reading, and that works with the text as already properly belonging to the ethico-politics that this difficulty engenders. Addressing a series of three "reading problems" - genre, readability, and meaning - we discuss machine learning textbooks and papers as sites where today's algorithmic models are actively giving accounts of their paradigmatic worldview. Much more than matters of technical definition or proof of concept, texts are sites where concepts are forged and contested. In our times, when the political application of AI and machine learning is so commonly geared to settle or predict difficult societal problems in advance, a reading strategy must open the gaps and difficulties of that which cannot be settled or resolved.

T2  - Journal of comparative effectiveness research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the utilization and outcomes of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) by USA region, using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Patients & methods: All TAVR discharge encounters from June 2017-2019 were included in the analysis. Discharge encounters with bicuspid anatomy were excluded. Regional CEP utilization rates were reported. For TAVR cases performed with the Sentinel CEP device (Boston Scientific, MA, USA), multivariable logistic regression was performed to model regional differences in TAVR outcomes including: stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke/TIA combined, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Generalized linear regression models were used to assess regional differences in length of stay (LOS) and hospital charges. Results: The Northeast had the greatest overall CEP utilization rate (11.3%), followed by the Midwest (11.1%), West (8.7%), then South (3.1%). Compared with the Northeast, the South was associated with a lower risk of stroke (OR: 0.267, 95% CI: 0.106-0.673; p= 0.005), and the West a higher risk of stroke (OR: 1.583, 95% CI: 1.044-2.401; p= 0.031). Compared with the Northeast, the West was associated with a higher risk of stroke/TIA combined (OR: 1.618, 95% CI: 1.107-2.364; p= 0.013). Compared with the Northeast, the Midwest (OR: 4.501, 95% CI: 2.229-9.089; p< 0.001) and West (OR: 5.316, 95% CI: 2.611-10.824; p< 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality. Adjusted charges and LOS were highest in the West. Conclusion: Within the USA, there are regional differences in the utilization and outcomes of CEP use during TAVR. To prevent regional disparities and ensure consistent quality of care in the USA, further research is needed to determine what variable(s) may be responsible for regional differences in TAVR outcomes, with or without CEP.

TI  - Predicting Spatially Explicit Composite Burn Index (CBI) from Different Spectral Indices Derived from Sentinel 2A: A Case of Study in Tunisia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity, which quantifies the degree of organic matter consumption, is an important component of the fire regime. High-severity fires have major ecological implications, affecting carbon uptake, storage and emissions, soil nutrients, and plant regeneration, among other ecosystem services. Accordingly, spatially explicit maps of the fire severity are required to develop improved tools to manage and restore the most damaged areas. The aim of this study is to develop spatially explicit maps of the field-based fire severity (composite burn index-CBI) from different spectral indices derived from Sentinel 2A images and using several regression models. The study areas are two recent large fires that occurred in Tunisia in the summer of 2021. We employed different spectral severity indices derived from the normalized burn ratio (NBR): differenced NBR (dNBR), relative differenced NBR (RdNBR), and relativized burn Ratio (RBR). In addition, we calculated the burned area index for Sentinel 2 (BAIS2) and the thermal anomaly index (TAI). Different tree decision models (i.e., the recursive partitioning regression method [RPART], bagging regression trees [Bagging], and boosted regression trees [BRT]), as well as a generalized additive model [GAM]), were applied to predict the CBI. The main results indicated that RBR, followed by dNBR, were the most important spectral severity indices for predicting the field-based CBI. Moreover, BRT was the best regression model, explaining 92% of the CBI variance using the training set of points and 88% when using the validation set. These results suggested the adequacy of RBR index derived from Sentinel 2A for assessing and mapping forest fire severity in Mediterranean forests. These spatially explicit maps of field-based CBI could help improve post-fire recovery and restoration efforts.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Algorithm for Early Morning Observations From the FY-3E Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cloud detection via satellites is important for cloud radiative forcing estimation and disaster weather monitoring. Current polar-orbiting satellite cloud observations are limited during early morning orbit and contain notable uncertainty due to dimness measurements in visible bands. FY-3E\MERSI-LL is the first early morning orbit satellite worldwide and can realize global cloud observation under early morning scenarios. In this study, a dynamic threshold cloud detection algorithm is proposed based on the FY-3E\MERSI-LL infrared channel, combined with auxiliary data such as sea surface temperature (SST), land surface temperature (LST), snow cover mask (SCM), and terrain elevation. The algorithm can detect clouds against a complex land surface background, but faces classification difficulties over some plateau, high-latitude, and snow surface regions, especially during early morning observation periods. Compared to coincident Himawari-8 and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 cloud measurements in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively, our algorithm recognizes reasonable cloud distributions. Furthermore, Himawari-8 and GOES-16 cloud products are used for quantitative cloud algorithm evaluation. The results show that at low-middle latitudes (60 degrees N-60 degrees S), the average cloud and clear hit rates (HRs) during the various seasons are 73.24% and 76.46%, respectively, the cloud leakage and false alarm rates (FARs) are 14.46% and 8.15%, respectively, and the total accuracy (cloud and clear) is 77.33%. The algorithm performance is better over the ocean than over land. Ground site MPLCMASK products are also used to verify the FY-3E cloud results in middle- and high-latitude areas. This algorithm provides a cloud detection reference during early morning orbit based on infrared channels.

TI  - Land cover classification with spatial resolution of 10 meters in forests of the Colombian Caribbean based on Sentinel 1 and 2 missions
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - A Land cover map of the Colombian Caribbean were generated with data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions for the year 2020. The main objective was to evaluate Sentinel 1 and 2 images to generate a classification for Caribbean forests. The images were processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and then classified using Random Forest. The Overall Accuracy, the Mean Decrease Accuracy and the Mean Decrease in Gini were calculated for the optical and radar bands, this allowed evaluating the importance of different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in the classification of vegetation cover and the relative importance of the spectral bands. The accuracy of the land cover map was 76% using exclusively Sentinel-2 bands, with a slight increase when Sentinel-1 data was incorporated. The SWIR region was the most important of both Sentinel programs for increasing accuracy. We highlight the importance of coastal aerosol band 1 (442.7 nm) in the classification despite its low spatial resolution. The overall accuracy reached 83% when adding the Elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) as auxiliary variable. These results indicate great potential for the generation of vegetation cover maps at the regional level while maintaining a pixel size of 10 m. This article highlights the relative importance of the different bands and its contribution to improve accuracy.

TI  - Comparison of Six Days of the Creation in Masoretic Version and Onkelos Targum in the Historical and Philosophical Contexts
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is dedicated to the first chapter of the Book of Genesis in the Targum Onkelos, the most important Jewish translation of the Pentateuch into Aramaic. The paper deals with terms related to the structure of space, time and eternity. In the Targum of Onkelos, the influence of Ptolemaic cosmology and geography, as well as the worldview of the era of the formation of the Mishna, are observed. The creator of the translation uses the term kadmin (originality, eternity), which al-lows us to interpret that Onkelos in a sense allows the existence of the world for an indefinitely long time in the past. In the theological aspect, the author of the Targum uses the Tetragrammaton, which is translated into Russian as the word "Lord", instead of the Hebrew elohim (plural form). The author of the article inter-prets this unconditionally monotheistic term as a struggle against Gnosticism and Manichaeism, which was relevant in the 2nd century AD. The Aramaic term rekiya, which Onkelos translates into Hebrew rakia, means not so much "firma-ment" as extension, and this article discusses its possible translation as "space". If a number of concepts "signs", "holidays", "days" and "years" are used in the He-brew Torah as synonymous, then in the Aramaic text "signs" and "times" are sepa-rately distinguished, and it is separately indicated that the luminaries are needed to count days and years. This shows the influence of Late Antique astrology, popu-lar among the Jews too. The author of this Targum not only created an interpreta-tion of the biblical text, but also created his own aspects of Jewish cosmology, which were used by Jewish interpreters to build their medieval cosmology.

TI  - M. K. Ciurlionis' Relationship with the Natural World: Landscape Painting as Expression of Spiritual State
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis of principal stages in Ciurlionis' painting evolution, the article reveals the relationship that the Lithuanian artist had with the natural world. It shows that nature along with its diversity in colours and forms was the main source of the artist's artistic inspiration. Throughout the mature phase of his artistic activity Ciurlionis drew nearer to great nature-worshipping Chinese and Japanese masters of landscape painting, as was evidenced by these common traits: careful observation of various manifestations of the natural world, attentive listening to enigmatic natural phenomena, grasp of one's integrity with nature, particular sensitivity for seasonal changes, worldview from bird's eye, clarity of painting manner, inclination towards juxtaposition of various spatial plans, and restraint of colour system. Just as in East Asian landscape painting, the Man occupies a modest place in Ciurlionis' paintings - the Man is treated as an organic part of nature, included into united operation of universal elements and infinite flow of cosmic metamorphoses. Ciurlionis, similarly to East Asian masters, paints "soul landscapes" derived from memories and rich imagination, as opposed to the ones observable in reality.

CP  - International Conference on Environmental Management (ICEM)
CL  - ICEM Comm, ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Tourism and urban areas experienced rapid development at the beginning of the 21st century. This condition is caused by natural, cultural, and artificial tourist destinations and adequate infrastructure support. Tourist destinations in urban areas add to urbanization because apart from being the center of government, trade, and industry, it is also a tourist destination that can attract tourists. Monitoring the development of urban tourism is carried out in the cities of Denpasar and Bali, as well-known destinations at the world level. The development of the urban area can be detected through multi-temporal and multispectral remote sensing imagery in combination with machine learning technology. This study aims to determine the spatial distribution of urban tourism development from 2013 to 2021. This study uses remote sensing and machine learning methods with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing. The RF algorithm is one of the non-parametric classification algorithms which is widely applied in remote sensing data classification because of its insensitivity to excessive noise and training data and its good performance. The material used is Landsat 8, especially on the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor. The result showed that integrating remote sensing, GEE cloud computing, and machine learning, especially the RF algorithm, effectively monitors urban tourism expansion. The overall accuracy of the RF model with simple training data is above 90%. We found that within nine years, vegetated land was changed into an urban area of 20.23 km(2). For this reason, special attention is needed from the government to make regulations on spatial planning and control over land conversion so that there will still be green open spaces in the future.

TI  - Multichannel Ground-Based Bistatic SAR Receiver for Single-Pass Opportunistic Tomography
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a multichannel ground-based bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) receiver architecture designed to perform single-pass tomography using the Sentinel-1 satellites as transmitters of opportunity. The bistatic receiver presents only three imaging channels, which is an extreme case for single-pass tomographic estimation. The three antennas are placed in a nonuniform configuration such that the two antenna separations are in a 2:1 ratio. For a fixed array length, the nonuniform three-element array will extend the maximum unambiguous height (relative to the three-element uniform array) while keeping the elevation resolution cell around the Rayleigh limit. In the proposed processing flow, for each Sentinel-1 overpass on the envisaged orbits, the bistatic SAR image of each channel is focused on a 2-D grid, and afterward, the elevation profile of a given area is computed using the Capon estimator. The proposed architecture was evaluated in a measurement campaign performed between June and November 2021 using an electronic target with two transmit antennas placed on a vertical pole situated 58.5 m from the ground receiver. For an array length of 2.6 m, the overall root mean square error of the relative height was below 10 cm, while the unambiguous interval and the height resolution cell were around 3.75 and 1.2 m, respectively. The experimental data from this measurements campaign provide the first quantitative assessment of spaceborne transmitter/stationary receiver single-pass bistatic SAR tomography in a controlled environment. In the long term, these results may contribute to future multistatic spaceborne SAR missions for which a single-pass tomographic capability is envisioned.

TI  - From Imperial to Soviet Power: Interpretation of Zabolotsky's Creative Quest in the <i>Ararat</i> Collection
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the role of Zhukovsky, a nineteenth--century ballad author, in Zabolotsky's creative consciousness. Among the biographical facts and writings of the twentieth-century poet that reveal his constant interest in the canonic figure of his predecessor, the author pays special attention to Zhukovsky's Ballad (1927) that has a metaliterary title. Zabolotsky included this work which looks like a riddle in the composition of Ararat, his handwritten book, and therefore is considered by the author of the article in the context of this collection. The paper aims to overcome the semantic opacity of Zhukovsky's Ballad and to determine its place and functions in the structure of the Ararat poetic cycle. Methodologically, the analysis is based on historical poetics, which implies, on the one hand, the identification of a genre basis relevant to both Zhukovsky and Zabolotsky, and on the other hand - the transformations that the ballad underwent in the context of a "new worldview and new art". Another theoretical reference point is B. M. Gasparov's Poetics of the Tale of Igor's Campaign dedicated to the interpretation of the opaque text and based on the analysis of its linguistic and genre-stylistic features. The main sources in this research are the manuscript of Zhukovsky's Ballad as well as the cover of Ararat with drawings by the writer, and the other poems of the collection. The main result lies in the reconstruction of the cyclical plot implying the unity of all the poems of the collection through the prism of their motifs and imagery, which, in turn, revisits the biblical story of the Flood. The author analyses intertextual connections within the book and specifies their functions. In the first part of Ararat, Zhukovsky's Ballad which completed the collection was the most conflictual work within a triad of texts dedicated to the end of the old tsarist and imperial way of life. Based on the clarified symmetrical composition of the cycle, in its second half, the author discovers the poem Movement mirroring Zhukovsky's Ballad. Instead of the tsar in the ballad, there appears a cabman sitting "as if on the throne" as a representative of the new "proletarian" authorities. In the place of a drowned man who lived in the "round village," the reader now sees a "poor horse" as the driving force of modernity. Thus, Zabolotsky captures the change of the social and everyday life paradigms, bringing the heroes of a new era to the fore.

TI  - The effect of water resources on spatial and temporal change of soil salinity in Izdkhast playa, Fars Province, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the south of Fars Province in Iran, there are several closed basins where the salinity of water and soil resources is one of the main problems. Therefore, to manage the water and soil resources of these basins, identifying the source of salinity and its expansion in playa is necessary. Thus, the Izad-Khast pit in the south of Fars Province of Iran was selected as one of these basins for research. To achieve the goal, 16 soil samples were randomly taken from the basin, and their EC was determined. Landsat 8 image was selected according to sampling day, and ten salinity indices were extracted from it. Then, the best index was determined by the relationship between salinity indices and ground EC using linear regression. Using the determined index and linear equation derived from linear regression and Landsat 7 and 8 images, salinity maps were obtained in three periods 2010, 2015, and 2020. Then, using maps of the three mentioned intervals and the CA-Markov method, soil salinity prediction maps were extracted for 2025 and 2030. Based on the research results, salinity index S2 = (Blue - R)/(Blue + R) provided the best results. Salinity maps derived from this index show that the highest level is related to the area with no salinity or low salinity, and high degrees of salinity are concentrated in some parts of the hills and in some areas of the plain, respectively, which determines the origin of salts. The results also showed that the kappa coefficient of CA-Markov is 0.7282, which shows the high ability of the model to predict soil salinity, in which the distance factor from gypsum and salt minerals is the most critical predictor factor. According to the forecasts, from 2020 to 2025, about 1 km(2) and then from 2025 to 2030, about 1.6 km(2) will be added to the saline lands.

TI  - Symbolism of Number in the Traditional World Perception of the Mongolian Ethnous: A Philosophical Aspect
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The philosophical aspect of the spiritual culture of the Mongolian ethnic groups is of undoubted interest for modern Russian science. Features of the cultural genesis of the Mongolian-speaking ethnic groups of Russia (Buryats and Kalmyks) have common historical and cultural foundations with the Mongolian world. These fea-tures make it possible to consider the Mongolian ethnos as a certain spiritual and cultural integrity. In this article, the authors continue to develop previously ob-tained results from the position of philosophy and semiotics of culture. The origi-nal philosophical, conceptual and methodological formulation of the problem is based on Hegel's teaching about the symbol, about the symbolic form, which in his interpretation is characteristic of the culture and art of the East. The work reveals the role of the number symbolism in the spiritual and cultural life of the Mongols, considers its characteristic features based on the analysis of the numbers 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 13, 25, 37, 49, 60, 61, 73, 81, occupying an important place in the ethno-cultural world of the Mongols, the invariable and enduring value-conceptual nature of the number symbolism is shown. The identification of the traditional features of the Mongolian worldview of numerical symbolism is carried out from the posi-tion of the philosophy of the ethnos. The philosophy of ethnos is considered as a relatively new approach in the space of philosophy, focused on the inclusion of non-Western ethnic worldviews in the general outline of philosophical prob-lems. The joint work of Russian and Mongolian specialists in this field of research has made it possible to obtain new results for the philosophy of the ethnos, the phi-losophy and semiotics of culture, and in general for philosophical science.

TI  - Ethno-confessional neotraditionalism of the Khakas: The search for identification grounds
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the evolution of the ethno-confessional identity of the Khakas people. In its course, on the one hand, the continuity of the shamanic foundations of faith and cult practice was preserved. This led to a more developed form of religious identity - Tengrianism. On the other hand, the Khakas joined other religious systems (for example, Manichaeism and Christianity), and this formed the well-known phenomenon of "dual faith".The author pays a special attention to the processes of sacralization, desacralization and resacralization of the most important value of native land. It is concluded that the doctrine of Tengrianism is being revitalized. However, this phenomenon is controversial and causes discussions not only in the academic circles, but also in the society.In modern Tengrianism, traditionalist, modernist and neotraditionalist tendencies have appeared. Traditionalist actors, as a rule, adhere to strict observance of the dogmas of the religious doctrine and the rules of the cult practice. While comprehending the worldview of Tengrianism, modernists who mainly belong to the national intelligentsia tend to be non-confessional in the interpretation of the creed and prone to liberal forms of cult practice. Neotraditionalist actors seek to use traditional forms of ethno-confessional identity as a resource to raise the motivation of ethnophors for achieving ethnic solidarity and intensification of modernization. Unlike traditional forms of shamanism and Tengrianism, contemporary actors actively construct a new social reality using legislative practice (for example, for the protection of sacred sites), institutional forms of organization (societies, movements, actions, etc.), and, finally, science.

TI  - Land Use and Landscape Characteristics Are Associated with Core Forest Patches in Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land uses and terrain characteristics would likely influence the types and spatial arrangements of forest patches, and generally, forest fragmentation. Whereas prior research has focused mainly on direct land use-induced forest fragmentation, this study models the relationship between the spatial distribution of core forest patches, land uses, and terrain variables. Relying on Landsat images from the Atewa Range Forest Reserve (ARFR) in Ghana, we use machine learning geospatial techniques and statistical methods to process satellite images and model the relationship between core forest patches and associated variables. The study finds that a unit reduction in elevation would significantly likely reduce by 0.995 times the possibility of forest patches being core forests, implying that on lower slopes, core forests are less likely to occur. Additionally, we find that a unit increase in slope gradient significantly increases the odds of a forest patch being among the core forest category by 1.35 times. Moreover, our results show that the odds of forest patches being core forests significantly increase by 1.60 and 2.14 times if patches are found beyond 1 km from logging sites and access roads, respectively. This implies that intact forest patches would likely be found on higher slopes, higher elevations, and areas far away from land uses. Based on the results, we suggest that the protection of forest patches should target higher elevations and slopes and most importantly areas far from land uses whereas forest restoration programs should target areas close to land uses and on lower elevations and lower slopes. With this study demonstrating a significant relationship between core forests, land uses and terrain variables, we present important information to land managers for land monitoring and conservation in the ARFR and other tropical forest regions of the world.

TI  - Remotely sensed-based analysis about climatic and landscape change effects on phytoplankton bloom in Barra Bonita Reservoir (Sao Paulo State, Brazil)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The constant land use and land cover (LULC) changes combined with climatic factors are frequently assigned to anthropogenic eutrophication, one of the main ecological imbalances in aquatic systems characterized by dense phytoplankton proliferation. Beyond the degradation of freshwater ecosystems, some cyanobacterial and algae species produce toxins harmful to living beings. Distinct studies in the literature, usually supported by in situ data, have discussed the influence of LULC and climatic changes on phytoplankton bloom events. In this context, motivated by the importance of understanding the environmental mechanisms assigned to phytoplankton bloom events and considering the difficulties imposed by field data collection, our study focuses on analyzing the mentioned issue only using remotely sensed time series data. For this purpose, we performed a temporal analysis between 1985 and 2018 over a portion of the Barra Bonita Hydroelectric Reservoir, Brazil. Initially, we obtained the landscape occupation, precipitation, and temperature information from the MapBiomas, FLDAS, and CHIRPS projects, respectively. A fully automatic algorithm fed by Landsat image series and supported by Google Earth Engine functions was developed and employed to identify and quantify phytoplankton bloom events. Then, the obtained data were inspected by distinct statistical procedures, including correlation and trend analysis. Although there was an absence of a relationship between the climatic components and the emergence of phytoplankton blooms, it was identified using linear regression models (R-2 = 78 % ) an intensification of blooms after the increase in nonnatural forestry areas, reduction of pastures, and advance of agricultural areas. Furthermore, machine learning methods were employed to obtain nonlinear regression models (R-2 =73 % ), making evident that the landscape changes are mainly responsible for the phytoplankton insurgences in the analyzed region. This result agrees with other studies found in the literature and highlights the possibility of investigating anthropogenic eutrophication only using remotely sensed data and automatic algorithms.

TI  - The importance of sentinel lymph node diagnostic biopsy from the lateral neck compartment in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cance.
T2  - Bratislavske lekarske listy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study is to determine whether mapping the lymphatic drainage and diagnostic excision of lymph nodes from lateral neck compartment is able to detect ultrasound unknown metastases in this compartment early and thus favorably affect the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).BACKGROUND: Lymph node involvement in the lateral neck compartment is seen in 30-60 % of patients with PTC at the time of diagnosis and affects the prognosis of patients in terms of disease recurrence.METHODS: From June 2012 to December 2016, 154 patients with no evidence of lateral nodal involvement on imaging studies were treated with total thyroidectomy and central comparment neck dissection. A volume of 0.2 ml of Patent Blue dye was applied in the upper half of the thyroid gland with subsequent exposure of lymphatic drainage in the lateral compartment and 2-3 sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were removed for frozen section (Group 1). In case of metastatic involvement, a lateral comparment neck dissection was performed. The reference groups were composed of aset of patients without detected lymphatic drainage (Group 2) and a set of patients who underwent lateral compartment neck dissection for preoperatively detected metastases in the lymph nodes (Group 3). The biochemical, structural and overall persistence of the disease at the time of administration of adjuvant radioiodine ablation was evaluated.RESULTS: The SLN identification rate was 95.45 %. In Group 1, a total of 32 patients had a positive SLN. Out of these, 24 patients had positive SLNs based on the analysis of frozen section, while in 8 patients, the positive diagnosis was confirmed through definitive histology. The comparison of data from the entire follow-up period in all three groups of patients revealed statistically significant differences in persistence of disease, namely in favor of Group 1. The percentage of reoperations for persistence and recurrence of disease was significantly lowest in Group 1 (2.04 %) compared to Groups 2 and 3 (6.94 % and 45.45 % respectively).CONCLUSION: The method is safe and sensitive for detecting unknown lymph node metastases in the lateral neck compartment, and may facilitate adecision to perform accurate surgical treatment of patients with PTC (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 38).

TI  - The jesuits and the Church with an indigenous face
T2  - REVISTA PERSEITAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, a sector of the Latin American Catholic Church has promoted the idea of forming a Church with an indigenous face, in which indigenous people are incorporated into the ecclesiastical structure through certain positions such as catechist and/or deacons. Some have even proposed the ordination of indigenous priests, who according to the indigenous worldview must be married.The purpose of this article is to review, from the perspective of the historicization of concepts proposed by Ellacuria, the theoretical and practical contribution made by the Society of Jesus, in particular three Ignatian religious -XavierAlbo, Manuel Marzal and Bartomeu Melia- to this process. As will be seen throughout the text, it has been a path full of advances and setbacks. At the theoretical level, the Jesuits have defended the idea that inculturation is the best way for the Church to achieve a true insertion in the reality of the indigenous communities. In the practical field, the experience of indigenous deacons is explored in two regions: in the Aymara zone in the Andes -especially in Bolivia-, and in the Mission of Bachajon, Chiapas. Both experiences have dissimilar results, but they enrich the journey of the Church with an indigenous face.

TI  - A Procedure for the Quantitative Comparison of Rainfall and DInSAR-Based Surface Displacement Time Series in Slow-Moving Landslides: A Case Study in Southern Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data are useful to analyze the impact of climate-related variables on geomorphological processes. This work aims at evaluating the impact of rainfall on slow-moving landslides, by means of a quantitative procedure for identifying satellite-based displacement clusters, comparing them with rainfall series, and applying statistical tests to evaluate their relationships at the regional scale. The chosen study area is the Basento catchment in the Basilicata region (southern Italy). Rainfall series are gathered from rain gauges and are analyzed to evaluate the presence of temporal trends. Ground displacements are obtained by applying the P-SBAS (Parallel Small BAseline Subset) to three datasets of Sentinel-1 images: T146 ascending orbit, and T51 and T124 descending orbits, for the period 2015-2020. The displacement series of the pixels located in areas mapped as landslides by the Italian Landslide Inventory and sited within rain gauge influence regions (defined as 10 km circular buffers) are studied. Those displacement series are analyzed and compared to the rainfall series to search for correlations, by employing statistical and non-parametric tests. In particular, two landslides are selected and investigated in detail. Significant results were obtained for the T124 descending orbit for both landslides, for a 3-day cumulative rainfall and a 7-day delay of the slope response. Challenges in the whole procedure are highlighted and possible solutions to overcome the raised problems are proposed. Given the replicability of the proposed quantitative procedure it might be applied to any study area.

TI  - Evaluation of forest landscape change and its impact on the distribution of Dipsas elegans in northern Ecuador
T2  - INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mira River basin in Ecuador has a high biodiversity. However, the intensive land-use has led to landscape changes and generated alterations in the distribution of species. This study evaluates the spatial patterns of the forest landscape and its impacts on the distribution of Dipsas elegans (Boulenger, 1986). Landsat satellite images of 1991, 2000, and 2017 have been used and landscape metrics have been generated for the evaluation of the forested landscape. Additionally, the analysis of the potential distribution of D. elegans has been performed using the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The results show a decrease in the forest cover of 235.726,96 ha (10,28%) and an annual deforestation rate of 0,44%. In addition, the native forest displays fragmentation due to the increase in the number of patches (1.249-1.741) and its density (0,23-0,33), because of agriculture advance and deforestation. D. elegans is mainly distributed in the middle basin, which is composed of native forest and other coverage with an area of 104.747 ha (19,6%). Habitat loss with respect to the distribution model accounts for 33.859,33 ha (32,32%), which shows that the species is susceptible to patch size reduction, edge, effects and habitat solation that threaten the specie ' s presence.

TI  - Mapping bathymetry and shallow water benthic habitats in inland and coastal waters with Sentinel-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of the water depth and benthic macroalgae composition in coastal and inland water bodies is important due to the high commercial and ecological value of these regions. Benthic habitat mapping by conventional methods provides good accuracy, but these methods are very expensive and limited by manpower and time factor, which is necessary for mapping large areas. Remote sensing methods significantly complement contact measurements and give additional information about the hard-to-reach areas. The usefulness of free Sentinel-2 data in bathymetry and habitat mapping has been demonstrated in clear oceanic waters. The aim of this study was to further test the suitability of Sentinel-2 imagery in creating maps of dominant benthic types, as well as in estimating ba-thymetry in optically complex marine and lake waters. Two study sites were selected to cover a representative range of optical variability -Lake Garda in northern Italy (an intermediate between clear ocean and optically very complex waters) and Viimsi peninsula on the Estonian side of the Gulf of Finland, in the Baltic Sea. The results show that Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m spatial resolution is suitable for bathymetry and habitat mapping in optically complex inland and coastal waters. Our results show that bathymetry mapping is suf-ficiently accurate in waters less than 4 m deep in the case of the Baltic Sea and up to 7 m deep in Lake Garda. In such depths, the R2 was above 0.93 in all four Sentinel-2 images used in the study. Bottom type mapping accuracy was in all cases over 73%, which is considered to be good, but due to the limited number of sampling points in both test sites, further studies are needed. The Sentinel-2 data quality and no cost of the imagery for users make it very useful for mapping bathymetry and shallow water habitats over large coastal areas or high number of lakes, espe-cially in hard to reach by in situ methods areas. Moreover, the frequent revisit time allows moving from one-off maps to mon-itoring of temporal changes happening in dynamic shallow in-land and coastal waters.

TI  - Determination of mating status of Lobesia botrana (Denis & Shiffermuller, 1776) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) using the sentinel female technique
T2  - Revista Chilena de Entomologia
M3  - Article
AB  - In Chile, Lobesia botrana is a pest submitted to a campaign of eradication/contention. Its management uses mating disruption (CS) as a fundamental control tool which is usually indirectly evaluated by the suppression of male captures in traps and/or by the fruit damage reduction in treated fields. However, the goal of mating disruption technique is to avoid mating. The current study provides the bases to use the "sentinel female" technique as a direct and alternative method to evaluate CS efficacy by measuring the percentage of mating in females. In studies conducted in laboratory, the age at post-emergence copulation from the pupa and the dimensions of the bursa copulatrix in virgin and mated females were evaluated in adult females. Additionally, two methods of virgin females' confinement (females with a tied wing or females in cages with restricted access) were evaluated, measuring the respective % copulation when exposed to virgin males, which was contrasted with unconfined virgin females. It was determined that the females mate before 48 hours after mating with a male. The bursa copulatrix of a virgin female measures 0.9 & PLUSMN; 0.03 mm long x 0.2 & PLUSMN; 0.01 mm wide, while in a mated female it measures 1.1 & PLUSMN; 0.5 x 0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.3 mm, which constitutes an objective criterion to determine the female mating status. Virgin females were able to mate in all treatments; 100% of the unconfined females copulated, 92% copulated with a tethered wing and 64% in cages. It is concluded that the method of confinement in cages works to directly evaluate the efficacy of CS.

AB  - The Las Piedras River sub-basin, located in the department of Cauca, Colombia, is very important for the region, especially for the capital (Popayan). This is because this sub-basin contributes around 68.17% of the water supply for the city. To guarantee continuity of this resource, good management of the Water Ecosystem Services (WES) must be carried out. To this aim, periodic environmental assessments of the water resource in the region are necessary. Such Environmental Assessment WES (EAWES) is possible when an accurate and up-to-date land cover map is available. However, obtaining such a product is quite complex due to the heterogeneous conditions both in the land cover and orography of the studied region. Another impacting factor is the weather conditions of the region, that make it difficult to access the areas and/or to acquire information for land cover mapping. This research proposes a robust model, based on deep learning and Sentinel-2 satellite images, able to perform a land cover classification with reliable accuracy (>90%) at a low computational cost. A variant of a LeNet Convolutional Neural Network has been used together with features extracted from original spectral bands, radiometric indices and a digital elevation map. Preliminary results show an Overall Accuracy of 95.49% in the training data and 96.51% in the validation one.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping for Road Corridors by Using a Combined Interferometry SAR and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - GEO-RISK 2023: INNOVATION IN DATA AND ANALYSIS METHODS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Geo-Risk - Advances in Theory and Innovation in Practice
CL  - Arlington, VA
AB  - Landslides comprise about 42% of the entire natural hazards in Indonesia, claiming one-third of the annual economic losses caused by natural disasters. To mitigate their severe impacts, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) with actual, continuous, and accurate information about landslide occurrences and their likelihood in a particular area is urgently needed. Therefore, this research presents a reliable landslide susceptibility mapping with combined interferometry synthetic aperture radar (In-SAR) and machine learning (ML) techniques. A new framework of LSM by using In-SAR and ML applied to road infrastructure was proposed. The framework begins with the acquisition of a satellite imaging-based digital elevation model (DEM) of a particular road corridor, in which the landslide contributing factors (slopes, natural drainage networks, lithology, and rainfall) were rendered and overlaid by using GIS. Then, the ML was used to rate those contributing factors to the actual landslide occurrences. In a parallel way, the In-SAR was employed to obtain the ground movements in the road corridor from a series of SAR images derived from the Sentinel-1. Interferograms were then generated to produce ground movement maps. By combining the ground movement maps from the In-SAR and landslide ratings maps from the ML, a landslide susceptibility map was created. The applicability of the framework was investigated through a case study of landslide susceptibility in West Sulawesi, Indonesia.

TI  - Measuring Food Security in the United States for More Than 25 years: History, Methods, Findings, and Opportunities.
T2  - Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This article sets the stage for the "25 Years of Food Security Measurement: Answered Questions and Further Research" conference, with support from the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture, by providing some history of federal food security measurement, summarizing notable findings, and reviewing selected special topics in analysis methods. The federal government uses food security surveys to monitor national progress toward reducing food insecurity and to evaluate federal nutrition assistance programs. For the monitoring purpose, there is a tension between focus (on a single authoritative measurement approach) and breadth (encompassing multiple tools or instruments suitable for diverse populations, contexts, and applications). For the program evaluation purpose, challenges include coordination with study designs capable of real causal estimation in the face of strong self-selection effects and tailored reference periods in survey questions that match the timing of program participation. Some analysis methods treat the food security survey items as distinct experiences of hardship, whereas others treat the food security survey items as windows on an underlying latent variable, a food insecurity score. The severity of food-related hardship may be assessed quantitatively by the number of distinct hardships reported, by the estimated value of a latent food insecurity score, or by the frequency of occurrence for sentinel hardships. Ongoing work investigates statistical approaches that are sufficiently simple for policy application and yet sufficiently flexible to accurately match the empirical survey evidence.

TI  - Scrutinizing Urbanization in Kathmandu Using Google Earth Engine Together with Proximity-Based Scenario Modelling
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Urbanization' refers to the expansion of built-up areas caused by several factors. This study focuses on the urbanization process in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Supervised classification was conducted in Google Earth Engine by using Landsat data for years 2001, 2011 and 2021. The random forest classifier with 250 trees was used for classification to generate land-cover map. A land-cover map of 2021 was used as base map in the InVEST tool for scenario modelling. An accuracy assessment with 20% of sample points was conducted with different metrics, such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, producer accuracy, and consumer accuracy. The results show an increment of built-up areas by around 67 km(2) over 20 years in a centrifugal pattern from the core district, converting agricultural and forest land. 'Forest' is still dominant land-use class, with an area of 177.97 km(2). Agricultural land was highly converted to urban area. The overall accuracy of this classification process ranged 0.96-1.00 for different years. The scenario modelling further elaborated an amiability of drastic shift in land-use classes to 'built-up', especially forest and agriculture, by around 33 km(2) and 66 km(2), respectively. This study recommends the consideration of ecological approaches during the planning process.

TI  - Detection and Mapping of Kochia Plants and Patches Using High-Resolution Ground Imagery and Satellite Data: Application of Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of Kochia weed is harmful to crop production. It can grow well in harsh conditions and is resistant to common herbicides like glyphosate. It causes stress to crops and spreads quickly, forming large patches. Early detection of Kochia is crucial for its effective control. However, it is challenging to detect Kochia due to its close resemblance with early-stage crops. As Kochia seeds are water and air-borne, these can also spread in the field from neighbouring farms. Therefore, Kochia needs to be managed both at the field as well as regional levels. Currently, object-based detection methods are used for Kochia detection at the field level, but there is still a lack of literature on mapping Kochia at a regional level. Our research proposes a methodology for accurately detecting, localizing and quantifying Kochia plants in fields using high-resolution RGB imagery. We also explore the potential of detecting Kochia patches at a regional level using satellite imagery. Our approach uses semantic segmentation techniques to process geotagged RGB images, allowing us to identify and quantify individual Kochia plants in the field. To ensure accurate detection, we have established a minimum Kochia density threshold based on the density of Kochia in RGB images. This threshold enables us to distinguish the spectral signature of satellite imagery pixels containing a high density of Kochia. We label the satellite imagery based on the geo-locations where Kochia density exceeds the threshold value. Our method has a 99% accuracy rate in detecting Kochia patches using multi-spectral satellite imagery with a density threshold of 40%. The semantic segmentation model trained on RGB imagery for in-field mapping has a mean intersection over union value of up to 0.8606. These results suggest pixel-level Kochia segmentation of satellite imagery can be performed more accurately if a pixel has more than 40% Kochia mix. Our study highlights the potential of using high-resolution RGB imagery and satellite data at the farm and regional levels for effective Kochia management. Detecting Kochia early and accurately can help prevent crop damage and ensure successful crop production.

T2  - PeerJ
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Background: The Galapagos sea lion, Zalophus wollebaeki, is an endemic and endangered otariid, which is considered as a sentinel species of ecosystem dynamics in the Galapagos archipelago. Mitochondrial DNA is an important tool in phylogenetic and population genetic inference. In this work we use Illumina sequencing to complement the mitogenomic resources for Zalophus genus-the other two species employed Sanger sequencing-by a complete mitochondrial genome and a molecular clock of this species, which is not present in any case.Materials and Methods: We used DNA obtained from a fresh scat sample of a Galapagos sea lion and shotgun-sequenced it on the Illumina NextSeq platform. The obtained raw reads were processed using the GetOrganelle software to filter the mitochondrial Zalophus DNA reads (16% survive the filtration), assemble them, and set up a molecular clock.Results: From the obtained 3,511,116 raw reads, we were able to assemble a full mitogenome of a length of 16,676 bp, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNA), and two ribosomal RNAs (rRNA). A time-calibrated phylogeny confirmed the phylogenetic position of Z. wollebaeki in a clade with Z. californianus, and Z. japonicus, and sister to Z. californianus; as well as establishing the divergence time for Z. wollebaeki 0.65 million years ago. Our study illustrates the possibility of seamlessly sequencing full mitochondrial genomes from fresh scat samples of marine mammals.

TI  - Temporal and spatial pattern of dust storms, their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and human health risk assessment in the dustiest region of the world
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the concentration and health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Abadan City under 4 different climatic conditions: normal days, dusty days, dust with northwesterly winds, and dust with southeasterly winds. It also determined the sources of aromatics and discussed the relationship between meteorological parameters and PAH concentrations. The spatiotemporal distribution of dust in the area was determined using the HYSPLIT (hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory) back trajectory model, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. For this purpose, sampling was performed for 70 days using an Omni device. The concentrations of 16 PAHs (USEPA) ranged from 46.22 to 90.96 ng/m(3). The highest concentration of high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs was 4-6 rings, of which 4 rings were predominant in all samples. PAH sources were identified using diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA), and it was shown that PAHs mainly originate from a mixture of sources, including vehicular emissions, petrol emissions, and traffic. Wind speed was negatively correlated with dust, except on dusty days. This result indicates a decrease in PAH concentrations when wind speed increases. On the other hand, the dust correlation with PAH was positive on normal days, but a negative correlation was observed on dusty days. This result was due to the lower concentration of PAHs from natural resources (such as dust source areas) vs. human resources (such as traffic and industry). PAH health risk assessment in Abadan City showed that the risk of carcinogenesis was higher on normal days and through skin contact. The probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) in all sampling conditions was potential in terms of carcinogenic risk (10(-4)-10(-6)). As a critical risk factor, relevant authorities should prevent, control, and reduce it.

TI  - Exploring barriers and pathways towards Sarawak 2030 skills condition: A causal layered analysis
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sarawak aspires to become a developed state in Malaysia by 2030. The Sarawak Digital Economy blueprint calls for the public sector to steer and facilitate a digital transformation to the industry, communities, and other stakeholders. Considering the infrastructures and technology that assent, it signifies the crucial need for the public sector to be equipped with the fitting skills and people strategies to effectively embark on this 2030 vision. Such skills condition needs to be addressed by relevant policy actors. Challenges to the condition pose in many layers (i.e., Litany, Systemic, Worldview, Metaphor). This paper seeks to explore the viewpoints of seven policy enablers on the barriers and pathways pertaining to the skills condition in the public sector for Sarawak 2030. Using Inayatullah's Causal Layered Analysis, the paper reveals the short-term vs long-term challenges and solutions to those conditions. Results suggest the urgent need for planning and a reconnection among public sector to improve the current skills condition. Findings are further discussed with a transformed future as a guiding description for Sarawak 2030. This paper contributes to understanding a condition within a context, towards conscious policymaking via futures study method. The study's scope and future directions are also discussed.

TI  - A New Spectral Harmonization Algorithm for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Reflectance Products Using Machine Learning: A Case Study for the Barents Sea (European Arctic)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - synergistic use of Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data products provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. However, the merging of data products from multisensors is often adversely affected by the difference in their spectral characteristics. In addition, the errors in the atmospheric correction (AC) methods further increase the inconsistencies in downstream products. This work proposes an improved spectral harmonization method for OLI and MSI-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products, which significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. We compared R(rs )retrieved via state-of-the-art AC processors, i.e., Acolite, C2RCC, and Polymer, against ship-based in situ R-rs observations obtained from the Barents Sea waters, including a wide range of optical properties. Results suggest that the Acolite-derived R-rs has a minimum bias for our study area with median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) varying from 9% to 25% in the blue-green bands. To spectrally merge OLI and MSI, we develop and apply a new machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model to near-simultaneous OLI and MSI images acquired in the years from 2018 to 2020. Compared to a conventional linear adjustment, we demonstrate that the spectral difference is significantly reduced from similar to 6% to 12% to similar to 2% to < 10% in the common OLI-MSI bands using the proposed BA model. The findings of this study are useful for the combined use of OLI and MSI R-rs products for water quality monitoring applications. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to other waters.

TI  - Complex-Valued End-to-End Deep Network With Coherency Preservation for Complex-Valued SAR Data Reconstruction and Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many different fields and attracted many interests. Several researchers attempted to apply deep learning models to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing, but it did not have the same breakthrough as the other fields, including optical remote sensing. SAR data are in complex domain by nature and processing them with real-valued (RV) networks neglects the phase component which conveys important and distinctive information. A complex-valued (CV) end-to-end deep network is developed in this study for the reconstruction and classification of CV-SAR data. Azimuth subaperture decomposition is utilized to incorporate physics-aware attributes of the CV-SAR into the deep model. Moreover, the correlation coefficient amplitude (coherence) of the CV-SAR images depends on the SAR system characteristics and physical properties of the target. This coherency should be considered and preserved in the processing chain of the CV-SAR data. The coherency preservation of the CV deep networks for CV-SAR images, which is mostly neglected in the literature, is evaluated in this study. Furthermore, a large-scale CV-SAR annotated dataset for the evaluation of the CV deep networks is lacking. A semantically annotated CV-SAR dataset from Sentinel-1 single look complex stripmap mode data [S1SLC_CVDL (complex-valued deep learning) dataset] is developed and introduced in this study. The experimental analysis demonstrated the better performance of the developed CV deep network for CV-SAR data classification and reconstruction in comparison with the equivalent RV model and more complicated RV architectures, as well as its coherency preservation and physics-aware capability.

TI  - Arguments for the existence of God: The discourse of Russian religious philosophy
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the topic of arguments of the existence of God in the works of Russian re-ligious philosophers of the second half of the 19th - the first half of the 20th century. This topic is found in the discourse of Russian religious philosophy in three variants: putting forward arguments for the existence of God, analysis of Kant's criticism of the proofs for the existence of God, statements about the meaninglessness of the proofs for religious consciousness. In all variants, there is an inextricable connection between Russian philosophers' argumenta-tion and their metaphysical propositions. The discourse of Russian religious philosophy itself should be considered a way of contextual demonstration of the significance of metaphysical propositions for religious consciousness. The topic was not only a moment of strengthening the epistemological status of religious knowledge in relation to scientific knowledge, but it had also the importance of philosophizing to form religious worldview. Using the examples of the analysis of both the proofs of the existence of God and their criticism, which is found in the works by S. N. Bulgakov, V. I. Nesmelov, V. S. Solovyov, E. N. Trubetskoy, B. N. Chicherin, and S. L. Frank, the pragmatics of their discourse is revealed - it was aimed not at finding some new ways to substantiate the existence of God with rational means, but at substantiating the necessity of religious faith for the human reason - the faith is not only the main element of re-ligious consciousness, but also a metaphysical principle of cognition of God. The study of the contexts of the appeal of Frank and other Russian philosophers to the topic of the ontological argument leads to the conclusion that such an appeal was associated with the demonstration of the relevance of their metaphysical constructions with the Christian religion.

TI  - RATIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF CREATIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN SCIENCE
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a reply to the article by A.M. Dorozhkin, S.V. Shibarshina "Epistemological Randomization, or On Creativity in Science". The comprehension of the general philosophical problems of sci-entific rationality is inextricably linked with the creative devel-opment of the world. An actual philosophical position can be formed on the basis of the intersection of several alternative ap-proaches. The first is connected with the understanding of ratio-nality as a special style of thinking of the epoch, in which the co-ordinate system of the worldview is set. Such rationality sets general ideas about the cognizability of the world, and forms methodological and theoretical scientific strategies. Rationality outlines the boundaries of a scientist's creative thought. Address-ing the problem of the rationality of scientific creativity involves the use of a second approach, on the basis of which we can talk about the use of a variety of logics in describing the world. At the same time, confidence in their connection with reality al-lows us to hope for the formation of a holistic description of the problem in the future. In this case, we are dealing with an act of cognitive activity, as a result of which our consciousness throws a rational construct as a network on a situation of uncertainty, ex-plaining and mastering it - the picture of the world is ordered. According to the third position, the evaluation of scientific results is flexible, plastic in nature: what is perceived as methodologically erroneous today may turn out to be a scientific discovery tomor-row. Thus, it can be stated that the creative thinking of the re-searcher is inscribed in certain cultural conditions of under-standing reality, and this situation has a rationally given meaning. At the same time, the human mind always strives beyond the lim-its of the definable and categorically set, with the help of ratio-nality, progressively groping the boundaries of the unknown and going beyond the limits of the possible.

TI  - The Use of Zebra Mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) as a Sentinel Species for the Microplastic Pollution of Freshwater: The Case of Beyhan Dam Lake, Turkey
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of microplastics (MPs) in several components of different ecosystems has aroused great concern and led to numerous studies on MP pollution. Although there has been an increasing number of these studies in aquatic ecosystems, no data about the MP pollution in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas 1771) living in Beyhan dam lake (Elazig, Turkiye) are available. This study aimed to investigate the presence of MPs in freshwater mussel species found in this water reservoir. The distribution and characterization of MPs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in zebra mussel (D. polymorpha) samples at four different stations. A significant difference in the MP presence between the 1st and 4th stations was observed (p < 0.05). A total of 52 MPs were determined in mussels collected from different stations in Beyhan Dam Lake. A total of 18 MPs of this total (1.80 +/- 0.92 MP/individual) were obtained in station 1 and 7 of them (0.70 +/- 0.82 MP/individual) were from the 4th station. Results of the MP investigation showed that the dominant color was black, the common size range was 1001-2000 mu m, the dominant polymer shape was fiber, and the main polymer type was polypropylene (PP). A positive correlation was found among total MP and factors (length, tissue weight, and MP/individual). The detection of MPs in a freshwater mussel of the Beyhan dam lake can be suggested as a threat indicator and offers the possibility of using D. polymorpha as a bioindicator in the aquatic ecosystems' MP pollution.

TI  - The problem of transformation of the social functions of ritual in modern culture
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to trace the transformation of the ritual in modern society using the example of initiation rituals. The result of solving this problem is the classification of the main social functions of the ritual. The distinguishing or grouping function of the ritual is expressed in education and upbringing for the upcoming social role of the individual; it develops especially important personal qualities, norms and motives accepted by the community. The function of social memory is one of the conditions for the collective life of a community: ritual participants experience past events as real, which allows them to reproduce historical cultural experience. The ritual, expressing and transmitting to the participants the view of the whole society on the world, deity, man, thereby performs the worldview function. The ritual can gradually take in new elements and new meanings brought in by the demands of the time. The modern society of consumerism and digital networks is re-interpreting the ritual. The ritual goes to the level of tradition, a beautiful ceremony; it is divided into separate actions, which are then introduced into everyday life. There is a process of the reverse transition of the sacred into the ordinary, and the ritual degrades. Archaic rituals accompanying the birth of a person are intended to construct a transition from the dead to the alive. A newborn baby is attributed to the inanimate world by assigning to it the quality of sacred impurity, thus an object of ritual action appears, which can be considered the first stage of the ritual - the stage of objectification. The second part of the ritual is a test, this is a kind of an empirical stage, during which the baby is subjected to a detailed examination, the performance of all parts of its body is checked; it is washed and dressed in diapers. Swaddling makes the newborn look like a dead man wrapped in a shroud. The third stage of the ritual is the naming, which performs the most important function of initiation - the function of socialization. For naming, they chose the name that used to be in the family, thereby the baby became the successor of the family tree. The modern secular initiation ritual of a newborn includes: picking up the baby from the hospital; dressing in cloth with a ribbon, which is a reference to the shroud; obtaining a state document confirming the baby's birth. Thus, the secular ritual carries neither sacred nor emotional overtones, it only confirms that a new individual has appeared in the community. Nevertheless, leaving the category of the sacred, the ritual continues to perform a social function.

TI  - DETERMINING THE DEFORMATIONS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE AFTER THE EARTHQUAKES IN TURKEY-SYRIA OF 06 FEBRUARY 2023-INITIAL RESULTS
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Two devastating earthquakes of magnitude M-W 7.8 and M-W 7.5 hit Turkey on February 6, 2023. The earthquakes occurred in the East Anatolian Fault Zone, westwards of Gaziantep, Turkey. The quake was followed by intensive aftershock activity. This study presents initial results from interferometric processing of SAR data from the European Space Agency Sentinel-1 mission revealing the affected area and the magnitude of the deformations that occurred after the earthquakes. The produced maps are combination of data from several sources. Data of the epicenters of the events are from EMSC1, and the active faults are from EDAF(2), both considered to be the driving forces of these ground movements. SAR data were used to produce information showing the actual surface displacements. It needs to be highlighted that the said information reflects not the consequences of the single seismic event but the effect of all earthquakes that took place in the investigated region between the dates of registration by the SAR instrument. In this paper, the presented results are only part of the larger set of interferograms and maps of the derived from them vertical displacements.

TI  - Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for Classifying Landforms in Satellite Images
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing has great potential for detecting many natural differences, such as disasters, climate changes, and urban changes. Due to technological advances in imaging, remote sensing has become an increasingly popular topic. One of the significant benefits of technological advancement has been the ease with which remote sensing data is now accessible. Physical and spatial information is detected by remote sensing, which can be described as the process of identifying distinctive characteristics of an environment. Resolution is one of the most important factors influencing the success of the detection processes. As a result of the resolution being below the necessary level, features of the objects to be differentiated become incomprehensible and therefore constitute a significant barrier to differentiation. The use of deep learning methods for classifying remote sensing data has become prevalent and successful in recent years. This study classified Satellite images using deep learning and machine learning methods. Based on the transfer learning strategy, a parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed in the study. To improve the feature mapping of an image, convolutional branches use pre-trained knowledge of the transmitted network. Using the offline augmentation method, the raw data set was balanced to overcome its unbalanced class distribution and increased network performance. A total of 35 classes of landforms have been studied in the experiments. The accuracy value of the developed model in the classification study of landforms was 97.84%. According to experimental results, the proposed method provides high classification accuracy in detecting landforms and outperforms existing studies.

TI  - Complementing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for Pacific peoples in New Zealand
T2  - JOURNAL OF PACIFIC RIM PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivery to Pacific peoples by exploring Pacific psychologists' perspectives. The research was qualitative in its approach, using the Pacific methodology of "talanoa." The study carried out two face-to-face focus-group interviews using the talanoa method. Initially, nine participants expressed their interest in the study. However, five participants did not attend the interviews. Three participants participated in the first focus group discussion, and one participant participated in the second focus group, which resulted in an individual interview. All four participants were clinically trained psychologists, with an average of 14 years of clinical experience. These participants worked continuously with Pacific service users in various mental health settings and private practice. The need to enhance the compatibility of CBT with the culture of Pacific peoples was highlighted throughout the study. From the psychologists' perspectives, there were significant challenges regarding the delivery of CBT among Pacific peoples. These included: accessibility barriers due to socioeconomic and financial stressors; funding constraints and the availability and affordability of therapy sessions; the appropriateness of treatment that needed to be tailored to suit Pacific peoples; and the lack of spiritual and cultural aspects of treatment. The results of the study provide preliminary validation for the efficacy of CBT among Pacific peoples. There is an increasing awareness that delivering culturally relevant and appropriate care to Pacific peoples living in New Zealand requires a deeper understanding of valuing the realities and unique experiences they bring both collectively and individually. Ultimately, the findings provide significant insight into the barriers to the efficacy of CBT and strategies to overcome these.

TI  - FlexibleNet: A New Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network Model for Estimating Carbon Sequestration Qualitatively Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many heavy and lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require large datasets and parameter tuning. Moreover, they consume time and computer resources. A new lightweight model called FlexibleNet was created to overcome these obstacles. The new lightweight model is a CNN scaling-based model (width, depth, and resolution). Unlike the conventional practice, which arbitrarily scales these factors, FlexibleNet uniformly scales the network width, depth, and resolution with a set of fixed scaling coefficients. The new model was tested by qualitatively estimating sequestered carbon in the aboveground forest biomass from Sentinel-2 images. We also created three different sizes of training datasets. The new training datasets consisted of six qualitative categories (no carbon, very low, low, medium, high, and very high). The results showed that FlexibleNet was better or comparable to the other lightweight or heavy CNN models concerning the number of parameters and time requirements. Moreover, FlexibleNet had the highest accuracy compared to these CNN models. Finally, the FlexibleNet model showed robustness and low parameter tuning requirements when a small dataset was provided for training compared to other models.

TI  - Evaluation of Giresun city parks for accessibility
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate Giresun city parks in terms of urban accessibility. In this direction, by drawing attention to the environmental factors affecting the accessibility of the city, the ideal park standards, land structure, demographic characteristics, and the sufficiency of public transportation facilities were tried to be determined.Theory and Methods: In this study, Giresun city parks (43) were addressed in terms of urban accessibility. In order to carry out the study, 8 different analysis studies were made, which were thought to shed light on similar studies and were mentioned in detail, using the relevant law, institution, and literature resources and standard values. For this purpose, ArcGIS and NetCAD software and satellite image of WorldView-2 satellite were used.Results: In the study, 24 playgrounds, 14 neighbourhood parks, 4 urban parks, and 1 sports area in the city were defined. The ideal service radius for city parks was 200 m for playgrounds, 500 m for neighbourhood parks, 800 m for city parks and sports areas, while a suitable walking distance for 1 min was calculated as 80 m. In addition, according to the final accessibility area of 829 ha, it was determined that accessibility to parks from 65% of the city was provided, but when an evaluation was made in terms of the high-slope land structure, which was seen as the biggest obstacle in ensuring accessibility, the ratio of the area with slopes higher than 8% was found to be 61%.Conclusion: As a result, suggestions were developed for the evaluation of parks and it was determined that the biggest obstacle in ensuring urban accessibility was the slope of the land. In line with the data obtained, a proposed park map for the city was with analysis applications that can be used in urban design and planning studies. Thus, it is thought that spaces that improve the urban life quality may emerge.

TI  - Road Surface Roughness Estimation Using Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Road surface roughness is a major factor that is responsible for the skid resistance of vehicles and, thus, road safety. Therefore, it needs to be monitored regularly to ensure that the roughness values are in the optimal range and to perform maintenance actions when needed. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter is sensitive to surface roughness and can provide large-scale estimates of road surface roughness. In this letter, a semiempirical model for estimating road surface roughness using high-resolution spaceborne X-band SAR datasets from Germany's TerraSAR-X (TS-X) satellite is proposed for the first time. The method is capable of handling the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spaceborne SAR. To enhance the reliability of the results obtained from rather low SNR datasets, techniques, such as SNR thresholding, multi-dataset fusion, and automatic road extraction, were implemented. The study's results show good agreement with ground-truth (GT) data.

AB  - The present work demonstrates a landslide hazard zonation technique based on a machine learning algorithm of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost). The XGboost algorithm uses a multi-parameter indices function as an input, namely Slope, Aspect, Curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Rainfall and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These indices were systematically investigated using ALOS PALSAR DEM image (12.5m resolution), rainfall from WorldClim data and Landsat-5 data for NDVI mapping. Initially, the hierarchical selection of the causative factors was carried out within the XGBoost algorithm, which revealed the variable importance of each causative factor to be used for the parameterization of the landslide potential index (LPI). LPI mapping indicated five different classes of landslide zonation, which were tested using the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The AUC (Area under the curve) yielded a value of 0.91, indicating a robust performance of the ROC in terms of a true positive rate. A significantly larger spatial extent of the study area was found in moderate to high zones along the road, indicating the potential impact of governing causative factors of landslide vulnerability.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of Debris-Covered Glacier Surface Velocity and Ice Thickness of Mt.Tomur, Tian Shan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mt.Tomur glaciers, in the Tian Shan mountains of Western China, are usually debris-covered, and due to climate change, glacial hazards are becoming more frequent in this region. However, no changes in the long-time series of glacier surface velocities have been observed in this region. Conducting field measurements in high-altitude mountains is relatively difficult, and consequently, the dynamics and driving factors are less studied. Here, image-correlation offset tracking using Landsat images was exploited to estimate the glacier surface velocity of glaciers in the Mt.Tomur region from 2000 to 2020 and to assess glacier ice thickness. The results show that the glacier surface velocity in the Mt.Tomur region showed a significant slowdown during 2000-2020, from 6.71 +/- 0.66 m a(-1) to 3.95 +/- 0.66 m a(-1), an overall decrease of 41.13%. The maximum glacier ice thickness in the Mt.Tomur region was estimated based on the ice flow principle being 171.27 +/- 17.10 m, and the glacier average thickness is 50.00 +/- 5.0 m. Glacier thickness at first increases with increasing altitude, showing more than 100 +/- 10 m ice thickness between 3400 m and 4300 m, and then decreases with further increases in altitude. The reliability of the surface velocity and ice thickness obtained from remote sensing was proved using the measured surface velocity and ice thickness of Qingbingtan glacier No. 72 stall (the correlation coefficient R-2 > 0.85). The debris cover has an overall mitigating effect on the ablation and movement rate of Qingbingtan Glacier No. 72; however, it has an accelerating effect on the ablation and movement rate of glacier No. 74.

TI  - A Fast Piecewise-Defined Neural Network Method to Retrieve Temperature and Humidity Profile for the Vertical Atmospheric Sounding System of FengYun-3E Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fast piecewise-defined neural network (PDNN) method is presented to produce accurate atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from satellite hyperspectral infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) observations in all-sky conditions. The PDNN method relies on a novel classification approach and a principal component-based neural network (NN) function to better capture the nonlinear relationship between the spectral radiances and atmospheric state vectors. The algorithm was designed to only rely on satellite measurements. Large datasets were used for network training to make the retrieval robust to random errors in the reference data. For each retrieved profile, an effective quality indicator (QI) was obtained by training against the absolute value of the retrieval error. In addition, a reliable rain cloud flag was generated based on the scattering difference of cloud particles between the 50 and 118 GHz channels. Besides the independent reanalysis of field data, the algorithm's performance was also evaluated using radiosonde measurements. Preliminary validation shows that the best temperature retrieval occurred in the mid-troposphere (around 1.0 K). Depending on the reference data, errors in the boundary layer typically ranged from 1.8 to 2.5 K. For water vapor, the retrieval error was less than 22% in the low-troposphere and less than 35% in the mid- and upper-troposphere when validated against the reanalysis field. The humidity error was approximately 10% lower when compared to radiosondes. The PDNN is used operationally to produce atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings from the Vertical Atmospheric Sounding System (VASS) of the FengYun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, an early-morning-orbit meteorological satellite launched in 2021.

TI  - Spatial Difference in Labor Productivity between Beijing and the Wider South East Region of England
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the differences in labor productivity between the Wider South East region of England (WSE) (including London, the east, and the south east of England) and Beijing in an attempt to establish the reasons for the difference based on the deformation of the Cobb-Douglas production function proposed by Brandt et al. and the shift-share method. We use data from multiple sources, including remote sensing data, to reproduce smaller-scale spatial data of urban boundaries, urban land structures, and urban traffic structures. We found that there is not only a gap in productivity between Beijing and the WSE but also a more significant regional gap in productivity among Beijing's districts. From the perspective of the role of production factors, Beijing's productivity improvement over the past ten years has mainly depended on the total factor productivity and capital. To ensure the sustained growth of Beijing's productivity, we should pay attention to the geographical differences in labor productivity and the improvement of labor productivity throughout the entire urban area. Moreover, we should focus on the production factors that can accelerate the growth of labor productivity.

TI  - Maize Yield Prediction with Machine Learning, Spectral Variables and Irrigation Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting maize yield using spectral information, temperature, and different irrigation management through machine learning algorithms provide information in a fast, accurate, and non-destructive way. The use of multispectral sensor data coupled with irrigation management in maize allows further exploration of water behavior and its relationship with changes in spectral bands presented by the crop. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, by means of multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques, the relationship between irrigation management and spectral bands in predicting maize yields. Field experiments were carried out over two seasons (first and second seasons) in a randomized block design with four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and eighteen sample repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation indices (IVs) and crop yield (GY). Measurement of spectral wavelengths was performed with the Sensefly eBee RTK, with autonomous flight control. The eBee was equipped with the Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor acquiring reflectance at the wavelengths of green (550 nm +/- 40 nm), red (660 nm +/- 40 nm), red-edge (735 nm +/- 10 nm), and NIR (790 nm +/- 40 nm). The blue length (496 nm) was obtained by additional RGB imaging. Data were subjected to Pearson correlations (r) between the evaluated variables represented by a correlation and scatter plot. Subsequently, the canonical analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship between the variables evaluated. Data were also subjected to machine learning (ML) analysis, in which three different input dataset configurations were tested: using only irrigation management (IR), using irrigation management and spectral bands (SB+IR), and using irrigation management, spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp). ML models used were: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), M5P Decision Tree (J48), REPTree Decision Tree (REPT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A multiple linear regression (LR) was tested as a control model. Our results revealed that Random Forest has higher accuracy in predicting grain yield in maize, especially when associated with the inputs SB+IR and SB+IR+Temp.

TI  - Lightweight Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Filling of Data Gaps in Sea Surface Temperature Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remotely sensed data often have data gaps due to cloud coverage, which hinders their full potential in many environmental applications. The question of how to accurately and effectively reconstruct the measurements in the data gaps remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model with a novel and adaptable custom temporal penalty layer for spatiotemporal gap filling. The model was trained and tested in time-series daily nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) images acquired by the Himawari-8 satellite. The modeling results showed strong performance, accurately reconstructing spatial and temporal features of cloud-affected SST data. Our neural network achieved a per-image MAE of 0.1193 ? and per-image root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1293 ?. The model was also able to produce realistic SST time-series predictions that were consistent with the expected seasonal variables. Importantly, the BiLSTM model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art simple spatial gap-filling processor (SSGP) algorithm in terms of error metrics, structural similarity (SSIM), and computational efficiency. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the BiLSTM neural network model we developed is highly suitable for spatiotemporal gap filling of SST and other remotely sensed data.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nowadays, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is still a major global cause of death. Indonesia is a country with a high burden of the disease and is ranked second as a contributor to tuberculosis in the world after India, China, the Philippines, and Pakistan [1] along with the phenomenon of deforestation [2] and global warming [3]. Forest restoration and reforestation are considered cost-effective nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, provide habitat for species and balance temperatures.Methods: There is no research data on the contribution of the economic value of reforestation to reduce the incidence rate of infectious diseases especially for TB, which is very important for mitigating against the global warming. This research was conducted to determine the economic value of ecosystem services as compensation for the reforestation program. This research was carried out in Lampung Province from April to October 2021, using Landsat imagery series 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2019 to detect forest cover.Results: The study's findings show that every 2oC increase in temperature increases the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis by 1.5 per 10,000 population, or 3,770 cases cover class that has a significant effect on the incidence of pulmonary TB is temperature, state forests, community forests, bare land, and rice fields.Conclusions: The valuation of forest environmental services in Lampung Province with human capital through pulmonary tuberculosis medical cost approach techniques for forest mitigation costs is IDR 20.113.458.000 /year.

TI  - Features of Seasonal Variability of Chlorophyll a Concentration in Different Regions of the Southern Atlantic Based on Satellite Data
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Based on the long-term satellite optical measurements, the work is to study seasonal variability of the chlorophyll a concentration on the sea surface in different regions of the Southern Atlantic, determine its spatial features, identify the areas where the values of the chlorophyll a concentration are maximum, and to analyze the reasons for its increase in these regions.Methods and Results. The data on the chlorophyll a concentration obtained from the MODIS-Aqua measurements for 2002-2019 in the region 30 degrees-80 degrees S, 70 degrees W - 25 degrees E were used. Spatial variability of the surface chlorophyll a concentration, its seasonal dynamics and the time of the seasonal peak occurrence were studied. Four zones of local maxima of the chlorophyll a concentration were identified (the Argentinean shelf, the islands of South Georgia, the area of water removal from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Antarctic shelf east of the Weddell Sea); for each of them the features of seasonal variability were analyzed in details.Conclusions. In agreement with the previous papers, the peak chlorophyll a concentration and the beginning of bloom in the regions under study are observed later than in the high latitudes: in the northern part - in November - December, and in the southern one - in January - February. The exception consists in the quite extensive areas to the east of the nutrients powerful sources (islands, shelf waters), where the time of occurrence of the chlorophyll a concentration peak values is related to the advection impact, that results in its arising with a delay which is required for transferring the nutrients by the currents. The basic factors promoting appearance of the areas with the increased chlorophyll a concentrations are the interaction between the topography features and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts, and ice melting in the marginal zone.

TI  - Names of colour in V. Nabokov's bilingual worldview (based on the original and self-translated texts of the novel<i> Lolita)</i>
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-YAZYK I LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the current problem of studying bilingual authors' idiolects in colour aspect. This research aims to identify the features of Vladimir Nabokov's lingua-colour world-view associated with the use of English and Russian in self-translation. Lists of colouremes of the original and translated Lolita are made; their part-of-speech facet is analyzed; dominant coloronyms are identified and compared; structural peculiarities of the selected colours in both lists are studied. The novelty of the work lies in the creation of English and Russian lexicons and frequency dictionaries of representatives of Nabokov's color worldview, which gives objective data about the linguistic personality basing on idiolect. Along with quantitative method, the work uses the method of systematic scientific description, via which the multi-dimensional systematization of empirical material is conducted and the comparative method implemented in observation, comparison and interpretation techniques for the received lan-guage data. The article notes both common and specific features in the two color lexicons. With a comparable number of English and Russian colouremes, the translation language is more coloristic. Part-of-speech differences of colours are noted. In complete lists chromatic designations predominate, they are more frequent in Russian. Among the dominants ach-romatic colors outweigh, English achromatisms prevail. Numerous hapaxes and complex coloremes, rarely equivalent, contribute to the palette diversity. The main causes of incon-sistencies are identified. The author comes to the conclusion that the ways of lexicalizing the color perceptions of the bilingual writer-translator are modified when switching to the target language that indicates differences in Nabokov's worldview.

TI  - The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty
T2  - MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
M3  - Book Review
AB  - This article is dedicated to the discussion of Daron Acemoglu , James Robinson's book "The Narrow Corridor", which presents a distinctive theoretical justification of the primacy of democratic institutions in constructing a progressive society and universal welfare. In addition to providing a structural representation of the concept of the narrow corridor, the article addresses the logical contradictions within the concept itself. Specifically, it demonstrates that the new theory cannot explain the Cicero Paradox, where at a certain historical stage, the most advanced mixed institutional configuration of state governance-the republic-is replaced by the most primitive pure form-the empire. The article argues that Acemoglu and Robinson's lack of distinction between formal and informal institutions in their concept of the narrow corridor leads to numerous logical collisions in their worldview. Theoretical theses and contemporary historical facts ignored by the narrow corridor are discussed. Firstly, the authors assume an abstract state in the form of a Despotic Leviathan and an equally abstract tyrant driven by a thirst for power, whereas in reality, the state is merely an apparatus with all its elements, an instrument of violence; the subject of power is the one holding this instrument, giving rise to a broad, unaccounted spectrum of interpretations of despotism. Secondly, the narrow corridor disregards the perpetual geopolitical confrontation of states and the fact that institutional building in a country does not occur in a vacuum but under the oppression of geopolitical rivals whose aim is to create obstacles to the development of the country in question. Thirdly, the entire texture of Acemoglu and Robinson's book neglects events from the past three to four years which have brought significant adjustments to our views of the world, such as the replacement of centuries-old political competition between the Republican and Democratic parties in the US with the political monopoly of the Democrats; the desecration of monuments to the founding fathers of America during the 2020 US presidential election, so on. Fourthly, the very notion of effective political , economic institutions in Acemoglu and Robinson's book does not consider political sovereignty, where the institutional efficiency of puppet states serves as a peculiar form of tribute to the global hegemon. The article argues that the new concept represents one of the latest attempts to construct comprehensive monocausal theories.

TI  - Entrapment and rupture of the guide wire during PTCA: case report and medico-legal considerations.
T2  - La Clinica terapeutica
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Background: In recent years, due to the increase of complaints for medical malpractice, the Sicilian Regional Health System has adopted proceedings for the direct management of claims by each healthcare facility with the aim of reducing costs of insurance premiums and their relative taxes. Thus this management has led to increased awareness and management of clinical risk through the introduction of mandatory sentinel event monitoring.Case report: A 55-year-old man with acute ischemic heart disease, due to three-vasal coronary diasease, underwent angioplasty perfomed on the second diagonal branch of the anterior descending artery. Simultaneously following the discovery of a major middle tract stenosis, he underwent further angioplasty surgery during which guidewire entrapment occurred, precisely in the proximal section of the vessel, resulting in the rupture and persistence of some fragments despite attempts to extract them. Subsequent antiplatelet therapy was prescribed and no further procedures were indicated for the removal of the guide wire, meanwhile a persistent reactive anxious-depressive state was established.Conclusion: The medico-legal analysis of the case excluded liabilty since it was a fortuitous, unpredictable and inevitable event. However, the patient had not been adequately informed about the possibility of the complication presented, which resulted in prolonged hospitalization and compensation for the psychological disorder suffered as a result of the adverse event. The attempted economic agreement was unsuccessful. A civil lawsuit was subsequently filed by the patient and the Judge's report confirmed the corporate CMC assessment and ruled out that the side effects related to the guideline fragment.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy Using Tilmanocept Detects Multiple Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Melanoma Patients
T2  - CANCER CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTechnetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept, a multivalent mannose, is readily internalized by the CD206 surface receptor on macrophages and dendritic cells which are abundantly present in lymph nodes. We want to examine the drainage patterns of Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in melanoma patients following the 10% rule.MethodsMulti-center retrospective review of patients with cutaneous melanoma undergoing SLN biopsy using Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept between 2008 and 2014 was conducted. Statistical methods were used for data analyses.ResultsOf the 564 patients (mean age of 60.3 and 62% male) with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy showing at least one SLN, several primary tumor sites were included: 27% head/neck, 33% trunk, 21% upper extremity and 19% lower extremity. For the head/neck primary site, 36.5% of patients had multiple draining basins; for the trunk site, 36.4% of patients; for the upper extremity site, 13% of patients; and for the lower extremity, 27.4% of patients. A median of 3 (range 1-18) SLNs were identified and resected. Overall, 78% of patients had >1 SLN identified by Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept. In a multivariate model, patients with >1 SLN were significantly associated with age, Breslow depth, tumor location and higher AJCC tumor stage. A total of 17.7% of patients (100/564) had a positive SLN identified. A total of 145 positive SLNs were identified out of 1,812 SLNs with a positive SLN rate of 8%. Positive SLN status was significantly associated with younger age, greater Breslow depth, mitosis rate, higher AJCC tumor stage, presence of ulceration and angiolymphatic invasion.ConclusionsUsing the 10% rule, Technetium-99m-labeled Tilmanocept detects multiple SLNs in most melanoma patients.

TI  - Green algae monitoring via ground-based GNSS-R observations
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of harmful algal blooms (HABs) exhibit high frequency, large range and damage aggravation characteristics, but existing monitoring methods, such as artificial and optical near-infrared remote sensing, cannot accommodate these characteristics. We propose a new method for monitoring green algae using Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) observations. The basic principle states that changes in the seawater dielectric constant and sea surface roughness due to the emergence of green algae lead to an increase in brightness temperature, which can be inverted based on the reflection time delay waveform. Shipboard reflection waveform data collected during an Enteromorpha prolifera outbreak in the Qingdao sea area were used for model development and validation of the detection and estimation performance. The results indicated that the root mean square error of GNSS-R-based inversion of the green algae density was 6.74%, indicating the potential of GNSS-R technology for rapid preliminary monitoring of green algae. Moreover, the advantages of a low cost, short return time and no climatic limitations support GNSS-R technology as a new and efficient means of green algae monitoring.

AB  - High-resolution Forest biophysical parameter estimation is crucial to understand forest structural and functional variability. Moreover, mapping high-resolution biophysical products is significant to capture accurate forest carbon fluxes and understand seasonal variability. The existing biophysical products are coarse in spatial resolution and unable to capture intra-annual variability. In this study, we proposed a random forest machine learning approach embedded in Google Earth Engine to retrieve three major forest biophysical parameters. The training samples were distributed in a 70:30 ratio for model training and validation. The outcome of the work shows promising results that hold a good agreement with SNAP-derived biophysical variables, whereas the agreement is moderate-to-poor for MODIS and VIIRS biophysical products. As shown in the model, NIR performs as the most sensitive band for forest biophysical estimation. We believe our proposed approach would significantly support the existing methods for improved high-resolution forest biophysical component estimation.

CL  - Msida, MALTA
AB  - With the rapid development of space technology, numerous applications are being developed utilising satellite imagery data, including environmental monitoring, meteorology and map making, mapping and monitoring the Earth's resources ecosystems and observing various particles in space. The satellite data can be analysed with the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Satellite data deliver the signal for information about the surface and surrounding changes in a location on the Earth. The satellite image quality of the target surface depends on many factors, including atmospheric circumstances, the direction of lighting source, scattering of the target and path view of the surface arena. All performance of different observatory technologies depends on whether the data is gathering through a passive or an active remote sensing method. The limitation of satellite images is their very low spatial a temporal resolution, making it challenging to use them for many practical applications. This research proposes to review the literature to critically analyse existing approaches to improve the resolution of satellite images. A novel technique will be developed and evaluated based on the fusion of satellite imagery data collection from various satellites to improve a target surface's spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Correction of Satellite Sea Surface Salinity Products Using Ensemble Learning Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although salinity satellites can provide high-resolution global sea surface salinity (SSS) data, the satellite data still display large errors close to the coast. In this paper, a nonlinear empirical method based on random forest is proposed to correct two Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 products in the tropical Indian Ocean, including SMOS BEC and SMOS CATDS data. The agreement between in-situ data and the corrected SMOS data is better than that between in-situ data and the original satellite data. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the satellite SSS data decreased from 0.366 to 0.275 and from 0.367 to 0.255 for SMOS BEC and SMOS CATDS, respectively. The effect of the correction model was better in the Arabian Sea than in the Bay of Bengal. The RMSD of corrected BEC (CATDS) SSS was reduced from 0.44 (0.48) to 0.276 (0.269), and the correlation coefficient was increased to 0.915 from 0.741(0.801) in the Arabian Sea while the correlation coefficient improved less than 0.02 in the Bay of Bengal. The cross-validation results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the correction model. Additionally, the effects of different features on the correction model are discussed to demonstrate the vital role of geographical information in the correction of satellite SSS data. The proposed method outperformed other machine-learning methods with respect to the RMSD and correlation coefficient.

TI  - Satellite-Based Analysis of Spatiotemporal Wildfire Pattern in the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burned area is a critical input to biomass burning carbon emissions algorithms and for understanding variability in fire activity due to climate change. This study presents the spatial and temporal patterns of wildland fires in the Mongolian Plateau (MP) using Collection 6 NASA MCD64A1 500 m global Burned Area product from 2001 to 2021. Both inter- and intra-annual fire trends and variations in two subregions, Mongolia and China's Inner Mongolia, were analyzed. The results indicated that an average area of 1.3 x 10(4) km(2) was consumed by fire per year in the MP. The fire season has two peaks: spring (March, April, and May) and autumn (September, October, and December). The profiles of the burnt area for each subregion exhibit distinct seasonality. The majority of wildfires occurred in the northeastern and southwestern regions of the MP, on the border between Mongolia and China. There were 2.7 x 10(4) km(2) of land burned by wildfires in the MP from 2001 to 2021, 57% of which occurred in spring. Dornod aimag (province) of Mongolia is the most fire-prone region, accounting for 51% of the total burned area in the MP, followed by Hulunbuir, at 17%, Sukhbaatar, at 9%, and Khentii at 8%. The changing patterns of spatiotemporal patterns of fire in the MP were analyzed by using a spatiotemporal cube analysis tool, ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2. The results suggested that fires showed a decreasing trend overall in the MP from 2001 to 2021. Fires in the southern region of Dornod aimag and eastern parts of Great Xing'an Mountain showed a sporadic increasing trend. Therefore, these areas should be priorities for future fire protection for both Mongolia and China.

TI  - Estimation of flooded areas on Frio river basin (Costa Rica) using polarimetry with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) of Sentinel 1A imagery
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry is a remote sensing technique known for being applied to monitoring of land surface and water bodies. Polarimetry aims at charactering the land surface through the analysis of its response under different combinations of transmitting and receiving an-tennas polarization, called polarimetric channels. The use of cross-polarization (vertical/horizontal) proved to be efficient for estimating the extent of the floods between July 22nd and July 30th in the Frio river basin (Costa Rica). To that end, Sentinel-1 images from the European Space Agency have been used, with a workflow process and RGB composition that allowed to draw a clear distinction between flooded and permanent water bodies. The use of optical imagery for flood mapping is limit-ed by weather conditions, specially by the presence of clouds. SAR measurements are independent of daytime and weather conditions, providing valuable information for monitoring flood events. Furthermore, flood extent is a critical factor for the calibration and validation of hydraulic models (Horritt, 2006). Flood extent can be also used for damage assessment and risk management and can be of benefit to rescuers during flooding (Corbley, 1999).

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Non-typhoidal salmonellosis (NTS) is one of the most common foodborne diseases worldwide. In this study, we aimed to analyze trends in the epidemiology of NTS in the last decade in Israel. Laboratory-confirmed cases of NTS at eight sentinel laboratories were reported to the Israel Sentinel Laboratory-Based Surveillance Network, integrated with the serotype identification performed at the Salmonella National Reference Laboratory of the Ministry of Health. The decrease in NTS incidence since 1999 continued between 2010 and 2014 (16.1 per 100,000 in 2014) and was interrupted by a rise between 2015 and 2017 (39.1 per 100,000 in 2017) associated with outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis. The incidence of NTS dropped again thereafter (21.4 per 100,000 in 2021). The 0-4 age group was the most affected by NTS (55.5% of the cases) throughout the surveillance period. The age-adjusted incidence rates were consistently high in the summer months (June-September) and low in the winter months (December-February). The overall decrease in the incidence of NTS in Israel since 1999 was temporarily interrupted in the last decade by country-wide outbreaks involving emerging or re-emerging Salmonella serotypes. Control measures should be enhanced for all risk points of food chain transmission of Salmonella spp. to further reduce the NTS morbidity in Israel.

TI  - A THEORY TOWARDS A BUILT-IN-VARIETY IN MUSEUM DESIGN: THE "CAPRICCIO MUSEUM"
T2  - PROSTOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents an excerpt from the extensive research on various museal spaces throughout human history. By re-evaluating the imaginative procedures involved in conceiving those spaces, the research in its broadest scope asks: how do we map, rethink and revive the historically valuable assets of architectural thought without "museumising" them? The excerpt is initially dedicated to the neoclassical museum space based upon the notion of the frame that was already adopted by the painting genre capriccio to induce the spectator's mind into an architectural fantasy of juxtaposed real and fictitious buildings, archaeological ruins, urban and natural landscapes. In the neoclassical museum space, the capriccio "became alive" as an actual-size architectural fantasy that could be stepped into. Based upon multiple conceptual frames, the interconnected yet distinct architectural fragments illustrated the neoclassical worldview founded on inclusivity, synchronicity and bodily experience. This historical episode is further theorised into the capriccio museum, a new theoretical model that critically perceives multiple experience probabilities as distilled from the past and starts a process of conversion of that historical knowledge into transhistorical knowledge relevant for today.

TI  - POLLUTION DETECTION FOR THE SINGULAR LINEAR PARABOLIC EQUATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS & INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - . In this work, we are concerned by the problem of identification of noisy terms which arise in singular problem as for remote sensing problems, and which are modeled by a linear singular parabolic equation. For the reason of missing some data that could be arisen when using the traditional sentinel method, the later will be changed by a new sentinel method for attaining the same purpose. Such new method is a particular least square-like method which permits one to distinguish between the missing terms and the pollution terms. In particular, a sentinel method will be given here in its more realistic setting for singular parabolic problems, where in this case, the observation and the control have their support in different open sets. The problem of finding a new sentinel is equivalent to finding singular optimality system of the least square control for the parabolic equation that we solve.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation regrowth and spatial patterns and severity factors of wildfires in wildland-urban interface - the case of the large wildfire in Baiao (2019)
T2  - CADERNOS DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Portugal is one of the Southern European countries most affected by forest fires, with recurrent events and frequent impacts. The demographic and social changes that have occurred in rural areas have driven land abandonment in recent years, which, in turn, influences forest management and wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas that are related to fires. The aim of this work is to develop a case study in the municipality of Baiao based on the large wildfire (LWF) of 2019, by defining and mapping the WUI areas, evaluating the LWF recurrence and severity, and the vegetation regrowth in a period of 2 years in areas with different land uses affected by distinct fire severities. The study was organized into 4 stages: firstly, we mapped the fire occurrences and then the WUI areas. After fire mapping, the recurrence of wildfires was characterized and the last step corresponded to the evaluation of the severity of the LWF of 2019 and the evaluation of the vegetation regeneration, and different land use types. The WUI represents 26.7% of the territory of the municipality of Baiao. From 2001 to 2021, the municipality registered 3,770 fire occurrences. In 2019, the LWF of Baiao burned an area corresponding to 853 ha, which was affected by a total of 12 fires in the period between 1975 and 2019, resulting in a maximum degree of 11 recurrences for the same area. With regard to the direct impact of fire on vegetation and its subsequent recovery, we can see that 2 years after the LWF, the area occupied by the forest and shrub vegetation, which were hit by high severity, already showed significant levels of vegetation regrowth. As a main conclusion, the study contributes to widen the understanding of the patterns created by fire in different landscapes, and this information is valuable for forest managers to know the consequences (beneficial or not) and be able to plan prevention, restoration, and environmental education actions.

TI  - Comparative analysis of orbital sensors in soybean yield estimation by the random forest algorithm
T2  - CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has proven to be a promising tool allowing crop monitoring over large geographic areas. In addition, when combined with machine learning methods, the algorithms can be used for estimating crop yield. This study sought to estimate soybean yield through the enhanced vegetation index and normalized difference vegetation index. These vegetation indices were obtained using moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensors on AQUA and TERRA satellites and multispectral instrument (MSI) sensor on Sentinel-2 satellite. Random forest (RF) algorithm was used to predict soybean yield and the estimation models were compared with the actual plot's yield. The RF algorithm showed good performance to estimate soybean yield with our models (R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 0.50 for MSI; R2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 0.59 for MODIS). Vegetation indices with imaging dates corresponding to the crop's maturation had a higher degree of importance in its predictive ability. However, when comparing the actual and predicted soybean production values, differences of 145 kg ha-1 in contrast to 4 kg ha-1 were found for the MODIS and MSI models, respectively. Therefore, the MSI sensor integrated with machine learning algorithms accurately estimated crop yields.

TI  - [SENTIERI Project: air pollution and health impact of population living in industrial areas in Italy].
T2  - Epidemiologia e prevenzione
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to estimate the impact of PM2.5 and PM10 in the Italian industrial areas included in the SENTIERI project characterized by industrial plants with combustion processes deriving from point emissions.DESIGN: using satellite data, the Population Weighted Exposure (PWE) to PM2.5 and PM10 for 2011 and 2015 was estimated. The concentration-response functions available were used to estimate the number of premature deaths attributable to exposure to industrial emissions. The counterfactual levels recommended by the new WHO Air Quality Guidelines were used.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for the selection of industrial plants, the European database on emissions of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register was used. Residents in areas of 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km around the selected industrial plants were considered.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the number of premature deaths from non-accidental causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and lung cancer was estimated.RESULTS: residents were exposed to PM2.5 values of 17.3 g/m3 (Northern Italy: 23.3) and to 24.3 g/m3 (Northern Italy: 30.3) of PM10. PWE for both pollutants tends to increase as the size of the area under study is reduced and it is generally higher everywhere in 2011 than in 2015, with values that are always higher than the average (overall) in the Norther Italy. In 2011, 1,709 (IC95% 1,309-1,903) and 1,611 (IC95% 1,225-2,353) non accidental premature deaths were estimated attributable to PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, in residents close to the industrial plants (1 km x 1 km). Deaths attributable to exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 tend to follow a North-Central-South&Islands gradient for all observed causes and for both years of analysis.CONCLUSIONS: although exposure assessment of the population by using random-forest model does not allow to disentangle the contribution of the industrial component, the results of the study are suggestive of an impact on health from PM exposure in the industrial areas considered, with a greater impact in the vicinity of the plants, recommending the implementation of urgent impact reduction actions.

AB  - Accurate snow cover maps are an important tool in a large variety of applications including avalanche research. The WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) has developed a snow cover mapping system for the Dischma valley in Davos, based on ground-based cameras. Their goal has been to validate snow-cover maps derived from satellite data. In the currently implemented system, several steps require manual work. The goal of this paper is to automate SLF's approach by applying a deep learning framework. For the training of our models, we have access to data from multiple cameras mounted in the Dischma valley. In our approach, we first apply deep learning to perform fog classification and then to do pixel-wise snow segmentation. Unlike the current procedure our method is independent of image- and camera-specific thresholds. In our experiments, we compare a model that is trained on images from all cameras to camera-specific models for both tasks. For the fog classification, we aim for a higher recall to be able to detect most of the foggy images. We show that, when tuned to achieve the same precision as the baseline, our model improves recall by 17%. For the snow segmentation, we evaluate our models based on the F1-score. When using our fully automated machine learning model without any manually selected thresholds, we achieve a higher F1-score only for a part of the cameras in the valley, and on average, this comes at a cost of 2.3%. We also show that for the case of a new camera being mounted in the Dischma valley, our models for both tasks can still be used for that new camera and will achieve similar results compared to the currently mounted cameras.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF DIAGNOSTIC EXCISIONAL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY RESULTS: 12-YEAR EXPERIENCE OF A SINGLE CENTER
T2  - ACTA CLINICA CROATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node biopsy is indicated in patients with suspected malignancy or lymphadenopathy due to unclarified reasons. Lymph node biopsy can be performed as fine needle aspiration biopsy, core biopsy, or excisional lymph node biopsy. In particular, the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma is considered insufficient for oncological treatment unless classified into subgroups. Core biopsy and excisional biopsy can be performed to diagnose lymphoma and classify it into subgroups. Core biopsy may also be limited in some cases for the diagnosis of lymphoma. Therefore, patients are referred to surgical departments for excisional lymph node biopsy. It was aimed herein to analyze the results of excisional lymph node biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes in our department. Data on 73 patients having undergone diagnostic excisional lymph node biopsy at Sakarya University Medical Faculty Training and Research Hospital between January 2008 and January 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were evaluated in terms of age, gender, biopsy site, pathological diagnosis, number and diameter of lymph nodes excised. Patients younger than 18 years of age, those with sentinel lymph node biopsies, and lymph node dissections performed for any known malignancy were excluded from the study. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS statistical software. There were 37 (50.7%) female and 36 (49.3%) male patients, mean age 52.07 (18-90) years. Axillary lymph node biopsy was performed in 32 patients, inguinal lymph node biopsy in 29 patients, cervical lymph node biopsy in 3 patients, intra-abdominal lymph node biopsy in 6 patients, mediastinal lymph node biopsy in 1 patient, and supraclavicular lymph node biopsy in 2 patients. All of the lymph node biopsies were performed as excisional biopsy. Malignancy was detected in 36 (49.3%) patients. In 37 (50.3%) patients, the causes of lymphadenopathy were found to be benign pathologies. When the causes of malignant disease were examined, it was observed that 23 (31.5%) patients were diagnosed with lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma was detected in 5 patients diagnosed with lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was found in 18 patients. Metastatic lymphadenopathy was observed in 13 (17.8%) patients. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (26%) and lymphadenitis (20.5%) were found among the causes of benign lymphadenopathy. The number of excised lymph nodes was between 1 and 4, and their diameter was between 9 and 75 mm (mean: 29.53 & PLUSMN;15.56 mm). There was no statistically significant difference between benign and malignant patients according to gender, age, lymph node diameter, number of lymph nodes excised, and excisional lymph node biopsy site. For diagnostic lymph node biopsy, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core biopsy should be performed primarily. If lymphoma is suspected in the diagnosis, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not necessary. In this case, it is believed that it is more appropriate to perform core biopsy first. If the core biopsy is insufficient for diagnosis, it is more appropriate to perform surgical biopsy in order to cause no delay in diagnosis and treatment. Excisional biopsy is a method that can be safely performed and does not cause severe morbidity in palpable peripheral lymphadenopathies. Although it does not cause severe morbidity because it is an invasive procedure, excisional biopsy should be performed in a selected patient group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) is a rare presentation type of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and imaging features affecting the invasive component, loco-regional recurrence, prognosis, and survival of MPD.METHODS: Patients who had undergone surgery due to MPD in a 10-year period were included. Parameters including mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, tumor stage, molecular subtype, axillary involvement, presence of invasive carcinoma, loco-regional recurrence, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were recorded and statistically analyzed. P<0.05 was determined as statistically significant.RESULTS: The study group consisted of 49 women with a mean age of 67.05±14.43 (range: 23-90) years. There was a significant association between the presence of invasive carcinoma and a mass lesion in the MRI (p=0.002). The frequency of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis was significantly higher in patients with multicentric tumors (p=0.029; p<0.05). Locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis were significantly more frequent in patients with axillary involvement (p=0.0336; p<0.05). The mean DFS was 115.02±7.28 months, while the mean OS was 119.29±6.57 months.CONCLUSION: The presence of a mass lesion on MRI was determined to be significant in recognizing invasive carcinoma in MPD. The rate of SLN metastasis was higher in patients with multicentric tumors than in patients with unifocal tumors. Axillary involvement was associated with impaired DFS.

T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Territories stretching from the Caspian Sea in the west to Urumchi of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China in the east and from Karakalpakistan and Tashkent inclusive in the south to Western Siberia in the north, are the lands of compact resettlement of Kazakhs. Since the 1950s, some Kazakhs have been topics is the history and traditional culture of Kazakhs who live outside Kazakhstan. The article in this brief assessment of research is shown in Turkish original sources in Kazakh and Russian as well as the analysis of the main positions of the authors of these works. In essence, in the historiography of Kazakhstan, and in the historiography of Turkiye and Uzbekistan, disputes unfolded around such concepts as ethnic history, lan-guage, mentality, tradition and issues of theory. As for Kazakhstan, for various political reasons, the impetus to the studies associated with the Kazakhs outside Kazakhstan occurred only after the proclamation of Ka-zakhstan's independence in 1991. The theme of foreign Kazakhs turned in Kazakhstan into an important research area. On the one hand, according to ethnologists, ethnic communities (irredentes and diasporas) try to better protect and preserve language and traditional culture. In other words, irredentes and diaspora are histor-ically formed carriers of certain ethnocultural traditions. Along with this, at present, the problems and diaspo-ras have acquired a large way. That is, irredent and diasporas are a political tool that facilitates the integration of the Turkic states in the Eurasian space. Therefore, the article studies various factors affecting the traditional culture of Kazakhs. If we take into account some aspects of the topic, then there are features and nuances that are characteristic of the traditions of Kazakhs in Turkiye and Uzbekistan. And in this article an attempt was made to give information on wedding customs and traditions of Kazakhs. Along with this, the influence of the Turks of Anatolia on the traditional culture of Kazakhs has been established, ethnocultural features were revealed as a result of this influence and information on established elements is given. And the purpose of this work is to present information about rites and customs that have not received sufficient lighting in the works of researchers of the wedding traditions of Kazakhs who live outside Kazakhstan. In this work, wedding traditions are studied in the framework of folklore works. Since in the study of folklore works you can see the worldview of the people. In other words, legends, epics reflect the thinking, lifestyle of the people. Some elements of customs and traditions of Kazakhs also influenced their folklore. From this point of view, folklore is one of the important elements that form a traditional culture.

M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study is to evaluate different models for further improvement of the accuracy of land use and land cover (LULC) classification on Google Earth Engine using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithms. Ten indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index, index-based built-up index, biophysical composition index, built-up area extraction index (BAEI), urban index, new built-up index, band ratio for built-up area, bare soil index, and normalized built up area index, were used as input parameters for the machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy. The combinatorial analysis of the Sentinel-2 bands and the aforementioned indices allowed us to create four combinations based on surface reflectance characteristics. The study includes data from April 2020 to September 2021 and April 2022 to June 2022. The multitemporal Sentinel-2 data with spatial resolutions of 10 m were used to determine the LULC classification. The major land use classes such as water, forest, grassland, urban areas, and other lands were obtained. Generally, the RF algorithm showed higher accuracy than the SVM. The overall accuracy for RF and SVM was 86.56% and 84.48%, respectively, and the mean Kappa was 0.82 and 0.79, respectively. Using the combination 2 with the RF algorithm and combination 4 with the SVM algorithm for LULC classification was more accurate. The additional use of vegetation indices allowed to increase in the accuracy of LULC classification and separate classes with similar reflection spectra.

M3  - Article
AB  - The actualization of the study of the irrational in the interpretation of man and communication with society in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries can be explained by modern ideas about the limitless incognizability of the phenomenon of life. Rational knowledge is accompanied by knowledge of the exceptional significance of the belief in the influence of otherworldliness for certain periods of history when the totality of conflicts, clashes, and features in people's behavior is explained through an appeal to images of demonic properties. Historians, philologists, and theologians from various Russian academic centers discuss the representation of "otherworldliness" and the prospects of its study. The panelists discuss the studies of the functional properties of otherworldliness in various spheres of life and art and its manifestation in the genres of oral and written literature. Finally, they put forward ideas about the further directions of scholarly research in the sphere.

TI  - Remote Sensing of the Subtropical Front in the Southeast Pacific and the Ecology of Chilean Jack Mackerel <i>Trachurus murphyi</i>
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Review
AB  - The Subtropical Front (STF) plays a key role in the ecology of Chilean jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi. Nonetheless, there are few remote sensing studies of the STF in the open Southeast Pacific, and almost all of them have been conducted by satellite oceanographers in Russia and Ukraine to support respective large-scale fisheries of jack mackerel in this region. We reviewed these studies that documented long-term seasonal and interannual variability of the STF from sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) data. We also mapped the STF from satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) data of the SMOS mission (2012-2019). The Subtropical Front consists of two fronts-North and South STF about 500 km apart-that border the Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ) in-between. The STF is density-compensated, with spatially divergent manifestations in temperature and salinity. In the temperature field, the STF extends in the WNW to ESE direction in the Southeast Pacific. In the salinity field, the STFZ appears as a broad frontal zone, extending zonally across the entire South Pacific. Three major types of satellite data-SST, SSH, and SSS-can be used to locate the STF. The SSH data is most advantageous with regard to the jack mackerel fisheries, owing to the all-weather capability of satellite altimetry and the radical improvement of the spatial resolution of SSH data in the near future. Despite the dearth of dedicated in situ studies of the South Pacific STFZ, there is a broad consensus regarding the STFZ being the principal spawning and nursing ground of T. murphyi and a migration corridor between Chile and New Zealand. Major data/knowledge gaps are identified, and key next steps are proposed to mitigate the data/knowledge gaps and inform fisheries management.

TI  - Land Cover Classification With Gaussian Processes Using Spatio-Spectro-Temporal Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose an approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for large-scale land cover pixel-based classification with Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS). We used a sparse approximation of the posterior combined with variational inference to learn the GP's parameters. We applied stochastic gradient descent and GPU computing to optimize our GP models on massive datasets. The proposed GP model can be trained with hundreds of thousands of samples, compared to a few thousands for traditional GP methods. Moreover, we included the spatial information by adding the geographic coordinates into the GP's covariance function to efficiently exploit the spatio-spectro-temporal structure of the SITS. We ran experiments with Sentinel-2 SITS of the full year 2018 over an area of 200000 km2 (about 2 billion pixels) in the south of France, which is representative of an operational setting. Adding the spatial information significantly improved the results in terms of classification accuracy. With spatial information, GP models have an overall accuracy of 79.8. They are more than three points above random forest (the method used for current operational systems) and more than one point above a multilayer perceptron. Compared to a transformer-based model (which provides state-of-the-art results in the literature, but is not applied in operational systems), GP models are only one point below.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change on European Grassland Phenology: A 20-Year Analysis of MODIS Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of very long spatial datasets from satellites has opened up numerous opportunities, including the monitoring of vegetation phenology over the course of time. Considering the importance of grassland systems and the influence of climate change on their phenology, the specific objectives of this study are: (a) to identify a methodology for a reliable estimation of grassland phenological dates from a satellite vegetation index (i.e., kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI) and (b) to quantify the changes that have occurred over the period 2001-2021 in a representative dataset of European grasslands and assess the extent of climate change impacts. In order to identify the best methodological approach for estimating the start (SOS), peak (POS) and end (EOS) of the growing season from the satellite, we compared dates extracted from the MODIS-kNDVI annual trajectories with different combinations of fitting models (FMs) and extraction methods (EM), with those extracted from the gross primary productivity (GPP) measured from eddy covariance flux towers in specific grasslands. SOS and POS were effectively identified with various FMxEM approaches, whereas satellite-EOS did not obtain sufficiently reliable estimates and was excluded from the trend analysis. The methodological indications (i.e., FMxEM selection) were then used to calculate the SOS and POS for 31 grassland sites in Europe from MODIS-kNDVI during the period 2001-2021. SOS tended towards an anticipation at the majority of sites (83.9%), with an average advance at significant sites of 0.76 days year(-1). For POS, the trend was also towards advancement, although the results are less homogeneous (67.7% of sites with advancement), and with a less marked advance at significant sites (0.56 days year(-1)). From the analyses carried out, the SOS and POS of several sites were influenced by the winter and spring temperatures, which recorded rises during the period 2001-2021. Contrasting results were recorded for the SOS-POS duration, which did not show a clear trend towards lengthening or shortening. Considering latitude and altitude, the results highlighted that the greatest changes in terms of SOS and POS anticipation were recorded for sites at higher latitudes and lower altitudes.

TI  - Dynamics of Low-Lying Sandy Coast of the Gydan Peninsula, Kara Sea, Russia, Based on Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retreat rates of Arctic coasts have increased in recent decades at many sites, and an essential part of coasts considered accumulative before have turned erosional due to global climate changes and construction in the coastal zone. In this paper, we study a 7 km long coastal section of the western Gydan Peninsula in a new construction area. Based on the interpretation of multi-temporal satellite imagery, we assessed coastal dynamics in distinct periods from 1972 to 2020. We analyzed the geological structure of the coast as well as changes in hydrometeorological parameters with time, and considering the human impact, we proposed the main drivers of spatial and temporal variations of coastal dynamics. The studied low-lying sandy accumulative marine terrace was more or less stable in the period before construction (1972-2014). However, with the area's development, the coast dynamics changed drastically: in 2014-2017, three-quarters of the studied area experienced retreat, and the average retreat rate amounted to 5.8 m/yr, up to 28.5 m/yr near the construction sites. We relate this coastal erosion intensification to human impact combined with the growth of hydrometeorological forcing. Although coastal erosion slowed down after 2017, the retreat trend remained. In the coming years, with Arctic climate warming, erosion of the studied coast will continue.

TI  - Identification of Seasonal Snow Phase Changes From C-Band SAR Time Series With Dynamic Thresholds
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In cryospheric studies, the most critical variable is estimating the beginning and evolution of the seasonal snow ac-cumulation and its melting process. We propose and evaluate a new method for identifying seasonal snow cover phase changes in the Argentinean Andes using time series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data available in the Google Earth Engine platform. We used meteorological and optical Sentinel-2 data to validate snow presence. First, we investigated seasonal snow cover dynamics in different regions of interest (ROIs). We identified three land surface cover periods: bare soil, dry snow, and melting snow. This finding is significant because other studies show that bare soil and dry snow have similar backscattering responses in C-band. Our methodology uses time series derivatives and their positive and negative anomalies. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with a fixed threshold change detection approach. Our method was able to detect the phase change between bare soil and dry snow period in 75% of the ROIs, while a fixed threshold of -2 dB only detects it in 42% of the cases. Furthermore, the derivative method also detects in 92% of the ROIs time series the beginning of the melting period, showing that it is a promising methodology for operative systems.

TI  - Application of the Analysis Time Series and Multispectral Images for the Estimation of the Conditions of the Vegetation Covers of the Natural Areas of Southern Spain
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been scientifically proven that climate change is a reality. In subarid Mediterranean limates, this fact is observed in the irregular distribution of rainfall, resulting in alternating periods of more or less prolonged drought with episodes of torrential rains concentrated in short periods of time. We have selected 11 natural areas in southern Spain, where we will observe these circumstances and where a series of ecosystems composed of vegetation covers of a high ecological value are found. We start from the question of whether these climatic circumstances are really deteriorating them. For this study, we propose a method that combines three analysis techniques: the design of the time series, the application of vegetation indices, and the use of techniques analysis of changes in land use. From the combination of these techniques in the period from 1997 to 2021, we have observed that there have been a dynamic of changes in land use that has maintained its original characteristics by more than 70%, so it is possible to affirm that the adaptation of ecosystems to climatic conditions has occurred satisfactorily. However, this general statement shows some particularities which are those that we will show in this work.

TI  - CORPUS ANALYSIS OF THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF THE CONCEPT <i>HYGGE</i>
T2  - SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The notion that a language worldview is shaped by a system of key concepts as well as ideas and motifs linking them, which are expressed in the meaning of individual lexemes and phrases, has informed a number of studies of culturally specific words and even entire semantic fields. Comparison of different language worldviews has revealed many differences, which at first sight seem insignificant but may hinder successful communication. The concept of hygge occupies a special place in the Danish language worldview and has become somewhat of a Danish hallmark. Our study uses corpus data to analyse six co-occurrence patterns of words representing the concept hygge, which allows us to explicate the implicit meaning components of the lexemes in question and to identify the most frequent patterns. The material used was the Danish Gigaword Corpus (DAGW), which includes texts collected from the Internet. The corpus covers the Danish language in all its diversity: a variety of genres and types of texts are represented in the corpus (law, social media, subtitles, debates, conversation notes, encyclopaedia articles, fiction, news, etc.). The high frequency of the words representing the concept hygge in the corpus texts once again confirms the importance of this concept for Danish culture. The combinational properties of all the models studied show a striking uniformity: all collocations are characterized by positive connotations and can be categorized into a small set of thematic groups (place, time, atmosphere, hobbies, spending time together and communicating). The above co-occurrence analysis allows us to identify the following set of characteristics of the concept hygge: a feeling of peace, tranquillity and security, enjoyment and good mood that comes from being engaged in active pursuits, presence of close, familiar people, a familiar, well-known place, a shared time together.

TI  - Spectral-Temporal Fusion of Satellite Images via an End-to-End Two-Stream Attention With an Effective Reconstruction Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to technical and budget constraints on current optical satellites, the acquisition of satellite images with the best resolutions is not practicable. In this article, aiming to produce products with high spectral (HS) and temporal resolutions, we introduced a two-stream spectral-temporal fusion technique based on attention mechanism called STA-Net. STA-Net aims to combine high spectral and low temporal (HSLT) resolution images with low spectral and high temporal (LSHT) resolution images to generate products with the best characteristics. The proposed technique involves two stages. In the first one, two fused images are generated by a two-stream architecture based on residual attention blocks. The temporal difference estimator stream estimates the temporal difference between HS images at desired and neighboring dates. The reflectance difference estimator is the second stream. It predicts the reflectance difference between the input images (HS-LS) to map LS images into HS products. In the second stage, a reconstruction network combines the latter two-stream outputs via an effective learnable weighted-sum strategy. The two-stage model is trained in an end-to-end fashion using an effective loss function to ensure the best fusion quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address the spectral-temporal fusion using an end-to-end deep neural network model. Experimental results conducted on two actual datasets of Sentinel-2 (HSLT:10 spectral bands and long revisit period) and Planetscope (LSHT: four spectral bands and daily images) images, which proved the effectiveness of the proposed technique with respect to baseline technique.

TI  - A Dual-Branch Deep Learning Architecture for Multisensor and Multitemporal Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor data analysis allows exploiting heterogeneous data regularly acquired by the many available remote sensing (RS) systems. Machine- and deep-learning methods use the information of heterogeneous sources to improve the results obtained by using single-source data. However, the state-of-the-art methods analyze either the multiscale information of multisensor multiresolution images or the time component of image time series. We propose a supervised deep-learning classification method that jointly performs a multiscale and multitemporal analysis of RS multitemporal images acquired by different sensors. The proposed method processes very-high-resolution (VHR) images using a residual network with a wide receptive field that handles geometrical details and multitemporal high-resolution (HR) image using a 3-D convolutional neural network that analyzes both the spatial and temporal information. The multiscale and multitemporal features are processed together in a decoder to retrieve a land-cover map. We tested the proposed method on two multisensor and multitemporal datasets. One is composed of VHR orthophotos and Sentinel-2 multitemporal images for pasture classification, and another is composed of VHR orthophotos and Sentinel-1 multitemporal images. Results proved the effectiveness of the proposed classification method.

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN
M3  - Article
AB  - For the Research Centre of Post-Mining (FZN) at the Technische Hochschule Georg Agricola University (THGA) in Bochum, geomonitoring is a multi-level approach to environmental monitoring with a focus on post-mining activities. In situ, a precise understanding of natural processes, e.g. the condition of groundwater, water bodies, soil or vegetation, is developed - usually through mapping, laboratory analyses and installed sensors. The goal is to later be able to derive an areawide statement on these processes through the analysis of satellite data. In order to be able to transfer the process understanding gained to the satellite data, an unmanned aerial vehicle is used.This article highlights an essential aspect of the in situ component. The denser the coverage with sensors, the more reliably an area-wide statement about drones and satellites can succeed. This is why low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors and loggers are also used in the FZN research projects. In the "Climate Change - Management and Monitoring (C2M2)" project, funded by the Emschergenossenschaft-Lippeverband (EGLV), such sensors could be evaluated in several tests.The article presents initial results aimed at mapping an annual cycle of soil moisture with such inexpensive sensors. As a result, no physically correct measurements can be achieved with these sensors, but they are able to show patterns in processes and, for example, map such annual cycles. With the appropriate interpretation, they can thus deliver a contribution to understand processes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The summer months of 1832-1836, spent by F. M. Dostoevsky as a child in his parents' Darovoe estate in the Kashirsky district of Tula province, left, by the writer's own admission, "the deepest and strongest impression for the rest of his life." One of these impressions is the way of life, traditions, and character of the Russian people. The Russian Geographical Society (RGO) archive document "Information About the Ordinary Russian People of Tula Province in Kashirsky District", compiled by the priest of the Holy Dukhovsky church of Monogarovo village P. V. Proferansov (1849), contains an ethnographic description of the peasants of the villages of Monogarovo, Darovoe, Cheremoshnya, Komovo, Nazar'yevo - parish of the Holy Dukhovsky temple. These documentary data provide an idea not only about the appearance, language, dwelling, rituals and traditions of the people, but also about the national character, as the future writer learned it in his youth. The introduction into scientific circulation of new materials on the history of the Dostoevskys' Darovoe estate will allow us to more comprehensively present the circumstances of the formation of the character and worldview of the writer. Consideration of the archival materials of the Russian Geographical Society in the context of the "folk" idea of F. M. Dostoevsky, formulated by him in the "A Writer's Diary", testifies to the objectivity of his position in the "folk" question and the undoubted influence of early impressions of rural childhood on the ideological and artistic structure of works.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Unmanned Aerial Systems in Geomatics (UASG)
CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - The availability of Very High-Resolution (VHR) remote sensing datasets from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based sensors are changing the methods of cartographic mapping as well as visualization by taking advantage of both the high spatial resolution as well as high radiometric resolutions. A high-fidelity digital elevation model (DEM) can be prepared using these UAV datasets, which can produce high-quality orthoimages. In the present study, the space-borne lidar elevation datasets from the Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1) and TanDEM-X 90 m DEM from TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) mission are utilized for the comparison of elevation values from DEM generated using UAV datasets for the experimental site in Switzerland. The experimental site is part of Yverdon-Les-Bains, which is a municipality in the district of Jura-Nord VauDOIs, canton of Vaud, Switzerland. The openly accessible dataset from the Sensefly Sensor Optimized for Drone Applications (S.O.D.A.) includes 235 true-color RGB images acquired from a flight height of 106 m, at an average Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 2.64 cm. The datasets are processed in Pix4D software for the bundle block adjustment, followed by the generation of DEM and orthomosaic. The comparison of ICESat-1 elevation data with DEM depicts a difference of about 26 cm on plain ground, which is reasonably good considering the use of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network in Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) mode. The quality report depicts the mean of geolocation accuracy in X, Y, and z as 2.73 cm, 2.73 cm, and 3.46 cm respectively, which is practically highly accurate. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in X, Y, and z is computed as 1.7 cm, 2.27 cm, and 2.31 cm respectively. The study depicts that practically the cartographic potential for the UAV dataset is suitable for mapping at a scale range of 1:250 to 1:300 or better for such plain terrain conditions, meeting the engineering drawing requirements for facility management and utility mapping.

TI  - Analysing the relationship between human modification and land surface temperature fluctuation in the Ramganga basin, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In many regions across the world, including river basins, population growth and land development have enhanced the demand for land and other natural resources. The anthropogenic activities can be detrimental to the vital ecosystems that sustain the river basin region. This work assessed the impact of human modification on land surface temperature (LST) for the Ramganga basin in India. It has been hypothesised that the footprints of anthropogenic activities in the region have been connected to the LST fluctuation for the region, which could indicate environmental degradation. The LST variation between 2000 and 2016 has been estimated to test this hypothesis. The spatio-temporal correlation between human modification and LST has been computed. LST has been calculated with MODIS satellite data in the Google earth engine (GEE) platform, and anthropogenic activities can be visualised using an LU/LC map of the basin created by the Classification and Regression (CART) technique. The statistical parameters (average, maximum and standard deviation) of annual temperature for each pixel in 17 years (2000-2016) have been assessed to establish the links with human modification. The result of this work portrays a positive correlation of 0.705 between maximum LST and human modification. The forest class in the basin region has the lowest average human modification value (0.37), and it also possesses the lowest mean LST of 26.72 degrees C. Similarly, the settlement class has the highest average human modification value (0.85), and the mean LST temperature of this class has been on the higher side, having a value of 31.07 degrees C.

TI  - A Deep-Learning-Based Lightweight Model for Ship Localizations in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection and localizing its position are indispensable in maritime surveillance and monitoring. Until early 2000, ship detection relied on human intelligence, but with the fast-processing speed, artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, has replaced manual intervention with automatic localization in tracking naval activities. Taking advantage of the continuous and cloud-free ocean observations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), recent studies have demonstrated some success in utilizing SAR data to localize ships using deep-learning and other AI methods despite the accuracy of the models being lower than the acceptable limit. However, the existing models are inherently complex and time consuming in addition to demanding an extensive computational resource, which pose a significant challenge when applied to satellite-based data. This study presents a computationally efficient deep-learning-based algorithm that has a wider applicability and improves the accuracy over the existing models for ship localization in SAR images. Training and testing of this algorithm were conducted using the SAR Ship Dataset, which contains ship chips with complex backgrounds extracted from Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 satellite data. It produced the localized ship's position with bounding boxes in SAR images using the combined traditional computer vision and deep neural network configuration, which comprises a novel backbone network called Ship-Net or S-Net. The S-Net model has a thirteen-layer backbone feature extraction network and a four-layer regression network concatenated. Further, this study proposes a modified combined loss function for optimizing the model performance. A comparative analysis of the proposed S-Net model was done using the various pre-build model architectures and loss function combinations. The results showed that the S-Net model with a combined loss function yielded 94.88% precision and 79.68% recall, with 12.58% precision and 7.39% recall higher than the state-of-the-art Faster RCNN baseline model. The proposed S-Net model has a relatively higher performance than the existing state-of-the-art models for ship localization in SAR images and can become an efficient tool for ship localization in optical images with suitable architectural and training scheme modifications for better coastal surveillance and worldwide naval security.

TI  - Analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation dynamics and their responses to climatic parameters in Meghalaya from 2001 to 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the spatio-temporal trends in vegetation dynamics and its drivers is crucial to ensure sustainable management of ecosystems. The north-eastern state of Meghalaya possessing an idiosyncratic climatic regime has been undergoing tremendous pressure in the past decades considering the recent climate change scenario. A robust trend analysis has been performed using the MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) data (2001-2020) along with multi-source gridded climate data (precipitation and temperature) to detect changes in the vegetation dynamics and corresponding climatic variables by employing the Theil-Sen Median trend test and Mann-Kendall test (tau). The spatial variability of trends was gauged with respect to 7 major forest types, administrative boundaries and different elevational gradients found in the area. Results revealed a large positive inter-annual trend (85.48%) with a minimal negative trend (14.52%) in the annual mean NDVI. Mean Annual Precipitation presents a negative trend in 66.97% of the area mainly concentrated in the eastern portion of the state while the western portion displays a positive trend in about 33.03% of the area. Temperature exhibits a 98% positive trend in Meghalaya. Pettitt Change Point Detection revealed three major breakpoints viz., 2010, 2012 and 2014 in the NDVI values from 2001 to 2020 over the forested region of Meghalaya. A consistent future vegetation trend (87.78%) in Meghalaya was identified through Hurst Exponent. A positive correlation between vegetation and temperature was observed in about 82.81% of the area. The western portion of the state was seen to reflect a clear correlation between NDVI and rainfall as compared to the eastern portion where NDVI is correlated more with temperature than rainfall. A gradual deviation of rainfall towards the west was identified which might be feedback of the increasing significant greening observed in the state in the recent decades. This study, therefore, serves as a decadal archive of forest dynamics and also provides an insight into the long-term impact of climate change on vegetation which would further help in investigating and projecting the future ecosystem dynamics in Meghalaya.

TI  - An angular normalization method for temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) in monitoring agricultural drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing drought is mandatory for a thorough monitoring of crop growth. Such information can be inferred from radiometric measurements in optical and thermal spectral ranges. The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) presents the advantage to mix spectral information since it associates land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is known to be weakly impact by directional effects, which is not the case of TVDI as the accuracy assessment of LST can be severely hampered directional anisotropy (DA). In this paper, DA feature of TVDI is analyzed using the kernel-driven model Vinnikov-Li (VinLi) that serves to perform through simulations and remove DA. The study uses both airborne and satellite datasets. TVDI was found to be angularly dependent, with a possible uncertainty larger than 15%. Compared against TVDI without angular correction, the normalized results displayed a better correlation with soil moisture content, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of estimated soil moisture content decreased obviously, from 0.050 m3/m3 to 0.045 m3/m3 for airborne data over maize canopies, from approximately 0.036 m3/m3 to 0.030 m3/m3 for satellite data over cropland canopies, and from approximately 0.032 m3/m3 to 0.028 m3/m3 for satellite data over grassland canopies. The evaluation was carried out using the complied synthetic datasets based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model. These also confirmed the occurrence of significant DAs of TVDIs and good performance of VinLi in reducing DA of TVDI by >50%. Based on the VinLi method, an angular-independent TVDI appears necessary to reduce uncertainties originated from illuminating and viewing geometries for the purpose of agriculture monitoring with possible drought episodes. Although further evaluation is still needed using surface measurements, the outcomes support a confident use of TVDI for observations from satellite and airborne/unmanned aerial vehicle.

CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Canada's RADARSAT-2 (R-2) low-resolution ScanSAR Detection of Vessels, Wide swath, Far incidence angle (DVWF) mode was implemented for vessel detection over wide swaths. Between 2013 and 2020, DVWF imagery was used operationally, by the Department of National Defence (DND), and exploited using a tool that detects clusters of bright pixels with vessel-like signature in the SAR imagery. The detected objects were then associated with automatic identification system (AIS) messages. Not all vessels transmit AIS messages, and not all detected vessels that transmit AIS are associated; therefore, analysts observed non-associated objects in an attempt to validate detected vessels. The new work described here evaluates the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects and rejects false alarms to assist analysts with this validation. A CNN is first calibrated with 1,963 DVWF images containing 16,490 detected and AIS associated vessels (referred to as SAR detected and AIS associated (SAR-AIS) vessels) and 5,654 known false alarms mostly off the coasts of Canada. The CNN's usability is then evaluated, globally, with 94,562 DVWF images containing 209,746 SAR-AIS vessels, 203,559 validated vessels, and 261,499 unknown objects, detected operationally and non-operationally. During calibration, the CNN classified SAR-AIS vessels and false alarms with 91.6% and 96.3% accuracy, respectively. When evaluating usability, the CNN correctly classified 93.7% of the 209,746 SAR-AIS vessels. False alarms were determined for 5.4% of the 203,559 validated vessels, and 58.1% of the 261,499 unknown objects. These results suggest that a CNN designed to detect and reject false alarms could reduce the number of objects requiring validation by approximately 30%.

TI  - Spirolides in Bivalve Mollusk of the Galician (NW Spain) Coast: Interspecific, Spatial, Temporal Variation and Presence of an Isomer of 13-Desmethyl Spirolide C
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spirolides are cyclic imines whose risks to human health have not been sufficiently evaluated. To determine the possible impact of these compounds in Galicia (NW Spain), their presence and concentration in bivalve mollusk were studied from 2014 to 2021. Only 13-desmethyl spirolide C (13desmSPXC) and an isomer have been detected, and always at low concentrations. Mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, was the species which accumulated more spirolides, but the presence of its isomer was nearly restricted to cockle, Cerastoderma edule, and two clam species, Venerupis corrugata and Polititapes rhomboides. On average, the highest 13desmSPXC levels were found in autumn-winter, while those of its isomer were recorded in spring-summer. Both compounds showed decreasing trends during the study period. Geographically, the concentration tends to decrease from the southern to the north-eastern locations, but temporal variability predominates over spatial variability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION EDUCATION AND LEADERSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental interpretation can improve sustainability by mitigating the negative impacts of nature-based recreation. However, we do not fully understand the psychological factors that influence interpretation's efficacy in changing human behaviours. Specifically, the role of emotions has been understudied within environmental psychology and nature-based recreation. This study, therefore, provides further insight into the psychological processes driving pro -environmental behavioural intentions among overnight visitors attending personal interpretation programs in provincial parks in Alberta, Canada. In 2018 and 2019, we surveyed 763 attendees of personal interpretation events. We used latent variable structural regression modeling to test the hypothesized relationships between ecological worldview, attitudes, emotions, and pro -environmental behaviours. As predicted, there were positive relationships between worldviews, affective and cognitive attitudes, and emotions; these variables and knowledge gain were positively associated with pro-environmental behaviours. Findings suggest that interpretation should focus programming on the affective elements of communication, target personal meaning such as responsibility to act, and continue to transmit knowledge.

Textual evidences indicate that Lope used different resources and procedures to modi-fy the text that he had already written: sometimes, he added verses in the margins; other times, he decided to interpolate fragments of text at the beginning, end or in the middle of an act; while on other occasions, he left blank spaces to fill in at another time. All of them are elements that prove the existence of a careful revision process of his dramatic works.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance Using Structured Telehealth Data: Case Study of the First Wave of COVID-19 in Brazil
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Telehealth has been widely used for new case detection and telemonitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. It safely provides access to health care services and expands assistance to remote, rural areas and underserved communities in situations of shortage of specialized health professionals. Qualified data are systematically collected by health care workers containing information on suspected cases and can be used as a proxy of disease spread for surveillance purposes. However, the use of this approach for syndromic surveillance has yet to be explored. Besides, the mathematical modeling of epidemics is a well-established field that has been successfully used for tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting the decision-making process on diverse aspects of public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The response of the current models depends on the quality of input data, particularly the transmission rate, initial conditions, and other parameters present in compartmental models. Telehealth systems may feed numerical models developed to model virus spread in a specific region.Objective: Herein, we evaluated whether a high-quality data set obtained from a state-based telehealth service could be used to forecast the geographical spread of new cases of COVID-19 and to feed computational models of disease spread.Methods: We analyzed structured data obtained from a statewide toll-free telehealth service during 4 months following the first notification of COVID-19 in the Bahia state, Brazil. Structured data were collected during teletriage by a health team of medical students supervised by physicians. Data were registered in a responsive web application for planning and surveillance purposes. The data set was designed to quickly identify users, city, residence neighborhood, date, sex, age, and COVID-19-like symptoms. We performed a temporal-spatial comparison of calls reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and notification of COVID-19 cases. The number of calls was used as a proxy of exposed individuals to feed a mathematical model called "susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased." Results: For 181 (43%) out of 417 municipalities of Bahia, the first call to the telehealth service reporting COVID-19-like symptoms preceded the first notification of the disease. The calls preceded, on average, 30 days of the notification of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Additionally, data obtained by the telehealth service were used to effectively reproduce the spread of COVID-19 in Salvador, the capital of the state, using the "susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased" model to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of the disease.Conclusions: Data from telehealth services confer high effectiveness in anticipating new waves of COVID-19 and may help understand the epidemic dynamics.

AB  - Accurate models for early harvest estimation in citrus production generally involve expensive variables. The goal of this research work was to develop a model to provide early and accurate estimations of harvest using low-cost features. Given the original data may derive from tree measurements, meteorological stations, or satellites, they have varied costs. The studied orchards included tangerines (Citrus reticulata x C. sinensis) and sweet oranges (C. sinensis) located in northeastern Argentina. Machine learning methods combined with different datasets were tested to obtain the most accurate harvest estimation. The final model is based on support vector machines with low-cost variables like species, age, irrigation, red and near-infrared reflectance in February and December, NDVI in December, rain during ripening, and humidity during fruit growth.

TI  - The use of spectral techniques to monitor the vegetation status in a protected area in the Iasi county
T2  - PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology offers the possibility to monitor biophysical attributes and changes in plant biomass and productivity during the growing season, which can enable sustainable management. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing technology have produced innovative sensors for monitoring the Earth's surface, with increasing spatial and temporal resolution of available satellite images, such as those provided by the Sentinel-2, creating new opportunities for environmental monitoring and the generation of accurate datasets. This study aimed to assess vegetation condition during the spring, summer and autumn seasons in a protected area near Iasi, ROSCI0058, using biophysical indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The study area was chosen due to the existence of signals indicating the possibility of changes in the type and health status of vegetation within the site of Community importance. The analysis was based on a series of vegetation-specific spectral indices such as: normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), canopy water content (CWC), fraction of photosynthetically active absorbed radiation (FAPAR) and fraction of canopy cover (FCOVER), derived from Sentinel-2 high-resolution images. The time series of satellite images used covers the phenophase periods specific to the spontaneous flora in the period 2020-2022. With SNAP software the Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed to convert the reflectance of the ToA images to BoA, vegetation indices were calculated, after which final distribution maps were created with ArcGIS. The results indicate that the highest values for NDVI, LAI, FAPAR, FCOVER, CAB and CW did not follow a pattern, they occurred at different times of the year, as follows: in the spring season, the highest value was on April 10, 2020; in the summer season, highlighting the values of July 9, 2021 while for the fall, the year 2022 recorded the highest values on September 7, the results being directly proportional to the variation of climatic parameters. The analysis also considered the type of land use, with non-irrigated arable land having the highest values for various indices. The results highlight the potential of Sentinel -2 images for these types of studies, as they can be used to observe and assess the health of the vegetation cover.

TI  - The Strength of Religious Lifeworld: The Impact of Social Spaces on Religious Values in Central and Eastern Europe
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the role of social spaces in the religious worldview in the Central and Eastern European region through a comprehensive study of values spanning nearly three decades. The analysis focuses on the differences between the values of religious and non-religious people in different social spaces during this period. Drawing on the insights of the spatial turn, the study provides a new way of understanding the impact of social spaces on the emergence of religious values. For the first time, the analysis attempts to verify the influence of social spaces on the emergence of specific religious values using a representative database. The research on the four waves of EVS interprets the values of the religious and non-religious along the lines of their relationship to norm violations. The analysis points out that religious worldview does not appear equally in different spaces of society. The research proved in a novel way that in the social space of production and administration, in the systematic organization of society, religious people do not have significantly different values in this region. On the other hand, the values of the religious, which are different from those of the non-religious, are expressed in values that can be linked to the social space of lifeworld. All these findings can give a new direction to quantitative and qualitative research on religion, which now includes aspects of spatiality.

TI  - An Overview on the Alignment of Radiation Protection in Computed Tomography with Maqasid al-Shari'ah in the Context of al-Dharuriyat
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing utilisation of computed tomography (CT) in the medical field has raised a greater concern regarding the radiation-induced health effects as CT imposes high radiation risks on the exposed individual. Adherence to radiation protection measures in CT as endorsed by regulatory bodies; justification, optimisation and dose limit, is essential to minimise radiation risks. Islam values every human being and Maqasid al-Shari'ah helps to protect human beings through its sacred principles which aim to fulfil human beings' benefits (maslahah) and prevent mischief (mafsadah). Alignment of the concept of radiation protection in CT within the framework of al-Dharuriyat; protection of faith or religion (din), protection of life (nafs), protection of lineage (nasl), protection of intellect ('aql) and protection of property (mal) is essential. This strengthens the concept and practices of radiation protection in CT among radiology personnel, particularly Muslim radiographers. The alignment provides supplementary knowledge towards the integration of knowledge fields between Islamic worldview and radiation protection in medical imaging, particularly in CT. This paper is hoped to set a benchmark for future studies on the integration of knowledge between the Islamic worldview and radiation protection in medical imaging in terms of other classifications of Maqasid al-Shari'ah; al-Hajiyat and al-Tahsiniyat.

TI  - WOMEN ABOUT WOMEN: GENDERLECT MANIFESTATIONS THROUGH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SELF-STEREOTYPES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article re-actualises genderlect as one of the key points of malefemale differentiation and a relevant object in the humanities, not merely from the perspective of gender studies but linguistic and literary ones. Selfstereotypes in the speech of one or another gender may be considered the result of the complex interaction of collective identity and the subconscious. The excerpts from the selected novels by Salman Rushdie, Jennifer Crusie, Lisa Kleypas, Aleksandar Hemon, Zadie Smith and Candace Bushnell have provided a wide range of patterns of expressing self-stereotypes in the dimension of 'women about women'. To emphasise the multicultural nature of genderlect self-stereotypes, writers of different ethnic affiliations are represented. The article also classifies the criteria of self-stereotype polarisation in characters' speech to explicate the strategies of women's verbal behaviour. These criteria include marital status, maternal experience, professional activity, ageism and harassment. The impact of gender on verbal behaviour, observed in real life and adapted to fiction through literary representation, is manifested in communication stereotypes. This serves to illuminate the most representative speech self-stereotypes, which make certain images or ideas easier to interpret. The application of an interdisciplinary approach with a set of appropriate methods to theorising and practising genderlect reveals its role as a significant tool for reconstructing a linguistic worldview and contextualises both positive and negative self-stereotypes for the expressive evaluation of speech in fictional discourse.

TI  - From global recommendations to (in)action: A scoping review of the coverage of companion of choice for women during labour and birth.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Women greatly value and benefit from the presence of someone they trust to support them throughout labour and childbirth ('labour companion of choice'). Labour companionship improves maternal and perinatal outcomes, including enhancing physiological labour and birth experiences. Despite clear benefits, implementation is slow. We conducted a scoping review to assess coverage and models of labour companionship, including quantitative studies reporting coverage of labour companionship in any level health facility globally. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Global Health from 1 January 2010-14 December 2021. We extracted data on study design, labour companionship coverage, timing and type of companions allowed, and recoded data into categories for comparison across studies. We included data from a maternal health sentinel network of hospitals in Latin America, using descriptive statistics to assess coverage among 120,581 women giving birth in these sites from April 2018-April 2022. In the scoping review, we included 77 studies from 27 countries. There was wide variation in the coverage of labour companionship: almost one-third of studies reported coverage less than 40%, and one-third of studies reported coverage between 40-80%. Husbands or partners were the most frequent companion (37.7%, 29/77), followed by family member or friend (gender not specified) (32.5%, 25/77), family member or friend (female-only) (13.0%, 10/77). Across nine sentinel hospitals in five Latin American countries, there was variation in coverage, with no companion at any time ranging from 14.9%-93.8%. Despite the well-known benefits and factors affecting implementation of labour companionship, more work is needed to improve equitable coverage. Concerted efforts are needed to engage with communities, health workers, health managers, and policy-makers to establish policies, address implementation barriers, and integrate data on coverage into perinatal records and quality processes to ensure that all women have access. Harmonized reporting of labour companionship would greatly enhance understanding at global level.

TI  - Pochvennichestvo and Symbolic Realism of V. P. Astafiev and V. G. Rasputin
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the beginning of the 21 century, when leading villagers (Astafiev, Belov, Rasputin) began to leave one after another, and it became easier for versifiers from different ideological positions to criticize their works, there was a need to protect village prose - the leading literary trend of the second half of the twentieth century. To do this, literary critics began to resurrect ideological attitudes (that were in demand in times of crisis to stabilize national consciousness), but not always justifiably, which caused a new wave of denial. The purpose of this article is to verify the existing and identify new approaches to village prose and poetics of its leading representatives in a similar context. The understanding of the subject in the context of traditionalism and conservatism is critically rechecked. The task of studying the poetics of such leading literary masters as Astafiev, Rasputin, comes to the fore from the point of view of the implementation in their artistic method of the "pochvennichestvo" ideology, most deeply rooted in the peasant-agricultural worldview. The author's tasks include the verification of the terminological content of pochvennichestvo, its historical genesis in the works of Dostoevsky, the coupling of the pochvennichestvo theory and literature, as well as its modifications in the "new pochvennichestvo" by Astafiev, Rasputin and other masters of village prose. First and foremost, research material included the new artistic method of symbolic realism, where the key ideologeme "earth-soil" has found implementation in the image-symbol of Mother Earth, the primary basis for this literary trend. This position is proven through the analysis of the poetics of Astafiev and Rasputin, whose new method and its key image-symbol have acquired a vivid artistic individualization. Nevertheless, as a result, the author of the article comes to the conclusion that one should not limit the artistic ideology of Astafiev or Rasputin to any one direction of philosophical thought, since the poetics of these artists is complex and multifaceted.

TI  - A Step-Wise Workflow for SAR Remote Sensing of Perennial Heaving Mound/Crater on the Yamal Peninsula, Western Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in the Arctic region is more significant than in other parts of our planet. One of the manifestations of these changes is crater creation with blowouts of a gas, ice and frozen soil mixture. In this context, dynamics studies of long-term heaving mounds that turn into craters as a result are relevant. A workflow for detecting and assessing anomalous dynamics of heaving mounds in the Arctic regions is proposed. Areas with anomalous increase of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering intensity are detected in the first stage. These increases take place due to sudden changes in local terrain slopes when the scattering surface (mound slope) turns toward the radar. Radar backscattering intensity also rises due to depolarization at newly formed frost cracks. Validation of the detected anomaly is carried out at the second stage through a comparison of multi-temporal digital elevation models obtained from bistatic radar interferometry TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data. At the final stage, the deformations are assessed within the detected areas using differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) technique by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. The magnitude of the heaving along the line of sight (LOS) was 22-24 cm in the period from January 2019 to January 2020. In general, effectiveness for detecting the perennial heaving mounds and the rate assessment of their increase were demonstrated in the suggested workflow.

TI  - Spotting Virus From Satellites: Modeling the Circulation of West Nile Virus Through Graph Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of West Nile virus (WNV) represents one of the most common mosquito-borne zoonosis viral infections. Its circulation is usually associated with climatic and environmental conditions suitable for vector proliferation and virus replication. On top of that, several statistical models have been developed to shape and forecast WNV circulation: in particular, the recent massive availability of Earth observation (EO) data coupled with the continuous advances in the field of artificial intelligence offer valuable opportunities. In this article, we seek to predict WNV circulation by feeding deep neural networks (DNNs) with satellite images, which have been extensively shown to hold environmental and climatic features. Notably, while previous approaches analyze each geographical site independently, we propose a spatial-aware approach that considers also the characteristics of close sites. Specifically, we build upon graph neural networks (GNNs) to aggregate features from neighboring places and further extend these modules to consider multiple relations, such as the difference in temperature and soil moisture between two sites, as well as the geographical distance. Moreover, we inject time-related information directly into the model to take into account the seasonality of virus spread. We design an experimental setting that combines satellite images-from Landsat and Sentinel missions-with ground-truth observations of WNV circulation in Italy. We show that our proposed multiadjacency graph attention network (MAGAT) consistently leads to higher performance when paired with an appropriate pretraining stage. Finally, we assess the importance of each component of MAGAT in our ablation studies.

TI  - Recent Advances in Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery for Early Gastric Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Maintaining the postoperative quality of life (QOL) while ensuring curability without overtreatment is important in the treatment of early gastric cancer. Postoperative QOL is anticipated to be maintained through minimally invasive function-preserving gastrectomy in early gastric cancer. The concept of the sentinel lymph node (SN) basin is essential to maintain the curability of early gastric cancer using minimally invasive function-preserving gastrectomy. However, additional resection after surgery is difficult to perform in gastric cancer. Thus, the SN basin theory is important. Recently, a multicenter randomized phase III trial in South Korea (SENORITA trial) proved that laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) for stomach preservation results in better postoperative QOL compared with standard gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer. LSNNS contributes to patients' QOL based on the concept that curability is not impaired. A multicenter nonrandomized phase III trial is ongoing in Japan, and oncologic safety is expected to be demonstrated. LSNNS has been established as a treatment option for selected patients with early gastric cancer, and its application will become widespread in the future.

TI  - Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation for Land Use and Land Cover Types Using Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using deep learning semantic segmentation for land use extraction is the most challenging problem in medium spatial resolution imagery. This is because of the deep convolution layer and multiple levels of deep steps of the baseline network, which can cause a degradation problem in small land use features. In this paper, a deep learning semantic segmentation algorithm which comprises an adjustment network architecture (LoopNet) and land use dataset is proposed for automatic land use classification using Landsat 8 imagery. The experimental results illustrate that deep learning semantic segmentation using the baseline network (SegNet, U-Net) outperforms pixel-based machine learning algorithms (MLE, SVM, RF) for land use classification. Furthermore, the LoopNet network, which comprises a convolutional loop and convolutional block, is superior to other baseline networks (SegNet, U-Net, PSPnet) and improvement networks (ResU-Net, DeeplabV3+, U-Net++), with 89.84% overall accuracy and good segmentation results. The evaluation of multispectral bands in the land use dataset demonstrates that Band 5 has good performance in terms of extraction accuracy, with 83.91% overall accuracy. Furthermore, the combination of different spectral bands (Band 1-Band 7) achieved the highest accuracy result (89.84%) compared to individual bands. These results indicate the effectiveness of LoopNet and multispectral bands for land use classification using Landsat 8 imagery.

TI  - Examining the value of satellite data in halting transmission of polio in Nigeria: A socioeconomic analysis
T2  - DATA & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, Nigeria halted transmission of wild poliovirus for the first time in its history. A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between $46.0 million and $153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations. We also explore the substantial benefits associated with follow-on projects that have made use of the satellite-based data products and methodologies originally developed for the Nigeria polio eradication effort.

T2  - ESTUDIOS DEL DESARROLLO SOCIAL-CUBA Y AMERICA LATINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The research objective is to propose dimensions for the empirical study of the communicative treatment of information in the press. Raising gender systems as an object of study is the starting point to question power relations from the objectives promoted by this to their forms of rationalization. Sexism affects the criteria of social transcendence within the press, originating two great consequences: the unequal distribution of narrative sources, and the unequal treatment of men and women. The communicative treatment encourages a hierarchical reading of the information that, by proposing concepts and interpretations, stimulates relationships and forms of exchange among citizens. Revitalizes an androcentric worldview, to the extent that it undervalues and denies the contributions of women to society. To dismantle this vision, it is necessary to begin with the delimitation of the geographical-cultural, physical and temporal framework that affects the subjects of the news; going through the role of legitimation, dissimulation, fragmentation and reification when prioritizing information; indicators of power as relevant as the distribution of roles and sources, norms and stereotypes; until you get to the elements of language.

AB  - A 'hybrid space architecture' has been proposed to facilitate robust and resilient satellite data downlink, integration and analysis; however, the technical details for what may comprise a hybrid space architecture are severely lacking. Thus far, 'hybrid' principally entails the diversity of commercial providers. While diverse suppliers can contribute to hybrid space architectures, we argue that robustness and resilience will only be achieved through heterogeneous network and asset architectures. A connected satellite services ecosystem composed of the union of different networks with different characteristics would limit single points of failure, thereby generating high levels of redundancy, resilience and scalability. This research outlines parameters of a hybrid space architecture, documents satellite service reference architectures and provides a comparative analysis of the features for each architecture. Further, through a case study of existing satellite service providers, we propose how a hybrid space architecture could be piloted in Northern Europe and the High North.

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Pathogens that persist in their host induce immune dysfunctions even in the absence of detectable replication. To better understand the phenotypic and functional changes that persistent infections induce in sentinel innate immune cells, we developed human PBMC-based HIV models of persistent infection. Autologous nonactivated PBMCs were cocultured with chronically infected, acutely infected, or uninfected cells and were then analyzed by unsupervised high-dimensional flow cytometry. Using this approach, we identified prevalent patterns of innate immune dysfunctions associated with persistent HIV infections that at least in part mirror immune dysfunctions observed in patients. In one or more models of chronic infection, bystander CD16+ NK cells expressing markers of activation, such as CD94, CD45RO, CD62L, CD69, CD25, and immune checkpoints PD1, Tim3, TIGIT, NKG2A and Lag3, were significantly reduced. Conversely, helper ILC subsets expressing PDL1/PDL2 were significantly enriched in chronic infection compared with either uninfected or acute infection, suggesting that chronic HIV-1 infection was associated with an inhibitory environment for bystander ILC and NK subsets. The cell-based models of persistent infection that we describe here provide versatile tools to explore the molecular mechanisms of these immune dysfunctions and unveil the contribution of innate immunity in sustaining pathogen persistence.

TI  - Use of Spatial Remote Sensing to Study the Temporal Evolution of the Water Retention of Al Massira Dam in Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Morocco, irrigated agriculture is still very much linked to the climate and the water retention of dams. With climate change, this country is experiencing recurrent drought, which has led to deficits in water inflow from the rivers to the various dams. The Al Massira dam, the area of study, does not escape this trend. This dam is the only surface water source for the irrigated area of Doukkala. Therefore, special attention must be paid to monitoring this resource at this dam. Thus, the proposed study examined the possibilities offered by spatial remote sensing to improve the current information system. It aims to evaluate this dam's reservoir by exploiting the data generated by using satellite images. The Landsat satellite images were used to assess the area of this dam by adopting an ap-proach combining spectral indices with thresholding. Then, the existing relationship between the area of the dam lake were examined, determined by spatial remote sensing and its water retention measured in situ. The results obtained revealed a strong correlation between the two parameters. Therefore, a study was conducted to find the best model for predicting the dam's impoundment based on its lake. The second-degree polynomial model showed a better performance. Given the results obtained, it is recommended to use geospatial methods in the current and prospective monitoring and steering system of water resources.

TI  - GENRE SPECIFICITY OF MODERN HAGIOGRAPHIC LITERATURE: "PROMISED PETUSHKI" BY GENNADY KATYSHEV
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors of modern theocentric prose often describe the life of the New martyrs and confessors of Russia in the twentieth century who suffered persecution for the faith in the twentieth century. Gennady Katyshev studied the biography of St. Athanasius (Sakharov), Bishop of Kovrov, and wrote the book "Promised Petushki". The book contains everyday stories about God's help to people, including episodes of the narrator's life, and biographies of the Saints of the twentieth century. The Life of St. Athanasius is the semantic center of the book. The distinctive features of the book correlate with various genres. As a scientific biography, it is based on historical research, archival materials and published sources. The biography also contains popularization techniques. The book resembles traditional hagiography, it brings spiritual benefits; historicism is combined with the aspiration for Eternal life. The similarity between some events in the lives of different ascetics is due to the similarity of circumstances and the worldview of the heroes. In this article we consider artistic time and space as the artistic features of the book. The artistic Universe is actualized according to the "I am - here - now" model. Any moment of time is connected with Eternity. The narrator, as fully as possible, describes the life of each character, therefore, the history of the country is repeatedly shown through personal perception.

TI  - Innate Immunity, Epithelial Plasticity, and Remodeling in Asthma.
T2  - Advances in experimental medicine and biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Innate immune responses (IIR) of the epithelium play a critical role in the initiation and progression of asthma. The core of the IIR is an intracellular signaling pathway activated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to limit the spread of infectious organisms. This chapter will focus on the epithelium as the major innate sentinel cell and its role in acute exacerbations (AEs). Although the pathways of how the IIR activates the NFkappaB transcription factor, triggering cytokine secretion, dendritic cell activation, and Th2 polarization are well-described, recent exciting work has developed mechanistic insights into how chronic activation of the IIR is linked to mucosal adaptive responses. These adaptations include changes in cell state, now called epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). EMP is a coordinated, genomic response to airway injury disrupting epithelial barrier function, expanding the basal lamina, and producing airway remodeling. EMP is driven by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a transcriptional response producing metabolic shunting of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to protein N-glycosylation. NFkappaB signaling and UPR activation pathways potentiate each other in remodeling the basement membrane. Understanding of injury-repair process of epithelium provides new therapeutic targets for precision approaches to the treatment of asthma exacerbations and their sequelae.

T2  - Scientific reports

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Eragrostis curvula is an agronomically and ecologically undesirable perennial tussock grass dispersed across Australia. The objective of this study is to investigate relationships of ecologically relevant abiotic variables with the presence of E. curvula at a landscape scale in the Snowy Monaro region, Australia. Through vegetation surveys across 21 privately owned properties and freely available ancillary data on E. curvula presence, we used seven predictor variables, including Sentinel 2 NDVI reflectance, topography, distance from roads and watercourses and climate, to predict the presence or absence of E. curvula across its invaded range using a random forest (RF) algorithm. Assessment of performance metrics resulted in a pseudo-R squared of 0.96, a kappa of 0.97 and an R squared for out-of-bag samples of 0.67. Temperature had the largest influence on the model's performance, followed by linear features such as highways and rivers. Highways' high importance in the model may indicate that the presence or absence of E. curvula is related to the density of human transit, thus as a vector of E. curvula propagule dispersal. Further, humans' tendency to reside adjacent to rivers may indicate that E. curvula's presence or absence is related to human density and E. curvula's potential to spread via water courses.

TI  - Tularemia above the Treeline: Climate and Rodent Abundance Influences Exposure of a Sentinel Species, the Arctic Fox (<i>Vulpes lagopus</i>), to <i>Francisella tularensis</i>
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tularemia is a zoonotic disease found throughout most of the northern hemisphere that may experience range expansion with warming temperatures. Rodents and lagomorphs are reservoirs for the disease, and outbreaks of tularemia often follow peaks in their abundance. As small mammals dominate the diet of arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), we determined whether they may serve as sentinels by identifying antibodies in live-captured and harvested foxes from northern Canada. Overall seroprevalence was 2% (CI95 1-2%) in 176 foxes harvested in 2018-2019 compared to 17% (CI95 12-22%) of 230 foxes captured live in 2011-2021. Prevalence was at an all-time high in 2018, following a peak in vole abundance in 2017. Antibodies were identified in fox pups born in 2018 and 2019, suggesting that F. tularensis was actively transmitted during the summers. High precipitation during the summer, increased snow cover and colder temperatures in May, and a higher abundance of voles were all associated with increased seroprevalence in live-captured foxes. Thus, exposure to F. tularensis is largely mediated through climate and rodent populations in the Canadian Arctic, and arctic foxes are useful sentinels for F. tularensis in northern ecosystems. Further studies should investigate whether infection impacts arctic fox survival and reproductive success in the circumpolar North.

TI  - Uncovering hypercoagulation status using rotational thromboelastometry in patients with sepsis presented with hypocoagulation based on conventional coagulation tests: an observational study
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Conventional coag-ulation tests (CCTs) cannot identify hypercoag-ulation, despite being common in patients with sepsis. Moreover, CCTs overdiagnose hypoco-agulation, which increases unnecessary blood transfusion. Therefore, we aimed to use rota-tional thromboelastometry (ROTEM) to classi-fy the coagulation status of patients with sep-sis with abnormal CCTs and to identify the main coagulation components that affect coagulation status.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was part of an observational study to investigate ROTEM use in 161 patients with sepsis with the Sepsis-3 criteria. They underwent concurrent CCTs and ROTEM assessments within 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit admission at the Univer-sity Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, from June 2020 to December 2021. This study only extract-ed data from patients with sepsis with abnormal CCTs, including activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, international normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration.RESULTS: A total of 158 patients with sep-sis with abnormal CCTs had a median age of 69, and 48.7% were women. Of 34 patients with INR & GE;1.6, ROTEM identified 11.8% with hyperco-agulation and 20.6% with normal coagulation. Of 29 patients with platelet counts <100 (103/ mm3), ROTEM identified 3.5% with hypercoagu-lation and 24.1% with normal coagulation. In the ROTEM-based hypercoagulability group, an in-crease in maximum clot firmness was observed in 95.1% of cases; also, this group had signifi-cantly higher plasma fibrinogen concentrations than other groups (p<0.005).CONCLUSIONS: ROTEM can reveal hyperco-agulability in patients with sepsis with hypoco-agulation based on CCTs. Hyperfibrinogenemia causes hypercoagulation in patients with sepsis.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Presumed Low- and Intermediate-Risk Endometrial Cancer Management (SLIM): A Multicenter, Prospective Cohort Study in The Netherlands
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is safe, feasible, and cost-effective to determine the lymph node status in endometrial cancer (EC). The aim of our prospective SLIM study was to investigate the incidence of SLN metastases and the contribution of SLN mapping in the management of presumed low- and intermediate-risk EC, i.e., clinical early-stage EC, endometrioid histology, grade 1 or 2. SLN metastases were present in 11.2% of 152 patients. Adjuvant management was adjusted based on the SLN status in 7.9% of patients: in 5.9% adjuvant treatment was added due to a positive sentinel node, and in 2.0% adjuvant treatment was limited due to unexpected grade 3 disease with a negative SLN. SLN mapping seems important in patients with presumed low- and intermediate-risk EC and may avoid undertreatment as well as overtreatment. The aim was to investigate the incidence of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases and the contribution of SLN mapping in presumed low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer (EC). A multicenter, prospective cohort study in presumed low- and intermediate-risk EC patients was performed. Patients underwent SLN mapping using cervical injections of indocyanine green and a minimally invasive hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The primary outcome was the incidence of SLN metastases, leading to adjusted adjuvant treatment. Secondary outcomes were the SLN detection rate and the occurrence of complications. Descriptive statistics and univariate general linear model analyses were used. A total of 152 patients were enrolled, with overall and bilateral SLN detection rates of 91% and 61%, respectively. At final histology, 78.9% of patients (n = 120) had truly low- and intermediate-risk EC. Macro- and micro-metastases were present in 11.2% (n = 17/152), and three patients had isolated tumor cells (2.0%). Nine patients (5.9%) had addition of adjuvant radiotherapy based on SLN metastases only. In 2.0% of patients with high-risk disease, adjuvant therapy was more limited due to negative SLNs. This study emphasizes the importance of SLN mapping in presumed early-stage, grade 1 and 2 EC, leading to individualized adjuvant management, resulting in less undertreatment and overtreatment.

TI  - The horse as a Chthonic Being in Khakass Beliefs and Folklore (late XIX-XX century)
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its domestication, the horse has played an important role in human life. It has contributed to making people extremely mobile. By covering great distances relatively quickly, they managed to dominate large areas. People actively involved the horse in economic, military, religious, ceremonial, and other activities. Its importance was so great that it became an obligatory part of funeral rites. Horses were buried with their deceased owners, so they became signposts to the "other world" for them and continued to serve them even after death. Archaic consciousness often attributed the use of a horse as a mount to the inhabitants of the subterranean world of non-human nature. Similar ideological ideas were definitely present among the Khakass. This work aims to characterize the horse as a religious and mythological figure of the Khakass, having a chthonic nature. The work's chronological framework is limited to the late XIX-XX century framework. The source material on the research topic determines the choice of this time frame. Ethnographic and folkloric materials, published and put into scientific circulation, served as a source base. Among the folk sources, the heroic stories (Alyptyg Nymakhtar) are widely used, from which excerpts in the author's translation are presented in Russian for the first time. Guiding the study is the principle of historicism, in which each cultural phenomenon is considered in its development, considering a specific situation. The research methodology uses historical and ethnographic methods: Vestiges (relics), folklore, and semantic analysis. The results of the study suggest that the image of the horse in the Khakass culture was endowed with extensive and diverse symbolism. It was a sacred animal and directly related to traditional ideas about death and the other world. The horse is a signpost to the other world and also an attribute of lower mythological beings. As a chthonic being, it is endowed with a number of specific characteristics: various physical anomalies, polymorphism, size, supernatural abilities, and connection with the element of water.

TI  - Interpretation of aeromagnetic and gravimetric satellite data to identify areas with aquifer potential in the western Grijalva basin, Mexico
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research is to interpret the magnetic and gravimetric responses subsur-face in the western portion of the Grijalva basin, Mexico, in order to identify and delimit the areas of rock units with aquifer potential. For it, the processing of satellite aeromagnetic and gravimetric data was car-ried out with the purpose of delimiting the geological characteristics of greatest interest. The results show that the north-central part of the study portion represents the area with the greatest aquifer potential, and it coin-cides with the areas of greater sedimentary thickness, of lower altitude, and where the groundwater concessions are concentrated. Therefore, the change of gradients between magnetic and gravimetric responses contrib-utes to the knowledge of the structural frame-work (faults, fractures, edges, and geological contacts) and the inference of areas with aquifer potential. In detail, from the filters used, the Tilt Derivative (TDR) presents the linear trends associated with the structural framework of a specific water interest. It seeks to promote decision-making and research on geohydrological topics, territorial planning, and related public policies.

TI  - Predictive model for monitoring water turbidity in a subtropical lagoon using Sentinel-2A/B MSI images
T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring prompt and effective water quality monitoring is increasingly important. Remote sensing has been shown to be an effective tool for simplifying and speeding up this process. The aim of this study is to develop an empirical model to map the spatial and temporal dynamics of turbidity in Mirim Lagoon, located in southern Brazil. To achieve this, Sentinel-2A/B MSI sensor data were combined with turbidity data collected in situ. The model was applied to monthly images (with cloud cover <= 20%) in 2019 and 2020 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Mean turbidity values in the lagoon did not vary significantly, remaining between 30 and 75 NTU overall. However, there were differences in turbidity levels between the northern and southern regions of the lagoon in some months of the investigated years. By applying this methodology and analyzing the results, we were able to better understand the behavior of turbidity throughout the lagoon and gain insights into the quality of this important freshwater source.

TI  - An Adaptive Stacking Regressor With a Self-Iterative Optimization Module for Improving Fractional Woody Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying woody vegetation cover is essential for understanding vegetation evolution and formulating land use management policies. However, most attention has focused on the retrieval of forest attributes, and it is imperative to enhance the capability to monitor the cover of woody vegetation. This study proposed an adaptive stacking regressor with a self iterative optimization module to improve the quantification of the fractional woody cover. The adaptive stacking model was trained using synthetic mixing techniques and the 2021 Landsat composite to estimate the proportion of woody cover in Shaanxi Province, China. Results show that: 1) the proposed model exhibits a stable relationship (R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 0.1020) between very high-resolution (VHR)-derived reference data and the Landsat-based wood cover fraction estimates; 2) the proposed model outperforms other classifiers in heterogeneous region mapping of woody vegetation, followed by random forest (RF) (R-2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 0.1492), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) (R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 0.2550), and classification and regression tree (CART) (R-2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 0.2042) models; and 3) uncertainty analysis based on the Monte Carlo method revealed that the adaptive stacking model improved the overestimations of low cover fractions and underestimations of high cover fractions. The adaptive stacking model is expected to advance the systematic monitoring of biophysical parameters of the land surface.

M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services, are strategic allies in carbon capture and storage, conserve different plant and wildlife species, are producers of aquatic species such as crabs and shrimp, and local communities have developed strong economic, cultural and identity ties. Despite their great ecological, economic, and social importance, mangroves are threatened by natural and anthropogenic factors, hence the importance of their constant monitoring. Remote sensing technology has demonstrated its ability to map changes in mangroves and technological advances allow faster application of mapping methodologies, optimizing costs and time. To facilitate the sustainable management of mangroves, an open tool based on remote sensing data and machine learning was developed on the Google Earth Engine platform (MANGLEE). MANGLEE was tested in the mangroves of Guayas, Ecuador. Mangrove cover maps were obtained for the years 2018, 2020 and 2022 as well as the mangrove change maps for the two periods 2018-2020 and 2020-2022. The maps generated in this service are also available on the APP MANGLEE: The methodology and the diffusion workshops are available at the following link.

TI  - Validation of surgical care quality indicators in the Brazilian Unified Health System
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a set of indicators for monitoring the quality of surgical procedures in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). METHODS: Validation study developed in 5 stages: 1) literature review; 2) prioritization of indicators; 3) content validation of indicators by RAND/UCLA consensus method; 4) pilot study for reliability analysis; and 5) development of instruction for tabulation of outcome indicators for monitoring via official information systems. RESULTS: From the literature review, 217 indicators of surgical quality were identified. The excluded indicators were: those based on scientific evidence lower than 1A, similar, specific, which corresponded to sentinel events; and those that did not apply to the SUS context. Twenty-six indicators with a high level of scientific evidence were submitted to expert consensus. Twenty-two indicators were validated, of which 14 process indicators and 8 outcome indicators with content validation index >= 80%. Of the validated process indicators, 6 were considered substantially reliable (Kappa coefficient between 0.6 and 0.8; p < 0.05) and 2 had almost perfect reliability (Kappa coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05), when the inter-rater agreement was analyzed. One could measure and establish tabulation mechanism for TabWin for 7 outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: The study contributes to the development of a set of potentially effective surgical indicators for monitoring the quality of care and patient safety in SUS hospital services.

TI  - Uncovering Archaeological Sites in Airborne LiDAR Data With Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping potential archaeological sites using remote sensing and artificial intelligence can be an efficient tool to assist archaeologists during project planning and fieldwork. This paper explores the use of airborne LiDAR data and data-centric artificial intelligence for identifying potential burial mounds. The challenge of exploring the landscape and mapping new archaeological sites, coupled with the difficulty of identifying them through visual analysis of remote sensing data, results in the recurring issue of insufficient annotations. Additionally, the top-down nature of LiDAR data hinders artificial intelligence in its search, as the morphology of archaeological sites blends with the morphology of natural and artificial shapes, leading to a frequent occurrence of false positives. To address this problem, a novel data-centric artificial intelligence approach is proposed, exploring the available data and tools. The LiDAR data is pre-processed into a dataset of 2D digital elevation images, and the known burial mounds are annotated. This dataset is augmented with a copy-paste object embedding based on Location-Based Ranking. This technique uses the Land-Use and Occupation Charter to segment the regions of interest, where burial mounds can be pasted. YOLOv5 is trained on the resulting dataset to propose new burial mounds. These proposals go through a post-processing step, directly using the 3D data acquired by the LiDAR to verify if its 3D shape is similar to the annotated sites. This approach drastically reduced false positives, attaining a 72.53% positive rate, relevant for the ground-truthing phase where archaeologists visit the coordinates of proposed burial mounds to confirm their existence.

TI  - Influenza hospitalisations in Spain between the last influenza and COVID-19 pandemic (2009-2019).
T2  - Epidemiology and infection
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Knowing the burden of severe disease caused by influenza is essential for disease risk communication, to understand the true impact of vaccination programmes and to guide public health and disease control measures. We estimated the number of influenza-attributable hospitalisations in Spain during the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 seasons - based on the hospitalisations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Spain using the hospital discharge database and virological influenza information from the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS). The weekly numbers of influenza-attributable hospitalisations were calculated by multiplying the weekly SARI hospitalisations by the weekly influenza virus positivity, obtained from the SISSS in each season, stratified by age group and sex. The influenza-related hospitalisation burden is age-specific and varies significantly by influenza season. People aged 65 and over yielded the highest average influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates per season (615.6 per 100,000), followed by children aged under 5 (251.2 per 100,000). These results provide an essential contribution to influenza control and to improving existing vaccination programmes, as well as to the optimisation and planning of health resources and policies.

TI  - ICESAT-2 Shallow Bathymetric Mapping Based on a Size and Direction Adaptive Filtering Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) satellite adopts 532 nm single-photon lidar with shallow sea bathymetry capability. In order to realize high-precision and automated shallow sea bathymetric mapping based on ICESat-2 photon data, an adaptive underwater point denoising algorithm that considers the search direction and search size is proposed in this article, and a detailed data processing process is discussed to further verify the technical feasibility. The accuracy of direct bathymetry and active-passive fusion bathymetry from ICESat-2 is systematically analyzed using airborne in situ data. First, the underwater photon points are separated by surface position identification; then, the signal point cloud search strategy is improved, the search size increases with water depth, the search angle is rotated and the direction of the maximum number of point clouds is taken as the main direction, and the threshold is automatically determined by histogram Gaussian fitting of the point cloud density to achieve automatic underwater signal extraction; then, the refraction correction is carried out based on the light geometry and the water depth is obtained; finally, the active-passive fusion bathymetry is performed by combining the optical remote sensing images WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2, and the accuracy is verified by using the airborne lidar bathymetric data provided by NOAA. The experimental results show that the proposed denoising algorithm can accurately discriminate the underwater signal/noise, and the overall accuracy is better than 86%; the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ICESat-2 direct bathymetry is between 0.42 and 0.98 m; the RMSE of active-passive fusion bathymetry is between 0.84 and 1.88 m. Our workflow and experimental results demonstrate a means of using ICESat-2 to produce relatively accurate bathymetric maps in shallow, clear water environments.

TI  - A Two-Stage Machine Learning Algorithm for Retrieving Multiple Aerosol Properties Over Land: Development and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol optical property retrieval over land, especially size-related parameters, is challenging. This study proposed a novel two-stage machine learning (ML) algorithm for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD), angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), fine mode fraction (FMF), and fine mode AOD (FAOD) over land using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed reflectance. The new ML algorithm consists of three steps: 1) all samples extracted from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements were used to train the ML model; 2) then, to reduce the extreme estimation bias of the model, divided low- and high-value samples were used to train low- and high-value ML models, respectively; and 3) finally, the three ML models were integrated into the final retrieval based on the weight interpolation. Independent site network validation results show that the new ML algorithm has a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.894 (0.638, 0.661, and 0.865) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.146 (0.258, 0.245, and 0.153) for the AOD (AE, FMF, and FAOD) retrieval, which significantly outperforms the validation metrics of MODIS operational products, with AOD (AE, FMF, and FAOD) RMSE of 0.130-0.156 (0.536-0.569, 0.313, and 0.191). The intercomparison of aerosol products shows that the spatial patterns of AOD, AE, FMF, and FAOD of the new ML algorithm are in good agreement with those of the MODIS, and Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER) products. These results illustrate that the new ML algorithm has good performance and transferability, and indicate the ability of ML methods to be applied to multispectral instruments (such as MODIS) to retrieve multiple aerosol properties.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Multi-scale Green Space Environments and Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study of Beijing Sub-center
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of global industrialization and urbanization and the aggravation of climate warming, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become an important environmental problem affecting human survival and development. In 2020, China clearly set a "dual carbon" target. Because the location and layout of urban green space are related to the function of carbon sink, the study of the relationship between the construction of urban green spaces and the heat island effect is of great significance. This study was based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images of the Tongzhou District, Beijing, from 2013 to 2019 and examined the effect of urban green space construction and the heat island effect in the Tongzhou District at three scales: the macro level of the overall construction environment, the meso level of the urban area, and the micro level of the individual park. The results show that: (1) when the vegetation coverage was increased by 10% in the Tongzhou District, the temperature decreased by 0.58-0.68 celcius; (2) the change in the heat island in the Tongzhou District had a circular layered structure, the degree of mitigation produced by green space in different circles differed, and the effect of urban and rural transition areas was obvious; and (3) parks have different effects on the temperature drop inside and outside the park. The cooling benefit was higher when the area of an individual park was 105 ha or less, and a park including both forest and wetland had better cooling ability. This study clarifies the direction of urban space cooling and carbon control at different levels and proposes a multi-scale planning decision-making process for urban green space based on temperature orientation, thereby providing a theoretical reference for macro policy, standards, planning, and park design of urban green spaces.

TI  - A full-level fused cross-task transfer learning method for building change detection using noise-robust pretrained networks on crowdsourced labels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate building change detection is crucial for understanding urban development. Although fully supervised deep learning-based methods for building change detection have made progress, they tend to fuse temporal information only at a single level (e.g., input, feature, or decision levels) to mitigate the data distribution differences between time-series images, which is highly prone to introduce a large number of pseudo changes. Moreover, these methods rely on a large number of high-quality pixel-level change labels with high acquisition costs. In contrast, available crowdsourced building data are abundant but are less considered for change detection. For example, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Google Map, and Gaode Map provide lots of available building labels, yet they usually contain noise such as false alarms, omissions, and mismatches, limiting their wide application. In addition, when the building extraction task is transferred to the building change detection task, the temporal and regional differences between different images may lead to undesired pseudo changes. Given these issues, we propose a full-level fused cross-task transfer learning method for building change detection using only crowdsourced building labels and high-resolution satellite imagery. The method consists of three steps: 1) noise-robust building extraction network pretraining; 2) uncertainty-aware pseudo label generation; and 3) fulllevel fused building change detection. We created building extraction and building change detection datasets. The former (building extraction dataset) contains 30 scenes of ZY-3 images covering 27 major cities in China and crowdsourced building labels from Gaode Map for training, while the latter (building change dataset) contains bi-temporal ZY-3 images in Shanghai and Beijing for testing. The results show that the proposed method can identify changed buildings more effectively and better balance false alarms and omissions, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis indicates that the inclusion of samples from multiple cities with various spatial heterogeneities is helpful to improve the performance. The experiments show that it is promising to apply the proposed method to situations where true labels are completely lacking or limited, thus alleviating the issue of high label acquisition cost.

TI  - Innovative Remote Sensing Identification of Cyanobacterial Blooms Inspired from Pseudo Water Color
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) is critical for ensuring water security. However, traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive and are not ideal for large-scale monitoring. In operational monitoring, the existing remote sensing methods are also not ideal due to complex surface features, unstable models, and poor robustness thresholds. Here, a novel algorithm, the pseudo-Forel-Ule index (P-FUI), is developed and validated to identify cyanobacterial blooms based on Terra MODIS, Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Sentinel-3 OLCI sensors. First, three parameters of P-FUI, that is, brightness Y, saturation s, and hue angle alpha, were calculated based on remote sensing reflectance. Then, the robustness thresholds of the parameters were determined by statistical analysis for a frequency distribution histogram. We validated the accuracy of our approach using high-spatial-resolution satellite data with the aid of field investigations. Considerable results were obtained by using water color differences directly. The overall classification accuracy is more than 93.76%, and the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy are more than 94.60% and 94.00%, respectively, with a kappa coefficient of 0.91. The identified cyanobacterial blooms' spatial distribution with high, medium, and low intensity produced consistent results compared to those based on satellite data. Impact factors were also discussed, and the algorithm was shown to be tolerant of perturbations by clouds and high turbidity. This new approach enables operational monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes.

TI  - Multisensor Temporal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Land Cover Mapping With Spatial Pseudo-Labeling and Adversarial Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the huge variety of Earth observation satellite missions available nowadays, the collection of multisensor remote sensing information depicting the same geographical area has become systematic in practice, paving the way to the further breakthroughs in automatic land cover mapping with the aim to support decision makers in a variety of land management applications. In this context, along with the increase in the volume of data available, the availability of ground-truth (GT) data to train supervised models, which is usually time-consuming and costly, may even be more critical. In this scenario, the possibility to transfer a model learned on a particular time span (source domain) to a different period of time (target domain), over the same geographical area, can be advantageous in terms of both cost and time efforts. However, such model transfer is challenging due to different climate, weather, or environmental conditions affecting remote sensing data collected at different time periods, resulting in possible distribution shifts between the source and target domains. With the aim to cope with the multisensor temporal transfer scenario in the context of land cover mapping, where multitemporal and multiscale information are used jointly, we propose a Multisensor, Multitemporal, and Multiscale SPatially Aware Domain Adaptation (M3SPADA) framework, a deep learning methodology that jointly exploits self-training and adversarial learning to transfer a multisensor land cover classifier (MSLCC) from a time period (year) to a different one on the same geographical area. Here, we consider the case in which each domain (source and target) is described by a pair of remote sensing datasets: a satellite image time series (SITS) of optical images and a single very high spatial resolution (VHR) scene. Experimental evaluation on a real-world study case located in Burkina Faso and characterized by operational constraints shows the quality of our proposal to deal with the temporal multisensor transfer in the context of land cover mapping.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Given the growing interest in sentinel node mapping (SLN) biopsy in Endometrial Cancer (EC) patients, many efforts have been made to maximize the SLN bilateral detection rate. However, at present, no previous research assessed the potential correlation between primary EC location in the uterine cavity and SLN mapping. In this context, this study aims to investigate the possible role of intrauterine EC hysteroscopic localization in predicting SLN nodal placement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: EC patients surgically treated from January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and SLN mapping. During hysteroscopy, the location of the neoplastic lesion was described as follows: uterine fundus (comprising the most cranial portion of the uterine cavity up to the tubal ostium including the cornual areas), corpus uteri (from the tubal ostium to the inner uterine orifice), and diffuse (when the tumor invades more than 50% of the uterine cavity).RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients met the inclusion criteria. The tumor pattern diffused to the whole uterine cavity was statistically associated with SLN uptake on common iliac lymph nodes (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1-5.8, p=0.05). Patients'age is an independent factor associated with SLN failure (OR: 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.98, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a statistically significant association between EC hysteroscopically spread throughout the whole uterine cavity and SLN uptake at the common iliac lymph nodes. Furthermore, patient age negatively affected the SLN detection rate.

TI  - Fragmentation Analysis of Capisaan Surface Karst Landscape through Changes in Land Use and Land Cover using FRAGSTATS
T2  - MINDANAO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover mainly brought by humans could alter how landscapes function, which has an impact on the variety and health of the local biota. This study examined the fragmentation shifts of the Capisaan Cave System surface landscape by looking at changes in land use and land cover using Landsat images, ArcGIS and Google Earth imageries to generate classified land covers for the years 2001, 2005, 2010, 2016 and 2019. Fragmentation was analyzed through FRAGSTATS with forest; shrubland and orchard (SO); and agriculture and clearing (AC) as class types. Results showed that the most significant change in the landscape was in the year 2010 with AC significantly increasing its area and aggregation causing other class types to exhibit more fragmentation. Forest and SO covers displayed huge losses indicated by decreased class area and average size of patches accompanied by a more subdivided landscape shown by their increased number of patches. Although forest and SO slightly recovered in the class area in 2016, values were far from recovering to 2001 values. FRAGSTATS data suggest lowering biodiversity values and paying importance to reserve size in the maintenance of species diversity. The edge effect as a result of class and landscape fragmentation in forest vegetation might have been reduced at the landscape level as indicated by the reduced fractal dimension, as well as sustaining patch cohesion and increased clumpiness. However, abatement of edge effect could be easily limited and reversed if the reduction of the total area of forest available in the landscape continues.

TI  - A Deep Learning Framework for the Estimation of Forest Height From Bistatic TanDEM-X Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date canopy height model (CHM) estimates are of key importance for forest resource monitoring and disturbance analysis. In this article, we present a study on the potential of deep learning (DL) for the regression of forest height from TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. We propose a novel fully convolutional neural network framework, trained in a supervised manner using reference CHM measurements derived from the LiDAR LVIS airborne sensor from NASA. The reference measurements were acquired during the joint NASA-ESA 2016 AfriSAR campaign over five sites in Gabon, Africa, characterized by the presence of different kinds of vegetation, spanning from tropical primary forests to mangroves. Together with the DL architecture and training strategy, we present a series of experiments to assess the impact of different input features on the network estimation accuracy (in particular of bistatic InSAR-related ones). When tested on all the considered sites, the proposed DL model achieves an overall performance of 1.46-m mean error, 4.2-m mean absolute error, and 15.06% mean absolute percentage error. Furthermore, we perform a spatial transfer analysis aimed at deriving preliminary insights on the generalization capability of the network when trained and tested on datasets acquired over different locations, combining different kinds of tropical vegetation. The obtained results are promising and already in line with state-of-the-art methods based on both physical-based modeling and data-driven approaches, with the remarkable advantage of requiring only one single TanDEM-X acquisition at inference time.

AB  - Background: The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000).Methods: This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch.Results: Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes.Conclusions: The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies.Funding: No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis. Coordinators were supported by fellowships from the European Union (ZAD received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 845681), the Wellcome Trust (SB, Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship), and the National Health and Medical Research Council (DJI is supported by an NHMRC Investigator Grant [GNT1195210]).
AB  - Salmonella Typhi (Typhi) is a type of bacteria that causes typhoid fever. More than 110,000 people die from this disease each year, predominantly in areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia with limited access to safe water and sanitation. Clinicians use antibiotics to treat typhoid fever, but scientists worry that the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Typhi could render the drugs ineffective, leading to increased typhoid fever mortality. The World Health Organization has prequalified two vaccines that are highly effective in preventing typhoid fever and may also help limit the emergence and spread of resistant Typhi. In low resource settings, public health officials must make difficult trade-off decisions about which new vaccines to introduce into already crowded immunization schedules. Understanding the local burden of antimicrobial-resistant Typhi and how it is spreading could help inform their actions. The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium analyzed 13,000 Typhi genomes from 110 countries to provide a global overview of genetic diversity and antimicrobial-resistant patterns. The analysis showed great genetic diversity of the different strains between countries and regions. For example, the H58 Typhi variant, which is often drug-resistant, has spread rapidly through Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, but is less common in other regions. However, distinct strains of other drug-resistant Typhi have emerged in other parts of the world. Resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin was widespread and accounted for over 85% of cases in South Africa. Around 70% of Typhi from Pakistan were extensively drug-resistant in 2020, but these hard-to-treat variants have not yet become established elsewhere. Variants that are resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone have been identified, and azithromycin resistance has also appeared in several different variants across South Asia. The Consortiums analyses provide valuable insights into the global distribution and transmission patterns of drug-resistant Typhi. Limited genetic data were available fromseveral regions, but data from travel-associated cases helped fill some regional gaps. These findings may help serve as a starting point for collective sharing and analyses of genetic data to inform local public health action. Funders need to provide ongoing supportto help fill global surveillance data gaps.

T2  - REVER-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS DA RELIGIAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to investigate how Buddhism is related to science as a mechanism for legitimizing its meditative practices and worldview. The first part takes a historical review of the different moments that mark the dialogue between Buddhism and the scientific worldview in the Western sociocultural context. Then, the paper explores the narratives of various contemporary Buddhist leaders and personalities from the scientific field to identify the different argumentative modalities that support the compatibility between Buddhism and science. From this conceptual scheme, the last section of the article analyzes the stories of committed practitioners of Buddhist centers formed in Argentina in recent decades to investigate the modalities of reception and appropriation of this discourse.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of nitrate based on Landsat 8 in Playa Colorada bay, Sinaloa, Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing water quality in coastal waters through spatial observations is challenging, due to spatial and temporal variations in water composition. Nitrate, an important compound for water quality assessment, has received little attention in estimates made from satellite measurements, even though it can be estimated using models generated from multispectral images. Since nitrate is a non-optically active parameter that can be correlated with optically active parameters, it was related to bands of the visible and infrared spectrum, captured in Landsat-8 images, and used to generate empirical models to estimate the spatio-temporal variation of nitrate concentration in the Playa Colorada Bay, in the state of Sinaloa Northwest Mexico. Four sampling campaigns were performed, two in spring and two in fall. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration ranged between 0.69 and 1.80 mg/L, values higher than those recommended in the Mexican ecological criteria of water quality for the protection of marine aquatic life in coastal areas. Generated models showed a significant relationship (P < 0.05) between NO3-N and band reflectance in the infrared (band 5) and short-wave infrared (band 6 and band 7) spectra of Landsat-8 imagery. The B6 band appeared in all models selected to estimate NO3-N in the bay. These results evidence the potential of Landsat-8 images for the estimation of nitrate in the coastal waters of Sinaloa, Mexico.

TI  - Spatio-temporal water quality variability and regionalization of tropical reservoirs based on Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs are aquatic environments with complex interactions between bio-chemical and physical components. Many of those parameters can be estimated from remote sensing tools, especially since increasing technological progress allows the analysis of those environments in high spatial and temporal resolutions. This work aimed to analyze the water quality of four reservoirs, with high energy productivity, located in the center-southern region of Brazil from bio-optical and thermal water parameters. Therefore, hundreds of Landsat 5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI) satellite images were processed by the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to estimate water surface temperature, chlorophyll-a density (chl-a), Secchi depth (SD), and trophic state index (TSI). To calibrate the equations, 11 in situ monitoring points were used in 27 scenes from the TM and ETM+ sensors and 30 from the OLI sensor, within 6 days interval between the monitoring date and the image acquisition. Additionally, records from two weather stations near the reservoirs were analyzed to evaluate meteorological influences on water parameters. SD has influenced TSI in three reservoirs, while chl-a has acted as a proxy in only one. Moderate correlations were observed between air temperature, rainfall, and global radiation and the bio-optical and thermal water parameters. Remote sensing has detected a clear spatio-temporal variation, which allowed regionalizing the reservoirs. Reservoir regionalization based on the mapped parameters may be able not only to visualize the spatial dynamics of the waters but also as a tool for the management of water bodies with multiple users and issues.

TI  - Satellite InSAR technology for structural health monitoring of road bridges and the surrounding territory: a case study

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems

AB  - This paper explores the potential of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of road bridges. While many road bridges worldwide are over half a century old and exhibit widespread deterioration, traditional contact-type sensors for SHM are installed only on a few structures, mainly due to their high cost. In recent years, remote sensing techniques, such as satellite InSAR technology, have been explored to overcome these limitations. This paper focuses on the displacements of the Po River Bridge, which is part of the Italian A22 Highway. We extract the bridge's displacement with Multi-Temporal InSAR data processing using SAR images acquired by the Italian Cosmo-SkyMed mission. We study 8 years of displacement time series of reflective targets, Persistent Scatterers, naturally visible on the bridge without installing any instrumentation on site. We perform an exploratory analysis of the displacements of the entire area through the K-means clustering algorithms and investigate the correlation between the bridge displacements and environmental phenomena (variation of air temperature and river water flow). The results confirm the potential of satellite InSAR technology for the remote monitoring of road bridges and their surrounding area. However, they also highlight the need for a metrological validation of such technology through a direct comparison with measurements from traditional and already validated SHM systems.

TI  - Multi-spatiotemporal analysis of changes in mangrove forests in Palawan, Philippines: predicting future trends using a support vector machine algorithm and the Markov chain model.
T2  - UCL open environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Multi-temporal remote sensing imagery can be used to explore how mangrove assemblages are changing over time and facilitate critical interventions for ecological sustainability and effective management. This study aims to explore the spatial dynamics of mangrove extents in Palawan, Philippines, specifically in Puerto Princesa City, Taytay and Aborlan, and facilitate future predictions for Palawan using the Markov Chain model. The multi-date Landsat imageries during the period 1988-2020 were used for this research. The support vector machine algorithm was sufficiently effective for mangrove feature extraction to generate satisfactory accuracy results (>70% kappa coefficient values; 91% average overall accuracies). In Palawan, a 5.2% (2693 ha) decrease was recorded during 1988-1998 and an 8.6% increase in 2013-2020 to 4371 ha. In Puerto Princesa City, a 95.9% (2758 ha) increase was observed during 1988-1998 and 2.0% (136 ha) decrease during 2013-2020. The mangroves in Taytay and Aborlan both gained an additional 2138 ha (55.3%) and 228 ha (16.8%) during 1988-1998 but also decreased from 2013 to 2020 by 3.4% (247 ha) and 0.2% (3 ha), respectively. However, projected results suggest that the mangrove areas in Palawan will likely increase in 2030 (to 64,946 ha) and 2050 (to 66,972 ha). This study demonstrated the capability of the Markov chain model in the context of ecological sustainability involving policy intervention. However, as this research did not capture the environmental factors that may have influenced the changes in mangrove patterns, it is suggested adding cellular automata in future Markovian mangrove modelling.

TI  - Melanoma Prognosis and Associated Risk Factors: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using Semantic Map Analysis
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall patterns of correlations among various melanoma risk factors have not yet been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different parameters on disease-free and melanomarelated overall survival. A retrospective cohort study was conducted encompassing all patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in a university referral centre. Associations were explored using semantic map analysis, which uses graph theory to find the strongest path of connections between variables. A total of 1,110 melanoma patients (median followup 10.6 years) were included. The analysis revealed a clustering of variables around 2 main hubs: Breslow thickness < 1 mm and & GE; 4 mm. Factors connected with high melanoma thickness were: older age, positive sentinel lymph node biopsy findings, presence of ulceration, nodular melanoma type, and light skin phototype. Both disease-free and melanoma-related overall survival were in this cluster and connected with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy and Breslow & GE; 4 mm. Patients with Breslow between 1 and 3.9 mm were also in this cluster and linked with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, nodular melanoma and safety distance > 10 mm. This semantic analysis confirmed the close link between Breslow thickness, age, sentinel lymph node biopsy findings, skin type, melanoma subtype and prognosis, and provides prognostic information useful for the further stratification and management of patients with melanoma.

M3  - Article
AB  - The growth and densification of cities have an impact on the local environment. In this context, the evolution of vegetation coverage (NDVI) and built-up area (NDBI) in the city of Mar del Plata (Argentina) was analyzed using Sentinel 2 satellite images processed through the online platform of Google Earth Engine. The results show a decreasing trend in NDVI and an increasing trend in NDBI, with a high correlation between both variables. Although the temporal analysis is limited because the satellite images used are only available since late 2018, these results show how the impact of urbanization affects the local vegetation, constituting, in this way, a valuable tool for the management of the urban environment.

TI  - Twitting Against the Enemy: Populist Radical Right Parties Discourse Against the (Political) "Other"
T2  - POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a common agreement in considering populism as a Manichean worldview that oversimplifies and polarizes political options reducing them to a symbolical struggle between an "us" and a "them." "Us" is embodied by "the people," equated with "good," and "them" is identified by political "Others," often embodied by "the elites" who are depicted as inherently "evil." Naturally, the nature and composition of the people and the elite vary according to both ideology and political opportunities. This article examines the discursive construction of political opponents in two populist radical right parties: Lega in Italy and Vox in Spain. Based on the analysis of a selection of tweets by the two party leaders, Santiago Abascal and Matteo Salvini, this study applies clause-based semantic text analysis to detect the main discursive representations of political opponents. The article concludes that Salvini focuses all the attention on the left, while Abascal, although predominantly identifying the left as the main enemy, also targets pro-independence parties. The discursive construction of the "enemy" is based on two main strategies: demonization, the framing of opponents as "enemies of the people" who, along with dangerous "Others" such as immigrants, conspire against the "people" and are blamed for everything that is "wrong" in society; secondly, character assassination of individual politicians through personal attacks, which aim to undermine their reputation and deflect attention from the real issues towards their personal traits and actions.

TI  - Data and Code from: Remote Sensing of Riverbank Migration Using Particle Image Velocimetry
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Roughly three billion people worldwide live along large rivers and rely upon them for food, water, transport, and energy. To ensure the safety and sustainability of these riverside communities, it is important that we understand how rivers migrate over time. Satellite missions like NASA Landsat have captured millions of images of migrating rivers worldwide for more than thirty years-more images than can be feasibly mapped manually.These data and codes accompany the manuscript "Remote Sensing of Riverbank Migration using Particle Image Velocimetry" by Austin J. Chadwick, Evan Greenberg, and Vamsi Ganti. In this manuscript, we build on previous work and present a method to automatically map riverbank migration from satellite images using a technique called particle image velocimetry (PIV). We apply PIV to Landsat-image time series for 21 example rivers and show PIV results are efficient, reproducible, and accurate compared with existing automatic techniques. Importantly, unlike existing techniques, the PIV method directly accounts for the inherent uncertainty in migration-rate measurements that arises when identifying riverbanks from satellite imagery. Furthermore, PIV is equally applicable to all kinds of rivers (e.g., meandering, braided), opening up new opportunities to investigate the diversity of rivers and their responses to climate change and human activities in our rapidly changing world.

In these codes, images for a given year were combined into median annual composites, and these composites were analyzed to produce binary images (masks) representing the river channel. For a given image, there are sixteen binary images representing distinct but defensible realizations of the river channel network, which were used to quantify uncertainty in riverbank position and propagate this uncertainty into river mobility. See the associated manuscript for details and references.River mobility data were collected using a method based on particle image velocimetry (PIV), developed in the main manuscript.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper aims to find out the medieval Japanese spirit that emerged from the 1930s to Defeat of War, through Choi In-hoon’s Typhoon and how the colonial Joseon youth who accepted it cooperated in war, problems in trans-identity, and influences in recognizing others. Choi In-hoon created a Typhoon based on his colonial experience, and in it, the identity conflict and anguish of colonial youth deeply infiltrated the medieval Japanese spirit are well revealed. Otomenak feels inferior to his country, draws a heroic worldview due to his refracted desire for recognition, and chooses trans- identity as a Napaj person. Even after he realized that the gap between the ideals and reality of Napaj was quite wide, his way of thinking of recognizing the world and others surrounding him is mostly through the frame created by Napaj. Even though Karnos encouraged Otomenak to change his name to live as an Aisenodin and he carried out a second trans-identity through activities to help the independence of the weak countries and the unification of Arroke, it was found that the medieval Japanese spirit still influenced his unconsciousness. Considering the above points, it is judged that more active research should be conducted on the point of connection between the Middle Ages and the modern era in Japan and the situation in which Japanese medieval ideas were extended to colonial Joseon.

TI  - Planning and management of the Community Councils of the Patia region of southwestern Colombia
T2  - APUNTES-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reveals the planning and management processes of the community councils of the Pada region in the department of Cauca, located in the south-west of Colombia. The research is placed under a hermeneutic historical epistemological approach, documentary analysis techniques and group interviews are implemented with the purpose of understanding situations or achievements of community management from the stories, experiences, and experiences of community councils. To facilitate the complementarity of the data, three investigative techniques are triangulated, the observation recorded in the field diaries, the interviews, and the documentary research techniques. The results relate to the Colombian State as guideline guide to strengthen cultural identity, collective territory, economic and social development that guarantee rights and equal opportunities through ethno-development plans; while the community councils under their worldview appropriate the life plan for sustainability, identify themselves as guarantors of the protection and defense of the territory, through their community organization they preserve their own agroecological practices, which contribute to maintaining and rescuing related ancestral knowledge to the sustainable development goals.

TI  - A Multi-Scale Feasibility Study into Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Monitoring Using Same-Day Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, many mines emit acid mine drainage (AMD) during and after their operational life cycle. AMD can affect large and often inaccessible areas. This leads to expensive monitoring via conventional ground-based sampling. Recent advances in remote sensing which are both non-intrusive and less time-consuming hold the potential to unlock a new paradigm of automated AMD analysis. Herein, we test the feasibility of remote sensing as a standalone tool to map AMD at various spatial resolutions and altitudes in water-impacted mining environments. This was achieved through the same-day collection of satellite-based simulated Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS2.SD) imagery and drone-based UAV Nano-Hyperspec (UAV) imagery, in tandem with ground-based visible and short-wave infrared analysis. The study site was a historic tin and copper mine in Cornwall, UK. The ground-based data collection took place on the 30 July 2020. Ferric (Fe(III) iron) band ratio (665/560 nm wavelength) was used as an AMD proxy to map AMD pixel distribution. The relationship between remote-sensed Fe(III) iron reflectance values and ground-based Fe(III) iron reflectance values deteriorated as sensor spatial resolution decreased from high-resolution UAV imagery (<50 mm(2) per pixel; r(2) = 0.78) to medium-resolution PlanetScope Dove-R (3 m(2) per pixel; r(2) = 0.51) and low-resolution simulated Sentinel-2 (10 m(2) per pixel; r(2) = 0.23). A fractioned water pixel (FWP) analysis was used to identify mixed pixels between land and the nearby waterbody, which lowered spectral reflectance. Increases in total mixed pixels were observed as the spatial resolution of sensors decreased (UAV: 2.4%, PS: 3.7%, S2: 8.5%). This study demonstrates that remote sensing is a non-intrusive AMD surveying tool with varying degrees of effectiveness relative to sensor spatial resolution. This was achieved by identifying and successfully mapping a cross-sensor Fe(III) iron band ratio whilst recognizing water bodies as reflectance inhibitors for passive sensors.

TI  - Global Observing System Experiments within the Meteo-France 4D-Var Data Assimilation System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing system experiments were undertaken within the 4D-Var data assimilation of the Meteo-France global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. A 6-month period was chosen (October 2019-March 2020) where 40 million observations per day were assimilated. The importance of in situ observations provided by aircraft, radiosondes, and surface weather stations, despite their small fractional amount (7%), has been confirmed particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, the largest impact over Europe in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores comes from surface observations. Satellite data play a dominant role over tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. Microwave radiances have a more pronounced impact on the long range and on the humidity field than infrared radiances, despite being less numerous (10% versus 80%). Bending angles impact significantly the quality of the upper-troposphere-lower-stratosphere temperature of the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) are beneficial in wind forecasts at low and high levels in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, but also in the humidity field. Such impacts are only significant during the first 48 h of the forecasts. Scatterometer winds have an impact restricted to low levels that is kept at longer ranges. A comparison with forecast sensitivity-observation impact studies over a 3-month period using the same measure of short-range (24-h) forecast errors reveals that the ranking between the major observing systems is kept between these two ways of measuring observation impact in NWP. From our conclusions, recommendations are provided on possible evolutions of the global observing system for NWP.

TI  - REVIEW OF THE APPLICATIONS OF SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING IN ORGANIC FARMING (PART I)
T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Organic farming is a much more sustainable farming system than conventional farming. It is part of humanity's efforts to preserve biodiversity and provides healthy and safe food to humans. Remote sensing methods are widely used in agriculture. Their use will help the transition from conventional to organic farming. They can help farmers choose the most suitable place to build an organic farm. Remote sensing methods are a very powerful tool for weed control in organic farming. They can be used to determine the level of stress that crops experience. They provide a good opportunity to forecast yields on organic farms. Remote sensing methods can optimize fertilization on organic farms. They can be used to distinguish between organic and conventional agriculture, as well as to monitor biodiversity in agricultural areas. Remote sensing methods can help organic farmers make timely and adequate decisions in managing their farms.

TI  - Block Optimization and Outlier Detection in GEO SAR Turbulent Tropospheric Error Compensation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR) has important potential applications in the fields of the atmospheric water cycle and digital weather forecast, and establishing the connection between GEO SAR imaging and atmospheric water vapor inversion is a key step. The turbulent variation of atmospheric phase delay will cause the SAR image to defocus, and turbulent tropospheric delay (TTD) phase estimation based on the block autofocus method in low-orbit high-resolution space-borne SAR can be used for reference, but this method is very sensitive to the data block selection, modulation frequency (FM) outlier detection, and correction. This letter gives some consideration to these two problems of block selection and outlier correction. Based on the idea of an extreme learning machine (ELM), a mathematical model with nonlinearity as the core and a linear model as easy to solve is established. When the parameters affecting the turbulent troposphere are known, the model can be directly used to obtain the block optimization selection, namely, the number and size of blocks. When the parameters are unknown, the model can be used to roughly inverse the parameters and provide initial values for iteration. For the second problem, using the prior information on the correlation of the FM estimated by the adjacent subblocks, we propose a local outlier factor (LOF) method to identify the error point by defining the distance threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by Sentinel-1 data injected with tropospheric error.

TI  - Soil Moisture Mapping Along Climatic Gradient by Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 C-Band Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in agriculture, hydrology, plants' seasonal growth cycle, and their sustainability under climate change. This letter presents a novel method for regional mapping of soil moisture with partial vegetation cover by using dual-polarized Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. Model based retrieval of soil moisture from radar backscatter under partial vegetation cover first necessitates the separation of the backscatter of the underlying soil from total radar backscatter and then the implementation of an inversion technique to estimate its soil moisture content from the backscattering coefficient of the underlying soil. The regional mapping of soil moisture was verified with in situ measurements along a climatic gradient (650- 100 mm/year) in central Israel. A good agreement between the estimated soil moisture and the measured from ground samples was found, with an R-2 of 0.793 with an RMSE of 0.047.

TI  - A qualitative study on traditional healers' perceptions and management of epidermolysis bullosa.
T2  - Health SA = SA Gesondheid
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, incurable genodermatosis causing blisters that can result in multisystemic complications and death. Limited data exists on EB in South Africa. Research indicates that the majority of African patients consult traditional health practitioners (THPs) before seeking allopathic healthcare.Aim: This study aims to understand THPs belief systems, experiences, perceptions and management of EB patients and their families in the social and cultural context to improve the healthcare of EB patients.Setting: The study setting is Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, Durban, and Grey's hospital, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal.Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 THPs. A non-probability, purposive sampling method was used. A two-site qualitative study was guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Guba's trustworthiness framework was used to ensure rigour.Results: Three male and seven female THPs were interviewed, including sangoma, inyanga and umthandazi. The integration presented five global themes: (1) THP practices, (2) perceptions of THP, (3) experiences of THP with patients with EB, (4) diagnosis and management plans of THP and (5) vision and role of THPs. There were multiple divergent perspectives among the THPs with the shared African worldview.Conclusion: Understanding THPs belief systems and therapeutic options is crucial for holistic patient management. Knowledge exchange can promote safe healthcare practices and facilitate collaboration between traditional and allopathic health practitioners.Contribution: This is the first study to explore THPs perceptions and practices regarding EB, a rare disease.

AB  - Farm scale information is critical for large-scale agricultural monitoring and policymaking. Manual digitization of the field map or field boundaries using optical satellite images during each growing season is a challenging task. Deep Learning approaches have been successfully implemented for delineating farm parcel boundaries. However, small-scale parcel delineation in such approaches either requires a huge training dataset and high-resolution satellite imagery or gives malformed edges. To overcome these challenges, we developed a multi-task deep learning-based method that generalizes well to unseen data sets. The potential of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated on temporal high resolution (5.8m) IRS P-6 LISS IV images. The deep learning network takes linear directional features and the temporal standard deviation as input to the model in a multi-task learning framework. The model was allowed to simultaneously learn the tasks such as crop-field extent, boundary and distance. We show that our results compare favourably to existing approaches for boundary delineation.

TI  - Tomographic Reconstruction of Water Vapor Density Fields From the Integration of GNSS Observations and Fengyun-4A Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of precipitable water vapor (PWV) maps retrieved by remote sensing satellites can address the geometry defect of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations in tropospheric tomography. The second-generation geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) of China can provide PWV products with high spatial (4 km) and temporal (15 min) resolutions. This article presents the first study on water vapor tomography by integrating GNSS measurements and FY-4A products using the node-based parameterized method. Layer PWV (LPW) products of FY-4A instead of the total PWV are adopted, which can increase the rank of the tomographic equation significantly. The integrated tomography model is validated with observational data collected over the three-month period of June to August 2020 from 124 GNSS stations in Hunan province, China. Assessments using radiosonde and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5) data demonstrate the better performance of the integrated model against the traditional model using GNSS data alone. In the assessment with radiosonde profiles, the integrated model improves the tomographic solutions upon the traditional model by 40.58% and 36.33% for 30- and 15-min resolutions, respectively. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) of density differences between ERA5 and the integrated model vary from 1.24 to 2.82 g/m(3) throughout the study area. RMSEs vertically decrease from similar to 5 g/m(3) at the bottom to similar to 0.5 g/m(3) at the top layer of about 10 km. This work demonstrates the benefit of high-quality FY-4A products to GNSS tomography because they can effectively mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse process.

AB  - The performance of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4 (FY-4) satellite was evaluated. The results showed that its performance has approached the international advanced level of similar instruments. A wavelet filter was designed to filter the striping noises of the AGRI, which come from the inconsistency of the spectrum and thus varies with the observed target. The non-uniformity of the whole image was evaluated by weighting the probability variance of its count values. After filtering, the infrared image of the AGRI had a uniform visual effect on a single channel, and the pattern noise was reduced to below 0.2 K, which ensures the uniformity of products such as cloud detection and sea temperature that use the infrared splitting window channels. Furthermore, the AGRI carries the surface source blackbody as the on-orbit radiation calibration benchmark, and rotates the north-south scanning mirror to point to the blackbody to obtain the blackbody observation data in each infrared band. In the current mode, the infrared calibration is performed every 15 minutes. The long-term evaluation results showed that the radiation calibration accuracy of the infrared channels of the AGRI was better than 0.5 K, and some of the channels reached 0.2 K. In addition, the long-term monitoring of the sensitivity and radiative cooling of the AGRI has shown the on-orbit variation of the instrument, which provides a reference for the development of the subsequent instrument.

TI  - Generating Daily Gap-Free MODIS Land Surface Temperature Using the Random Forest Model and Similar Pixels Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) is one of the vital variables for surface-atmosphere interaction. However, due to the vulnerability of thermal infrared remote sensing to clouds, the MODIS LST products have many observation gaps, which seriously limits their application. In this paper, to make up for the shortage of random forest model in reconstructing images with substantial cloud-cover pixels, a combined random forest (RF) and similar pixels (SP) reconstruction scheme was proposed to generate daily gap-free MODIS/Terra LST product and validated by the automatic weather stations (AWS) data in the Heihe River Basin. First, we used the RF model to reconstruct the images that meet the threshold (the clear-sky pixels percentage is more than 30%). Then, we used a combination of the RF model and the SP method to reconstruct the images that do not meet the threshold. Thus, the daily MODIS LST reconstruction results were obtained. The visual assessment indicated that the reconstructed LST strongly correlates with the original LST and can capture the spatial distribution features of LST-related characteristic variables. Additionally, the validation with in situ observations demonstrated that the method of directly using the RF model performs well with an $\text{R}<^>{2}$ of 0.87, an NSE of 0.87, an RMSE, and a Bias of 4.69 K and 0.08 K, respectively. The RF model and SP method combination still have a good performance with an $\text{R}<^>{2}$ of 0.79, an NSE of 0.76, and an RMSE and Bias of 6.37 K and 0.62 K, respectively.

TI  - StfMLP: Spatiotemporal Fusion Multilayer Perceptron for Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing (RS) images with high spatial and temporal resolutions play a significant role in monitoring periodic landscape changes for earth observation science. To enrich RS images, spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is considered a promising approach. The key challenge in the current STF-based methods is the requirement for large-scale data. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based method called spatiotemporal fusion multilayer perceptron (StfMLP) to tackle this challenge. First, our method focuses on the given data in the manner of transductive learning. Second, we propose a designed multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to capture the time dependency and consistency among the input images. Consequently, StfMLP is capable of simultaneously achieving more accurate fusion and requiring a small-scale of data. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely adopted public datasets, namely Coleambally irrigation area (CIA) and the lower Gwydir catchment (LGC). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods effectively. Code, trained model, and cropped images are available online (https://github.com/luhailaing-max/StfMLP-master).

TI  - Effect of Axisymmetrical Spectral Response Function on Microwave Radiance Simulation of Quadruple-Sideband Channel
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual spectral response function (SRF) of the quadruple-sideband channel of the microwave sounder is axisymmetrical, and its distortion degree affects the difference in observations between the actual microwave sounder and the ideal design situation. Effects of the actual quadruple-sideband channel's SRF on observations has been evaluated by applying the actual SRF of the quadruple-sideband channel of FengYun-3D (FY-3D) microwave temperature sounder-2 (MWTS-2) and rapid radiative transfer model (RTM) of China Meteorological Administration-Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS). Compared with ideal SRF, actual SRF could improve microwave-radiance simulation, and the observation-minus-background could be decreased by about 0.7 K. The improvements in the mid-high latitudes of the south hemisphere are more evident than in other latitudes. Effects of distortion types of actual SRF on observations have been analyzed by comparing simulated radiance differences between reference SRF and originally proposed SRFs with eight typical distortion types. Inner sideband drifting type and outer sideband drifting type have the greatest influence of about 1 K on microwave radiance. Inner-outer sideband symmetrical difference type has the least impact of approximately 0.02 K. Effects of the axisymmetry of SRF on observations have also been evaluated. Compared microwave radiance simulation by reference SRF with axisymmetrically and nonaxisymmetrically distorted SRFs, respectively, simulation errors induced by axisymmetrically distorted SRFs are less than that by nonaxisymmetrically distorted SRFs of about 0.1-0.4 K.

TI  - Caps-SSENet: An Improved Estimation Method for SAR Ship Size
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the sizes of ship targets plays a critical role in the task of ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Existing deep neural networks (DNNs)-based methods for SAR ship size estimation (SSE) often adopt a fully connected structure that has limited capability in accurately modeling the relationships of features extracted from SAR images, leading to degraded performance of size estimation. It has been demonstrated that capsule networks provide new guidelines to capture relationships of image features by replacing traditional neurons with capsules, where the dynamic routing strategy is used to calculate correlations among capsules. In this letter, we propose an improved method for SAR SSE based on the capsule network named Caps-SSE network (SSENet). In our Caps-SSENet, a capsule-neural-mixing size mapping module is designed to transform the extracted image features into capsules and complete the estimation of ship sizes using informative feature correlations from dynamic routing. In addition, an average scaled mean square error (ASMSE) loss is proposed to improve the size estimation performance of small ships. Experimental results based on measured SAR data show that the proposed method reduces the estimation error of ship sizes in SAR images in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art method.

TI  - Application of FY-4B Geostationary Meteorological Satellite in Grassland Fire Dynamic Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the channel data related to fire point identification of Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager on Fengyun-4B (FY-4B/AGRI) and Advanced Meteorological Imager on GEO-KOMPSAT 2A (GK-2A/AMI) were cross-compared. A total of 267 sampling points in China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hainan) were selected to carry out fine positioning correction on the data in different elevation intervals. Then, a fire monitoring algorithm based on Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) was proposed, in which the self-adaptive threshold adjustment of the underlying surface parameters and the reprocessing module of fire point identification were added. The algorithm can realize the high-precision and stable monitoring of fire. The continuous dynamic monitoring was carried out using the grassland fire Mongolia from April 18 to 20, 2022 as an example. The results showed that the parameters of FY-4B/AGRI and GK2A/AMI channels have high consistency. The root-meansquare error (RMSE) of reflection channel was 1.33%, and the maximum RMSE of brightness temperature channel was less than 1.3 Kelvin (K). Through the positioning analysis in different elevation intervals, the average longitude offset of FY-4B satellite data was -0.5. to 0. and the average latitude offset was -0.9. o 0.6.. Overall, these findings indicate that the high-frequency observations of FY-4B can be fully utilized to monitor forest and grassland fires, which can continuously track the dynamic evolution of fire and can distinguish the spatial distribution of different fire intensities in large-scale fire fields.

TI  - Assessing the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Vegetation Coverage in Urban Built-Up Areas
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main carbon sink in the carbon cycle process, vegetation is an important support for achieving "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality. How does the vegetation coverage of urban built-up areas change in the process of urbanization in China? Taking advantage of Landsat remote sensing data, we extract urban built-up areas, calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), estimate fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and analyze the temporal and spatial dynamics of vegetation coverage in built-up areas of provincial capitals from the national and individual city levels in China. Major conclusions are as follows: (1) The FVC in the urban built-up areas has increased by 7.97%, and the urban green space has gradually changed from the "green core" distribution model to the "green vein" distribution mode. (2) The disparities in FVC of built-up areas of provincial capitals are notable, presumably due to a variety of factors that include the natural geographic environment, economic development level, built-up area expansion, land type conversion, afforestation of greening policy, etc. (3) Not just simply raise or lower, the FVC curves in the built-up areas of provincial capital cities present oscillating patterns with gradually weakening amplitude. Our study is expected to provide scientific references of an important theoretical basis for urban ecological construction and practical support for promoting the harmonious development of urban residents and urban environments in China.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies have essential effects on the distribution of the different sizes of phytoplankton and the status of phytoplankton physiology. The impact of mesoscale eddies on phytoplankton size and physiological level in the northern South China Sea is analyzed based on satellite data and HYCOM-simulated results from 2003 to 2018. The results show that there are higher nanophytoplankton levels for high and low nonlinearity in the center of cyclonic eddies. At the same time, the growth rate of phytoplankton increased, and the assimilation of phytoplankton decreased. Moreover, in the center of anticyclonic eddies, a lower nanophytoplankton level is observed in both high and low nonlinearity. At the same time, the growth rate of phytoplankton decreased, and the assimilation of phytoplankton increased. In addition, there is a higher nanophytoplankton level in the mode-water eddy, while the growth rate of phytoplankton is increased, and the assimilation of phytoplankton is decreased.

TI  - Exploiting Frequency-Domain Information of GNSS Reflectometry for Sea Surface Wind Speed Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) delay-Doppler map (DDM) measures the sea surface roughness, which has recently been applied to retrieve sea surface wind speed. However, current studies on GNSS-R wind speed retrieval only use the spatial domain of the DDM without considering the variation patterns in the map, which is regarded as frequency-domain information of the map. In this study, we propose a joint frequency & ahat;"spatial domain network (FSNet) based on reflectivity data provided by the cyclone global navigation satellite system (CyGNSS) mission. We construct a matchup dataset between the CyGNSS satellite data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. The wind speed range is 0-25 m/s. Using the proposed FSNet, frequency and spatial features are simultaneously extracted. The frequency-domain feature supplements the spatial-domain information of the mid- and high-level features in the neural network. Rather than directly concatenating the frequency-domain features with the spatial-domain features, we designed a feature fusion module (FFM) to fuse frequency and spatial features for wind speed retrieval adaptively. Experiments show that our FSNet wind speed retrieval has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.63 m/s for a wind range of 0-25 m/s. This accuracy is 25.4% better than the operational algorithm provided by the CyGNSS Level 2 wind speed product. For a higher wind range of 16-25 m/s, FSNet performed even better, improving the RMSE by 31%.

TI  - Lithium-Bearing Pegmatite Identification, Based on Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Dahongliutan Area, NW China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium (Li) resources are widely used in many strategic emerging fields; recently, several large-scale to super-large-scale pegmatite-type lithium deposits have been discovered in Dahongliutan, NW China. However, the natural environmental conditions in the Dahongliutan area are extremely harsh; hence, manpower in field exploration is difficult to achieve. Efficient and rapid methods for identifying Li-rich pegmatites, based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology, have great potential for promoting the discovery of lithium resources. Ground spectral research is the cornerstone of regional hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for geological mapping. Direct observation and analysis by the naked eye are part of a process that is mainly dependent upon abundant experience and knowledge from experts. Machine learning (ML) technology has the advantages of automatic feature extraction and relationship characterization. Therefore, identifying the spectral features of Li-rich pegmatite via ML can accurately and efficiently distinguish the spectral characteristics of Li-rich pegmatites and Li-poor pegmatites, enabling further excavation to identify the strongest predictors of Li-pegmatite and laying a foundation for the accurate extraction of Li-rich pegmatites in the West Kunlun region using HSI. The spectral characteristics of pegmatite in the visible near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectra were observed and analyzed. Li-rich pegmatite was identified based on the diagnostic spectral waveform characteristic parameters of the local wavelength range. The results demonstrated that the pegmatite ML recognition model was based on spectral characteristic parameters of the local wavelength range, with good model explicability, and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for the model is 0.843. A recognition model based on full-range spectrum data achieved a higher precision, and the AUC value was up to 0.977. The evaluation of the Gini coefficient presented the strongest predictors, which were used to map the spatial distribution lithology, based on GF-5, in Akesayi and the 509 mines, producing encouraging lithological mapping results (Kappa > 0.9, OA > 94%).

TI  - Spatial Data Augmentation: Improving the Generalization of Neural Networks for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) methods have achieved impressive performance for pansharpening in recent years. However, because of poor generalization, most DL methods achieve unsatisfactory performance for data acquired by sensors not considered during the training phase and decreased performance for samples at full resolution (FR). To solve this issue, we propose a data augmentation framework for pansharpening neural networks (PNNs). Specifically, we introduce first a random spatial degradation based on anisotropic Gaussian-shaped modulation transfer functions (MTFs) to increase the generalization with respect to different spatial models and sensors. Then, considering that various sensors have different ground sampling distances (GSDs), we randomly rescale the GSD of the training samples to improve the generalization with respect to spatial resolution. Thanks to this module, the generalization to tests from different sensors and samples at FR can easily be achieved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with better performance when data for training are decoupled with the ones for testing and comparable performance when training and testing are coupled (i.e., data acquired by the same sensor are considered in the two phases). Besides, performance at FR for PNNs is improved by the proposed approach. The proposed approach has been integrated into existing PNNs showing satisfactory performance for widely used sensors, including, GaoFen-1 (GF1), QuickBird (QB), WorldView-2 (WV2), WorldView-3 (WV3), IKONOS (IK), Spot-7, GeoEye, and PHR1A.

TI  - Accessing the Time-Series Two-Dimensional Displacements around a Reservoir Using Multi-Orbit SAR Datasets: A Case Study of Xiluodu Hydropower Station
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of large-scale hydropower stations could solve the problem of China's power and energy shortages. However, the construction of hydropower stations requires reservoir water storage. Artificially raising the water level by several tens of meters or even hundreds of meters will undoubtedly change the hydrogeological conditions of an area, which will lead to surface deformation near the reservoir. In this paper, we first used SBAS-InSAR technology to monitor the surface deformation near the Xiluodu reservoir area for various data and analyzed the surface deformation of the Xiluodu reservoir area from 2014 to 2019. By using the 12 ALOS2 ascending data, the 100 Sentinel-1 ascending data, and the 97 Sentinel-1 descending data, the horizontal and vertical deformations of the Xiluodu reservoir area were obtained. We found that the Xiluodu reservoir area is mainly deformed along the vertical shore, with a maximum deformation rate of 250 mm/a, accompanied by vertical deformation, and the maximum deformation rate is 60 mm/a. Furthermore, by analyzing the relationship between the horizontal deformation sequence, the vertical deformation sequence, and the impoundment, we found the following: (1) Since the commencement of Xiluodu water storage, the vertical shore direction displacement has continued to increase, indicating that the deformation caused by the water storage is not due to the elastic displacement caused by the load, but by irreversible shaping displacement. According to its development trend, we speculate that the vertical shore direction displacement will continue to increase until it eventually stabilizes; (2) Vertical displacement increases rapidly in the initial stage of water storage; after two water-storage cycles, absolute settlement begins to slow down in the vertical direction, but its deformation still changes with the change in the storage period.

TI  - Urban Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From High Spatial Resolution Thermal Infrared Image Using a Modified Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban canopy multiple scattering thermal radiative transfer (UCM-RT) model, incorporating the effects of urban geometry and adjacent thermal radiation from neighboring pixels, depicts the process of thermal radiation transfer on the urban surface and therefore provided new opportunity to develop new retrieval algorithms for urban land surface temperature (ULST). This article aims at developing an urban split-window (USW) algorithm for deriving ULST from high spatial resolution thermal infrared (TIR) data from the visible and infrared multispectral sensor (VIMS) onboard Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite. The VIMS provides four-channel TIR image with a spatial resolution of 40 m. The coefficients of the USW algorithm were obtained based on several subranges of atmospheric column water vapors (cwv), emissivity, and sky view factors (SVFs) under various land surface conditions, by removing the geometry, adjacent, and atmospheric effects. Methods of estimating urban pixel emissivity and cwv in urban areas were also conducted. The sensitive analysis of instrument noise and uncertainty of cwv, pixel emissivity, and SVFs demonstrated the reliability of the USW algorithm in ULST retrieval. The accuracy evaluation shows that the root-mean-square errors of the ULST results are less than 0.7 K in theory. Compared with the conventional SW algorithms and publicly released LST products, the USW algorithm obtained better results in estimating ULST, especially in high-density building areas. Finally, the USW algorithm is expected to be beneficial to the application of multiple TIR sensor (TIRS) data, for example, the newly launched GF-5 No. 2 satellite images.

TI  - Vegetation Change and Eco-Environmental Quality Evaluation in the Loess Plateau of China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation change and ecological quality of the Loess Plateau (LP) are directly related to ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. Based on LP ecological zoning and multisource remote sensing data, we analyzed vegetation change and its relationship with climate, terrestrial water storage (TWS), and land use/cover change from 2000 to 2020, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), and net primary productivity (NPP). And ecological environmental quality was evaluated based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The results showed that the spatial distribution pattern of NDVI, FVC and NPP decreased from southeast to northwest in the LP as a whole. Vegetation in the LP recovered significantly, and NDVI, FVC, and NPP showed significant increases of 35.66%, 34%, and 54.69%, respectively. The average NDVI and FVC in the earth-rocky mountainous region and river valley plain region (Area D) were the highest, but the growth rate was the slowest. The average NDVI, FVC, and growth rates in the loess hilly and gully regions (Area B) were slightly higher than those in the loess sorghum gully region (Area A). The average NDVI, FVC, and NPP in the sandy land and agricultural irrigation regions (Area C) were the lowest but showed significant increase. RSEI in most LP areas changed from poor to medium, increasing by 43.45%. Precipitation is the basic factor affecting vegetation cover pattern, with the increase (40.79 mm/10a) promoting vegetation restoration in the LP. Vegetation restoration lost much TWS (-0.6 mm/month), and Area D had the highest average NDVI, FVC, and NPP but the largest TWS loss. Anthropogenic land use/cover change (LUCC) (decrease in cultivated land and unused land; increase in forest, grassland, and construction land) is the primary factor affecting LP vegetation change. This study provides a scientific reference for further vegetation restoration in the LP.

TI  - Forest Mapping Using a VGG16-UNet++& Stacking Model Based on Google Earth Engine in the Urban Area
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, detailed urban forest mapping contributes to ecological status monitoring and formulating sustainable development policies in cities worldwide. However, accurate urban forest identification in southern Chinese cities is challenging when samples are insufficient because of high fragmentation and the influence of mountain shadows and cloudy weather. Therefore, this study combined the advantages of transfer, deep, and ensemble learning to propose a VGG16-UNet++&Stacking algorithm for urban forest mapping in heavily urbanized areas based on the Sentinel dataset. Initially, the algorithm mined deep features of an image by pre-training the convolutional layer. Then, the deep feature set was fed into ensemble learning for classification to improve accuracy and robustness. The classification results showed that the VGG16-UNet++&Stacking had an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.87% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.9481. Furthermore, the user accuracy (UA) of the forest was 97.94%. The OA of the method in this study was improved by 2.2% and 3.83% compared with that of UNet++ and random forest (RF), respectively. Compared to that of UNet++, the results showed a modest improvement in OA for the VGG16-UNet++&Stacking method; VGG16-UNet++&Stacking is more effective in eliminating cloud influence, a feature that UNet++ lacks.

TI  - Improve the Accuracy in Numerical Modeling of Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Hangzhou Bay by Assimilating Remote Sensing Data Utilizing Combined Techniques of Adjoint Data Assimilation and the Penalty Function Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment dynamics play an important role in controlling nearshore and estuarine geomorphology and the associated ecological environments. Modeling the transport of suspended sediment is a complicated and challenging research topic. The goal of this study is to improve the accuracy of modeling the suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) with newly developed techniques. Based on a three-dimensional suspended cohesive sediment transport model, the transport of suspended sediment and SSCs are simulated by assimilating SSCs retrieved from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) with the adjoint data assimilation in the Hangzhou Bay, a typical strong tidal estuary along the coast of the East China Sea. To improve the effect of the data assimilation, the penalty function method, in which the reasonable constraints of the estimated model parameters are added to the cost function as penalty terms, will be introduced for the first time into the adjoint data assimilation in the SSCs modeling. In twin experiments, the prescribed spatially varying settling velocity is estimated by assimilating the synthetic SSC observations, and the results show that the penalty function method can further improve the effect of data assimilation and parameter estimation, regardless of synthetic SSC observations being contaminated by random artificial errors. In practical experiments, the spatially varying settling velocity is firstly estimated by assimilating the actual GOCI-retrieved SSCs. The results demonstrate that the simulated results can be improved by the adjoint data assimilation, and the penalty function method can additionally reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) between the independent check observations and the corresponding simulated SSCs from 1.44 x 10(-1) kg/m(3) to 1.30 x 10(-1) kg/m(3). To pursue greater simulation accuracy, the spatially varying settling velocity, resuspension rate, critical shear stress and initial conditions are simultaneously estimated by assimilating the actual GOCI-retrieved SSCs to simulate the SSCs in the Hangzhou Bay. When the adjoint data assimilation and the penalty function method are simultaneously used, the MAE between the independent check observations and the corresponding simulated SSCs is just 9.90 x 10(-2) kg/m(3), which is substantially less than that when only the settling velocity is estimated. The MAE is also considerably less than that when the four model parameters are estimated to be without using the penalty function method. This study indicates that the adjoint data assimilation can effectively improve the SSC simulation accuracy, and the penalty function method can limit the variation range of the estimated model parameters to further improve the effect of data assimilation and parameter estimation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has become the most effective tool for monitoring and evaluating forest resources. Owing to the development of big data, current research on forest resource information mainly focuses on a regional, national, or global scale. However, there are still certain limitations on small regional scales. We used supervised classification based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform to extract county land use information and a Whittaker smoother to extract vegetation indices to monitor forest area and vegetation indices in the study areas from the 1980s to the 2020s. The results show that the classification accuracy is improved for the study area where the image quality is affected by clouds after adding complementary datasets of greenness and water bodies. The overall accuracy (OA) increases from 0.82 to 0.89, and the kappa accuracy increases from 0.77 to 0.85. The OA of the classification results was 0.88, and the forest area increased and decreased with an overall increase of 225.35 km(2). The building area continued to increase with an increase of 34.88 km(2). The cropland area first decreased and then increased with a complete decrease of 243.6 km(2). The bare soil area decreased by 16.2 km(2). The area of the water bodies was relatively stable. The vegetation index indicated good forest growth. Jiangle County's forest area and forest growth stability cannot be achieved without the protection of national and local policies.

AB  - Sea ice mapping on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is important for various purposes, including ship navigation and usage in environmental and climatological studies. Although a series of deep learning-based models have been proposed for automatic sea ice classification on SAR scenes, most of them are flat N-way classifiers that do not consider the uneven visual separability of different sea ice types. To further improve classification accuracy with limited training samples, a hierarchical deep learningbased pipeline is proposed for sea ice mapping from SAR. First, a semantic segmentation model with encoder-decoder structure is implemented to accurately separate ice and open water on each SAR scene. To classify different ice types, a two-level category hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model is then trained using limited numbers of labeled image patches. Experimental results on dual-polarized SAR scenes collected from C-band satellite RADARSAT-2 show that ice-water mapping results are in very good accordance with pixel-based labels under different combinations of encoders and decoders. Also, compared to a flat N-way CNN, the hierarchical CNNs further boosts the classification accuracy among all the ice types.

TI  - Uncertainty-Incorporated Ice and Open Water Detection on Dual-Polarized SAR Sea Ice Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algorithms designed for ice-water classification of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sea ice imagery produce only binary (ice and water) output typically using manually labeled samples for assessment. This is limiting because only a small subset of labeled samples are used, which, given the nonstationary nature of the ice and water classes, will likely not reflect the full scene. To address this, we implement a binary ice-water classification in a more informative manner considering the uncertainty associated with each pixel in the scene. To accomplish this, we have implemented a Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) with variational inference to produce both aleatoric (data-based) and epistemic (model-based) uncertainty. This valuable information provides feedback as to regions that have pixels more likely to be misclassified and provides improved scene interpretation. Testing was performed on a set of 21 RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization SAR scenes covering a region in the Beaufort Sea captured regularly from April to December. The model is validated by demonstrating: 1) a positive correlation between misclassification rate and model uncertainty and 2) a higher uncertainty during the melt and freeze-up transition periods, which are more challenging to classify. By incorporating the iterative region growing with semantics (IRGS) segmentation algorithm and an uncertainty value-based thresholding algorithm, the Bayesian CNN classification outputs are improved significantly via both numerical analysis and visual inspection.

TI  - FTDN: Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion With Diverse Temporal Difference Spans
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral (MS)-hyperspectral (HS) image fusion, which aims to enhance the spatial resolution of low-spatial-resolution HS images with a high-spatial-resolution MS, has provided a wide range of applications in remote sensing. However, relatively long revisit cycles of HS satellites and irresistible weather factors cause the acquisition of HS and MS images at the same time difficult. Most of the existing approaches neglect the temporal difference between MS and HS images and perform weakness in the challenging case with diverse temporal difference spans. In this article, we propose a novel image fusion strategy with embedding a stage of feature matching before interaction. On the one hand, we explore the role of spectral correlation modeling between HS and MS images, which accounts for the utilization of available spatial information from MS images. On the other hand, we design a feature aggregation module to fully exploit the nonlinear gaps and dependencies of heterogeneous data and utilize adaptive gains to realize complementary information projection and fusion. We build Dongying (DY) and Yellow River Estuary (YRE) remote-sensing datasets based on Sentinel-2 and ZiYuan (ZY)-1 02D satellites with diverse temporal difference spans. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is robust to the span of temporal difference and shows superior performance over the existing methods visually and quantitatively.

TI  - A Novel Spectral Indices-Driven Spectral-Spatial-Context Attention Network for Automatic Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a fundamental step for optical satellite image applications. Existing deep learning methods can provide more accurate cloud detection results. However, the performance of these methods relies on a large number of label samples, whose collection is time-consuming and high-cost. In addition, cloud detection is challenging in high-brightness scenes due to cloud and high-brightness objects having a similar spectral features. In this study, we propose a cloud index driven spectral-spatial-context attention network (SSCA-net) for cloud detection, which relies on no effort to manually collect label samples and can improve the accuracy of cloud detection in high-brightness scenes. The label samples are automatically generated from the cloud index by using dual-threshold, which is then expanded to improve the completeness of cloud mask labels. We designed SSCA-net with the spectral-spatial-context aware module and spectral-spatial-context information aggregation module, aimed to improve the accuracy of cloud detection in high-brightness scenes. The results show that the proposed SSCA-net achieved good performance with an average overall accuracy of 97.69% and an average kappa coefficient of 92.71% on the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 datasets. This article provides fresh insight into how advanced deep attention networks and cloud indexes can be integrated to obtain high accuracy of cloud detection on high-brightness scenes.

TI  - Built-Up Area Extraction Combing Densely Connected Dual-Attention Network and Multiscale Context
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas are the main areas for human production and life. The wide availability of high-resolution satellite images provides new opportunities for fine-scale detection and mapping of built-up areas. However, great challenges remain because built-up areas are large-scale composite geographical objects, which contain diverse object classes and complex scenes, and have extremely large feature heterogeneity across space. For the automatic recognition of built-up areas in high spatial resolution satellite images, a block-level built-up area extraction framework combing densely connected dual-attention network and multiscale context is proposed. The proposed method first divides an image into multiscale blocks with a certain proportion of overlap through multisize grids and their multistep offsets. It then uses the constructed lightweight network integrating dense connection and dual attention to realize the feature representation and discrimination of image blocks. Finally, it achieves the refined detection of built-up areas by integrating the prediction results under different divisions through pixel-level multilabel voting. GaoFen-2 satellite images covering Shenzhen city, China, are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the five selected test areas, the F1 score of the proposed method ranges from 0.8720 to 0.8983. Results visually preserve the integrity of internal morphology and have a well-defined boundary. The proposed method shows better performance than the state-of-the-art built-up area extraction methods. It can potentially be applied for fine mapping of large-scale urban built-up areas from high-resolution satellite images.

TI  - Deformable Scattering Feature Correlation Network for Aircraft Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft detection is a valuable but challenging task in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). Because of the complicated electromagnetic imaging mechanism of SAR, the SAR image of aircraft appears as a distributed collection of discrete scattering points that varies significantly with imaging conditions, like different incident angles, bringing great challenges to existing convolution neural network (CNN)-based detection methods for accurate aircraft detection. To address these challenges, we analyze and leverage the scattering characteristics of multiscale SAR aircraft to propose a novel SAR aircraft detector named deformable scattering feature correlation network (DSFCN). First, to deal with the discreteness of SAR aircraft, we propose a new Transformer-based backbone named scalable Swin Transformer backbone (SSTB) to replace a conventional CNN-based one, to effectively extract hierarchical scattering features from multiscale aircraft. Second, to cope with the varying image appearance of SAR aircraft, we design a deformable region correlation module (DRCM) to flexibly correlate strong scattering regions (SSRs) that carry aircraft salient features. Various interpretable experiments conducted on a real-measured Gaofen-3 SAR aircraft dataset demonstrate the superiority and reliability of our DSFCN over other representative CNN-based methods.

TI  - Burned Area Estimation Using a New Accuracy Verification Method Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the accuracy of burned area (BA) estimations is crucial in wildfire monitoring and loss assessment based on remote sensing technology. In this letter, a novel approach to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of BA estimations, called the vector distance algorithm (VDA), was proposed based on boundary sampling and $t$ tests. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the BA, and a field survey and a GaoFen-6 (GF-6) image were then utilized to evaluate the accuracy based on the VDA. The results were as follows: 1) the proposed algorithm could provide not only the percent accuracy of the evaluation but also the confidence interval of the BA; 2) the accuracy validation of the BA extracted by the normalized burn ratio (NBR) index and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was verified by the VDA; 3) based on the field survey, the VDA confirmed that the NBR index had high accuracy, while the NDVI index had a large error, which is consistent with the results of using ground truth observations as a reference; and 4) the analysis based on the GF-6 image showed similar results. This study indicated that the VDA is effective and has the potential for widespread use in evaluating the accuracy of a BA.

TI  - An Improved Doppler Centroid Estimator Meeting the Cramer-Rao Bound for Ocean SAR Application
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Doppler information in complement to the intensity of radar backscatter has been verified useful for ocean synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications. An accurate estimate of the ocean surface motions requires an accurate estimate of the Doppler centroid. When we process the real SAR data, we find that different methods yield different mean values of the estimates. After a careful analysis, we find that it is caused by the underestimation of the centroids for conventional methods. The estimate bias depends on the Doppler centroid itself. To overcome this problem, we carefully study the conventional methods and the Cramer-Rao bound of the estimation. Based on the maximum-likelihood principle, a novel method is proposed. By adaptively adjusting the center and the bandwidth of the weighting function after a coarse estimation of the spectrum, the symmetry of the spectrum is maintained. The estimate bias of conventional methods is eliminated. It is a fully optimal method meeting the Cramer-Rao bound no matter whether the true Doppler centroid is high or low. Both the simulated and the real SAR data validate our novel method. In the simulation, an estimate error of tens of Hz could be avoided when the true Doppler center is hundreds of hertz. In real SAR estimation, an accuracy of 3-6 Hz can be improved. The result of the estimation is consistent with the simulation and theoretical analysis, validating the efficiency of our improved method.

TI  - The Influence of Different Climate and Terrain Factors on Vegetation Dynamics in the Lancang River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in soil and water conservation, regulating the atmosphere and maintaining ecosystem stability, as well as influencing regional hydrology and water-sand processes. In this study, spatial patterns in the response of climate and terrain factors to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its dynamic characteristics were examined in the Lancang River Basin, by using a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) according to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data. The results showed that the NDVI in the study area showed a significant increasing trend in time, with 6.39% of the NDVI degraded and 90.85% of the NDVI increased in space. In the Pearson correlation analysis, precipitation was mainly negatively correlated with the NDVI, while temperature was mainly positively correlated with the NDVI, especially in Qinghai and Tibet. Among the soil types, iron-alluvium, incipient soils, and leached soils are particularly suitable for vegetation growth. In conclusion, the effects of climate and topographic factors on the NDVI are roughly the same in the Yunnan section, but opposite in the Qinghai section and Tibet section.

TI  - Environmental Performance of Regional Protected Area Network: Typological Diversity and Fragmentation of Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are among the main tools for preserving biodiversity and creating an environment for the natural course of ecological processes. The identification of forest biodiversity is especially important for large metropolitan areas. An obvious problem in assessing the efficiency of the PAs network is the lack of up-to-date cartographic materials representing the typological diversity of vegetation. The aim of the paper is to identify forest biodiversity and fragmentation in the example of the Moscow region (MR)-the largest metropolis in Eastern Europe. The typological classification was carried out at a detailed hierarchical level-33 association groups (ass. gr.) considering the diversity of the land cover. A random forest algorithm was used for cartographic mapping (overall accuracy 0.59). Remote sensing (RS) data included Sentinel-2A, DEM SRTM, and PALSAR radar images. Six fragmentation metrics were calculated based on the raster map of forest typological diversity. A significant correlation between the forest diversity and PAs forest patch fragmentation metrics was noted. It has been established that the PAs proportion of the territory accounts for almost 20% only within the northernmost district and noticeably decreases to the south to 1-2%. At the same time, fragmentation noticeably increases from Northeast to Southwest. The category of PAs does not affect the state of the forest cover. Additionally, there was no direct influence of the anthropogenic factor from both local sources and a large regional source, i.e., the city of Moscow. It is shown that the average area of PAs, supporting 75% of the typological diversity of regional communities, was about 1000 ha. The results of the study suggest that there is a general lack of environmental protection measures in the region. It is recommended to increase the area of PAs, primarily for less fragmented forest patches, including indigenous forest-steppe and forest types of communities.

TI  - SENTINEL: Self Protecting 5G Core Control Plane from DDoS Attacks for High Availability Service

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)
CL  - Bangalore, INDIA
AB  - Current advancements in the 5G network slicing admit a huge number of users avail a variety of services from the 5G Core network (5GC). While this is impressive, it opens the doors to security threats that could harm the smooth functioning of the 5GC as well as the legitimate users availing its services. This paper presents SENTINEL - a novel self protecting 5GC in the control plane by leveraging the Self Organizing Network (SON) paradigm. SENTINEL is fabricated as an autonomous framework, which protects itself in the control plane operations of 5GC from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack attempts by malicious users. Precisely, we build it as an Artificial Intelligence-based Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) framework along with eXpress Data Path (XDP) and extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) based slice aggregator to aid in protecting the slice when the malicious users attempt a DDoS attack. While the attack is aimed at the 5GC control plane, the SENTINEL isolates the suspected malicious users with a sensitivity of '85.59%' from the 5GC. Thereby, it keeps the High Availability (HA) service for legitimate users intact, without incurring additional resources.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal and supergene alteration zones associated with carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb deposits by using PRISMA satellite imagery supported by field-based hyperspectral data, mineralogical and geochemical analysis
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating hydrothermal alteration and supergene caps is fundamental for mineral exploration of sulfide ores. The aim of this study is to apply a multi-scale workflow based on hyperspectral remote and proximal sensing data in order to delineate hydrothermal dolomitization and supergene alteration associated with the Mississippi Valley-Type Zn-Pb(-Ag) deposit of Jabali (Western Yemen). The area was investigated through hyperspectral images derived from the new launched Italian Space Agency's PRISMA satellite, which has a higher spectral resolution compared to multispectral sensors and covers the mineral-diagnostic wavelength regions (such as the 2100 nm to 2300 nm range) with a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) >= 100. Spectral mineral maps were produced through the band ratios method using specific feature extraction indices applied to the hyperspectral satellite data. The results were validated by using Visible Near InfraRed (VNIR) to Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) reflectance spectra, mineralogical (XRPD) and geochemical (ICP-ES/MS) analyses on rock samples collected in the Jabali area. The dolomites footprint was mapped using a PRISMA Level 2C image, by enhancing the spectral differences between limestones and dolomites in the SWIR-2 region (major features centered at 2340 nm and 2320 nm, respectively). Gossans were detected due to the Fe3+ absorption band in the VNIR region at 900 nm. The Zn-Pb mineralized area, extended for approximately 25 km2, was thus identified by recognizing gossan occurrences in dolomites. The study demonstrates that the PRISMA satellite is effective in identifying Zn-Pb mineralized outcrops in sedimentary basins.

TI  - Burned Area Mapping Using Unitemporal PlanetScope Imagery With a Deep Learning Based Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk and damage of wildfires have been increasing due to various reasons including climate change, and the Republic of Korea is no exception to this situation. Burned area mapping is crucial not only to prevent further damage but also to manage burned areas. Burned area mapping using satellite data, however, has been limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data and classification accuracy. This article presents a new burned area mapping method, by which damaged areas can be mapped using semantic segmentation. For this research, PlanetScope imagery that has high-resolution images with very short revisit time was used, and the proposed method is based on U-Net which requires a unitemporal PlanetScope image. The network was trained using 17 satellite images for 12 forest fires and corresponding label images that were obtained semiautomatically by setting threshold values. Band combination tests were conducted to produce an optimal burned area mapping model. The results demonstrated that the optimal and most stable band combination is red, green, blue, and near infrared of PlanetScope. To improve classification accuracy, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, dissimilarity extracted from Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix, and Land Cover Maps were used as additional datasets. In addition, topographic normalization was conducted to improve model performance and classification accuracy by reducing shadow effects. The F1 scores and overall accuracies of the final image segmentation models are ranged from 0.883 to 0.939, and from 0.990 to 0.997, respectively. These results highlight the potential of detecting burned areas using the deep learning based approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine regimen in infants aged 4-11 months in Guinea and Sierra Leone.METHODS: In this phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy infants (1:1 in a sentinel cohort, 5:2 for the remaining infants via an interactive web response system) to receive Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo (Ebola vaccine group) or two doses of meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (control group) administered 56 days apart. Infants were recruited at two sites in west Africa: Conakry, Guinea, and Kambia, Sierra Leone. All infants received the meningococcal vaccine 8 months after being randomly assigned. The primary objective was safety. The secondary objective was immunogenicity, measured as EBOV glycoprotein-binding antibody concentration 21 days post-dose 2, using the Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group ELISA. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03929757) and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201905827924069).FINDINGS: From Aug 20 to Nov 29, 2019, 142 infants were screened and 108 were randomly assigned (Ebola vaccine n=75; control n=33). The most common solicited local adverse event was injection-site pain (Ebola vaccine 15 [20%] of 75; control four [12%] of 33). The most common solicited systemic adverse events with the Ebola vaccine were irritability (26 [35%] of 75), decreased appetite (18 [24%] of 75), pyrexia (16 [21%] of 75), and decreased activity (15 [20%] of 75). In the control group, ten (30%) of 33 had irritability, seven (21%) of 33 had decreased appetite, three (9%) of 33 had pyrexia, and five (15%) of 33 had decreased activity. The frequency of unsolicited adverse events was 83% (62 of 75 infants) in the Ebola vaccine group and 85% (28 of 33 infants) in the control group. No serious adverse events were vaccine-related. In the Ebola vaccine group, EBOV glycoprotein-binding antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 21 days post-dose 2 were 27700 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 20477-37470) in infants aged 4-8 months and 20481 EU/mL (15325-27372) in infants aged 9-11 months. The responder rate was 100% (74 of 74 responded). In the control group, GMCs for both age groups were less than the lower limit of quantification and the responder rate was 3% (one of 33 responded).INTERPRETATION: Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo was well tolerated and induced strong humoral responses in infants younger than 1 year. There were no safety concerns related to vaccination.FUNDING: Janssen Vaccines & Prevention and Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking.TRANSLATION: For the French translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

AB  - This work presents a novel domain adaption paradigm for studying contrastive self-supervised representation learning and knowledge transfer using remote sensing satellite data. Major state-of-the-art remote sensing visual domain efforts primarily focus on fully supervised learning approaches that rely entirely on human annotations. On the other hand, human annotations in remote sensing satellite imagery are always subject to limited quantity due to high costs and domain expertise, making transfer learning a viable alternative. The proposed approach investigates the knowledge transfer of self-supervised representations across the distinct source and target data distributions in depth in the remote sensing data domain. In this arrangement, self-supervised contrastive learning-based pretraining is performed on the source dataset, and downstream tasks are performed on the target datasets in a round-robin fashion. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, UC Merced Landuse (UCMD), SIRI-WHU, and MLRSNet, for different downstream classification tasks versus label efficiency. In self-supervised knowledge transfer, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with label efficiency labels and outperforms a fully supervised setting. A more in-depth qualitative examination reveals consistent evidence for explainable representation learning. The source code and trained models are published on GitHub(1).

TI  - Influencing factors associated with lymph node status in patients with cutaneous melanoma: An Asian population study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is the predominant prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with clinically localized melanoma. The significance of completion lymph node dissection in patients with SLN metastasis is debatable. Not many studies have been conducted on acrallentiginous melanoma (ALM). This study aimed to characterize the prognostic factors of nodal positive ALM and confirm whether ALM patients can undergo the same treatment strategy as non-ALM patients in the Asian population. Methods:This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent surgery for cutaneous melanoma (CM) at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 1993 and December 2019. We investigated the risk factors for lymph node status. The association between clinicopathological factors and lymph node status of ALM and non-ALM patients was analyzed. Outcomes of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) performed following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the CM and ALM groups were compared. Results:A total of 197 patients were included in this study. ALM was the most common histological subtype, accounting for 66.5% of all the cases. Patients in the CM and ALM subgroups with metastatic SLN (p = 0.012) or lymph nodes (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001) exhibited higher mortality rate. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with clinical presentation of T4 category tumor (p = 0.012) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.012) had a significantly higher risk of positive lymph nodes. The overall survival of patients with lymph nodes metastasis was not associated with the performance of CLND. Conclusion:Patients in the CM or ALM subgroups with metastatic SLNs or lymph nodes exhibited significantly poorer overall survival. Advanced Breslow thickness and lymphovascular invasion were independent predictive factors for CM and ALM patients with positive lymph node status. There was no significant difference in survival between CM and ALM patients following SLNB, regardless of CLND being performed.

TI  - Classification of Tree Composition in the Forest Using Images from SENTINEL-2: A Case Study of Geomunoreum Forests Using NDVI Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change may alter tree species' distribution, which could impact on forest biodiversity. However, frequent and continuous surveys of forests need intense labor and are time-consuming. The current study utilized SENTINEL-2 images of Geomunoreum to solve this problem as a case study. Acquired images were converted into various indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which could be an efficient method to examine the diversity in forests over time. In the current study, the images were obtained in March and April from 2017 to 2021. As a result of analysis using NDVI images of the study area taken from the satellite, vegetation groups were classified into evergreen trees and deciduous trees. This implies that NDVI using extracted data from SENTINEL-2 images could be used for surveying large-scale examinations for tree classification in order to observe variations caused by climate change in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

AB  - In recent years precise and up-to-date information regarding seabed depth has become more and more important for companies and institutions that operate on coastlines. While direct, in-situ measurements are performed regularly, they are expensive, time-consuming and impractical to be performed in short time intervals. At the same time, an ever-increasing amount of satellite imaging data becomes available. With these images, it became possible to develop bathymetry estimation algorithms that can predict seabed depth and utilize them systematically. Since there are a number of theoretical approaches, physical models, and empirical techniques to use satellite observations in order to estimate depth in the coastal zone, the presented article compares the performance and precision of the most common one to modern machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the models based on shallow neural networks, decision trees and Random Forest algorithms have been proposed, investigated and confronted with the performance of pure analytical models. The particular proposed machine learning models differ also in a set of satellite data bands used as an input as well as in applying or not geographical weighting in the learning process. The obtained results point towards the best performance of the regression tree algorithm that incorporated as inputs information about data localization, raw reflectance data from four satellite data bands and a quotient of logarithms of B2 and B3 bands. The study for the paper was performed in relatively optically difficult and spatially variant conditions of the south Baltic coastline starting at Szczecin, Poland on the west (53°26'17'' N, 14°32'32'' E) to Hel peninsula (54°43'04,3774'' N 18°37'56,9175'' E). The reference bathymetry data was acquired from Polish Marine Administration. It was obtained through profile probing with single-beam sonar or direct in-situ probing.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a philosophical worldview, specifically metaphysical. This is important precisely to obtain a generalist view of reality, at a time when philosophical discussions are becoming increasingly specialized. The metaphysical worldview presented here is a general perspective on time, space, matter, laws of nature, the mind and the normativity. In order to achieve such goal, (1) we will talk about the nature of philosophy and its relation to the construction of a worldview, (2) we will discuss some arguments to talk about the nature of the aforementioned entities, and (3) we will conclude by presenting a unified metaphysical worldview that takes these arguments into account.

TI  - Fast Full-Resolution Target-Adaptive CNN-Based Pansharpening Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few years, there has been a renewed interest in data fusion techniques, and, in particular, in pansharpening due to a paradigm shift from model-based to data-driven approaches, supported by the recent advances in deep learning. Although a plethora of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for pansharpening have been devised, some fundamental issues still wait for answers. Among these, cross-scale and cross-datasets generalization capabilities are probably the most urgent ones since most of the current networks are trained at a different scale (reduced-resolution), and, in general, they are well-fitted on some datasets but fail on others. A recent attempt to address both these issues leverages on a target-adaptive inference scheme operating with a suitable full-resolution loss. On the downside, such an approach pays an additional computational overhead due to the adaptation phase. In this work, we propose a variant of this method with an effective target-adaptation scheme that allows for the reduction in inference time by a factor of ten, on average, without accuracy loss. A wide set of experiments carried out on three different datasets, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3, prove the computational gain obtained while keeping top accuracy scores compared to state-of-the-art methods, both model-based and deep-learning ones. The generality of the proposed solution has also been validated, applying the new adaptation framework to different CNN models.

T2  - STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS BABES-BOLYAI PHILOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-oriented ontology [OOO], alternatively known as flat ontology or as a branch of speculative realism, has recently been developed and presented as a non-anthropocentric attempt to construct an ontology, a metaphysics, or both. In this paper, I will look at the texts of Graham Harman, probably the most vocal of all the theorists working within the framework of OOO, in order to show that the many flaws of this approach end up legitimizing a neoliberal capitalist worldview and reinforcing its contradictions. Also, one of my goals is to answer a current misunderstanding of object-oriented ontology as posthumanism; OOO is not a posthumanism because it rejects any political discourse and criticism. On the contrary, as we will see, OOO explicitly opposes the new posthumanist materialisms.

TI  - "The man who wasn't there"-and was "out there": Chigurh as cinematic figure
T2  - REVUE LISA-LISA E-JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Notwithstanding Joel Coen's tongue-in-cheek comment that his film is "about a good guy, a bad guy, and a guy in between", the main characters of No Country for Old Men have evinced much perplexity. In particular, Chigurh, who has been deemed one of the most chilling villains in cinema history, defies any univocal archetypal definition that would readily apply to such character type. The present article focuses on the character of Chigurh in the Coens' film. After examining the diversity of interpretations that have sought to account for his character, it contends that Chigurh's enigmatic ambivalence is part and parcel of his characterisation. More specifically, it throws light on the character's ambivalence as a cinematic entity, that is, not so much as a direct personification of moral and philosophical issues as the embodiment of filmic figures and devices that are displayed to convey the film's worldview. En depit du commentaire ironique de Joel Coen pour qui le film parle & DLANGBRAC; d'un bon gars, d'un mechant et d'un gars entre les deux & drangbrac;, les personnages principaux de No Country for Old Men ont suscite de nombreuses interrogations. Chigurh en particulier, que l'on a qualifie d'un des mechants les plus effrayants de l'histoire du cinema, elude toute definition archetypale univoque pourtant associee a ce type de personnages. Le present article se concentre sur le personnage de Chigurh dans le film des Coen. Il examine dans un premier temps la diversite des interpretations qui ont cherche a rendre compte du personnage, puis developpe la these selon laquelle l'enigmatique ambivalence de Chigurh fait partie integrante de sa caracterisation. Plus precisement, il met en lumiere l'ambivalence du personnage en tant qu'entite cinematographique, c'est-a-dire non pas tant comme une personnification directe de questions morales et philosophiques que comme l'incarnation de figures et de dispositifs cinematographiques qui sont mis en exergue pour traduire la vision du monde transmise par le film.

TI  - FPGA Accelerator for Meta-Recognition Anomaly Detection: Case of Burned Area Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing instruments accumulate abundant data from across all of the earth's land surfaces, making it possible both to understand the effects of climate change and to monitor, investigate, and manage ground-level events in detail. Processing data using resources located near on-board satellite sensors can bring major benefits in terms of minimizing analysis time and quickly initiating active actions in critical situations. In satellite missions, long-term production on-board algorithms may encounter unexplored samples, i.e., abnormal ground-level events, and need to be able to discriminate and take the correct action. In this matter, the authors present a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based solution for natural anomaly detection in multispectral imagery using deep convolutional neural networks. The effects of weather-induced hazards and natural disasters, considered anomalies in this sense, are discovered by modeling an anomaly detector on a hybrid system that is hardware efficient. The proposed approach is assembled on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ XCZU9EG multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) device, where a deep convolutional model is scaled into the FPGA logic, followed by a downstream statistical meta-recognition predictor. The proposed anomaly detection accelerator has produced notable results in identifying a contemporary natural hazard, i.e., burned areas, in scenes acquired by Sentinel-2 over Europe, i.e., Spain and France. The implemented algorithm achieved on the FPGA accelerator an equivalent speedup of 4.46x and 4.5x lower power consumption than the equivalent implementation on the Tesla K80 GPU.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (EWSHM)
CL  - Univ Palermo, Dept Engn, Palermo, ITALY
AB  - The use of space-born data for monitoring single structures or infrastructures and detecting structural anomalies is recently becoming more widespread. The increasing application of satellite data in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is due to the significant advantages that they should bring compared to the traditional monitoring techniques. In fact, satellite data can allow us to obtain information quickly not only on the structure of interest but even on the surrounding area. Satellite data can provide different kind of information based on their nature: interferometric satellite data can detect displacements with high accuracy; while other satellite data are able to provide geophysical information on the soil state (i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, etc.). However, the interferometric data are generally applied separately from the other types of satellite data that are less used, so there is no combination at the moment in the SHM field. In this paper, an integrated use of different space-born data is proposed to understand if their cross-comparison can provide a more comprehensive overview of the structural behavior of a structure or infrastructure. As a benchmark, satellite data are applied to an ancient aqueduct, which is used to verify the proposed methods.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Forest Species: Case Study for Alto Alentejo, Portugal
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape evaluation and monitoring enable us to understand the interactions between its components and the effects of disturbances (whether they are natural or artificial) in its dynamics. Forests have a wide variability and diversity, and their analysis at the landscape level allows us to evaluate its spatial distribution pattern. This study focused on the analysis of the landscape spatial variability of forest species with data derived from remote sensing and landscape metrics of a case study in Alto Alentejo, Portugal. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to produce a land use and land cover map with a random forest classification algorithm, where the bands, vegetation and texture indices were the explanatory variables. The obtained land use/cover map has classified five forest classes and one non-forest class. The map was used to evaluate the diversity with eleven composition and configuration landscape diversity metrics for Alto Alentejo and for four sub-regions delimited according to their edaphic-climatic characteristics. The results showed that the land use/cover map had a good precision (a global precision of 89% and a kappa of 86%) and that both Alto Alentejo and its sub-regions had high forest diversity both in composition and configuration.

TI  - Ratzinger Before the Conflict Between Science and Faith
T2  - SCIENTIA ET FIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work deals with Ratzinger's contribution to the debate on the relationship between science and faith. We do not analyze it from the usual schemes that classify this relationship in models such as "conflict", "non overlapping magisterial", "integration", etc. Ratzinger's position fits better in a scheme that classifies the different attitudes adopted before the thesis of the conflict. We propose a classification of these attitudes. We show how Ratzinger recognizes the existence of a real conflict in the relationship between science and faith. We expose the epistemic roots that, according to Ratzinger, give rise to said conflict and we call "harmonization" his attitude towards it. The task of harmonization proposed by Ratzinger is possible to maintain only from faith. But it is a faith understood differently from the way it appears in the relationship models mentioned above. They are usually presented as alternative models. Ratzinger's proposal serves to give unity to these models. He does not approach the conflict from the illustrated budgets but revealing the keys that determine its nature. They are discovered in a historical process of which our author draws a global picture. In Ratzinger, the conflict is better understood as an insurmountable tension that invites us to undertake a continuous task of purification. The subject of this purification are the images with which faith has been expressed throughout history and the worldviews in which said faith has been embraced, those that have lent it the images.

TI  - Multiscale Spatiotemporal NDVI Mapping of Salt Marshes Using Sentinel-2, Dove, and UAV Imagery in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel, France

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference of European Spatial Data for Coastal and Marine Remote Sensing (EUCOMARE)
CL  - Saint Malo, FRANCE
AB  - Salt marshes offer a plethora of ecosystem services such as biodiversity support, ocean-climate change regulation, ornithology recreo tourism or plant gath-ering by hand. They undergo significant worldwide losses due to their conversion into crop fields and to their spatial compression between rising sea levels and armored shorelines. Their management requires multiscale spatiotemporal analysis to detect interrelated patterns and processes. This research innovatively studies continuous salt marsh mapping, based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) ranges, across three spatial and two temporal scales. Sentinel-2 (10 m), Dove (3 m), and unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) (0.03 m) imagery were used to progressively refine spatial resolutions over dynamic areas (extending from hun-dreds, tens, and a couple of km(2), respectively). NDVI ranges from Sentinel-2 and Dove imagery were monitored with a lag of 5 and 4 years, respectively. Contrary to spaceborne imagery, UAV imagery lacked a near-infrared (NIR) band. The UAV NIR band was thus modelled (R-NIR(2) = 0.98) using a three-layered neutral network (NN) prediction based on red, green, and blue reflectance imagery, itself calibrated/validated/tested by Dove imagery bands (R-red(2) = 0.88, R-green(2) = 0.84, and R-blue(2) = 0.90). The 100-fold increase in pixel size allowed to detect the decimeter-scale objects of salt marshes and tidal flats. The multiscale NDVI ranges were associated with microphytobenthos and topographically low, medium, and high salt marsh vegetation, including the opportunistic Elymus genus. The combination of the NDVI values derived from the Sentinel-2, Dove, and UAV imagery enabled to survey a region while detecting subtle features of salt marshes, providing an updated toolbox for managers.

M3  - Article
AB  - Immanuel Wallerstein was a writer of Big Books, in every sense of the term. Books that are big in size, big in topic, big in worldview-changing importance. Big over the author's lifetime, too, multiple volumes taking long years to produce. It is our pantheon of world history: Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; Toynbee's A Study of History, each around two million words. Marx' Das Kapital, about 1.2 million words. Weber's Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, a mere 600,000 words. Mann's The Sources of Social Power, 965,000 words. And Immanuel Wallerstein's The Modern World-System, 585,000 words in 1,300 pages, not counting 300 pages of references. The last five names still define our intellectual universe. Mann expands Weber's causal trio of class, status, and power into four dimensions. Wallerstein expands Marx into the capitalist world-system. A crucial stimulus was Braudel's The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, two-volumes at 600,000 words which came out in 1949 and revolutionized social history: treating whole geographical regions rather than states; the history of structures and everyday practices

TI  - An Algorithm to Detect Endangered Cultural Heritage by Agricultural Expansion in Drylands at a Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents AgriExp, a remote-based workflow for the rapid mapping and monitoring of archaeological and cultural heritage locations endangered by new agricultural expansion and encroachment. Our approach is powered by the cloud-computing data cataloguing and processing capabilities of Google Earth Engine and it uses all the available scenes from the Sentinel-2 image collection to map index-based multi-aggregate yearly vegetation changes. A user-defined index threshold maps the first per-pixel occurrence of an abrupt vegetation change and returns an updated and classified multi-temporal image aggregate in almost-real-time. The algorithm requires an input vector table such as data gazetteers or heritage inventories, and it performs buffer zonal statistics for each site to return a series of spatial indicators of potential site disturbance. It also returns time series charts for the evaluation and validation of the local to regional vegetation trends and the seasonal phenology. Additionally, we used multi-temporal MODIS, Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planet imagery for further photo-interpretation of critically endangered sites. AgriExp was first tested in the arid region of the Cholistan Desert in eastern Pakistan. Here, hundreds of archaeological mound surfaces are threatened by the accelerated transformation of barren lands into new irrigated agricultural lands. We have provided the algorithm code with the article to ensure that AgriExp can be exported and implemented with little computational cost by academics and heritage practitioners alike to monitor critically endangered archaeological and cultural landscapes elsewhere.

TI  - Changes in habitat suitability for wintering dabbling ducks during dry conditions in the Central Valley of California
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and Mediterranean regions, landscape-scale wetland conservation requires understanding how wildlife responds to dynamic freshwater availability and conservation actions to enhance wetland habitat. Taking advantage of Landsat satellite data and structured and community science bird survey data, we built species distribution models to describe how three duck species, the Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca), and Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), respond to freshwater supply and food resources on different flooded land cover types in the Central Valley of California. Specifically, our models compared duck habitat suitability between the wettest and driest conditions in each month from September through April. Using abundance-weighted boosted regression trees, we created three sets of species occurrence models based on different covariates: (1) near real-time (hereafter "real-time ") covariates in which duck observations were matched to the water availability within the 16-day window of a Landsat observation, (2) a combination of real-time covariates and waterfowl food resource covariates describing annual corn and rice biomass and managed wetland moist soil seed yield estimates derived from Landsat data, and (3) long-term average covariates-the most common approach to species distribution modeling-in which long-term average surface water availability was used. We modeled the monthly occurrence of three duck species as a function of surface water availability, land cover type, road density, temperature, and bird data source. We found that dry conditions result in reduced habitat suitability, with the biggest reductions in November through January and in agricultural fields; in contrast, suitability of flooded wetland habitat was relatively robust to surface water availability. When models of habitat suitability based on long-term average climate conditions were compared to models based on real-time conditions, the highest long-term suitability values occurred in areas where suitability was high regardless of whether it was a wet or a dry year. While all models performed well, the inclusion of crop and wetland plant yield covariates resulted in slightly higher model performance. Overall, species distribution models created using data on the environmental conditions present at the time of bird observations can aid conservation efforts under extreme conditions over large spatial scales.

AB  - The Copernicus era in Europe has resulted in an increase in the processing of satellite data, making the space sector an attractive target for cyber-attacks. RF attacks can potentially disrupt the management and distribution of satellite data and pose a significant risk to public safety and national security. The 7SHIELD project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for the protection of ground segments of space systems, which includes innovative services such as e-fences, passive radars, and laser technologies. Among the key modules developed within the project, the Cyber-Attack Detection Framework (CADF) has been developed to provide real-time correlation and detailed alerts in case anomalies are detected, providing support to the modules in charge of mitigation strategy. The CADF has been successfully tested against RF jamming attacks along with the rest of the 7SHIELD framework within an actual Critical Infrastructure, the Satellite Ground Station in Penteli, Athens, Greece.

AB  - Biomonitoring is a valuable tool for assessing the presence and effects of air pollutants such as heavy metals (HM); due to their toxicity and stability, these compounds can affect human health and the balance of ecosystems. To assess its potential as a sentinel organism of HM pollution, the wild plant Gnaphalium lavandulifolium was exposed to four sites in the metropolitan area of Mexico Valley (MAMV): Altzomoni (ALT) Coyoacan (COY), Ecatepec (ECA), and Tlalnepantla (TLA) during 2, 4, and 8 weeks, between October and November 2019. Control plants remained under controlled conditions. The chemical analysis determined twelve HM (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) in the leaves. Macroscopic damage to the leaves, later determined in semi-thin sections under light microscopy, lead to a finer analysis. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed major structural changes: chromatin condensation, protoplast shrinkage, cytoplasm vacuolization, cell wall thinning, decreased number and size of starch grains, and plastoglobules in chloroplasts. All these characteristics of stress-induced programed cell death (sPCD) were related to the significant increase of toxic HM in the leaves of the exposed plants compared to the control (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed a significant amount of proteases with caspase 3-like activity in ECA and TLA samples during long exposure times. Ultrastructural changes and sPCD features detected confirmed the usefulness of G. lavandulifolium as a good biomonitor of HM contamination. They supported the possibility of considering subcellular changes as markers of abiotic stress conditions in plants.

Abstract: Purpose: The literature contains differentiating information regarding the prognosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. We aimed to address the inconsistency by comparatively examining the clinical features and prognosis of invasive lobular carcinoma patients in our university and to report our experience by dividing our patients into various subgroups. Patients and methods: Records of patients with breast cancer admitted to Trakya University School of Medicine Department of Oncology between July 1999 and December 2021 were reviewed. The patients were divided into three groups (No-Special Type Breast Cancer, Invasive Lobular Special Type BC, No-Lobular Special BC). Patient characteristics, treatment methods and oncological results are presented. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance of survival among the selected variables was compared by using the log-rank test. Results: The patients in our study consisted of 2142 female and 15 male breast cancer patients. There were 1814 patients with Non-Special Type Breast Carcinoma, 193 patients with Lobular Special Type Breast Carcinoma, and 150 patients with Non-Lobular Special Type Breast Carcinoma. The duration of disease free survival (DFS) was 226.5 months for the No-Special Type group, 216.7 months for the No-Lobular Special Type group, and 197.2 months for the Lobular Special Type group, whereas the duration of overall survival (OS) was 233.2 months for the Non-Special Type group, 227.9 for the No-Lobular Special Type group, and 209.8 for the Lobular Special Type group. The duration of both DFS and OS was the lowest in the Lobular Special Type group. Multivariate factors that were significant risk factors for OS were Lobular Special Type histopathology (p=.045), T stage, N stage, stage, skin infiltration, positive surgical margins, high histological grade and mitotic index. Modified radical mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and use of Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors for more than 5 years were significant protective factors for overall survival. Conclusion: The histopathological subgroup with the worst prognosis in our study was Lobular Special Type. Duration of DFS and OS were significantly shorter in Lobular Special Type than No-Lobular Special Type group. Whether Lobular Special Type should be classified as a Special Type Breast Tumor should be reconsidered, and a more accurate treatment and follow-up process may be required. Keywords: No-Special Type Breast Cancer, Special Type Breast Cancer, Invasive Lobular Cancer, Non-Lobular Special Type Breast Cancer, Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer Introduction Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is the most common special histological type of breast cancer (BC). While ILC accounts for 5% of invasive carcinomas, its incidence has increased up to 10-14% with the developments in diagnostic methods and novel discoveries. However, ILC remains less common in Asian populations (2-6%)1-6. As the incidence of ILC is significantly less than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the most common histopathological subtype of breast cancer, its clinical and prognostic features and biological behavior become clearer as more studies are published7-15. ILC is within the Special Type BC group, along with tubular, mucinous, papillary, micropapillary, medullary, metaplastic, and apocrine histopathological subtypes, whereas IDC is among the No-Special Type BC group composed of highly heterogeneous subtypes10. ILC stands out among the other histopathological subtypes in the Special Type BC group with its distinct clinical course, prognosis and biological features. While the survival rate of ILC was better than or similar to that of IDC in series with less than 6 years of follow-up, the prognosis of ILC was found to be worse than IDC in series with longer follow-up. However, the St Gallen International Expert Consensus guidelines and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend that ILC should be treated with the same treatment paradigms as IDC, despite their many different features. Therefore, systemic treatment decisions for ILC and IDC are often similar (10). Highlighting ILC as the subgroup with better prognosis in the series published in the past years may have prevented the treatment decision from being more aggressive, resulting in worse survival than IDC in the long term6-9, 11-14. Treating the Special ILC similarly to the No-Special IDC may cause the clinicians to overlook important details regarding this patient group13. However, larger tumor diameter, more lymph node metastases, high hormone receptor positivity, loss of E-cadherin and the potential of atypical metastasis are among the currently known distinct features of ILC3, 4. Unlike IDC, ILC shows different growth patterns and biological features, rather than masses that can easily be diagnosed with palpation or mammography. Additionally, an increased rate of multiple metastases, low rates of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and frequent positive surgical margins are among the features that make ILC more remarkable14,15. Different information in the literature regarding prognosis has led us to comparatively examine the clinical features and prognosis of ILC patients in our series. We aimed to determine our own patient characteristics and report our treatment experience of ILC by dividing our patient series into various subgroups. Material and methods Patient characteristics Patients with breast cancer who applied to Trakya University School of Medicine Departments of Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology between July 1999 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Trakya University Medical Faculty Hospital (TUTF-BAEK 2022/170) for the use of patient information in the study. The consent form was submitted to the local ethics committee (Trakya University Faculty of Medicine Dean's Non-Invasive Scientific Research Ethics Committee, Edirne, Turkey). Informed consent forms were prepared in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In the study, permission was obtained from the patients, and if the patient died, from the legal guardians of the patients, by signing a written consent form, to use the information in the registry files containing the patient information. Medical records and pathological reports were retrospectively converted into SPSS data to evaluate the clinicopathological features. After excluding 190 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ from a total of 2347 breast cancer patients, the remaining 2157 patients with invasive carcinoma were included in the study. The patients in our series consisted of 2142 female and 15 male breast cancer patients. No-Special Type BC (Completely invasive ductal carcinoma, IDC) and Special Type BC were divided as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), mixed type (IDC+ILC), epidermoid carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, apocrine carcinoma, and metaplastic carcinoma. Later, the patients were divided into three groups: Non-Special Type BC (IDC) (n=1814), Lobular Special Type (ILC, ILC+IDC mixed type) (n=193), and Non-Lobular Special Type BC (n=150). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) analyzes of the patient groups were performed. Patient characteristics were tabulated as ratios and numbers, and comparisons were made between groups. Finally, univariate and multivariate analyzes of factors affecting DFS and OS were performed. Clinicopathological Features Pathological and clinical staging in our series was performed according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual16. IDC, Non-Lobular Special Type, ILC, and histopathological diagnoses were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining by pathologists specializing in breast cancer at Trakya University School of Medicine Department of Pathology. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Hormone receptor positivity was defined as an ER score greater than or equal to 3 on the Allred Score (17). HER2 positive was defined as a Herceptest score of 3+ or a Herceptest score of 2+ followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) positive18. Luminal type was defined as ER positive and HER2 negative. Histological grading was done using the Nottingham histological grading system. Pathological staging for extensive intraductal carcinoma (EIC), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI) was done according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual17. Statistical Analysis Numerical results are expressed as the mean  standard deviation, and categorical results are shown as n (%). Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate the survival curves. Log-rank test was used to compare the statistical significance of survival among the selected variables. Hazard ratios were estimated using univariate Cox regression analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with backward elimination method was used to estimate hazard ratios and identify independent prognostic factors.

M3  - Article
AB  - To identify, starting with an aesthetic and philosophical analysis, the presence of elements coming from shamanism in the artworks of Alex Grey. To evidence, through a descriptive methodology, the relation of reciprocity stablished between visionary culture and shamanic traditions. To explain how entheogens, or sacred plants that awaken the consciousness of the inner divinity, are instruments which favours the creative process of artist. To clarify in what measure, extraordinary states of perception, such as dream and ecstasy, lead Grey to consider creative action from the perspective of mystical experience. To elucidate in which form, entheogenic mysticism and artistic activity, when correlated, are capable of propitiating a radical transformation in the structures of society and in the worldview of individuals. To demonstrate, on the basis of a vast theoretical background, the indispensability of including and expanding, in the sphere of higher studies, the discussion of shamanistic religiosity in alignment with visionary art and contemporary philosophy.

TI  - <i>We</i><i> were</i><i> in</i><i> the</i><i> fight</i><i> together:</i> The expectations of bereaved caregivers of patients with acute myeloid leukemia from diagnosis to death
T2  - LEUKEMIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Patients with hematologic malignancies are more optimistic than their oncologists and their expecta-tions may be a barrier to timely hospice care. Patient expectations toward the end of life (EOL), however, have not been characterized. In this study, we analyzed interviews of bereaved caregivers to understand the expec-tations of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and the factors that influenced those expectations, from diagnosis until death.Methods: Bereaved caregivers (n = 19) participated in an in-depth interview that included open-ended and semi-structured prompts, within 18 months following patient death. Interviews were analyzed using a modified grounded theory qualitative approach and constant comparative methods.Results: We identified three themes relevant to expectations: Taking Stock, Being Stuck, and Disruption. Care-givers described clear and optimistic early expectations that AML is treatable. It was understood that treatment was required to survive. Later, when treatment options were limited, patients and caregivers became stuck in a belief that the patient could continue to live indefinitely on supportive care or at least until new more effective treatments were available. Caregivers often realized that the patient was at the end of life only when faced with a disruption, an event or conversation that changed their expectations for indefinite patient survival. Conclusions: Caregivers described continued expectations for patient survival until presented with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. The study suggests patients and caregivers may make better EOL care decisions if their early optimism is deliberately moderated by ongoing conversations with clinicians that highlight the sentinel events that signal treatment failure and explain how expectations and goals are changing from living a longer life to dying a more comfortable death.

TI  - Utopias in International Relations: Brazil, the Global South and the West
T2  - FUTURO DEL PASADO-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE HISTORIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on an in-depth reflection on the role of utopias in political projects that intervene in international relations, this article aims to analyse the change of direction of Brazil's foreign policy in the period 2003-2022. This involves observing the transformation of the country's international action, from a position of defender of the Global South to one of champion of the West. To this end, this proposal will make use of the information offered by primary sources -official documents and speeches of the presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs- and secondary sources -analysis of academic publications-. With this in mind, it will provide an extensive theoretical introduction, through which it will genealogically address utopian thinking in the discipline of International Relations and the field of Foreign Policy Analysis. Subsequently, it will define two discursive strategies that allude to antagonistic projects of international insertion based on opposing utopian imaginaries, and which have guided the Brazilian worldview of international reality in the first two decades of the twentyfirst century: the Brazil of the Global South and the Brazil of the West. By way of conclusion, the paper will offer some final reflections, highlighting the role played by both representations in Brazil's domestic and international projection for the government's term of office that started in 2023. It is understood that both worldviews have their origins in Brazil's tradition of international thought, but also incorporate variables that refer to transnational utopian projects.

TI  - Monitoring river turbidity after a mine tailing dam failure using an empirical model derived from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudden failure of a mine tailing dam occurred in the municipality of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, on January 25, 2019. Approximately 12 million cubic meters of mine tailings discharged into the Paraopeba River, producing strong environmental and societal impacts, mainly due to a massive increase in turbidity (occasionally exceeding 50,000 Nephelometric Turbidity Units [NTU] (CPRM 2019). Remote sensing is a well-established tool for quantifying spatial patterns of turbidity. However, a few empirical models have been developed to map turbidity in rivers impacted by mine tailings. Thus, this study aimed to develop an empirical model capable of producing turbidity estimates based on images from the Sentinel-2 satellite, using the Paraopeba River as the study area. We found that river turbidity was most strongly correlated with the sensor's near-infrared band (NIR) (band 8). Thus, we built an empirical single-band model using an exponential function with an (R2 of 0.91) to characterize the spatial-temporal variation of turbidity based on satellite observations of NIR reflectance. Although the role of discharged tailings in the seasonal variation of turbidity is not well understood, the proposed model enabled the monitoring of turbidity variations in the Paraopeba River associated with seasonal resuspension or deposition of mine tailings. Our study shows the capability of single-band models to quantify seasonal variations in turbidity in rivers impacted by mine tailing pollution.

TI  - Dynamic Maize Yield Predictions Using Machine Learning on Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely yield prediction is crucial for the agri-food supply chain as a whole. However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set.

TI  - Tracking the Extent and Impacts of a Southern Pine Beetle (<i>Dendroctonus frontalis</i>) Outbreak in the Bienville National Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bienville National Forest (BNF) in central Mississippi experienced an outbreak of southern pine beetle (SPB) beginning in 2015 and continuing through 2019. To assess the extent of the outbreak and subsequent treatments of impacted areas, high-resolution imagery was obtained from various sources and interpreted to determine the feasibility of this imagery for detecting SPB spots and tracking their spread and treatments. A negative binomial regression model then described the relationship between spot detection, year, and status (i.e., infestation/treatment) and then incidence rate ratios were calculated. The peak active infestation acreage occurred in 2017 with treatment and mitigation measures peaking in 2018. In total, over 4450 hectares (ha) were treated through 2019 in the BNF. Overall, it is possible to discern small areas of active SPB infestation and treatments. If used as a monitoring method, consistently available high-resolution imagery (e.g., from a satellite) provides an effective means of detecting, evaluating, and tracking infestations and related treatments.

TI  - Dementia, Substance Misuse, and Social Determinants of Health: American Indian and Alaska Native Peoples' Prevention, Service, and Care.
T2  - Chronic stress (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples are disproportionately impacted by substance use disorders (SUDs) and health consequences in contrast to all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. This is alarming that AI/AN peoples experience significant health disparities and disease burden that are exacerbated by settler-colonial traumas expressed through prejudice, stigma, discrimination, and systemic and structural inequities. One such compounding disease for AI/AN peoples that is expected to increase but little is known is Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). AI/AN approaches for understanding and treating disease have long been rooted in culture, context, and worldview. Thus, culturally based prevention, service, and caregiving are critical to optimal outcomes, and investigating cultural beliefs regarding ADRD can provide insights into linkages of chronic stressors, disease, prevention and treatment, and the role of substance misuse.Method: To understand the cultural practices and values that compose AI/AN Elder beliefs and perceptions of ADRD, a grounded theory, qualitative study was conducted. Twelve semistructured interviews with AI/AN Elders (M age=73; female=8, male=4) assessed the etiology, course, treatment, caregiving, and the culturally derived meanings of ADRD, which provides a frame of understanding social determinants of health (SDH; eg, healthcare equity, community context) and impacts (eg, historical trauma, substance misuse) across the lifespan.Results: Qualitative analyses specific to disease etiology, barriers to treatment, and SDH revealed 6 interrelated and nested subthemes elucidating both the resilience and the chronic stressors and barriers faced by AI/AN peoples that directly impact prevention, disease progression, and related services: (1) postcolonial distress; (2) substance misuse; (3) distrust of Western medicine; (4) structural inequities; (5) walking in two worlds; and (6) decolonizing and indigenizing medicine.Conclusion: Barriers to optimal wellbeing and SDH for AI/AN peoples are understood through SUDs, ADRD, and compounding symptoms upheld by colonial traumas and postcolonial distress. En masse historical and contemporary discrimination and stress, particularly within Western medicine, both contextualizes the present and points to the ways in which the strengths, wisdom, and balance inherent in AI/AN culture are imperative to the holistic health and healing of AI/AN peoples, families, and communities.

TI  - QCircularStats: A QGIS-Plugin for Evaluation Bidimensional Data by Circular Statistics
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Circular statistics have been developed and used in a wide range of branches of knowledge related to the study and observation of the Earth, such as physical, geographical, ecological, and biological sciences. Both to facilitate its use by a less specialised community and to extend its analysis within the research community, this work presents the application of circular statistics in QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information Systems, through the design and implementation of a novel and complete plugin, named QCircularStats. This free and open-source plugin provides a comprehensive, understandable, and visual way to conduct circular analysis over remote sensing data. The behaviour of the proposed QCircularStats is evaluated over real satellite data. Particularly, data on wind speed and direction over the oceans collected by the microwave sensor allocated on the QuikSCAT satellite have been considered. Results obtained demonstrate the performance, functionality, and versatility of the implemented plugin.

TI  - Tree Species Classification over Cloudy Mountainous Regions by Spatiotemporal Fusion and Ensemble Classifier
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of tree species is critical for the sustainable development of the forestry industry. However, the lack of cloud-free optical images makes it challenging to map tree species accurately in cloudy mountainous regions. In order to improve tree species identification in this context, a classification method using spatiotemporal fusion and ensemble classifier is proposed. The applicability of three spatiotemporal fusion methods, i.e., the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), and the spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model (STNLFFM), in fusing MODIS and Landsat 8 images was investigated. The fusion results in Helong City show that the STNLFFM algorithm generated the best fused images. The correlation coefficients between the fusion images and actual Landsat images on May 28 and October 19 were 0.9746 and 0.9226, respectively, with an average of 0.9486. Dense Landsat-like time series at 8-day time intervals were generated using this method. This time series imagery and topography-derived features were used as predictor variables. Four machine learning methods, i.e., K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), were selected for tree species classification in Helong City, Jilin Province. An ensemble classifier combining these classifiers was constructed to further improve the accuracy. The ensemble classifier consistently achieved the highest accuracy in almost all classification scenarios, with a maximum overall accuracy improvement of approximately 3.4% compared to the best base classifier. Compared to only using a single temporal image, utilizing dense time series and the ensemble classifier can improve the classification accuracy by about 20%, and the overall accuracy reaches 84.32%. In conclusion, using spatiotemporal fusion and the ensemble classifier can significantly enhance tree species identification in cloudy mountainous areas with poor data availability.

TI  - <i>DDIT3</i> Governs Milk Production Traits by Targeting IL-6 to Induce Apoptosis in Dairy Cattle
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms of modulating milk production traits remain largely unknown. Based on our previous RNA-seq, DDIT3 was presumed as a novel, promising candidate gene for regulating milk protein and fat traits in dairy cattle. To further detect the genetic effect of DDIT3 and its potential molecular mechanisms in regulating milk production traits in dairy cattle, here, we performed a genotype-phenotype association study. Two SNPs, g.-1194 C>T and g.-128 C>T, were significantly associated with MY (p = 0.0063), FY (p = 0.0001) and PY (p = 0.0216), respectively. A luciferase assay demonstrated that the allele T of g.-128 C>T increased the promoter activity by binding the HSF2, while allele C did not. To further reveal the molecular regulatory mechanisms, the DDIT3-knockdown MAC-T cells were established. It was observed that DDIT3 silencing could induce apoptosis and increase the number of PI-positive cells. Meanwhile, DDIT3 silencing led to increased expression of inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, IL6R, IL1B, IL7R, IL1RL2, IL1A, STAT1-5, MYC, IGFBP4, and IGFBP5, and especially for IL-6 (log(2)FC = 4.22; p = 3.49 x 10(-112)). Additionally, compared with the control group, increased lipid accumulation was found in the DDIT3-knockdown MAC-T cells. Thus, our results proved that lower expression of DDIT3 could result in increased lipid accumulation and apoptosis via up-regulating the expression of IL-6. These findings provided clues about the regulatory mechanisms of milk production traits in dairy cattle.

TI  - Interface reactions between TiAl alloys and diacetatozirconic acid-yttria molds differentiated by ammonium metatungstate addition
T2  - RARE METALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two types of diacetatozirconic acid-yttria molds which were labeled as ZYW mold (diacetatozirconic acid-yttria mold with traces of ammonium metatungstate in the slurry) and ZY mold (diacetatozirconic acid-yttria mold without ammonium metatungstate) were prepared by traditional investment casting. The ZYW and ZY molds were sintered in a carbon-reducing atmosphere and in air, respectively, at 1550 degrees C for 4 h. Interactions between Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb (at%) alloys and the molds at 1650 degrees C for 30 min were studied. The microstructures of the metal-mold interfaces and the presence of inclusions and oxygen contamination in the TiAl bulk alloy were analyzed, and the influences of ammonium metatungstate were discussed. The results indicate that WO3 releases O into the TiAl melt, introducing tungsten metal into the alloy matrix. The TiAl alloy ingots cast in the ZY molds had the fewest inclusions and the lowest oxygen contamination.

TI  - HOW TO FIND THE UNDISCOVERED? ANTHROPOGENIC OBJECTS IN FOREST AREAS: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT METHODS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape archaeology (archaeogeography) is a multidisciplinary study used by pre-historical, classic, and historical archaeologists. Archaeogeography deals with the study of how people have shaped and used their environment throughout history. It focuses on the relationship between the material culture of a given community and the changes it introduces in its spatial environment. Traditionally search for archaeological sites is mainly carried out using surface research, i.e., observation of ploughed fields in spring and autumn. However, the percentage ratio of the area covered by forests to the total area of the countries can reach up to even several dozen per cent. This is where archaeogeography aided with modern remote sensing data and processing techniques can be most useful. In this article, the authors describe the problems occurring while searching for anthropological objects in forest areas. In this first part of the two-part series, the authors present a non-invasive method based on widely available remote sensing and historical data that can be used for remote prospection or archaeological sides. The authors also present methods of field verification and critically describe the limitations and advantages of this method.

T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is a great source of arbovirus diversity, mainly in the Amazon region. However, other biomes, especially the Atlantic Forest, may also be a hotspot for emerging viruses, including Bunyaviruses (Negarnaviricota: Bunyavirales). For instance, Vale do Ribeira, located in the Southeastern region, has been widely studied for virus surveillance, where Flavivirus, Alphavirus and Bunyaviruses were isolated during the last decades, including Bruconha virus (BRCV), a member of Orthobunyavirus genus Group C, in 1976. Recently, a new isolate of BRCV named Span321532 was obtained from an adult sentinel mouse placed in Iguape city in 2011, and a full-length genome was generated with nucleotide differences ranging between 1.5%, 5.3% and 5% (L, M and S segments, respectively) from the prototype isolated 35 years earlier. In addition, each segment placed BRCV into different clusters, showing the high variety within Bunyavirales. Although no evidence for reassortants was detected, this finding reiterates the need for new surveillance and genomic studies in the area considering the high mutation rates of arbovirus, and also to identify the hosts capable of supporting the continuous circulation of Orthobunyavirus.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Lymph node microcalcifications are rare events, and when they are accompanied by neoplasia, they usually seem to be associated with a metastatic condition. We present a case of a patient with breast cancer and lymph node microcalcifications undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). A change in the calcification pattern towards becoming coarse was observed. Calcification represented a marker of axillary disease, and it was resected after NCT. This is the first report of a patient with lymph node microcalcification undergoing NCT. We observed a change in the calcification format, which facilitated lymph node sentinel identification. Pathological evaluation indicated metastatic disease.

TI  - Representations of care in Makuxi prayer: history, myth and health
T2  - CULTURA DE LOS CUIDADOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: to analyze the construction of representations of health care in the drawings, stories and prayers inscribed in the Makuxi Tarumu leaflets. Method: This is a historical-anthropological, documentary that used elements of New Cultural History from the perspective of the Historian Roger Chartier and ethnography. The research was carried out at the Indigenous Documentation Center (IDC) in Boa Vista-RR-Brazil. The leaflet entitled Makuxi Tarumu (Makuxi Prayers), volumes I and II, of 1987 was used as the object document. Results: In the Makuxi prayers, written in the Makuxi Tarumu leaflets, the representation of care appears in all prayers in a supernatural form, where the spiritual authority makes an evocation, interfering in the natural world. The prayer and the shaman are the authorities. Conclusion: The prayers preserve remarkable features of the Makuxi culture without religious syncretism, although it was produced by the DioceseRR.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of fire occurrence and recurrence in the Caatinga Biome using MODIS sensor data
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The indiscriminate use of fire, every year has been causing an imbalance in nature, which can be perceived globally. The remote sensing represents the main technological alternative in detecting, dimensioning and understanding the dynamics of fire. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of the burned areas of the Caatinga Biome using the MODIS MCD64A1 product, from 2001 to 2018. For this, the monthly subsets of the Burned Area MCD64A1 product were used for the period of study. The Canadian Forest Service classification was also adopted, which defines the burned areas in five different classes: I (0-0.09 ha); II (0.1-4.0 ha); III (4.1-40.0 ha); IV (40.1-200.0 ha); V (>200.0 ha). The results achieved in this study reveal that the state of Piaui has a statistically higher average of fire occurrences and burned area in the times series. The months that had the largest burned areas in the biome were September, August and October and the greatest recurrences of burned areas from May to December. The burned area size classes that presented the highest occurrences were III, IV e V. The biome undergoes systematic growth of degradation, which enhances its fragility in the face of fire.

TI  - Environmental degradation of vegetation cover and water bodies in the semiarid region of the Brazilian Northeast via cloud geoprocessing techniques applied to orbital data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal diagnosis of climate variability and environmental changes in arid and semiarid regions is essential to minimize pressures and impacts on natural ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques and satellite images allow the detection of such changes. The study evaluated spatio-temporally the processes of environmental degradation of vegetation cover and water resources via physical-hydric parameters at the surface using remote sensing techniques for the Northeast of Brazil (NEB). Geospatial data from TRMM and MODIS satellites/ sensors, digital cloud processing of vegetation indices (NDVI), water (NDWI and MNDWI), and rainfall were performed for the period 2000 to 2019. The patterns identified in the study were evaluated by multivariate statistics and correlation. The NDVI showed the significant vulnerability of vegetation cover in the Northeastern Semiarid region, due to the intensification of droughts. The spectral behavior of NDVI is due to rainfall, confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation. The NDWI and MNDWI detected the pattern of water availability in the semiarid region, with a critical reduction in water bodies. In the space-time analysis, the physical-hydric parameters showed a significant water deficit, followed by severe drought and prolonged drought. MNDWI was efficient and sensitive to open water content, especially in areas covered by water bodies concerning NDWI, and correlated with rainfall. The variability of rainfall directly impacted the dynamics and resilience of vegetation and water bodies in the Northeastern Semiarid region. The critical reduction of areas of water bodies, the increase of non-vegetated areas, and the pressures of anthropic activities are favored.

TI  - Evaluation of the Ability of SLSTR (Sentinel-3B) and MODIS (Terra) Images to Detect Burned Areas Using Spatial-Temporal Attributes and SVM Classification
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are considered one of the major dangers and environmental issues across the world. In the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savannas), forest fires have several consequences, including increased temperature, decreased rainfall, genetic depletion of natural species, and increased risk of respiratory diseases. This study presents a methodology that uses data from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) sensor of the Sentinel-3B satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the Terra satellite to analyze the thematic accuracy of burned area maps and their sensitivity under different spectral resolutions in a large area of 32,000 km(2) in the Cerrado biome from 2019 to 2021. The methodology used training and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. To analyze the spectral peculiarities of each orbital platform, the Transformed Divergence (TD) index separability statistic was used. The results showed that for both sensors, the near-infrared (NIR) band has an essential role in the detection of the burned areas, presenting high separability. Overall, it was possible to observe that the spectral mixing problems, registration date, and the spatial resolution of 500 m were the main factors that led to commission errors ranging between 15% and 72% and omission errors between 51% and 86% for both sensors. This study showed the importance of multispectral sensors for monitoring forest fires. It was found, however, that the spectral resolution and burning date may gradually interfere with the detection process.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of using indocyanine green associated with fluorescence in sentinel lymph node biopsy.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the technique recommended for the axillary staging of patients with breast cancer in the initial stages without clinical axillary involvement. Three techniques are widely used globally to detect sentinel lymph nodes: patent blue, the radiopharmaceutical technetium 99 with gamma probe, and the combination of these two.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sentinel lymph node detection rate with an innovative technique: indocyanine green (ICG) associated with fluorescence in breast cancer patients, and compare it with patent blue and a combination of patent blue and indocyanine green.METHODS: 99 patients were sequentially (not randomly) allocated into 3 arms with 33 patients submitted to sentinel lymph node techniques. One arm underwent patent blue dying, the other indocyanine green, and the third received a combination of both. The detection rates between arms were compared.RESULTS: The detection rate in identifying the sentinel lymph node was 78.8% with patent blue, 93.9% with indocyanine green, and 100% with the combination. Indocyanine green identified two sentinel nodes in 48.5% of patients; the other groups more commonly had only one node identified. The mean time to sentinel lymph node identification was 20.6 ± 10.7 SD (standard deviation) minutes among patients submitted to the patent blue dye, 8.6 ± 6.6 minutes in the indocyanine green arm, and 10 ± 8.9 minutes in the combined group (P<0.001; Student's test). The mean surgery time was 69.4 ± 16.9; 55.1 ± 13.9; and 69.4 ± 19.3 minutes respectively (P<0.001; Student's test).CONCLUSIONS: The sentinel lymph node detection rate by fluorescence using indocyanine green was 93.9%, considered adequate. The rates using patent blue, indocyanine green, and patent blue plus indocyanine green (combined) were significantly different, and the indocyanine green alone is also acceptable, since it has a good performance in sentinel lymph node identification and it can avoid tattooing, with a 100% sentinel lymph node detection rate when combined with patent blue.

TI  - EMOTIVE-EVALUATIVE CAUSATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS IN THE BURYAT LANGUAGE
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes emotive-evaluative causative constructions of guilt and condemnation in the Buryat language. The relevance of the work arises from the modern integrated approach to the study of such functional and semantic categories as causativity, as well as from the increasing interest in the problems of the category of emotivity in linguistics. The relevance stems from the need to study emotions and their representation in language from the perspective of linguistics. The main goal of this work is to determine the emotive-evaluative potential in causative constructions with the meaning of guilt and condemnation in the Buryat language and to try to identify its national and cultural peculiarities. The novelty of the work arises from the fact that this problem has not been practically studied on the material of the Buryat language before. The theoretical and methodological basis of the work was formed by the works of domestic and foreign linguists: V. I. Shakhovsky, A. Vezhbitskaya, I. V. Trufanova, and K. Izard. The feeling of guilt is one of the basic emotions. Condemnation refers to the moral evaluation of certain phenomena of reality, actions, and behaviors of people. In Buryat's causative constructions, one can notice a close connection between the semantics of guilt and condemnation. The material of the study consists of a solid sample of causative constructions contained in the electronic corpus of the Buryat language and data obtained by observing the speech of native speakers. As a result, it is found that causative constructions in the Buryat language have an emotive-evaluative potential. In order to express the feeling of guilt and related condemnation, the so-called constructions of "guilt of the causer" are used, in which the subject himself is guilty of what happened. The constructions of "fault of the causator" are quite specific; they show the peculiarities of the linguistic worldview in understanding causative relations. In the constructions of "guilt of the causer," the speaker often appears himself as the causer, and such constructions most vividly express the feeling of guilt, awareness of one's mistakes, and weakness.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time-Series Data and Machine-Learning Classifiers in Agricultural Sub-Saharan Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper shows the efficiency of machine learning for improving land use/cover classification from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery as a tool that can be used in some sub-Saharan countries that experience frequent clouds. Indeed, we aimed to map the land use and land cover, especially in agricultural areas, using SAR C-band Sentinel-1 (S-1) time-series data over our study area, located in the Kaffrine region of Senegal. We assessed the performance and the processing time of three machine-learning classifiers applied on two inputs. In fact, we applied the random forest (RF), K-D tree K-nearest neighbor (KDtKNN), and maximum likelihood (MLL) classifiers using two separate inputs, namely a set of monthly S-1 time-series data acquired during 2020 and the principal components (PCs) of the time-series dataset. In addition, the RF and KDtKNN classifiers were processed using different tree numbers for RF (10, 15, 50, and 100) and different neighbor numbers for KDtKNN (5, 10, and 15). The retrieved land cover classes included water, shrubs and scrubs, trees, bare soil, built-up areas, and cropland. The RF classification using the S-1 time-series data gave the best performance in terms of accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.84, kappa = 0.73) with 50 trees. However, the processing time was relatively slower compared to KDtKNN, which also gave a good accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.82, kappa = 0.68). Our results were compared to the FROM-GLC, ESRI, and ESA world cover maps and showed significant improvements in some land use and land cover classes.

TI  - A Functional Model for Determining Maximum Detectable Deformation Gradients of InSAR Considering the Topography in Mountainous Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The maximum detectable deformation gradients (MDDG) for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is important for the selection of SAR images and processing algorithms to perform accurate slope displacement monitoring, which is strongly influenced by terrain factors in mountainous areas. In this article, a functional model is proposed to determine the MDDG of InSAR with respect to arbitrary slope gradients/aspects and wavelengths. Based on this model, regional MDDG characteristics are explored and compared in Mao County, Sichuan Province, China. The MDDG distribution regarding Sentinel-1, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and TerraSAR-X SAR satellite data using arbitrary slope gradient/aspect are derived. Furthermore, the MDDG from variable satellites for three different bands (X/C/L-band) are compared and the influence factors with respect to the wavelength and resolution on MDDG are discussed. The proposed model is helpful in selecting SAR data or processing algorithms based on calculated MDDG, in the meanwhile, it has significant implications for understanding and analyzing real slope displacement monitored by InSAR regarding different SAR images in mountainous areas.

TI  - Exploiting Spatial-Temporal Dynamics for Satellite Image Sequence Prediction
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image sequence prediction is a challenging and significant task. The existing deep learning methods for the task make predictions mainly based on low-level pixelwise features, which fail to model the sophisticated spatial-temporal features of satellite image sequences and deliver unsatisfactory performance. In this letter, we present a hierarchical spatial-temporal network (HSTnet) for satellite image sequence prediction. With a carefully designed hierarchical feature extraction mechanism, HSTnet can learn effective spatial-temporal features from both pixel level and patch level. In addition, to better capture patch-level spatial-temporal dynamics, a dual-branch Transformer is proposed to model patch-level spatial and temporal features, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method HSTnet over state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Learning Spatial-Temporal Consistency for Satellite Image Sequence Prediction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an extremely challenging spatial-temporal sequence prediction task, satellite image sequence prediction has various and significant applications in real-world scenarios. Although a lot of deep learning prediction models are developed for spatial-temporal sequence prediction, the methods still deliver unsatisfactory performance in terms of keeping spatial-temporal consistency, which leads to inaccurate and blurry satellite image sequence predictions. To maintain spatial-temporal consistency and achieve high-quality satellite image sequence prediction, we propose a novel and effective spatial-temporal consistency network (STCNet). In STCNet, a multilevel motion memory-based predictor is proposed to accurately predict motion patterns of satellite image sequences to ensure temporal consistency. Then, a time-variant frame discriminator is carefully designed and proposed, which can enhance the perception quality of predicted frames to guarantee spatial consistency and simultaneously maintain the motion coherency of predicted sequences. Moreover, a scheduled sampling strategy is proposed to reduce the optimizing difficulty and better train the proposed method. Comprehensive experiments conducted on satellite image sequences from the FY-4A meteorological satellite verify the effectiveness, applicability, and adaptability of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches under challenging scenarios.

TI  - Retrieving leaf area index of rubber plantation in Hainan Island using empirical and neural network models with Landsat images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for describing the growth status and canopy structure of vegetation. The rapid and accurate acquisition of the vegetation or agroforestry LAI has great scientific significance in agroforestry ecological ecosystems research and a very important practical value for guiding agricultural and forestry production. In this study, the typical tropical crops (rubber forest) in Hainan Island were selected as the research area, the empirical and neural network (NN) LAI estimation models of rubber forest were constructed based on satellite remote sensing vegetation indices and the field LAI measurement data, and the spatiotemporal variation was analyzed. The results showed that, compared with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), ratio VI (RVI), normalized near-infrared (NNIR), wide dynamic range VI (WDRVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), DVI, renormalized DVI (RDVI), and modified SAVI (MSAVI) have higher correlations with LAI. Among the LAI estimation models of rubber forest based on empirical and artificial NN (ANN) models, the estimation accuracy of ANN achieves the highest value. The linear fitting determination coefficient R-2 of the observed and simulated rubber forest LAI was 0.85 (p < 0.001), the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.15, and the average relative error (RE) was 1.93%. However, there was underestimation in the middle-value area and overestimation in the high- and low-value areas of LAI. Based on remote sensing mapping of the rubber forest LAI, the high LAI values (4.40 to 6.00 m(2) m( - 2)) were mainly distributed in Danzhou and Baisha (west of Hainan Island); the middle LAI values (3.80 to 4.40 m(2) m( - 2)) were mainly located in Chengmai, Tunchang, and Qiongzhong (middle of Hainan Island); and the low LAI values (<3.80 m(2) m( - 2)) were shown primarily on Ding'an, Qionghai, Wanning, Ledong, and Sanya (east and south of Hainan Island). In summary, the remote sensing estimation model for the rubber plantation LAI based on the vegetation index has high accuracy and good values for application.

TI  - A Decision-Tree Approach to Identifying Paddy Rice Lodging with Multiple Pieces of Polarization Information Derived from Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging is one of the typical abiotic adversities during paddy rice growth. In addition to affecting photosynthesis, it can seriously damage crop growth and development, such as reducing rice quality and hindering automated harvesting. It is, therefore, imperative to accurately and in good time acquire crop-lodging areas for yield prediction, agricultural insurance claims, and disaster-management decisions. However, the accuracy requirements for crop-lodging monitoring remain challenging due to complicated impact factors. Aiming at identifying paddy rice lodging on Shazai Island, Guangdong, China, caused by heavy rainfall and strong wind, a decision-tree model was constructed using multiple-parameter information from Sentinel-1 SAR images and the in situ lodging samples. The model innovatively combined the five backscattering coefficients with five polarization decomposition parameters and quantified the importance of each parameter feature. It was found that the decision-tree method coupled with polarization decomposition can be used to obtain an accurate distribution of paddy rice-lodging areas. The results showed that: (1) Radar parameters can capture the changes in lodged paddy rice. The radar parameters that best distinguish paddy rice lodging are VV, VV+VH, VH/VV, and Span. (2) Span is the parameter with the strongest feature importance, which shows the necessity of adding polarization parameters to the classification model. (3) The dual-polarized Sentinel-1 database classification model can effectively extract the area of lodging paddy rice with an overall accuracy of 84.38%, and a total area precision of 93.18%. These observations can guide the future use of SAR-based information for crop-lodging assessment and post-disaster management.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of smart farming, automated crop type mapping is a challenging task to guarantee fast and automatic management of the agricultural sector. With the emergence of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and geospatial technologies, new concepts were developed to provide realistic solutions to precision agriculture. The present study aims to present a machine learning-based model for automated crop-type mapping with high accuracy. The proposed model is based on the use of both optical and radar satellite images for the classification of crop types with machine learning-based employed to classify the time series of vegetation indices. Several indices extracted from both optical and radar data were calculated. Harmonical modelization was also applied to optical indices, and decomposed into harmonic terms to calculate the fitted values of the time series. The proposed model was implemented using the geospatial processing services of Google Earth Engine and tested with a case study with about 147 satellite images. The results show the annual variability of crops and allowed performing classifications and crop type mapping with accuracy that exceeds the performances of the other existing models.

TI  - DIALECTICS OF THE FORMATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF PERSONALITY IN TUVAN CULTURE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MODERNIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the development of the phenomenon of personality in Tuvan culture, which is one of the many manifestations of contradictory and multilevel processes of modernization and globalization. The dialogical development of Tuvan culture leads to the synthesis of many cultural phenomena that form the modern existence of Tuvan culture. The absence of ontological and anthropological foundations for the natural formation of this phenomenon in Tuvan culture is revealed. The author reveals the inconsistency of the universal application of the concepts of European-rational philosophy to the analysis of the understanding of a person formed in specific conditions. The study showed that traditional cultures did not form and did not use universally rational thinking, which did not lead to the formation of a subject-object dichotomy in worldview and cognition. The reason for this phenomenon is syncretism, as well as a lack of analytical separation of aspects of human existence. The author infers that in traditional cultures there is no analogue of the word "personality", which is created in the cosmic-logical analysis of being, spread in the ancient philosophical tradition and Christian-theological philosophy. As a result, the subject-subject model of interaction forms a special moral model, which is only superficially revealed in cultures other than European. In modern times, the phenomenon of personality is necessarily formed in Tuvan culture, which changes the mechanisms of socialization and initiation. There are new meanings in the self-identification of Tuvans. Modernization brings to Tuvan culture the substantialism of the European worldview, and globalization unifies the development of cultural and historical tradition. The need for a methodologically complete analysis of the understanding of man in traditional cultures is emphasized, which will allow a deeper understanding of human manifestations, as well as form a more effective development of cultural and historical traditions in the future.

T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work traces the development of an illegal landfill near the town of Svoge in Bulgaria. After 2016, a waste management plan is prepared on the territory of the municipality and a decision is made to dispose of it by depositing it in a regional landfill for municipal waste in the town of Kostinbrod. The aim of the study is to trace the development of biochemical processes that took place on the territory of the former landfill and whether their impact continues to this day. Data from the Open Data Portal (https://data.egov.bg/), the National Spatial Data Portal INSPIRE (https://inspire.egov.bg/bg), satellite data and GIS, several spectral profiles and indices such as Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) were used.Composite images from the multispectral instrument (MSI) of the Sentinel 2 platform and radar (SAR) from the Sentinel 1 platform of the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency were used. The surface temperature of the landfill was calculated using the heat channels from the Landsat 5-7 (ETM) and Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 (OLI / TIRS) sensors. A combination of radar and optical data was made. Data from different seasons and years were used to monitor the dynamics of thermal pollution in the study area. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the territory on which the landfill is located has been made. Last but not least, the role of high-value open data in environmental monitoring has been demonstrated, which will reduce the administrative burden of making responsible decisions for each smaller municipality and will be successfully implemented in future methodologies for improving Digital twins through technical work in Destination Earth (DestinE) and information about any point, area or globally significant territories.

TI  - Philosophy and Intercultural Communication: The Phenomenon of a Human Being in the Confucian Tradition
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. This paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of a human being within the Confucian tradition as well as its interpretations from intercultural perspective. Theoretical basis. One of the ways to understand the deepest level of the intercultural dialogue is to reveal the interpretations of a human being in philosophical traditions, since they refer to the formation of personality and identity within a given culture including interpersonal, inter-group, and intercultural relations. Humanism based on the unity of Human and Heaven runs like a red thread through the philosophical teachings of Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, Zhu Xi, Wang Yangming defining the ideas of human nature, his/her duties, his/her place and roles in society that shaped the Chinese mentality. Originality. Quite often, Chinese concepts (for example, human dignity beyond the ideas of democracy and mass political participation, guanxi, mianzi) are incomprehensible to the representatives of the Western civilization, which leads to the challenges in intercultural communication. The interpretation of these ideas in the context of Confucianism allows to understand them from the perspective of Others and expand the set of patterns of cultural perception. This ultimately leads to the awareness that there are many social, political, cultural realities, which we perceive through the lens of our own concepts and attitudes. The participants of an intercultural dialogue realize that each of them has a unique experience, own way of posing a problem and resolving it, and no one is better or worse. Conclusions. Confucian philosophy shaped the worldview of Chinese people, defined values, goals, meanings, attitudes, communication models, which affected all spheres of Chinese life and culture. The study of the philosophical heritage of the great Chinese civilization enhances the cultural competence of the intercultural communicators and expands the field of dialogue to the level of global communication.

AB  - With the advent of remote sensing in diverse application areas, many novel devices, algorithms, and numerous such solutions have been developed and proposed to solve real-world problems. In such a scenario, the development of multispectral and hyperspectral cameras has proved to be a boon for the remote sensing society. These cameras work based on the electromagnetic spectrum and allows us to visualize terrains in diverse perspectives. This paper has its prime focus in visualizing all possible band combinations of the collected multispectral imagery dataset. The dataset consists of images that has been acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles acronymized UAVs with mounted multispectral camera having four different bands viz., green, red, red-edge, and near infrared (NIR). The dataset consisting the multispectral imagery is then subjected to the proposed framework in order to visualize diverse band combinations. Initially, the imagery data is processed to generate the orthomosaic map of the entire study area i.e., selected prior to flying of the UAV. Further, the orthomosaic map is tested with different band combinations which can be used by the cartographers or analysts to perform diverse analysis such as identification of healthy vegetation, water absorption rate, edaphic properties, and many such. Also, few challenges that were faced during implementation are provided following which some possible solutions and future research directions are also entailed. The total number of band combinations obtained through the practical realization of the proposed framework included 24 images. Further, the thematic maps generated using individual bands along with MODIS NDVI maps are epitomized. The relevance of each combined image has diverse perspectives to visualize. Certain future directions in identifying the relevant band combinations are also entailed.

TI  - Deep Learning Analysis of Rice Blast Disease Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale agricultural production systems require disease monitoring and pest management on a real-time basis. Monitoring disease phenology is one of the possible ways to save agricultural products from huge yield loss incurred due to diseases. Rice is one of the major food crops across the globe. Leaf blast disease in rice affects its productivity all over the world. Monitoring of leaf blast is essential for strategic and tactical disease management decisions. Conventional methods of large-scale disease monitoring are laborious, time taking, and above all, suffer from inaccuracy. Remote sensing parameters are useful for monitoring diseases and crop health on a large scale. Spectral indices derived from remote sensing data provide characteristic features to distinguish areas between healthy and infected crops facilitating strategic application. Assessment of leaf blast incidence based on land surface temperature moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and moisture stress (Sentinel-2) have been used to predict disease patterns. A deep learning-based model is developed to assess the condition of rice blast disease at field scale. The model provided 90.02% training accuracy and 85.33% validation accuracy. The deep learning model on remote sensing images could assess leaf blast occurrence in real time.

TI  - Detecting Deforestation Using Logistic Analysis and Sentinel-1 Multitemporal Backscatter Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new approach for detecting deforestation using Sentinel-1 C-band backscattering data. It is based on the temporal analysis of the backscatter intensity and its correlation with the scattering behavior of deforested plots. The backscatter intensity temporal variability is modeled with a logistic function, whose lower and upper boundaries are, respectively, set based on the representative backscatter values for forest and deforested plots. The approach also enables the identification of the date of each deforestation event, corresponding to the inflection point of the logistic curve that best fits the backscatter intensity time series. The methodology was applied to two forest biomes, a tropical forest at Iguazu National Park in Argentina and a temperate forest in the Braila region in Romania. The optimal flattening parameter was 0.12 for both sites, with an F1-score of 0.93 and 0.71 for the tropical and temperate forests, respectively. The temporal accuracy shows a bias on the estimated date, with a slight delay of 2 months. The results reveal that the Sentinel C-band data can be successfully used for deforestation detection over tropical forests; however, the accuracy for temperate forests might be 20 pp lower, depending on the environmental conditions, such as rainfall, snow and management after logging.

AB  - This dataset is part of the article with DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1130655. In the article, the authors employed satellite-derived Water Quality Indicators and spatiotemporal analysis to assess the risk of wastewater contamination in Conceicao Lagoon, a coastal lagoon in Southern Brazil. The WQIs used are satellite-derived absorption coefficients of chlorophyll-a (chla) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and the backscattering coefficient of suspended particulate matter (SPM).The dataset comprises: 1) time series (2019-2021) of WQIs generated from the processing of Sentinel-2 Level 2A scenes with the 2SeaColor model, 2) time series (2019-2021) of the WQIs standardized anomalies (WQIs_Anomalies), and 3) time series (2019-2021) of the final Wastewater Contamination Index (WCI). The files are raster stacks in ENVI format (flat-binary raster file with an accompanying ASCII header file - *.HDR), which can be opened with most GIS software. The header file contains metadata of the rasters, including the coordinate system, pixel size, and band names (which in this case correspond to the image date in the format YYYYmmdd).More details on the methods can be found in the associated article.

TI  - Impacts of urban sprawl in the Administrative Region of Ribeira tilde o Preto (Brazil) and measures to restore improved landscapes
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study addressed the problem of urban expansion in a large metropolis of Brazil (ARRP - Adminis-trative Region of Ribeira similar to o Preto), relating the evolution of urbanization in the past 35 years with losses of agricultural area and respective equivalent production and economic effects. Besides these food security and agribusiness issues, the study tracked important environmental consequences of the observed growing urbani-zation. This included water insecurity related with the occupation of watercourse networks, destruction of ri-parian vegetation that is legally protected as Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), and the occupation of Guarani Aquifer recharge areas with impermeable surfaces. The database consisted of Landsat images interpreted and processed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results indicate losses of rural area exceeding 350 km2 in the studied timeframe, with equivalent production and economic losses around 1.1 Mton/year and 230 MR$/year, on average. It is worth to mention the 40-75% overlap between the impermeable surfaces of some ARRP municipalities (e.g., Cajuru, Altin ' opolis) and recharge areas of Guarani Aquifer. The impermeable surfaces within the ARRP also affected approximately 7000 headwaters that were potential hotspots of shallow aquifer recharge. The urban sprawl destroyed more than 9100 km of natural watercourses and nearly 630 km2 of PPAs. The pathways recognized to improve the ARRP landscape included implementation of urban agriculture and landscape planning measures capable to protect the recharge to and the quality of Guarani Aquifer water, mostly anchored in the Municipal Director Plans, the prominent land use policy tools in the ARRP. This integrated, long-term, spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of urban sprawl impacts assembled with indications of landscape restoration policies and measures is novel in Brazil. On the other hand, studying the ARRP is worthwhile because of its historical relationship with the Brazilian ethanol program that brought an accelerated development to the region following the World oil crisis of 1970 s until now.

CP  - ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference (DIS)
CL  - Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA
AB  - Human-centered design (HCD) shaped our thinking for the past decade. However, this methodology risks negating non-human actors in design proposals. The current theoretical discourse in HCI questions this anthropocentric worldview and explores the potentialities of incorporating more-than-human perspectives in design processes. Yet, we have relatively few concrete methods for engaging with more-than-human actors and decentering human perspectives. Therefore, we propose a methodology beyond HCD to explore "more-than-human" perspectives in design. This methodology utilises Uexkull's concept of "Umwelt" as a guiding notion and integrates it into a methodology where creatively visualising overlapping Umwelts lead to moments of decentering. By doing so, we aim to transform design processes to create more inclusive and sustainable design interventions which consider our interconnectedness with the more-than-human world and the consequences for our planet.

T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Enterococci have been used as sentinel organisms for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in food, humans, and other animals. In this sense, the present study evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and the presence of genes associated with resistance to erythromycin (msrC and ermB) and tetracycline [tet(M) and/or tet(L)] in enterococci isolated from raw sheep's milk and cheeses (colonial, feta-, and pecorino-type) from South region of Brazil. A total of 156 enterococci were isolated from milk (n=80) and cheese (n=76) samples, identified by MALDI-TOF. Enterococcus faecalis (50.6%; n=79) was the most frequent species isolated from both samples. According to in vitro susceptibility tests, enterococci strains were not susceptible to the most commonly antimicrobial agents used in human and veterinary medicine. The frequency of MDR strains in enterococci isolated from milk (53.7%) was higher than those from cheese (24.2%). The tet(M) gene was the most commonly detected among tetracycline not-susceptible strains. The present study provided the first evidence of antimicrobial not-susceptible enterococci in raw sheep's milk and cheeses in South Brazil. Drug-resistant strains, particularly those that are MDR, constitute a One Health issue.

TI  - Classifying Sub-Parcel Grassland Management Practices by Optical and Microwave Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland management practices and intensities are key factors influencing the quality and balance of their provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Most European temperate grasslands are exploited through mowing, grazing, or a combination of both in relatively small management units. Grazing and mowing can however not be considered equivalent because the first is gradual and selective and the second is not. In this study, the aim is to differentiate grasslands in terms of management practices and to retrieve homogeneous management units. Grasslands are classified hierarchically, first through a pixel-based supervised classification to differentiate grazed pastures from mown hay meadows and then through an object-based mowing detection method to retrieve the timing and frequency of mowing events. A large field dataset was used to calibrate and validate the method. For the classification, 18 different input feature combinations derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were tested for a random forest classifier through a cross-validation scheme. The best results were obtained based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) times series with cubic spline interpolation. The classification differentiated pastures (grazed) from hay meadows (mown) with an overall accuracy of 88%. The classification is then combined with the existing parcel delineation and high-resolution ancillary data to retrieve the homogeneous management units, which are used for the object-based mowing detection based on the Sentinel-1 coherence and Sentinel-2 NDVI. The mowing detection performances were increased thanks to the grassland mask, the management unit delineation, and the exclusion of pastures, reaching a precision of 93% and a detection rate of 82%. This hierarchical grassland classification approach allowed to differentiate three types of grasslands, namely pastures, and meadows (including mixed practices) with an early first mowing event and with a late first mowing event, with an overall accuracy of 79%. The grasslands could be further differentiated by mowing frequency, resulting in five final classes.

TI  - Elephant Corridor loss due to anthropogenic stress-a study of change in forest cover using satellite data in the Sonitpur District, Assam, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Elephant habitats were mainly found in the dense forest regions which is the tropical evergreen forest in Sonitpur District, Assam. The total area of Sonitpur District is approximately 5204 km2. Satellite imagery from 1990, 2009, and 2017 was investigated. The current research aims to investigate the huge amount of deforestation that occurred from 1990 to 2017 in the Sonitpur district using a temporal satellite imagery system. The visual data interpretation and change matrix analysis using three-period imagery indicated significant corridor loss and deforestation between 1990 and 2017. The study indicates that a massive number of land-use changes would be occurring within the next few years. So, to protect elephants and forests, agricultural land should be converted into natural forests and anthropogenic activities should be stopped in the corridors and buffer areas. Local communities and governments should take various steps to do so and Government should take legal steps against elephant killing. This research focuses on the conservation problems associated with the corridor's decrease over time. The findings also indicated the advanced capabilities of GIS and remote sensing for monitoring and analyzing corridor status.

TI  - Initial Performance Analysis of the At-Altitude Radiance Ratio Method for Reflectance Conversion of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, the conversion of at-sensor radiance to surface reflectance for each pixel in a scene is an essential component of many analysis tasks. The empirical line method (ELM) is the most used technique among remote sensing practitioners due to its reliability and production of accurate reflectance measurements. However, the at-altitude radiance ratio (AARR), a more recently proposed methodology, is attractive as it allows reflectance conversion to be carried out in real time throughout data collection, does not require calibrated samples of pre-measured reflectance to be placed in scene, and can account for changes in illumination conditions. The benefits of AARR can substantially reduce the level of effort required for collection setup and subsequent data analysis, and provide a means for large-scale automation of remote sensing data collection, even in atypical flight conditions. In this study, an onboard, downwelling irradiance spectrometer integrated onto a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) is utilized to characterize the performance of AARR-generated reflectance from hyperspectral radiance data under a variety of challenging illumination conditions. The observed error introduced by AARR is often on par with ELM and acceptable depending on the application requirements and natural variation in the reflectance of the targets of interest. Additionally, a number of radiometric and atmospheric corrections are proposed that could increase the accuracy of the method in future trials, warranting further research.

TI  - Simulating spaceborne imaging to retrieve grassland nitrogen concentration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne optical imaging enables continuous monitoring of nitrogen concentration (N%) in grasslands. However, the differences in instrumental setup, image pre-processing, wavelength coverage, and sampling rate pose a challenge when attempting to leverage data from multiple spaceborne instruments. We develop a method that makes use of field spectroscopy and the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Radiative Transfer (SPART) model to simulate any Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) spaceborne sensor. The purpose of this method is to allow better integration of field spectroscopy data with spaceborne optical imagery. We develop a hybrid model using simulated data and a Random Forest Regressor, which is then independently validated using real Sentinel-2 TOA reflectance collected during 2016 and 2020. Our model achieves an independent validation accuracy of 0.44 (RMSE), MPIW of 0.11 and R2 of 0.55, demonstrating the potential of this methodology for monitoring grassland N% using field spectroscopy.

TI  - Spectral Aerosol Radiative Forcing and Efficiency of the La Palma Volcanic Plume over the Izana Observatory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 19 September 2021, a volcanic eruption began on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). The eruption has allowed the assessment of an unprecedented multidisciplinary study on the effects of the volcanic plume. This work presents the estimation of the spectral direct radiative forcing (Delta F) and efficiency (Delta F-Eff ) from solar radiation measurements at the Izana Observatory (IZO) located on the island of Tenerife (similar to 140 km from the volcano). During the eruption, the IZO was affected by different types of aerosols: volcanic, Saharan mineral dust, and a mixture of volcanic and dust aerosols. Three case studies were identified using ground-based (lidar) data, satellite-based (Sentinel 5P Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) data, reanalysis data (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2, MERRA-2), and backward trajectories (Flexible Trajectories, FLEXTRA), and subsequently characterised in terms of optical and micro-physical properties using ground-based sun-photometry measurements. Despite the Delta F of the volcanic aerosols being greater than that of the dust events (associated with the larger aerosol load present), the Delta F-Eff was found to be lower. The spectral Delta F-Eff values at 440 nm ranged between -1.9 and - 2.6 Wm(-2)nm(-1)AOD(-1) for the mineral dust and mixed volcanic and dust particles, and between - 1.6 and -3.3 Wm(-2)nm(-1)AOD(-1) for the volcanic aerosols, considering solar zenith angles between 30 degrees and 70 degrees, respectively.

TI  - Physiological Responses of the Bivalves <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> and <i>Ruditapes decussatus</i> Following Exposure to Phenanthrene: Toxicokinetics, Dynamics and Biomarkers Study
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The multiple impacts of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon on the aquatic invertebrates were rarely assessed in a chronic way and multiple-species experiments, despite the clear advantage of better mimicking natural conditions compared to traditional acute and single-species-focused toxicological experiments. The application of such an approach is essential to lower the health risks for populations that regularly consume seafood. The data presented herein supported the use of Mytilus galloprovincyalis and Ruditapes decussatus as bioindicators of phenanthrene in water and/or sediment and proved the efficacy of the biomarkers' assessment and molecular modelling in determining environmental thresholds and policies for governments. The aim of the current study was to assess the multifaceted effects of the polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene, mainly used in the colouring, explosive, and pharmaceutical industries, on the physiology of two bivalve species with economic value as seafood, namely, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincyalis and the European clam Ruditapes decussatus. The current study assessed how the phenanthrene affected several biomarkers and biometric endpoints in both bivalves, based on an in vivo experiment in silico approach. The bivalves were exposed during four time slots (i.e., 7, 15, 21, and 28 days) to two concentrations of phenanthrene in water (50 mu g/L and 100 mu g/L). For the clam R. decussatus, an additional contamination of sediment was applied due their typical benthic lifestyle (50 mu g/kg and 100 mu g/kg). The phenanthrene significantly reduced the ability of bivalves to tolerate desiccation and their Median Lethal Time, and also inhibited the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in a time-dependent manner. The activity of catalase indicated that bivalves also experienced oxidative stress during the first 21 days of the experiment. The significant decline in catalase activity observed during the last week of the experiment for the mussel M. galloprovincyalis supported a depletion of enzymes caused by the phenanthrene. The phenanthrene has also toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties, as assessed by the in silico approach. Overall, the results obtained suggest that the bivalves Ruditapes decussatus and M. galloprovincyalis can be used as a sentinel species in monitoring studies to assess the environmental impact of phenanthene in marine ecosystems. The significance of our findings is based on the fact that in ecotoxicology, little is known about the chronic effects, the simultaneous use of multiple species as bioindicators, and the interactions molecular modelling.

TI  - Measuring Glacier Elevation Change by Tracking Shadows on Satellite Monoscopic Optical Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring glacier elevation change is crucial information for estimating glacier mass balance, calibrating mass balance and climate models, and assessing the impact of global warming. We examined the potentiality of clinometry to quantify glacier elevation changes. This technique allows calculating the elevation of the points that lie on the margins of the shadows cast by the local topography on monoscopic optical images. Mapping the shadow position across different images permits quantifying surface elevation changes. We applied clinometry to Sentinel-2 images of the Aletsch Glacier (Switzerland) and we measured a glacier thinning of -1.9 +/- 1.7 ma(-1) between 2017 and 2021, in agreement with previous observations.

TI  - Alignment of Multifrequency SAR Images Acquired Over Sea Ice Using Drift Compensation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we investigate the feasibility to align synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery based on a compensation for sea ice drift occurring between temporally shifted image acquisitions. The image alignment is a requirement for improving sea ice classification by combining multifrequency SAR images acquired at different times. Images obtained at different radar frequencies provide complementary information, thus reducing ambiguities in the separation of ice types and the retrieval of sea ice parameters. For the alignment we use ice displacement vectors obtained from a sea ice drift retrieval algorithm based on pattern matching. The displacement vectors are organized on a triangular mesh and used for a piecewise affine transformation of the slave image onto the master image. In our case study, we developed an alignment framework for pairs of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band) images. We demonstrate several successful examples of alignment for time gaps ranging from a few hours to several days, depending on the ice conditions. The data were acquired over three test sites in the Arctic: 1) Belgica Bank, 2) Fram Strait, and 3) Lincoln Sea. We assess the quality of the alignment using the structural similarity index. From the displacement vectors, locations and extensions of patches of strong ice deformation are determined, which allows to estimate the possible areal size of successful alignment over undeformed ice and a judgment of the expected quality for each image pair. The comprehensive assessment of hundreds of aligned L-C SAR pairs shows the potential of our method to work under various environmental conditions provided that the ice drift can be estimated reliably.

TI  - Genomic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants using sentinel SARI hospital surveillance.
T2  - Influenza and other respiratory viruses
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: To support the COVID-19 pandemic response, many countries, including Belgium, implemented baseline genomic surveillance (BGS) programs aiming to early detect and characterize new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In parallel, Belgium maintained a sentinel network of six hospitals that samples patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and integrated SARS-CoV-2 detection within a broader range of respiratory pathogens. We evaluate the ability of the SARI surveillance to monitor general trends and early signals of viral genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and compare it with the BGS as a reference model.Methods: Nine-hundred twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients fulfilling the Belgian SARI definition between January 2020 and December 2022 were sequenced using the ARTIC Network amplicon tiling approach on a MinION platform. Weekly variant of concern (VOC) proportions and types were compared to those that were circulating between 2021 and 2022, using 96,251 sequences of the BGS.Results: SARI surveillance allowed timely detection of the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) and Delta (B.1.617.2) VOCs, with no to 2weeks delay according to the start of their epidemic growth in the Belgian population. First detection of VOCs B.1.351 and P.1 took longer, but these remained minor in Belgium. Omicron BA.3 was never detected in SARI surveillance. Timeliness could not be evaluated for B.1.1.7, being already major at the start of the study period.Conclusions: Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 using SARI sentinel surveillance has proven to accurately reflect VOCs detected in the population and provides a cost-effective solution for long-term genomic monitoring of circulating respiratory viruses.

TI  - Estimating Nighttime PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration in Beijing Based on NPP/VIIRS Day/Night Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime PM2.5 detection by remote sensing can expand understanding of PM2.5 spatiotemporal patterns due to wider coverage compared to ground monitors and by supplementing traditional daytime detection. However, using remote sensing data to invert PM2.5 at night is still challenging. Compared with daytime detection, which operates on sunlight, nighttime detection operates on much weaker moonlight and artificial light sources, complicating signal extraction. Moreover, as the attempts to sense PM2.5 remotely using satellite data are relatively recent, the existing nighttime models are still not mature, overlooking many important factors such as stray light, seasonality in meteorological effects, and observation angle. This paper attempts to improve the accuracy of nighttime PM2.5 detection by proposing an inversion model that takes these factors into consideration. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite/Day/Night Band (VIIRS/DNB) on board the polar-orbiting Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20) was used to establish a nighttime PM2.5 inversion model in the Beijing area from 1 March 2018 to 28 February 2019. The model was designed by first studying the effects of these factors through a stepwise regression, then building a multivariate regression model to compensate for these effects. The results showed that the impact of satellite viewing zenith angle (VZA) was strongest, followed by seasonality and moonlight. Total accuracy was measured using correlation coefficient (R) compared to ground measurements, achieving 0.87 over the urban area and 0.74 over the suburbs. Specifically, the proposed method works efficiently at subsatellite points, which in this case correspond to VZA from 0 and 5 degrees. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the R reached 0.95, 0.93, 0.94, and 0.97 at subsatellite points in the urban area, while it was 0.88, 0.82, 0.85, and 0.77 in the suburbs.

TI  - A Machine Learning Method for Building Height Estimation Based on Sentinel-2 Bi-Temporal Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building height information is essential for many applications such as urban planning and population density estimation. The build-ing shadow length varies according to seasons, which is shown as different digital number values in multi-temporal images. Thus, the bi-temporal satellite remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 are used to estimate the buildings height in this study. An area of 15 km x 15 km in Beijing, China is taken as the study area. By preprocess-ing the data, the remaining pixels are split into two parts: 70% as the training data set and the rest as the testing data set. Then, one classification model and three regression models are proposed with using Random Forest (RF) method. Based on the testing data, it shows that the accuracy rate of the classification model has reached 98.4% with the kappa coefficient of 0.93. And the regression models' root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.61 floor for 1-6 floors group, 0.41 floor for 7-12 floor group, and 0.98 floor for above 12 floor group. The final RMSE is 1.62 floor with RF models. In general, this study shows the feasibility of using satellite mid-resolution opti-cal image to estimate the building height and provides an important reference for regional building height estimation in the future.

TI  - Xylazine Complicating Opioid Ingestions in Young Children
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors of this report present 3 cases of synthetic opioid intoxication complicated by the concomitant presence of the additive xylazine, a nonopioid sedative analgesic and muscle relaxant used in veterinary medicine that potentiates respiratory depression associated with the opioid toxidrome. Three exposed children presented with severe signs and symptoms, 2 of whom experienced cardiac arrest, a need for continuous naloxone infusion or multiple naloxone doses, or mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory failure after their exposures. Additives were detected in urine studies only through the performance of specialized toxicology testing. Detection of xylazine among adult overdose deaths has recently increased sharply, particularly across the northeastern United States. Adulteration by xylazine is an emerging public health threat nationally. Our report reveals that pediatricians should be aware of sentinel drug trends among adults, including the emerging types of illicit, synthetic, or counterfeit formulations of recreational substances, because children may be harmed because of accidental or intentional exposure. Children exposed to dangerous substances also need child protection services that may entail safe relocation outside of the home and the referral of affected caregivers to necessary substance use treatment services. Given epidemic drug use among adults, pediatricians should be competent to recognize common toxidromes and be aware that signs and symptoms may be potentiated by synergistic novel additives or polysubstance exposures. Importantly, standard urine drug screens may not detect synthetic opioid derivatives or contributing additives, so that diagnosis will require specialized toxicology testing.

The paper follows previous works of some of the authors on this topic, giving an insight on the proper use, processing and interpretation of satellite radar interferometry data for the structural analysis, through an application to the "Vittorino da Feltre" school building located in the city centre of Rome (Italy), within the framework of a retrofitting project. After performing a correct positioning of the reflecting targets on the 3D geometry of the structure under investigation, displacement time series, mean deformation velocity values and continuous maps of the vertical and East-West velocity components are presented, by exploiting the COSMO-SkyMed SAR data collected during the 2011-2019 time interval. Finally, a comparison of the obtained results with the on-site detected cracking pattern can be useful to better understand the ongoing phenomena, for a proper damage assessment.

TI  - Grad-SLAM: Explaining Convolutional Autoencoders&amp;#x2019; Latent Space of Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter introduces a tool for explaining the latent space generated by applying convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to satellite image time series, entitled Grad-SLAM. We rely on backpropagated gradient interpretation combined with network activation localization. We use the proposed formula for multiple layers of the encoder, then scale and merge the results to generate a single date contribution metric for the generation of the latent space. We illustrate the potential of this method with the study of the unsupervised classification of agricultural Sentinel-1 time series. We show that critical characterizing dates for unsupervised retrieval of a given class are conditioned by the crop type's radiometric signature and class count. We also present how Grad-SLAM can be used to enhance the understanding of unsupervised classification confusion.

TI  - FARMSAR: Fixing AgRicultural Mislabels Using Sentinel-1 Time Series and AutoencodeRs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to quantify the errors in the provided agricultural crop types, estimate the possible error rate in the available dataset, and propose a correction strategy. This quantification could establish a confidence criterion useful for decisions taken on this data or to have a better apprehension of the possible consequences of using this data in learning downstream functions such as classification. We consider two agricultural label errors: crop type mislabels and mis-split crops. To process and correct these errors, we design a two-step methodology. Using class-specific convolutional autoencoders applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series of free-to-use and temporally dense Sentinel-1 data, we detect out-of-distribution temporal profiles of crop time series, which we categorize as one out of the three following possibilities: crop edge confusion, incorrectly split crop areas, and potentially mislabeled crop. We then relabel crops flagged as mislabeled using an Otsu threshold-derived confidence criteria. We numerically validate our methodology using a controlled disruption of labels over crops of confidence. We then compare our methods to supervised algorithms and show improved quality of relabels, with up to 98% correct relabels for our method, against up to 91% for Random Forest-based approaches. We show a drastic decrease in the performance of supervised algorithms under critical conditions (smaller and larger amounts of introduced label errors), with Random Forest falling to 56% of correct relabels against 95% for our approach. We also explicit the trade-off made in the design of our method between the number of relabels, and their quality. In addition, we apply this methodology to a set of agricultural labels containing probable mislabels. We also validate the quality of the corrections using optical imagery, which helps highlight incorrectly cut crops and potential mislabels. We then assess the applicability of the proposed method in various contexts and scales and present how it is suitable for verifying and correcting farmers' crop declarations.

TI  - Films "of Eastern Life" of the 1920s in the Light of Intercultural Communication among the Peoples of the USSR
T2  - ZHURNAL FRONTIRNYKH ISSLEDOVANII-JOURNAL OF FRONTIER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores various films "about Eastern life" of the 1920s, conducting a historical and anthro-pological analysis of the content of these films and their reviews from the perspective of intercultural communication. The research methodology is grounded in the semiotic tradition and the commu-nicative model proposed by Yu. M. Lotman. Printed media texts and visual sources (films) were used in the composition of this article. The aim of this piece is to expose the communicative functions of cinematography as a medium for information exchange and to ascertain the cognitive possibilities of silent cinema for the communicative interaction of the peoples of our country.Films "from Eastern life" had to conform to certain criteria, taking into account the idiosyncrasies of the national mentality of the inhabitants of the eastern outskirts. The study revealed that legends were employed in scriptwriting as a phenomenon of folk spiritual culture. Films inspired by folklore depict architectural masterpieces and the diverse nature of different regions. The harem theme popular in Western Europe found its way into Soviet films "about Eastern life", but the quest for the "false exotic of the East" often resulted in communication breakdowns. The "inauthentic" portrayal of the East did not resonate with viewers and film critics. Nevertheless, silent films of the 1920s introduced the ethno-confessional characteristics of peoples, their history, traditional way of life, mores, and customs. These films contributed to the broadening of the national worldview, thereby confirming the high cognitive potential and significance of cinema in the intercultural communication within the multi-ethnic landscape of the USSR.

TI  - "Bacchic" Face in A. P. Chekhov's Prose: Linguistic Aspect
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The individual-author's interpretation of the word face and partially its synonymous series in the Bacchic context in the works of A. P. Chekhov is studied. The material for the study is fragments from the prose works of the writer, presented in the Com-plete Works, which, along with a description of the character's appearance, contain an in-dication of the situation of drinking alcohol. The relevance of this study is associated with the defi nition of idio-style features (individual and usual) in the representation of the situation of drinking wine, as well as with the features of describing the appearance of a Bacchic per-son. It has been revealed that in the Bacchic context the lexeme "face" is accompanied by evaluative characteristics, verbalized adjecti-val phrases, which contain information about both the shape, texture, complexion, and about the activity, pastime of the subject of the situa-tion. It is shown that the face becomes a mirror of a person's lifestyle and can have an artifac-tual interpretation, that is, it acquires the same properties as clothes - it becomes "rumpled", "tattered", "worn". It is also noted that an outside observer is able to read thoughts and emotions from facial expressions, and the in-ability to see a face is the cause of fear.

TI  - A Spatial Downscaling Approach for Land Surface Temperature by Considering Descriptor Weight
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring the satellite land surface temperature (LST) with high spatiotemporal resolutions is pressing in the land surface biophysical process. However, most current LST products hardly satisfy this requirement. LST downscaling provides an effective way to solve this issue by introducing driving factors, but existing methods usually ignore the weights of descriptors. In this letter, based on the geographically weighted regression (GWR) and random forest (RF), a new downscaling method [i.e., weighted GWR (WGWR)] considering the weights of LST descriptors is proposed. To examine the performance of WGWR, the 100-m Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) and Terra advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) LSTs are aggregated to 1000 m as the simulated coarse LSTs, and then the coarse LSTs are downscaled to 100 m using WGWR, RF, and GWR. Meanwhile, the original 100-m LSTs are used as validation references. Results indicate that the proposed WGWR outperforms RF and GWR: for RF (GWR), the root mean square error (RMSE) can be reduced by 0.34 K (0.26 K) in Zhangye (ZY) and 0.22 K (0.1 K) in Beijing (BJ). Compared to RF and GWR, WGWR also yields better image quality: the downscaled LST images have neither obvious smoothing effect nor boundary effect and maintain the details of the image at high spatial resolution. Validation based on in situ LST indicates that the downscaled LST based on WGWR has better agreement with the in situ LST, and the RMSE is reduced by 0.57 K. The proposed WGWR contributes to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution LSTs and promote hydrological, meteorological, and ecological studies.

TI  - Near-Real-Time Estimation of Hourly All-Weather Land Surface Temperature by Fusing Reanalysis Data and Geostationary Satellite Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is urgently needed to obtain the hourly near-real-time all-weather land surface temperature (NRT-AW LST) for immediately monitoring the disaster and environmental changes. Nevertheless, studies on estimating hourly NRT-AW LST are in the preliminary stage. In this study, we proposed a Spatio-TEmporal Fusion (STEF) method for fusing the reanalysis dataset derived from the China Land Surface Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and thermal infrared (TIR) data derived from the Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite to estimate the hourly NRT-AW LST with 0.04(degrees) resolution. The STEF method can produce NRT-AW LST without relying on the data after the target moment. STEF is tested in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Validation results on DOY 215-366 of 2020 indicate that STEF has good accuracy: root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and mean bias error (MBEs) under clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and AW conditions vary from 2.74 K (-1.06 K) to 3.77 K (0.14 K), from 3.31 K (-1.40 K) to 4.46 K (-0.22 K), and from 3.10 K (-1.11 K) to 3.87 K (-0.22 K), respectively. The STEF method can improve the accuracies of FY-4A LST, and RMSEs are reduced by about 0.77-1.82 K. The NRT-AW LSTs estimated by STEF have better accuracies than CLDAS LSTs under AW conditions. The SETF also exhibited similar results in 2021. We believe that the proposed STEF method can meet the requirements of NRT-AW LST estimation and contribute to improving the timeliness of regional monitoring and related parameter estimations.

TI  - Relative contributions to patient effective dose in SPECT-CT hybrid imaging
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical imaging using ionising radiation, while commonplace, has an associated risk of cancer induction. In trying to manage this risk it is beneficial to be able to quantify it through the use of effective dose. Estimates of effective dose resulting from radiopharmaceutical administration are well established in published data but the equivalent data for the computed tomography (CT) component of nuclear medicine hybrid imaging is less well-known. This study aims to estimate the absolute and relative contributions to effective dose from radiopharmaceutical and CT components of common single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-CT procedures. Using patient dose-audit data from three SPECT-CT systems we estimated the effective dose resulting from radiopharmaceutical administration by scaling the published effective dose data according to administered activity. The corresponding effective dose resulting from the CT component was estimated using the ImPACT CT dosimetry tool. Absolute effective dose from radiopharmaceutical administrations ranged from 0.2 (Tc-99m colloid head and neck sentinel lymph node imaging) to 14.2 mSv (dual-isotope Tc-99m sestamibi/I-123 sodium iodide parathyroid imaging). Effective dose from the CT components ranged from 0.3 (Tl-201 chloride brain scans - scan range covering the brain) to 4.4 mSv (Tc-99m HYNIC Ty3-Octreotide scans which use a scan range from the top of the brain to bottom of pelvis). Relative contributions (radiopharmaceutical/CT) ranged from 11/89 (Tc-99m colloid head and neck sentinel lymph node imaging) to 98/2% (Tl-201 chloride brain scans). There is a wide range of effective dose from radiopharmaceutical and CT components of hybrid imaging and both aspects can benefit from optimisation efforts, with the largest benefit coming from the CT components.

TI  - The Theological Hypostases of Natural Philosophy in the Age of Enlightenment
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA NAUKI I TEHNOLOGIJ-SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea that nature demonstrates the wisdom, power, goodness, and glory of God was a common place in early modern literature, but it was not associated with interest in the study of natural history until the late seventeenth century. In the 1690s, however, things began to change and a new hybrid discipline called physico-theology began to take shape. At first physico-theology was spread in England, then it penetrated to the continent, although in France it was not widely supported. In Germany it peaked in the 1730s and 1760s, when many natural history books and essays describing the physico-theological aspects of the study of roses, tulips, grass, water, stones, insects, snails, locusts, fish, bees, and birds appeared.Physico-theology was developed as a way of reconciling natural philosophical inquiry with two types of Christian theology: natural theology and the theology of Revelation. However, physico-theology was not simply a matter of drawing the resources of both disciplines to form some holistic worldview. Although physico-theology fell into rapid decline in the second half of the nineteenth century, it did not disappear entirely, and echoes of it can be found in the literature of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.The article considers the main features of Enlightenment physico-theology in correlation with the development of natural philosophy and natural history. The article shows that, in contrast to J.H. Brooke's widespread opinion ("It was often not the natural philosophers themselves, but thinkers with a social or political grievance who transformed the sciences into a secularizing force"), the relationship between science/natural philosophy and theology in the Enlightenment has a political component, but it is not the main one. Depending on the ideological predisposition of this or that author and the cultural situation in socium, innovative science could be used both to reinforce traditional theological positions and to develop alternative systems of natural religion and even to propagate aggressive atheism.

TI  - What's the rumpus? Resident temperate forest birds approach an unfamiliar neotropical alarm call across three continents.
T2  - Biology letters
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Alarm signals have evolved to communicate pertinent threats to conspecifics, but heterospecifics may also use alarm calls to obtain social information. In birds, mixed-species flocks are often structured around focal sentinel species, which produce reliable alarm calls that inform eavesdropping heterospecifics about predation risk. Prior research has shown that Neotropical species innately recognize the alarm calls of a Nearctic sentinel species, but it remains unclear how generalizable or consistent such innate signal recognition of alarm-calling species is. We tested for the responses to the alarm calls of a Neotropical sentinel forest bird species, the dusky-throated antshrike (Thamnomanes ardesiacus), by naive resident temperate forest birds across three continents during the winter season. At all three sites, we found that approaches to the Neotropical antshrike alarm calls were similarly frequent to the alarm calls of a local parid sentinel species (positive control), while approaches to the antshrike's songs and to non-threatening columbid calls (negative controls) occurred significantly less often. Although we only tested one sentinel species, our findings indicate that temperate forest birds can recognize and adaptively respond globally to a foreign and unfamiliar tropical alarm call, and suggest that some avian alarm calls transcend phylogenetic histories and individual ecological experiences.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Data and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key factor in the water and heat exchange and energy transformation of the ecological systems and is of critical importance to the accurate obtainment of the soil moisture content for supervising water resources and protecting regional and global eco environments. In this study, we selected the soil moisture monitoring networks of Naqu, Maqu, and Tianjun on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as the research areas, and we established a database of surface microwave scattering with the AIEM (advanced integral equation model) and the mathematical expressions for the backscattering coefficient, soil moisture, and surface roughness of the VV and VH polarizations.We proposed the soil moisture retrieval models of empirical and machine learnings algorithms (backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF)) for the ascending and descending orbits using Sentinel-1 and measurement data, and we also validated the accuracies of the retrieval model in the research areas. According to the results, there is a substantial logarithmic correlation among the backscattering coefficient, soil moisture, and combined roughness. Generally, we can use empirical models to estimate the soil moisture content, with an R-2 of 0.609, RMSE of 0.08, and MAE of 0.064 for the ascending orbit model and an R-2 of 0.554, RMSE of 0.086, and MAE of 0.071 for the descending orbit model. The soil moisture contents are underestimated when the volumetric water content is high. The soil moisture retrieval accuracy is improved with machine learning algorithms compared to the empirical model, and the performance of the RF algorithm is superior to those of the other machine learning algorithms. The RF algorithm also achieved satisfactory performances for the Maqu and Tianjun networks. The accuracies of the inversion models for the ascending orbit in the three soil moisture monitoring networks were better than those for the descending orbit.

TI  - Satellite observed delaying effects of increased winds on spring green-up dates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind speeds have substantially changed over the Northern Hemisphere during the past a few decades, and such changes have been shown to have important implications for the growth, chemical composition, structure, and morphology of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of wind change on the spring leaf green-up date (GUD) remain largely unknown. Using both 89 sites of flux measurements (972 site-year in total) and satellite observations over 1982-2015, here we show that higher winds in the spring preseason contributed to the delayed GUD for 29.8% of northern ecosystems, and various factors controlled the strength of the delaying effects. We further show that the earlier GUD with climate change was offset roughly by 24.4 & PLUSMN; 3.7% due to the increase of wind. Higher winds potentially caused delayed GUD by changes in soil conditions and differences between daytime and night-time temperatures. A higher precipitation could likely compensate the drying effects of winds on GUD. Among different vegetation types, soil water and water use efficiency were the most important regu-lators of the sensitivity of GUD to wind for all plant functional types, while evapotranspiration regulated grasslands and shrubs. Our results identified the new role of wind change on the spring phenology in respective of satellite observations, and future ecosystem models might consider these effects for a better representation of the responses of vegetation phenology to climate change.

TI  - A Method for Retrieving Coarse-Resolution Leaf Area Index for Mixed Biomes Using a Mixed-Pixel Correction Factor
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key structural parameter of vegetation canopies. Accordingly, several moderate-resolution global LAI products have been produced and widely used in the field of remote sensing. However, the accuracy of the current moderate-resolution global LAI products cannot satisfy the requirements recommended by the LAI application communities, especially in heterogeneous areas composed of mixed land cover types. In this study, we propose a mixed-pixel correction (MPC) method to improve the accuracy of LAI retrievals over heterogeneous areas by considering the influence of heterogeneity caused by the mixture of different biome types with the help of high-resolution land cover maps. The DART-simulated LAI, the aggregated Landsat LAI, and the site-based high-resolution LAI reference maps are used to evaluate the performance of the MPC method. The results indicate that the MPC method can reduce the influences of spatial heterogeneity and biome misclassification to obtain the LAI with much better accuracy than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) main algorithm, given that the high-resolution land cover map is accurate. The root mean square error (RMSE) (bias) decreases from 0.749 (0.486) to 0.414 (0.087), while the R2 increases from 0.084 to 0.524, and the proportion of pixels that fulfill the uncertainty requirement of the GCOS increases from 38.2% to 84.6% for the results of site-based high-resolution LAI reference maps. Spatially explicit information about vegetation fractional cover can further reduce uncertainties induced by variations in canopy density for the results of DART simulated data. The proposed method shows potential for improving global moderate-resolution LAI products.

TI  - Is the use of blue dye really necessary in axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in staging of breast cancer?
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for staging the clinically node-negative axilla in early breast cancer. Evidence guiding current practice describes dual localization technique using Patent blue dye and radioisotope (99mTc). Adverse effects of blue dye include 1:1000 risk of anaphylaxis, skin staining and loss of plane visibility, which may increase operative time and reduce resectional accuracy. The risk to a patient posed by anaphylaxis may be greater when operating in a unit without on-site ITU support - a situation more common with recent restructuring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim is to quantify the benefit of blue dye above radioisotope alone in identifying nodal disease. This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected sentinel node data including all consecutive sentinel node biopsies in a single center during the period 2016-2019.In terms of results, 760 sentinel nodes were taken in 435 patients. 59 nodes (7.8%) were detected by blue dye alone; 120 (15.8%) 'hot' only, 581 (76.5%) hot and blue. 4 of the blue only nodes contained macrometastases but 3 of these patients had further hot nodes excised that also contained macrometastases. 1 out of 435 patients (0.2%) had macro metastatic disease identified as a result of blue dye alone which would have been missed had it not been used. In conclusion, the use of blue dye carries risk and offers little benefit in terms of staging in SLNB and its use may be unnecessary in the hands of the skilled surgeon. This study supports the omission of blue dye, which may be advisable if operating in units without ITU support. If larger studies support these figures, it may become as outdated.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of mangrove growth rate at selected planted sites in Mauritius
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive and rich ecosystems that thrive at the interface of land and sea. They provide a wide range of essential goods and services, contribute highly to coastal protection and the livelihood of coastal communities, and are also carbon-rich biomes contributing to carbon sequestration. Mangroves are primarily threatened by anthropogenic activities; a loss in biodiversity has been observed in the past years in many countries including Mauritius. Given their value to the ecosystem, it is important to have effective continuous monitoring of mangrove dynamics. We studied the rate of increase of canopy coverage of planted Rhizophora mucronata forests in two selected sites (Le Morne and Grande Riviere Noire) on a southern African island - Mauritius - using Google Earth Pro historical Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images. Data were processed using ImageJ software. To our knowledge, this technique has not yet been applied for monitoring mangrove growth. The mangrove sites were classified into four zones based on water level and tidal variations. On average, the rate of increase of canopy coverage expressed by a coefficient "b' at Le Morne (b = 1.901) was higher than that at Grande Rivi & egrave;re Noire (b = 1.823). The coefficient "b' positively correlated with the zonations (r similar to 0.8). Higher "b' values (2.319-2.886) were observed in Zone 1, where the substrate is always covered with water at low tide. The use of remote sensing data along with image processing analysis proved to be an effective tool to obtain relevant information, not only for mapping mangroves but also for monitoring the canopy growth rates of planted mangroves.

TI  - Impact of Parameterization of Vertical Turbulent Diffusion on the Results of Simulating the Phytoplankton Biomass Dynamics in the Deep Part of the Black Sea
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The paper is purposed at studying the impact of vertical mixing processes in the Black Sea on distribution and dynamics of the basic components of marine ecosystem based on numerical simulation.Methods and Results. Two variants of the lower trophic level model of the Black Sea ecosystem differing in the way of parameterizing the processes of vertical turbulent diffusion were used. In the first variant, the diffusion coefficients are represented as the functions depending on depth and time. At that, the time dependence is of seasonal character. In the second variant, in order to describe the vertical exchange processes, the turbulent model was added to the circulation one. In both versions, the biogeochemical parts of the models consisting of 15 compartments include the same equations, coefficients, and functions describing the interactions between different ecosystem components in the upper 200-meter layer of the sea. The calculations for 12 years (1998-2009) were done for both versions of the ecosystem model, and the results were compared. The results of modeling the nitrates distribution were compared with the in situ measurements in the deep part of the Black Sea taken from the interdisciplinary oceanographic database. Besides, the results of simulating the chlorophyll surface concentration were also compared with the analogous satellite-derived measurement results.Conclusions. As for the above-noted calculations, seasonal variability of the basic ecosystem parameters is insignificantly different, at that the parameterization of vertical turbulent diffusion produces a certain effect upon the vertical distribution of ecosystem parameters. Interannual variability in both calculations is characterized by a biomass decrease in the euphotic zone of the sea deep part resulted from a negative trend in the amount of nutrients inflowing with the river waters. The annual average concentrations in the sea upper layer corresponding to the first calculation are higher than those obtained in the calculation by the turbulent model. This is related to the fact that the vertical circulation cell formed due to the wind field cyclonic vorticity over the Black Sea results to be more intense for the first calculation. The nitrates entering into the euphotic zone from the underlying layer is provided mainly by advection rather than turbulent diffusion.

TI  - The influence of urban and mineral expansion on surface temperature variation
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the variations in surface temperature - Land Surface Temperature (LST) - in the urban network of the municipality of Paracatu, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, which has humid tropical climate of savannah (type Aw), and in the open pit mining activity located near its urban perimeter, between the years 1990 and 2019. The area was chosen because the municipality is the most important of its microregion, being an attractive pole of work due to the presence of several companies, with emphasis on the mining company Kinross Gold Corporation, which is one of the largest open pit mines and gold producers in Brazil. Images of LANDSAT- 5 and 8 satellites were used, which underwent a resampling and standardization of pixels to become the same size. The satellite choice and the period of analysis was based on the beginning of mining activity in the municipality, and a year that was able to represent its current state. Subsequently, the LST calculations made available by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were applied. When comparing the results of both areas of the first and last year of the series, there was an increase in the variation of the mean, minimum and maximum LST, a fact that is related with the suppression of vegetation for the growth of both areas. Such suppression, together with anthropic occupation, is responsible for one of the neighborhoods (28) that present the highest average variation of LST over the years. On the other hand, the neighborhood that presented the smallest variation on this parameter (47) was recently incorporated as a neighborhood in the city's Master Plan because it is currently being occupied by the construction of an allotment, evidencing that the temporal variability of LST in the municipality occurs in relation to anthropic presence and its magnitude.

TI  - Hydrographic structure of the continental shelf in Santos Basin and its causes: The SANAGU and SANSED campaigns (2019)
T2  - OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the hydrography and water masses of the Santos Basin Continental Shelf (SBCS) during two hydrographic campaigns (SANAGU, SANSED) in 2019. Coastal Water (CW) is the dominant water mass in the southern portion of the SBCS, with relatively low salinity values (S<35.5 g kg-1), and satellite data show that local precipitation and river discharge could not account for the low salinity observed during the cruises in the southern region of the domain. The low salinity observed is explained by the transport from the south influenced by Subtropical Shelf Water (STSW), which was influenced by the La Plata River discharge. In the northern region of the SBCS, the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) dominates the bottom layers of the water column, with the wind playing a major role in the uplift of this water mass, as evidenced by a wind impulse analysis. In this part of the shelf, Tropical Water (TW) was the second water mass in volume and occupied the surface layers and offshore the shelf. CW is restricted to a thin surface layer, which reaches distances of a few kilometers from the coast. Our analysis show the differences in the hydrographic structure of the SBCS and suggests that the SBCS can be divided in two regions with distinct characteristics: 1) the area southwest of Sao Sebastiao, where the hydrographic parameters were modulated by the presence of the Subtropical Shelf Water (STSW); 2) the area northeast of Sao Sebastiao, where the uplifting of SACW was the dominant process.

TI  - EXPERIENCE OF USING PLANET EARTH OBSERVATION DATA IN RETRAINING COURSES FOR EDUCATORS IN THE JUNIOR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF UKRAINE
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the background and presents the results of the first in Ukraine advanced training course for educators in Remote Sensing, "Fundamentals of Remote Sensing: History and Practice", organized by the Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing Laboratory of the National Center, "Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine". The Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine is a system of extracurricular education committed to the development and implementation of science education techniques. Currently, the Academy has more than 250,000 students working in 64 scientific areas. In 2018, the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine received the status of Category 2 Science Education Center under the auspices of UNESCO and joined the network of Copernicus Academies. The Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine has been promoting the application of satellite imagery in education for over ten years. One of the outputs of this activity is the advanced training course for educators. This paper describes the online training course that was held in spring 2021 and 2022. The course was open to all interested teachers. A total of 41 educators from 13 regions of Ukraine have completed the training course in the span of two years. The paper describes the stages of special course organization, topics, and tools used in the lectures and case studies, including an overview of the data sources, such as EO-Browser, ArcGIS Online, Google my Maps, NASA Worldview and Google Earth, etc. The paper presents a detailed description of one of the hands-on case studies of water bodies in EO-Browser. It was established that the conducted special course promoted the educators' interest in bringing Earth observation to classrooms. Increased number of GIS and Remote Sensing after-school clubs in the territorial branches of the Junior Academy of Sciences (from 1 in Kyiv as of 2019 to 9 in the regions as of 2022, namely in Poltava, Sumy, Volyn, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Zakarpattia, Lviv, Kharkiv and Chernivtsi) is indicative of the course's effectiveness.

TI  - Assessing the Relative Performance of GNSS-R Flood Extent Observations: Case Study in South Sudan
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters. Climate change-induced flooding events are increasing worldwide, disproportionately impacting low-income and developing communities. While early warning systems save lives, satellite-based observation systems are vital for the disaster relief and recovery phases. Current satellite-based operational flood products are largely based on either optical remote-sensing methods, which exhibit a limited ability to detect water through clouds and vegetation, or microwave remote sensing, which provides relatively low spatial and temporal resolution. New small satellite constellations using radar or GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) have been shown to enhance our ability to overcome these deficiencies. In this work, we quantify the performance of using GNSS-R measurements from the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite Systems (CYGNSS) satellite constellation to map surface water in South Sudan and the Sudd wetland in comparison with a set of representative operational products. We make quantitative comparisons of our results with operational flood products based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and MODIS and with C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar. We find that our method detects 35.4% more surface water than Sentinel-1, while the VIIRS- and MODIS-based products underestimate by 4.8% and 83.7%, respectively. We use several metrics commonly used to evaluate classification performance: precision, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), F2-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and assess the comparisons in this statistical framework. We discuss the consequences of our findings, including ways CYGNSS data may enhance current flood products and assist decision-makers and emergency managers.

TI  - Backdoor Attacks for Remote Sensing Data With Wavelet Transform
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the great success of deep learning algorithms in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) realm. Nevertheless, the security and robustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing safety-critical RS tasks. In this article, we provide a systematic analysis of backdoor attacks for RS data, where both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. While most of the existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers such as squared patches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based attack (WABA) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the trigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. In this way, the high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the attack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep learning models with a high attack success rate. We further analyze how different trigger images and the hyperparameters in the wavelet transform would influence the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on four benchmark RS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks and thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense algorithms to address this threat in RS scenarios. The code will be available online at https://github.com/ndraeger/waba.

TI  - OPTATIVE MODALITY IN PUBLICISTIC DISCOURSE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article, dealing with the problem of realization of the category of optativity within the framework of publicistic discourse, is to consider the linguistic means of expressing optative modality on the lexical and lexico-syntactic levels. The urgency of the study is determined by the anthropocentric nature of the category of linguistic modality and the related need for further development and clarification of the corre- sponding principles of the theory of modality, in particular, the theory of optative modality. The research materi- al, which involves identifying the specifics of the modal potential of the publicistic text, determined, presumably, by the peculiarities of the author's worldview and the national picture of the world, includes the texts of public speeches by R. Kipling, collected by the author himself and published in 1928 in the collection of speeches "A Book of Words". To solve the research problems aimed at identifying the trends in the implementation of optativity in the texts of the discursive type under consideration, a complex methodology was used, including the method of continuous sampling, the method of component analysis, as well as elements of structural-semantic, inter- pretive, contextual and statistical analyses. The study of the ways of expressing optative modality in Kipling's texts of public speeches reveals a tendency toward the predominant use of lexico-syntactic means expressing modal desirability categorically enough, which, however, can be reduced via a complicated syntactic context. This tendency, covering optative utterances that express such shades of meaning as "desire proper", "desire coupled with compulsion" and "wish", allows the authors of the article to argue that the choice of the linguistic means of realization of the category of optativity in publicistic discourse depends not only on its communicative purpose, but also on the peculiarities of the individual author's worldview, determined, in turn, by the specificity of the national picture of the world. The practical significance of the study consists in the possibility of using the results obtained when reading courses of lectures for students-philologists in theoretical grammar, stylistics and trans- lation studies, as well as at sessions on interpretation of publicistic text.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classifications of land use/land cover (LULC) in arid regions are vital for analyzing changes in climate. We propose an ensemble learning approach for improving LULC classification accuracy in Xinjiang, northwest China. First, multisource geographical datasets were applied, and the study area was divided into Northern Xinjiang, Tianshan, and Southern Xinjiang. Second, five machine learning algorithms-k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and C4.5-were chosen to develop different ensemble learning strategies according to the climatic and topographic characteristics of each subregion. Third, stratified random sampling was used to obtain training samples and optimal parameters for each machine learning algorithm. Lastly, each derived approach was applied across Xinjiang, and subregion performance was evaluated. The results showed that the LULC classification accuracy achieved across Xinjiang via the proposed ensemble learning approach was improved by >= 6.85% compared with individual machine learning algorithms. By specific subregion, the accuracies for Northern Xinjiang, Tianshan, and Southern Xinjiang increased by >= 6.70%, 5.87%, and 6.86%, respectively. Moreover, the ensemble learning strategy combining four machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, RF, ANN, and C4.5) was superior across Xinjiang and Tianshan; whereas, the three-algorithm (i.e., SVM, RF, and ANN) strategy worked best for the Northern and Southern Xinjiang. The innovation of this study is to develop a novel ensemble learning approach to divide Xinjiang into different subregions, accurately classify land cover, and generate a new land cover product for simulating climate change in Xinjiang.

TI  - InSAR-Based Active Landslide Detection and Characterization Along the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide have attracted extensive attention and research worldwide because of their tremendous destructiveness, and many catastrophic landslides have occurred along river corridors and reservoir bank slopes. The detection and detailed monitoring of potential landslides are prerequisites for landslide disaster prevention, with recent advance in spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) having effectively addressed this challenge. In this article, a wide-area landslide detection and monitoring framework, combining multiple InSAR techniques, is proposed to investigate active landslides along the upper reaches of the Yellow River from Longyang Gorge to Liujia Gorge (UYRLL), north-west China. A total of 597 active landslides have been mapped in this region for the first time. Our analyses suggest that a large percentage of the detected landslides are distributed at an elevation of 2000-3000 m with slope angles of 5-30 degrees and their spatial distribution density is correlated with regional tectonic activity. Multitemporal InSAR techniques have also been adopted to analyze the surface motion characteristics of two typical landslides (i.e., the Lijia landslide and the Xijitan landslide), showing that these two landslides are dominated by linear motion.

TI  - Assessment of Surface Fractional Water Impacts on SMAP Soil Moisture Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional water (FW) correction of satellite microwave brightness temperature (Tb) observations is a prerequisite for accurate soil moisture (SM) mapping over mixed land and water areas. Here, we evaluated the FW impacts on NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) SM retrievals using two water masks including (a) the NASA Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Water Mask version 6 (MOD44W) multi-year (2015-2019) water record and (b) the Ocean Discipline Processing System (ODPS) water mask previously used for SMAP global operational Tb and SM processing. The MOD44W and ODPS data were first compared with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Landsat-based water record. MOD44W showed major improvements in land/water classifications relative to the ODPS, with producer accuracy increasing from 50.02% to 95.02%, and user accuracy from 53.93% to 91.73% for water pixels. For assessing the FW impacts on SM retrievals, the same single channel V-polarization (SCA-V) algorithm was applied to SMAP Tb datasets corrected using ODPS and MOD44W water masks separately. MOD44W showed overall greater FW values (mean increase of 0.006) relative to the ODPS, leading to relatively drier SM retrievals (mean decrease: -0.012 m(3)/m(3)). Additional comparisons with globally distributed SM measurements confirmed consistently lower SM retrieval biases (mean decrease 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) and higher correlations (mean increase 0.06) of the MOD44W-based results relative to those based on the ODPS. Our results revealed non-negligible SM retrieval uncertainty introduced from the underlying ancillary FW data for areas with substantial water presence (e.g. FW>0.01).

TI  - An Improved Upscaling Method of In Situ Measurements With Consideration of Their Uncertainty for the Spatial Scale Match Between Satellite and In Situ Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial scale mismatch between satellite and in situ-based measurements can be reduced by deploying multiple in situ sites within the coarse pixel. However, upscaling in situ measurements from the ground-support scale to the coarse pixel scale is still necessary due to their "point" measurement characteristics. The previous upscaling methods were generally developed merely for the in situ measurements. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of in situ measurements, such as measurement errors and spatial representativeness errors, was not dealt with. Consequently, the upscaling results inevitably suffer from errors, which will finally propagate into the pixel scale ground "truth." For the first time, this study presents an improved upscaling method with the consideration of the uncertainty of in situ measurements based on the error theory and measurement adjustment theory. The effectiveness of the corrected upscaling coefficients was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the corrected upscaling results with those based on the upscaling coefficients without considering the uncertainty of in situ measurements. The results indicate that the accuracy of the upscaling results can be enhanced by 11.06% in the condition in which in situ measurements suffer from large uncertainty. However, if the uncertainty of in situ measurements is negligible, the corrected upscaling model is not necessary because it does not bring many benefits. Although the effectiveness of this method was only tested on a limited study area, it makes an important first step toward a higher precision pixel-scale ground "truth," especially when the uncertainty of in situ measurements is nonnegligible.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Processing Process Scheduling Based on Reinforcement Learning in Cloud Environment
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Task scheduling plays a crucial role in cloud computing and is a key factor determining cloud computing performance. To solve the task scheduling problem for remote sensing data processing in cloud computing, this paper proposes a workflow task scheduling algorithm-Workflow Task Scheduling Algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (WDRL). The remote sensing data process modeling is transformed into a directed acyclic graph scheduling problem. Then, the algorithm is designed by establishing a Markov decision model and adopting a fitness calculation method. Finally, combine the advantages of reinforcement learning and deep neural networks to minimize make-time for remote sensing data processes from experience. The experiment is based on the development of CloudSim and Python and compares the change of completion time in the process of remote sensing data. The results show that compared with several traditional meta-heuristic scheduling algorithms, WDRL can effectively achieve the goal of optimizing task scheduling efficiency.

TI  - Novel Validation and Calibration Strategy for Total Precipitable Water Products of Fengyun-2 Geostationary Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest batch of the Chinese Fengyun-2 (FY-2) geostationary satellites (i.e., FY-2F, FY-2G, and FY-2H) provides total precipitable water (TPW) products at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, due to the lack of accuracy and performance evaluation for these products, a vast amount of valuable TPW data remains unused in atmospheric science research. To address this issue, this study aimed to propose and apply a validation strategy that incorporated a hemispheric vertical correction model (VCM) to obtain reliable evaluation results. With the help of reliable radiosonde and the state-of-the-art fifth generation of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data (ERA5), this study was the first to assess the quality of the full-disk TPW products retrieved via the three FY-2 satellites from January 2019 to December 2020. In addition, this study analyzed the water vapor content, latitude, and elevation dependencies of FY-2 TPW retrieval error and explored the potential for improving the quality of each satellite TPW product through a linear calibration in the three test areas of northern and southern temperate zones and tropics. The results of this study were threefold. First, the accuracy of FY-2F and FY-2H TPW was superior to that of FY-2G. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of FY-2F, FY-2G, and FY-2H were 3.84, 4.46, and 3.73 mm and 2.30, 2.55, and 2.14 mm relative to the radiosonde and ERA5 data, respectively. Second, the TPW retrieval error of the FY-2 satellites decreased with the increasing latitude or decreasing elevation. Overall, FY-2G underestimated TPW, whereas FY-2F and FY-2H only underestimated TPW under wet conditions (i.e., TPW > 55 mm). Finally, the calibration potential of FY-2F and FY-2H was higher than that of FY-2G, and the bias, slope, and potential index (PI) values of FY-2G were lower than those of FY-2H and FY-2F in all the three test areas.

TI  - Mapping Annual Global Forest Gain From 1983 to 2021 With Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's forests are experiencing rapid changes due to land use and climate change. However, a detailed map of global forest gain at fine spatial and temporal resolutions is still missing. To fill this gap, we developed an automatic framework for mapping annual forest gain globally using Landsat time series, the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm, and the Google Earth engine platform. First, stable forest samples collected based on the first all-season sample set and an automated sample migrate method were used to determine annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) thresholds for forest gain detection. Second, with the NBR time series from 1982 to 2021 and LandTrendr algorithm, we produced a dataset of global forest gain year from 1983 to 2021 based on a set of decision rules. Our results reveal that over 60% gains occurred in Russia, Canada, the United States, Indonesia, and China, and approximately half of global forest gain occurred between 2001 and 2010. The forest gain map developed in this study exhibited good consistency with statistical inventories and independent regional and global products. Our dataset can be useful for policy-relevant research on the global carbon cycle, and our method provides an efficient and transferable approach for monitoring other types of land cover dynamics.

TI  - Toward a Wide-Scale Land Subsidence Product in Eastern States of Australia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of a wide-land deformation monitoring program in eastern states of Australia, characterized by an extensive landmass and extensive coastlines, necessitates the generation of deformation maps with a significantly larger spatial extent. A pragmatic approach for achieving such coverage involves the integration of multiple interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series results encompassing various tracks and frames. The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation is facilitating the generation of expansive ground surface deformation, while the initial challenge in obtaining such a product arises from the varying spatial coverage of the Sentinel-1 data. To overcome this obstacle, we proposed a novel Sentinel-1 image definition to facilitate consistent interferometric processing. Before the formation of any large displacement map, the inconsistency between different synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image scenes must, nevertheless, be addressed. Several factors contribute to these inconsistencies in observations, such as differences in the angle of observation at the overlapping regions of adjacent image tracks and imprecise estimations within the dataset itself (e.g., burst or swath discontinuities). This study delves into solutions for these challenges, specifically: 1) introducing a computer-vision-based algorithm for InSAR dataset quality assessment and 2) proposing a global least square mosaicking procedure for the amalgamation of tiles from multitracks and frames. Statistical analyses show that better accuracy can be achieved. The mosaicking InSAR product demonstrates the capacity to quantify ground surface changes, which also exhibits a correlation with other geological layers, and the subsidence range of [7, 10] mm/year shows a strong association with clay content levels ranging from 10% to 30% along the Darling River.

TI  - High-Resolution Planetscope Imagery and Machine Learning for Estimating Suspended Particulate Matter in the Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ebinur Lake is a shallow lake and vulnerable to strong winds, which can lead to drastic changes in suspended particulate matter (SPM). High spatial and temporal resolution images are therefore urgently needed for SPM monitoring over the Ebinur Lake. Hence, a high-efficiency inversion model of estimating SPM from high-resolution images using machine learning is essential to increase the amount of extracted information through band combinations quadratic optimization. This article aims to evaluate the capability of the PlanetScope images and four machine learning approaches for estimating SPM of the Ebinur Lake. The specific objectives include: to obtain the sensitive bands and band combinations for SPM using correlation analysis; to quadratically optimize the combination pattern of sensitive bands using a linear model; and to compare the accuracy of traditional linear model and machine learning models in estimating SPM. The results of the study confirm that after linear model quadratic optimization, the band combinations of B3(*)B4, (B2+B3)/ (B2-B3), (B3+B4)(*)(B3+B4), and (B3-B2)/(B2/B3) have higher accuracy than that of the single band model. By inputting the preferred four-band combinations into the partial least squares, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting decision tree, and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models, the performance of the SPM inversion based on PlanetScope images is better than the traditional linear model. Validation of the inversion maps with observations further indicates that the CatBoost model performed the best.

TI  - Efficient Extraction of Coastal Upwelling in the Northern South China Sea Based on Sea Surface Temperature Data and Research of Its Interannual Variations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - By applying the spatial intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (SIFCM) method based on MODIS Terra sea surface temperature (SST) data, we extract the significant coastal upwelling in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) efficiently, without the need for setting thresholds or regional connectivity processing. In this letter, the procedure is applied to the eight-day SST data from 2001 to 2021. Accordingly, the extraction data are effectively used to obtain long-term characteristics, based on which the interannual variations are quantitatively investigated and examined. The long-term characteristics data are analyzed in combination with the oceanic Ni no index (ONI), and the results indicate that the yearly average SST differences in summer coastal upwelling are positively correlated with the El Ni no southern oscillation (ENSO).

TI  - Automatic Detection and Identification of Floating Marine Debris Using Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floating plastic debris represent an environmental threat to the maritime environment as they drift the oceans. Developing tools to detect and remove them from our oceans is critical. We present an approach to detect and distinguish suspect plastic debris from other floating materials (i.e., driftwood, seaweed, sea snot, sea foam, and pumice) using Sentinel-2 data. We use extreme gradient boosting trained with data compiled from published works complemented by manual interpretation of satellite images. The method is trained with two spectral bands and seven spectral indices computed from the Sentinel-2 spectral bands. We consider three application scenarios. The first uses the database created under the scope of this work. While the classification achieved a 98% accuracy rate for suspect plastic debris, we acknowledge the need for ground-truth validation. The second, to enlarge the training dataset, uses synthetic data generated through a Wasserstein generative adversarial network. A supervised model trained exclusively with synthetic data successfully classified suspect plastic pixels with an accuracy of 83%. The third comprises an ensemble model that quantifies uncertainty about the predictions obtained with the classifier. We correctly classified 75% of the suspect plastic pixels. However, while the classification accuracy decreased, with the integration of uncertainty in the predictions, the number of misclassifications also significantly decreased when compared to the model with the highest accuracy of the previous scenarios. Due to the mixed band nature of the sensor and subpixel coverage of debris within a pixel, the application to other datasets might not be straightforward.

AB  - In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, the main goal of the Special Issue on "Remote sensing for water resources and environmental management" was to solicit papers from a diverse range of scientists around the world on the use of cutting-edge remote sensing technologies to assess and monitor freshwater quality, quantity, availability, and management to ensure water security. Special consideration was given to scientific manuscripts that covered, but were not limited to, the development of geospatial techniques and remote sensing applications for detecting, quantifying, and monitoring freshwater water resources, identifying potential threats to water resources and agriculture, as well as other themes related to water resources and environmental management at various spatial scales. The Special Issue attracted over thirteen peer-reviewed scientific articles, with the majority of manuscripts originating from China. Most of the studies made use of satellite datasets, ranging from coarse spatial resolution data, such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), to medium spatial resolution data, such as the Landsat series, ERA5, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Land version 2 reanalysis product (MERRA2), CLSM and NOAH ET, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Google Earth Engine (GEE) data, together with big data processing techniques, such as the remote sensing-based energy balance model (ALEXI/DisALEXI approach) and the STARFM data fusion technique, were used for analyzing geospatial datasets. Overall, this Special Issue demonstrated significant knowledge gaps in various big data image processing techniques and improved computing processes in assessing and monitoring water resources and the environment at various spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Comparing satellite methane measurements to inventory estimates: A Canadian case study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane emissions from natural gas production are of increasing importance as they threaten efforts to mitigate climate change. Current inventory estimates carry high uncertainties due to difficulties in measuring emission sources across large regions. Satellite measurements of atmospheric methane could provide new understanding of emissions. This paper provides insight into the effectiveness of using satellite data to inform and improve methane inventories for natural gas activities. TROPOMI data are used to quantify methane emissions from natural gas within the Montney basin region of Canada and results are compared with existing inventories. Emissions estimated using TROPOMI data were 2.6 +/- 2.2 kt/day which is 7.4 +/- 6.4 times the inventory esti -mates. Pixels (7 by 7 km) that contained gas facilities had on average 11 ppb more methane than the background. 7.4% of pixels containing gas sites displayed consistently high methane levels that were not reflected in the inventory. The satellite data were not sufficiently granular to correlate with inventories on a facility scale. This illustrates the spatial limitations of using satellite data to corroborate bottom-up inventories.

TI  - Automatic detection of photovoltaic facilities from Sentinel-2 observations by the enhanced U-Net method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the enactment of supportive government policies and the increasing maturity of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies, solar PV energy has become the most cost-effective new energy resource worldwide. Geospatial information on existing solar PV power systems is necessary to manage and optimize the deployment of new PV facilities. In this study, we propose a new deep-learning network, named the enhanced U-Net (E-UNET), to detect PV facilities from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral remote sensing data. Our E-UNET features an enhanced encoder-decoder structure that can efficiently extract spectral and spatial features simultaneously by combining a multi-spectral three-dimensional convolution path and a multi-scale pooling block. We compare the performance of the E-UNET with other semantic segmentation deep-learning networks and a pixel-based random forest classifier. The experimental results show that the E-UNET performs better than the other methods. It achieves an overall accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, F1, kappa coefficient, and recall of 0.989, 0.862, 0.869, 0.934, and 0.875, respectively. The experimental results also indicate that the E-UNET accurately detects PV facilities from various complex environments with high accuracy in terms of PV integrity and details.

TI  - Improving soil organic carbon predictions from a Sentinel-2 soil composite by assessing surface conditions and uncertainties
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction from remote sensing is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building reflectance composites using time series of images. Although composite imagery has demonstrated its potential in SOC prediction, it is still not well established if the resulting composite spectra mirror the reflectance fingerprint of the optimal conditions to predict topsoil properties (i.e. a smooth, dry and bare soil). We have collected 303 photos of soil surfaces in the Belgian loam belt where five main classes of surface conditions were distinguished: smooth seeded soils, soil crusts, partial cover by a growing crop, moist soils and crop residue cover. Reflectance spectra were then extracted from the Sentinel-2 images coinciding with the date of the photos. After the growing crop was removed by an NDVI < 0.25, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) was calculated to characterize the soil surface, and a threshold of NBR2 < 0.05 was found to be able to separate dry bare soils from soils in unfavorable conditions i.e. wet soils and soils covered by crop residues. Additionally, we found that normalizing the spectra (i.e. dividing the reflectance of each band by the mean reflectance of all spectral bands) allows for cancelling the albedo shift between soil crusts and smooth soils in seed-bed conditions. We then built the exposed soil composite from Sentinel-2 imagery for southern Belgium and part of NoordHolland and Flevoland in the Netherlands (covering the spring periods of 2016-2021). We used the mean spectra per pixel to predict SOC content by means of a Partial Least Squares Regression Model (PLSR) with 10-fold cross-validation. The uncertainty of the models was assessed via the prediction interval ratio (PIR). The cross validation of the model gave satisfactory results (mean of 100 bootstraps: model efficiency coefficient (MEC) = 0.48 & PLUSMN; 0.07, RMSE = 3.5 & PLUSMN; 0.3 g C kg-1, RPD = 1.4 & PLUSMN; 0.1 and RPIQ = 1.9 & PLUSMN; 0.3). The resulting SOC prediction maps show that the uncertainty of prediction decreases when the number of scenes per pixel increases, and reaches a minimum when at least six scenes per pixel are used (mean PIR of all pixels is 12.4 g C kg-1, while mean SOC predicted is 14.1 g C kg-1). The results of a validation against an independent data set showed a median difference of 0.5 g C kg-1 & PLUSMN; 2.8 g C kg-1 SOC between the measured (average SOC content 13.5 g C kg-1) and predicted SOC contents at field scale. Overall, this compositing method shows both realistic within field and regional SOC patterns.

TI  - GEDI waveform metrics in vegetation mapping-a case study from a heterogeneous tropical forest landscape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of different vegetation types is important information for landscape management, especially in the context of tackling global environmental change. Vegetation types can be mapped using satellite and airborne passive remote sensing. However, spectrally similar yet structurally different vegetation types, like different tree-dominated land covers, are often challenging to map using spectral information alone. We examined the potential of vertical vegetation structure acquired in the global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) mission that harnesses a space-borne waveform lidar sensor in vegetation mapping across a heterogeneous tropical landscape in Cambodia. We extracted 121 waveform metrics from Level-1B and Level-2A data products at 1062 locations across five key vegetation types. After reducing the relative height variables' dimensionality through simple linear regressions, we developed a Random Forest classifier to predict vegetation classes based on 23 GEDI metrics. We then used this model to classify the vegetation types across more than 77 000 GEDI footprints in the study area. GEDI metrics alone were useful in identifying vegetation types with 81% accuracy. Cropland/grassland class had the highest prediction accuracy (user's accuracy [UA] = 89%; producer's accuracy [PA] = 91%), while dry deciduous forest had the lowest accuracy (UA = 73%; PA = 69%). By comparing the GEDI-only classification with an optical-radar map, we found that structural and topographic information from GEDI Level-1B and Level-2A can complement the spectral information in assessing natural habitats that neighbor other vegetation types in a heterogeneous landscape. The highest classification accuracy at the footprint scale was obtained from the combination of GEDI, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 (88.3%). We also demonstrated how wall-to-wall vegetation mapping is possible by combining the three data sources. These findings expand the potential use of GEDI waveform lidar data in supporting the development of policy-relevant maps that depict the distribution of forests together with other vegetation types.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: Metaphysics of Philistine Discourses
T2  - GALACTICA MEDIA-JOURNAL OF MEDIA STUDIES - GALAKTIKA MEDIA-ZHURNAL MEDIA ISSLEDOVANIJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The article forms a matrix of the main propositions and markers of artificial intelligence in non-professional (philistine) discourses. The study is implemented on the Internet using special tools. The subject of the analysis is the search queries in the main 'Google' and 'Yandex' services, thematic communities, social networks and users' comments. The definition of the matrix of non-professional stereotypical labeling of artificial intelligence as an actual developing technology allows us to see a picture of a new metaphysics. "Technological " metaphysics is inextricably linked with mythological thinking and significantly affects the absorption of scientific and technological developments. It also influences the constructive critical attitude towards the physical condition. The article substantiates that this modern technical mythology, which includes many speculative assumptions, has a double meaning: on the one hand, it "domesticates " technology, and on the other hand, it creates an insur-mountable barrier for the convergence of spiritual and religious scope and the scientific worldview. The definition and subsequent refinement of the mythological matrix is necessary for the effective implementation of innovative programs, adjustment of those to the education system, constructive dialogue between the state, scientists, and users.

TI  - Local Features of Communication Between the Soviet Government and the Cossack Population of the Kuban (1920-22): The Chronicle of Staronizhesteblievskaya Stanitsa
T2  - HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to consideration of local features of communication between the Soviet government and the Cossack population of the Kuban in 1920-22 on the example of the chronicle of life of Staronizhesteblievskaya stanitsa. Using traditional methods of system analysis, retrospective and comparative approaches to historical research, the authors have set a task of identifying mechanisms for strengthening Soviet power and organizing its interaction with the population in the Kuban villages. The Cossack population was distinguished by its conservative worldview and for most part participated in the Civil War on the side of the White movement. Identification of features of the relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Cossack population of the Kuban in the early Soviet period (1920-22) is relevant for national historical science, as it shows that repressive vector in the system of communication of victorious political forces with individual ethno-social groups and society as a whole was possible, but not mandatory. The novelty of the research lies in consideration of economic, social, and political processes occurring at the grassroots level of the South of Russia rural society, in a Cossack village. Relying on methodological provisions of microhistoric approach, according to which the objects of scientific analysis are historical events and phenomena at the local level, the authors have analyzed socially significant phenomena in the rural society of Staronizhestebliyevskaya stanitsa, revealing features of the Cossack population integration into the Soviet society. The article introduces into scientific use documents of the village revkom and higher Soviet authorities, which highlight social confrontation within the rural society. They show how the Soviet government searched for and implemented mechanisms of combating the "green" insurgency and sabotage of the prodrazverstka, using preventive arrest, confiscation of property, taking and executing hostages. Having reconstructed the chronicle of life of Staronizhesteblievskaya stanitsa in 1920-22, the authors conclude that the Soviet government set a course for confrontation with the wealthy and middle-class Cossacks in its system of communication with the Cossack population of the Kuban in the early 1920s, designing and testing a repressive model of interaction with those disagreeing with political and economic transformations. The study has been carried out on the basis of materials from the State Archive of the Krasnodar Krai. Its results can be used for comprehensive characterization of the Soviet authorities' activities in the era of their formation and strengthening (1920-22) and of the Kuban Cossacks adaptation to the new model of state and society.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Variation in Response to Land Use Modes Changes: The Case of Mefou River Sub-Basin (Southern Cameroon)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) estimation at the river sub-basin level is crucial for developing land use planning at the basin scale and beyond. The main goal of this study was to analyze LST variations in response to land use mode (LUM) changes in the Mefou River sub-basin (Southern Cameroon) using geospatial techniques. To achieve this goal, we used Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (2000 and 2010) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data for 2020. We also used air surface temperature data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) to validate the LST. Our results reveal that between 2000 and 2020, the Mefou watershed recorded significant changes in LUMs, which were mainly manifested by an increase in impervious areas (IAs) (buildings and roads (+10%); bare soils and farmlands (+204.9%)) and forest reduction (-31.2). This decrease in the forest was also reflected by a reduction in NDVI values, the maximum of which went from 0.47 in 2000 to 0.39 in 2020. Contrary to the forest area and the NDVI values, the LSTs of the investigated basin increased over the period studied. There is a strong negative correlation between LST and NDVI. In general, high LSTs correspond to low NDVI values. For the years 2000, 2010 and 2020, the links between these two variables are materialized by respective correlation coefficients of -0.66, -0.74 and -0.85. This study could contribute to understanding the impact of LUM changes on the local climate, and could further provide assistance to policymakers in regard to land use planning and climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics of the Shore Coverage within the Zone of Influence of the Chambo River, Central Ecuador
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The predominant aim of the current study was to evaluate the spatial dynamics of the riparian coverage of the area of influence of the Chambo River in the area of the river's source (middle-high basin), between 2500 and 3000 m.a.s.l. For its execution, Landsat 7 images from the year 2000, RapidEye from the year 2009, and Spot 6 from the year 2019 were used in the time range of 2000-2009 and 2009-2019. These were subjected to supervised classification by applying the maximum likelihood algorithm, identifying five classes of soil cover, being pasture, crops, soil-remnants of paramo, forest, and anthropic. The classification results were validated by calculating the precision measures and the kappa index. With the use of cross-tabulation matrices, the gains, losses, and persistence in the two periods studied were identified. There, it was determined that, in the first study period, the soil cover-paramo remnants presented the highest percentage of loss (26.70%), the crop cover the highest percentage of gain (28.91%), and in the second period, the crop class presented the highest percentages of losses (18.94%) and gains (17.29%). The cartographic projection of the area for the year 2030 predicts that the areas anthropic category will increase by 1.27%, that of forest will decrease by 1.19%, that of soil-remnants of paramo will gain 0.79%, and crop and pasture cover will decrease by 0.45% and 0.43%, respectively. The results obtained allow for the transitions between coverages to be attributed to population growth, afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and agricultural activities, volcanic eruptions, land colonization, and expansion of agricultural activity. Complementary studies are recommended that involve livelihoods and water quality, which facilitate the identification of vulnerable areas to propose adaptation, prevention, and/or restoration measures.

TI  - Location-Aware Adaptive Normalization: A Deep Learning Approach for Wildfire Danger Forecasting
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to intensify and increase extreme events in the weather cycle. Since this has a significant impact on various sectors of our life, recent works are concerned with identifying and predicting such extreme events from Earth observations. With respect to wildfire danger forecasting, previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time dimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic variables. Furthermore, most existing multibranch architectures lose the interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To address these issues, this article proposes a 2-D/3-D two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) with a location-aware adaptive normalization (LOAN) layer. Using LOAN as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features conditional on their geographical locations. Thus, our approach considers feature properties as a unified yet compound 2-D/3-D model. Besides, we propose using the sinusoidal-based encoding of the day of the year to provide the model with explicit temporal information about the target day within the year. Our experimental results show a better performance of our approach than other baselines on the challenging FireCube dataset. The results show that location-aware adaptive feature normalization is a promising technique to learn the relation between dynamic variables and their geographic locations, which is highly relevant for areas where remote sensing data build the basis for analysis. The source code is available at https://github.com/HakamShams/LOAN.

AB  - Detecting and monitoring change on Earth has always been a subject of considerable interest. Over time, human activities have expanded and the impact of these activities on the land cover has been clearly seen. Detecting and monitoring the change in land cover has become a critical issue for decision-makers due to issues such as the increase in industrial activities and the increase in settlement. Several works have been performed on this subject in the field of remote sensing, and methods and tools have continuously improved to determine the change in the earth to achieve the most accurate result. Within the scope of the study, multi-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite images were used in order to determine the land cover change due to urbanization and agricultural activity in Kocaeli province within the framework of dynamic change determination according to LandCover 2.0 standards. Four different data reduction - classification method combinations were applied, which are Built-up Index-Random Forest, Principal Component Analysis-Random Forest, Built-up Index-Regression Tree and Principal Component Analysis-Regression Tree and their performances were evaluated comparatively. The results of the classification analyses performed on the Google Earth Engine platform were turned into thematic maps and an accuracy assessment was carried out. As a result of the study, it has been revealed that Principal Component Analysis-Regression Tree method pair is the approach that provides the highest accuracy, with an accuracy rate of 83.88 percent.

TI  - Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence in Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of death in women worldwide. Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is the most significant prognostic factor in breast cancer. Under the current guidelines, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of axillary staging in patients with clinically-node negative breast cancer. Despite the minimally invasive nature of SLNB, it can cause short and long-term morbidities, including pain, sensory impairment, and upper limb motor dysfunction. However, lymphedema remains the most feared adverse event, and it affects 7% of patients within 36 months of follow-up. Recently, we have witnessed the implication of radiomics and artificial intelligence domains in the diagnosis and follow-up of many malignancies with promising results. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic search to investigate the potential of radiomics and artificial intelligence in predicting ALNM. Methods Four electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis as our basis of organization. Results For radiomics, the area under the curve (AUC) for the included studies ranged from 0.715 to 0.93. Accuracy ranged from 67.7% to 98%. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 70.3% to 97.8% and 58.4% to 98.2%, respectively. For other artificial intelligence methods, AUC ranged from 0.68 to 0.98, while accuracy ranged from 55% to 89%. Conclusion The results of radiomics and artificial intelligence in predicting ALNM are promising. However, validation as a substitute for SLNB requires more substantial evidence from large randomized trials.

TI  - Concept of "Quixoticism" in Work of Miguel de Unamuno
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the concept of "quix-oticism" by M. de Unamuno. It is determined that Unamuno's Quixoteism was formed on the basis of the philosophy of F. M. Dostoevs-ky, with which M. de Unamuno has much in common: the perception of the image of Don Quixote as a refl ection of the national charac-ter. It is emphasized that the basic difference between these philosophies is the realism of the "Christ-like" image in F. M. Dosto-evsky and the reality of the "quixotic" im-age, which goes beyond the artistic world in M. de Unamuno. It has been proven that Una-muno's Quixoticism is essentially a religion that includes the main religious components, but Don Quixote lives on earth, while, unlike Christ, he is a man, a man with a divine be-ginning, a man who imitates God. The authors note that, despite the difference in approaches, both F. M. Dostoevsky and M. de Unamuno bow before the image of Don Quixote. Each of them sees in it a refl ection of the national characteristics of the peoples to which the au-thors identify themselves (Russian and Span-ish), as well as a biblical reference to Jesus Christ. It is determined that the distinguish-ing features of perception is the fact that the characters of F. M. Dostoevsky are striv-ing for greater realism, while the characters of Unamuno are more real in their own way, even relative to its creator, and have a greater impact on the existence and spiritual develop-ment of "real" people than other "real" people.

TI  - Was There a Babylonian Philosophy?
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article criticizes the theory of the assyriologist M. van de Mieroop about the existence of Babylonian philosophy, set forth in his monograph and detailed theses. Each thesis of this theory is quoted and analyzed in detail. The differences between the philosophical statement and the philosophical worldview from the religious and scientific statements of the peoples of ancient Mesopotamia are determined. It has been established that a philosophical statement can only be the author's and is necessarily criticized by other authors. In philosophical reasoning about the universe, the principle of non-possessiveness of the universal is obligatory. The universe is understood by philosophers as the unity of all things. At the same time, the universe is conceived as consisting of primary elements. In philosophical thinking there is a hierarchy of categories, the idea of the beginning, the limit and the infinite. Unlike the philosophers, the authors of the Sumerian and Akkadian texts were nameless and did not quote or criticize each other. In their reasoning, the universal is always associated with the belonging of many things to one subject, and the world order is understood exclusively as power. The universe appears in the Sumero-Akkadian texts as a multitude of possessed things. Cuneiform texts up to the 5th century B.C. do not know the concept of primary elements. They lack logical definitions and chains of logical reasoning, the hierarchy of categories, the idea of the beginning, the limit and the infinite. Thus, the constructions of the priests and scientists of ancient Mesopotamia, from our point of view, cannot be called philosophical texts.

AB  - This research characterized the traditional knowledge on the use and management of wildlife in the Nahuatl community of Santa Catarina, Morelos, Mexico. A qualitative methodology was used, applying ethnozoological research techniques such as semi-structured interviews (n = 55), ethnographic observation, and guided tours with local experts. In addition, the Cultural Importance Index (IIC) was calculated for each species used. A total of 41 species from different phyla were recorded, which are part of the tangible and intangible cultural manifestations of the Nahuas. Eleven categories of use are reported, of which nutritional (n = 57.5 %), forecast (n = 25 %), medicinal (n = 22.5 %) and legends (n = 12.5 %) recorded the higher percentage of species. The wild animals with the highest IIC were the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; 16.8), the field rabbit (Sylvilagus cunicularius; 13.6), the huilota (Zenaida macroura; 10.9), the rattlesnake (Crotalus culminatus; 12.8) and the winged ant (gynes and males of Atta mexicana; 10.8). Obtaining wildlife resources is done through individual or group gathering and hunting with firearms and traditional weapons in forest areas and agroecosystems within their territory. Wild fauna is a renewable natural resource that has a socio-cultural importance for the Nahua inhabitants because it is part of their subsistence strategies and cosmology: it provides them with raw materials for material needs, but also has symbolic representations associated with animals in traditional medicine, the practice of hunting and in the narratives of oral tradition.

TI  - Moral Boundaries and Cultural Membership: Perceptions of the LGBTQ in Turkiye
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMY CULTURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sexual minorities consistently rank as the most disapproved of group in Turkey although the LGBTQ community remain largely invisible. To explain this disparity, we examine private and public responses to "homosexuality" along four dimensions: demographic factors, social context, religion and religiosity, and public morality. The data come from a nationally representative survey (N=1893). We tested four sets of variables to explain the persistence of mistrust toward sexual minorities. The first two, demographic factors and social context, show limited explanatory power. The third dimension of personal morality is also limited, because boundaries against LGBTQ individuals also cut across religion and religiosity. The fourth dimension, public morality, a vision of moral values shaping public life and political discourse, explains the particularity of the views toward non-straight sexual orientations as the specific alignment of a moral worldview with exclusionary cultural membership. Results are significant in two ways. First, they show that the mistrust of sexual minorities is high. Second, the public displays of mistrust are different from the forms of prejudice expressed toward other groups, such as ethnic minorities. The symbolic boundaries drawn vis-avis LGBTQ individuals tells us more about the core values of belonging and solidarity in Turkish society.

TI  - SEMANTICS OF PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS WITH A FLORAL COMPONENT
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urgency of this research is determined by the interest in modern linguistics in revealing the specificity of the national worldview. The aim of the study is to investigate and analyze motivation of meaning and inner form of Russian phraseological units with a floral component. The article reports the results of the analyses of the phraseological units with a former lexeme - phytonym as one of their components. Phraseological units with a floral component are the units which incorporate a phytonym of a generic and common notion (tep- lichnoe rastenie, temnyy les, zatevat' syr-bor, puskat' korni, pristat' kak bannyy list, khot' trava ne rasti), as well as a component - name of some specific plant (osinovyy list, dubovaya golova, mak - makov tsvet, beleny ob"elsya, izrubit' v kapustu). It is emphasized that the analysis of the formation of semantic structure of phraseological units with a floral component is of considerable importance since the plants play a big role in the life of a person; they form and translate symbolic, mythological and religious ideas. Special attention is paid to the identification of the regularities and the specificity of phraseogenetic potential of floral lexemes (phytonyms). The novelty of the study might be determined by the fact that the motivation of the inner form of phraseological units with a floral component has not been studied in detail so far. It has been revealed that the inner form is based both on the floral symbols universal for the human culture and on the physical properties of some specific plants people deal with in their daily life. The national markedness of phytonyms in phraseological units can manifest itself on the level of symbols and can become the basis of the patterns and stereotypes of human behavior. The results ob- tained make it possible to conclude that the discovery of the motivation of the semantics of phraseological units with a floral component plays a considerable part in the study of the mentality of a nation.

TI  - SUBSTANDARD FORM AS A CULTURAL CODE: FROM NEWSPAPER DISCOURSE TO FICTION TEXT
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes a complex approach to the study of substandard forms as a special ethnocul- tural code of the Russian language on the material of newspaper and fiction (poetic) authored discourse. Sub- standard vocabulary enriches the communication system and facilitates the development of the linguistic and cultural space. The lexical units under study are not static; they pass over from one set into another, functioning not only as elements of imagery but also as a means of coding historical and everyday social events. The dynamic nature of these language forms has influenced the choice of practical research material: newspaper and authored (fiction) discourse. This thesis determines the urgency of this study. Linguo-culturological analysis of the lexicographic inventory of newspaper and fiction texts makes it possi- ble to identify conceptual projections and semiotic diffusion, contributing to doubled expressiveness, aesthetic choice, and axiological marking of substandard vocabulary. The aim of the study is to establish the relationship between the form and contextual realization of the lexical units in question, which constitute a special cultur- al code that ensures semantic stability and molds the general linguistic and a specific authored worldview. The research results corroborate the hypothesis about the dynamic nature of substandard vocabulary via register switching, indicating the culturally determined mechanisms of linguistic evolution.

TI  - Poetics of the Russian World by Ivan Shmelev
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the underlying causes of a new wave of axiological rejection of I. S. Shmelev, which, as the author of the work demonstrates, has a negative attitude towards the image of historical Russia, depicted in the writer's top works: "Praying Man" and " The Summer of the Lord." At pre-sent, there is a tendency of academic reduction of the religious (Orthodox) dominant idea of the late Shmelev in the modern studies of his work, which is motivated by the correction of "one-sidedness" in the works of non-Soviet researchers and their post-Soviet followers about the writer. The author analyzes the poetics of the writer, highlights the dominant concepts of this poetics. Although the article does not only review the writer's literary texts, it emphasizes that the Christian tradition, in which Shmelev's artistic work is rooted, does not manifest itself separately from his poetics (in the "worldview," journalistic, critical, epistolary texts), but does so in the poetics of his works of art. The poetics of the late Shmelev in the great time of Russian culture seems to contain the national image of the Russian world. It demonstrates how exactly artistic time and space in the writer's works are deeply connected with the fundamental categories of Orthodox consciousness.

TI  - Digital soil mapping with regression-Kriging and data from remote sensing
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of digital soil mapping allows obtaining quantitative information on soil distribution and functioning to provide alternatives for their management. The objective of this research is to perform the spatial prediction of soil properties through regression-kriging and serve as a basis for taking the necessary measures for a sustainable use of the resource. The study area is located in the wetland Cienaga de Chapala portion of Michoacan, Mexico. Soil sampling was systematic. In the laboratory, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, soluble cations calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium (Ca, K, Mg, Na), total nitrogen and pH were determined for each soil sample. The dependent variables were total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, organic carbon and pH. The independent variables are the Landsat 8 satellite bands. Regression-kriging was applied for spatial prediction. The experimental semivariogram fit with theoretical models was consistent for the four soil properties, because it was a systematic sampling design and the sample size was 297 points. The root mean square error of the electrical conductivity spatial prediction was 4 because it showed a coefficient of variation of 355. Soils are considered having from low to very low total nitrogen content (<0.15%). At least 30% of the soils have salinity problems because their electrical conductivity is greater than 1.1 dS m-1. Organic carbon contents are considered medium to high (>0.6%). The pH of the soils is moderately alkaline.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF SOIL AND VEGETATION IN THE VICINITY OF A MINING AND PROCESSING PLANT ON THE BASIS OF EARTH REMOTE-SENSING DATA
T2  - Vestnik Moskovskogo Universiteta Seriya 17 Pochvovedenie
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal variability of the vegetation index were investigated in the vicinity of the anthropogenic source of heavy metals. The analysis of the special points of the theoretical equation of the dependence of the concentration of photosynthetically active biomass on the resulting concentration of pollutants in the soil revealed the maximum permissible concentration of heavy metals in the soil. The results of its determination in the northern forest-steppe under the current level of anthropogenic pressure, according to MODIS materials, amounted to 12,3, according to Sentinel-2 - 12,5 mg/kg, respectively. A method for generalizing the macrokinetic patterns of the response of the living organisms to anthropogenic impact is proposed. The results of the environmental risk assessment showed that the probability of exceeding the threshold concentration is 74%. Based on the five-level quality scale and the indicator of soil state, the quality of soils and vegetation cover was ranked. The areas of the same resistance of soils and vegetation to the action of pollutants in the plant impact zone were mapped. Territories near the plant mostly correspond to the I and II categories of soil quality. The natural protection zone of the enterprise is allocated, and background territories are defined.
