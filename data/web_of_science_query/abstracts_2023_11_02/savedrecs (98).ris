TI  - Mathematical models used to inform study design or surveillance systems in infectious diseases: a systematic review
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Mathematical models offer the possibility to investigate the infectious disease dynamics over time and may help in informing design of studies. A systematic review was performed in order to determine to what extent mathematical models have been incorporated into the process of planning studies and hence inform study design for infectious diseases transmitted between humans and/or animals.Methods: We searched Ovid Medline and two trial registry platforms (Cochrane, WHO) using search terms related to infection, mathematical model, and study design from the earliest dates to October 2016. Eligible publications and registered trials included mathematical models (compartmental, individual-based, or Markov) which were described and used to inform the design of infectious disease studies. We extracted information about the investigated infection, population, model characteristics, and study design.Results: We identified 28 unique publications but no registered trials. Focusing on compartmental and individualbased models we found 12 observational/surveillance studies and 11 clinical trials. Infections studied were equally animal and human infectious diseases for the observational/surveillance studies, while all but one between humans for clinical trials. The mathematical models were used to inform, amongst other things, the required sample size (n = 16), the statistical power (n = 9), the frequency at which samples should be taken (n = 6), and from whom (n = 6).Conclusions: Despite the fact that mathematical models have been advocated to be used at the planning stage of studies or surveillance systems, they are used scarcely. With only one exception, the publications described theoretical studies, hence, not being utilised in real studies.

TI  - The interruption of <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> and <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> transmission by integrated chemotherapy in the Obongi focus, North Western Uganda
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - InterventionFew studies have documented the interruption of onchocerciasis and Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) by integrated chemotherapy in Uganda. The study describes the interruption of transmission of the two diseases co-endemic in Obongi focus, north western Uganda. Base line data for Onchocerciasis and LF were collected in 1994 and 2006, respectively. Annual mass drug administration for onchocerciasis (Ivermectin) and Lymphatic Filariasis (Ivermectin + albendazole) was conducted for 20 and 6 years, respectively. Thereafter, assessments by skin snip, larval searches in rivers and human landing catches were performed. Children <10 years were screened for IgG4 antibodies using Ov16 ELISA technique in 2013. LF Pre-TAS and TAS1 were conducted in sentinel sites. ITN coverage and utilization for the implementation unit was also reported.Intervention coverageOnchocerciasis treatment coverage was <80% but improved with the introduction of CDTI in 1999. While for LF, effective coverage of >65% was achieved in the six treatment rounds. Household ownership of ITN's and utilization was 96% and 72.4%., respectively.ImpactParasitological examinations conducted for onchocerciasis among 807 adults and children, revealed a reduction in mf prevalence from 58% in 1994 to 0% in 2012. Entomological monitoring conducted at the two sites had no single Simulium damnosum fly caught. Serological analysis using Ov16 ELISA for onchocerciasis revealed that out of the 3,308 children <10 years old screened in 2013, only 3/3308 (0.091%) positive cases were detected. All Ov16 positive children were negative when tested for patent infection by skin snip PCR. A reduction in LF microfilaria prevalence from 2.5% (n = 13/522) in 2006 to 0.0% (n = 602) in 2014 was observed. LF TAS1 conducted in 2015 among 1,532 children 6-7 years, all were negative for antigens of W. bancrofti.ConclusionThe results concluded that interruption of onchocerciasis and LF has been achieved.

TI  - Active SMS-based influenza vaccine safety surveillance in Australian children
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Australia's novel, active surveillance system, AusVaxSafety, monitors the post-market safety of vaccines in near real time. We analysed cumulative surveillance data for children aged 6 months to 4 years who received seasonal influenza vaccine in 2015 and/or 2016 to determine: adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) rates by vaccine brand, age and concomitant vaccine administration.Methods: Parent/carer reports of AEFI occurring within 3 days of their child receiving an influenza vaccine in sentinel immunisation clinics were solicited by Short Message Service (SMS) and/or email based survey. Retrospective data from 2 years were combined to examine specific AEFI rates, particularly fever and medical attendance as a proxy for serious adverse events (SAE), with and without concomitant vaccine administration. As trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) were funded in Australia's National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2015 and quadrivalent (QIV) in 2016, respectively, we compared their safety profiles.Results: 7402 children were included. Data were reported weekly through each vaccination season; no safety signals or excess of adverse events were detected. More children who received a concomitant vaccine had fever (7.5% versus 2.8%; p <.001). Meningococcal B vaccine was associated with the highest increase in AEFI rates among children receiving a specified concomitant vaccine: 30.3% reported an AEFI compared with 7.3% who received an influenza vaccine alone (p <.001). Reported fever was strongly associated with medical attendance (OR: 42.6; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 25.6-71.0). TIV and QIV safety profiles included low and expected AEFI rates (fever: 4.3% for TIV compared with 3.2% for QIV (p =.015); injection site reaction: 1.9% for TIV compared with 3.0% for QIV (p <.001)). There was no difference in safety profile between brands.Discussion: Active participant-reported data provided timely vaccine brand-specific safety information. Our surveillance system has particular utility in monitoring the safety of influenza vaccines, given that they may vary in composition annually. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using Multitemporal and Multispectral Airborne Lidar to Assess Depth of Peat Loss and Correspondence With a New Active Normalized Burn Ratio for Wildfires
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy of depth of burn (an indicator of consumption) in peatland soils using prefire and postfire airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data is determined within a wetland-upland forest environment near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. The relationship between peat soil burn depth and an "active" normalized burn ratio (ANBR) is also examined beneath partially and fully burned forest and understory canopies using state-of-the-art active reflectance from a multispectral lidar compared with normalized burn ratio (NBR) derived from Landsat 7 ETM+. We find significant correspondence between depth of burn, lidar-derived ANBR, and difference NBR (dNBR) from Landsat. However, low-resolution optical imagery excludes peatland burn losses in transition zones, which are highly sensitive to peat loss via combustion. The findings presented here illustrate the utility of this new remote sensing technology for expanding an area of research where it has previously been challenging to spatially detect and quantify such wildfire burn losses.

TI  - Analysis of the Diurnal Variation of the Global Electric Circuit Obtained From Different Numerical Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyzes different current source and conductivity parameterizations and their influence on the diurnal variation of the global electric circuit (GEC). The diurnal variations of the current source parameterizations obtained using electric field and conductivity measurements from plane overflights combined with global Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite data give generally good agreement with measured diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok, Antarctica, where reference experimental measurements are performed. An approach employing 85GHz passive microwave observations to infer currents within the GEC is compared and shows the best agreement in amplitude and phase with experimental measurements. To study the conductivity influence, GEC models solving the continuity equation in 3-D are used to calculate atmospheric resistance using yearly averaged conductivity obtained from the global circulation model Community Earth System Model (CESM). Then, using current source parameterization combining mean currents and global counts of electrified clouds, if the exponential conductivity is substituted by the conductivity from CESM, the peak to peak diurnal variation of the ionospheric potential of the GEC decreases from 24% to 20%. The main reason for the change is the presence of clouds while effects of Rn-222 ionization, aerosols, and topography are less pronounced. The simulated peak to peak diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok is increased from 15% to 18% from the diurnal variation of the global current in the GEC if conductivity from CESM is used.

TI  - Vertical Structure of Aerosols and Mineral Dust Over the Bay of Bengal From Multisatellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical distribution of aerosol and dust extinction coefficient over the Bay of Bengal is examined using the satellite observations (Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) for the period from 2006 to 2017. Distinct seasonal pattern is observed in the vertical structure of both aerosol and dust over the Bay of Bengal with an enhancement of 24% in the aerosol extinction above 1km from winter (December, January and February) to premonsoon (March, April, and May). Significant contribution of dust is observed over the northern Bay of Bengal during premonsoon season where 22% of the total aerosol extinction is contributed by dust aerosols transported from the nearby continental regions. During winter, dust transport is found to be less significant with fractional contribution of similar to 10%-13% to the total aerosol optical depth over the Bay of Bengal. MODIS-derived dust fraction (fine mode based) shows an overestimation up to twofold compared to CALIOP dust fraction (depolarization based), whereas the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport-simulated dust fraction underestimates the satellite-derived dust fractions over the Bay of Bengal. Though the long-term variation in dust aerosol showed a decreasing trend over the Bay of Bengal, the confidence level is insufficient in establishing the robustness of the observed trend. However, significant dust-induced heating is observed above the boundary layer during premonsoon season. This dust-induced elevated heating can affect the convection over the Bay of Bengal which will have implication on the monsoon dynamics over the Indian region.

TI  - Estimating Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> by Fusing Satellite and Station Observations: A Geo-Intelligent Deep Learning Approach
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing satellite observations and station measurements to estimate ground-level PM2.5 is promising for monitoring PM2.5 pollution. A geo-intelligent approach, which incorporates geographical correlation into an intelligent deep learning architecture, is developed to estimate PM2.5. Specifically, it considers geographical distance and spatiotemporally correlated PM2.5 in a deep belief network (denoted as Geoi-DBN). Geoi-DBN can capture the essential features associated with PM2.5 from latent factors. It was trained and tested with data from China in 2015. The results show that Geoi-DBN performs significantly better than the traditional neural network. The out-of-sample cross-validation R-2 increases from 0.42 to 0.88, and RMSE decreases from 29.96 to 13.03 mu g/m(3). On the basis of the derived PM(2.)5 distribution, it is predicted that over 80% of the Chinese population live in areas with an annual mean PM2.5 of greater than 35 mu g/m(3). This study provides a new perspective for air pollution monitoring in large geographic regions.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Smoke on Frontal Clouds and Precipitation During the 2002 Yakutsk Wildfires Using the WRF-Chem-SMOKE Model and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2002, an enormous amount of smoke has been emitted from Yakutsk wildfires. In this study, we examine the impact of smoke on cloud properties and precipitation associated with frontal systems using the WRF-Chem-SMOKE model and satellite data. The smoke emissions are computed using the fire radiative power technique. Smoke particles are represented as an internal mixture of organic matter (OM), black carbon (BC), and other inorganic matter, and their microphysical and radiative effects are explicitly modeled. After examining the fire activities, we identified two fire periods (FP1 and FP2). During FP1, in the cloud deck with the high cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), but the relatively small amount of ice nuclei (IN), the rain and snow water contents (RWC and SWC) were strongly reduced, because of suppressed collision-coalescence and riming processes. The cloud cells acquired the longer lifetime and traveled farther downwind. During FP2, in the cloud deck with relatively high CDNC and IN, RWC was reduced; however, the large amounts of IN triggered the glaciation indirect effect and leaded to increased SWC. Due to the competing effects of CDNC and IN, changes in the cloud lifetime were small. Consequently, smoke-induced changes in the total cloudiness cause a dipole feature. After the smoke was nearly consumed during FP1, the large-scale dynamics of the frontal system was altered by smoke. The onset of the precipitation was delayed by 1day. In FP2, the onset of the precipitation was not delayed but occurred at different locations, and the area-averaged precipitation was slightly reduced (similar to 0.5mm/day).

TI  - A Dynamic Enhancement With Background Reduction Algorithm: Overview and Application to Satellite-Based Dust Storm Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a Dynamic Enhancement Background Reduction Algorithm (DEBRA) applicable to multispectral satellite imaging radiometers. DEBRA uses ancillary information about the clear-sky background to reduce false detections of atmospheric parameters in complex scenes. Applied here to the detection of lofted dust, DEBRA enlists a surface emissivity database coupled with a climatological database of surface temperature to approximate the clear-sky equivalent signal for selected infrared-based multispectral dust detection tests. This background allows for suppression of false alarms caused by land surface features while retaining some ability to detect dust above those problematic surfaces. The algorithm is applicable to both day and nighttime observations and enables weighted combinations of dust detection tests. The results are provided quantitatively, as a detection confidence factor [0, 1], but are also readily visualized as enhanced imagery. Utilizing the DEBRA confidence factor as a scaling factor in false color red/green/blue imagery enables depiction of the targeted parameter in the context of the local meteorology and topography. In this way, the method holds utility to both automated clients and human analysts alike. Examples of DEBRA performance from notable dust storms and comparisons against other detection methods and independent observations are presented.Plain Language Summary A picture being worth a thousand words is not always a good thing. When a satellite picture of a complex environmental scene contains too much information, it can be hard to make sense of it all. Simple attempts to distill the information into colorful displays to enhance a certain feature of can be helpful, but sometimes they can do more harm than good. Problems arise when parts of ourthe image share properties with ourthe feature of interest, masquerading as false alarms and confusing our interpretation. This work attempts to reduce the chances of false alarms happening by accounting for them ahead of time. The Dynamic Enhancement Background Reduction Algorithm, applied in this paper to satellite-detected dust storms, accounts for land surfaces that "look like dust" under nondusty conditions and then adjusts the sensitivity of the detection tests accordingly. The result is a numerical gaugemeasure of our confidence in there being dust present. DEBRA can be communicated as simple, visually intuitive imagery where the only colors involved pertain to the feature of interest---the rest is portrayed as grayscale. The resulting picture may no longer be worth a thousand words, but its added utility to forecasters speaks volumes.

TI  - Developing an A Priori Database for Passive Microwave Snow Water Retrievals Over Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A physically optimized a priori database is developed for Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI) snow water retrievals over ocean. The initial snow water content profiles are derived from CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) measurements. A radiative transfer model in which the single-scattering properties of nonspherical snowflakes are based on the discrete dipole approximate results is employed to simulate brightness temperatures and their gradients. Snow water content profiles are then optimized through a one-dimensional variational (1D-Var) method. The standard deviations of the difference between observed and simulated brightness temperatures are in a similar magnitude to the observation errors defined for observation error covariance matrix after the 1D-Var optimization, indicating that this variational method is successful. This optimized database is applied in a Bayesian retrieval snow water algorithm. The retrieval results indicated that the 1D-Var approach has a positive impact on the GMI retrieved snow water content profiles by improving the physical consistency between snow water content profiles and observed brightness temperatures. Global distribution of snow water contents retrieved from the a priori database is compared with CloudSat CPR estimates. Results showed that the two estimates have a similar pattern of global distribution, and the difference of their global means is small. In addition, we investigate the impact of using physical parameters to subset the database on snow water retrievals. It is shown that using total precipitable water to subset the database with 1D-Var optimization is beneficial for snow water retrievals.

TI  - Protection of vaccinated mice against pneumonic tularemia is associated with an early memory sentinel-response in the lung
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Francisella tularensis is the intracellular bacterial pathogen causing the respiratory life-threatening disease tularemia. Development of tularemia vaccines has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the correlates of immunity. Moreover, the importance of lung cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection against tularemia is a controversial matter. Live attenuated vaccine strains of F. tularensis such as LVS (Live Vaccine Strain), elicit an immune response protecting mice against subsequent challenge with the virulent SchuS4 strain, yet the protective immunity against pulmonary challenge is limited in its efficacy and longevity. We established a murine intra-nasal immunization model which distinguishes between animals fully protected, challenged at 4 weeks post double-vaccination (200 inhalation Lethal Dose 50%, LD50, of SchuS4), and those which do not survive the lethal SchuS4 infection, challenged at 8 weeks post double vaccination. Early in the recall immune response in the lung (before day 3), disease progression and bacterial dissemination differed considerably between protected and non-protected immunized mice. Pre-challenge analysis, revealed that protected mice, exhibited significantly higher numbers of lung Ft-specific memory T cells compared to non-protected mice. Quantitative PCR analysis established that a higher magnitude, lung T cells response was activated in the lungs of the protected mice already at 24 h post-challenge. The data imply that an early memory response within the lung is strongly associated with protection against the lethal SchuS4 bacteria presumably by restricting the dissemination of the bacteria to internal organs. Thus, future prophylactic strategies to countermeasure F. tularensis infection may require modulation of the immune response within the lung. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal variations and spatial differentiation in the black alder and silver birch pollination pattern-the impact of local climate or something more?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous abiotic factors have an important impact on the phenology of woody plants with temperature as the main driver of their development. Furthermore, the biological factors connected with phenotypic plasticity and genetic heterogeneity might be the cause of differentiation in phenological response to abiotic factors. As objects of our study, we chose black alder and silver birch trees. The main aims of the study were to demonstrate the spatial and temporal diversity in the timing of Alnus glutinosa and Betula pendula pollination as well as to identify factors affecting these variations. We focused on abiotic factors such as thermal conditions: air and surface temperatures, within and between population variability. Phenological observations were carried out in Rzeszow (SE Poland) in a period of four years at over a dozen locations. Stands differed in their thermal conditions and prevalent land use types. The pollination pattern in the study area was presented against the background of local thermal conditions which were described by Land Surface Temperature (LST) and maximum daily air temperature. LST was estimated with a single-channel algorithm using satellite images obtained from Landsat 7 and 8. Our results showed great spatial and temporal diversity in the pollination pattern in the study area. Year-to-year variations in the B. pendula pollination pattern were less pronounced than in the case of A. glutinosa. The pollination pattern was strongly influenced by temperature before and during pollination. In the study area, the variability of LST was greater than that of air temperature but the relationships between the timing of pollination phenophases and LST or land use types were weak. It was observed that the same sites were similar in their pollination pattern - the timing of phenophases was 'accelerated' or 'delayed' during the whole study period. The same individuals were the first or the last that began to pollinate independently of the year. We concluded that despite the impact of temperature on A. glutinosa and B. pendula development, the phenotype of an individual tree might be as important for phenological variability as local climate.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of flooding, evaporation, and desiccation cycles and observations of salt crust area change at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bonneville Salt Flats (BSF) in Utah is a dynamic saline playa environment responding to natural and anthropogenic forces. Over the last century, the saline groundwater from below BSF has been harvested to produce potash via evaporative mining, mostly used as agricultural fertilizers, while the surface halite crust has provided a significant recreational site for land speed racing. Perceptions of changes in the salt crust through time have spurred debates about land use and management; however, little is known about the timescales of natural change as the salt crust responds to climatic parameters that drive flooding, evaporation, and desiccation (FED) cycles that control surface salt growth and dissolution. Climate data over the last similar to 30 years are examined to identify annual patterns in surface water balance at BSF to identify annual and seasonal climate constraints on FED cycles. Landsat satellite data from 1986 to the present are used to map the areal extent of the surface halite salt crust at BSF at the end of the desiccation season (between August 15 and October 30) annually. Overall, the observed area of the desiccation-stage BSF halite crust has varied from a maximum of 156 km(2) in 1993 to a minimum of 72 km2 in 2014 with an overall trend of declining area of halite observed over the similar to 30 years of analysis. Climatic variables that influence FED cycles and seasonal salt dissolution and precipitation have also varied through this time period; however, the relationship between surface water fluxes and salt crust area do not clearly correlate, suggesting that other processes are influencing the extent of the salt. Intra-annual analyses of salt area and weather illustrate the importance of ponded surface water, wind events, and microtopography in shaping a laterally extensive but thin and ephemeral halite crust. Examination of annual to decadal changes in salt crust extent and environmental parameters at BSF provides insights into the processes driving change and the sustainability of land use in this dynamic environment.

TI  - On the relationship between continuous measures of canopy greenness derived using near-surface remote sensing and satellite-derived vegetation products
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, satellite-derived estimates of biophysical variables have been increasingly used in operational services, requiring quantification of their accuracy and uncertainty. Evaluating satellite-derived vegetation products is challenging due to their moderate spatial resolution, the heterogeneity of the terrestrial landscape, and difficulties in adequately characterising spatial and temporal vegetation dynamics. In recent years, near-surface remote sensing has emerged as a potential source of data against which satellite-derived vegetation products can be evaluated. Several studies have focussed on the evaluation of satellite-derived phenological transition dates, however in most cases the shape and magnitude of the underlying time-series are neglected. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) derived using near-surface remote sensing and a range of vegetation products derived from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) throughout the growing season. Moderate to strong relationships between the GCC and vegetation products derived from MERIS were observed at deciduous forest sites. Weak relationships were observed over evergreen forest sites as a result of their subtle seasonality, which is likely masked by atmospheric, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and shadowing effects. Temporal inconsistencies were attributed to the oblique viewing geometry of the digital cameras and differences in the incorporated spectral bands. In addition, the commonly observed summer decline in GCC values was found to be primarily associated with seasonal variations in brown pigment concentration, and to a lesser extent illumination geometry. At deciduous sites, increased sensitivity to initial increases in canopy greenness was demonstrated by the GCC, making it particularly well-suited to identifying the start of season when compared to satellite-derived vegetation products. Nevertheless, in some cases, the relationship between the GCC and vegetation products derived from MERIS was found to saturate asymptotically. This limits the potential of the approach for evaluation of the vegetation products that underlie satellite-derived phenological transition dates, and for the continuous monitoring of vegetation during the growing season, particularly at medium to high biomass study sites.

TI  - Global satellite observations of column-averaged carbon dioxide and methane: The GHG-CCI XCO<sub>2</sub> and XCH<sub>4</sub> CRDP<sub>3</sub> data set
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the two most important greenhouse gases emitted by mankind. Better knowledge of the surface sources and sinks of these Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related carbon uptake and release processes is needed for important climate change related applications such as improved climate modelling and prediction. Some satellites provide near-surface-sensitive atmospheric CO2 and CH4 observations that can be used to obtain information on CQ(2) and CH4 surface fluxes. The goal of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) is to use satellite data to generate atmospheric CO2 and CH4 data products meeting demanding GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) greenhouse gas (GHG) ECV requirements. To achieve this, retrieval algorithms are regularly being improved followed by annual data reprocessing and analysis cycles to generate better products in terms of extended time series and continuously improved data quality. Here we present an overview about the latest GHG-CCI data set called Climate Research Data Package No.3 (CRDP3) focusing on the GHG-CCI core data products, which are column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4, i.e., XCO2 and XCH4, as retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO/GOSAT satellite radiances covering the time period end of 2002 to end of 2014. We present global maps and time series including initial validation results obtained by comparisons with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based observations. We show that the GCOS requirements for systematic error (<1 ppm for XCO2, <10 ppb for XCH4) and long-term stability (<0.2 ppm/year for XCO2, <2 ppb/year for XCH4) are met for nearly all products (an exception is SCIAMACHY methane especially since 2010). For XCO2 we present comparisons with global models using the output of two CO2 assimilation systems (MACC version 14r2 and CarbonTracker version CT2013B). We show that overall there is reasonable consistency and agreement between all data sets (within-1-2 ppm) but we also found significant differences depending on region and time period.

TI  - In-orbit performance of GNOS on-board FY3-C and the enhancements for FY3-D satellite
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite system Occultation Sounder (GNOS) instrument on each of the Fengyun 3 (FY3) series meteorology satellites is a global navigation satellite system radio occultation (RO) payload used for remote sensing of the earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. The GNOS, the world's first RO sounder compatible with both the BeiDou (BD) navigation satellite System (BDS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS), can observe around 700 (500 GPS + 200 BDS) RO events per day. This payload can receive BDS/GPS dual-frequency signals using the B1/B2 closed-loop (CL), GPS L2 semi-codeless, GPS L2C CL, GPS L1 C/A CL, and GPS L1 C/A open-loop (OL) tracking methods. This paper assesses the in-orbit performance of the Fengyun 3-C satellite (FY3-C) GNOS instrument, including the warm start time, the number of satellites tracked for positioning, carrier phase measurement errors, open-loop tracking performance, real-time navigation error analysis, the number and distribution of occultation events and Precise Orbit Determination (POD) error statistics, and illustrates the performances' results which shows the stability and feasibility of FY3-C GNOS. Moreover, the enhancements to be implemented on the Fengyun 3 D (FY3-D) satellite for a planned September 2017 launch include extended occultation channel numbers, open-loop tracking for both L2C and B1I carrier phases, and optimized antenna patterns.

TI  - Benchmarking of essential climate variables: Gamma index theory and results for surface albedo and aerosol optical depth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a benchmarking method for assessing the level of spatio-temporal variability of Essential Climate Variable (ECV) products against a reference taking into account acceptance criteria in terms of intensity and physical distance tolerances. This is based on a modified version of the gamma index that could be suitable for fitness-for-purpose assessment given that one can choose various criteria depending on applications.The method is first presented and then applied to both land and atmospheric ECVs. The terrestrial analysis concerns the global surface albedo, using monthly white-sky surface albedo in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave broadband spectral ranges at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees using three sources of products. The latter study is conducted using monthly aerosol optical depth (ADD) products at 550 nm at a spatial resolution of 1 with four different datasets at the global scale. The analysis shows how the values of the gamma criteria impact the spatial and temporal results.As an example, if the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) actual target measurements uncertainty is used as an acceptance criteria for the intensity tolerance the results show that: 1) the seasonal agreement for the surface albedo products varies over 20% to 40% of the terrestrial surface in the shortwave and near infrared broadband and from 10% to 30% in the visible one and 2) the three aerosols optical depth products agree with the reference one for over 50% of the land surface only when the tolerance distance term is at 224km.

TI  - Improvement and persistent disparities in completion lymph node dissection: Lessons from the National Cancer Database
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCompletion lymph node dissection (CLND) is recommended for melanoma patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB); however, 50% do not undergo CLND. We sought to determine CLND trends over time, and factors contributing to variability.MethodsThe NCDB was queried for patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE), with or without SLNB and CLND. Cohorts were created based on demographic/socioeconomic variables and era of treatment (Era 1: 2003-07, Era 2: 2008-12). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with performance of or trends in CLND.Results122849 underwent WLE with SLNB. Of 24267 (19.8%) with +SLNB, 13594 (56.0%) continued to CLND. In multivariate analyses, Medicaid (OR 0.78; P=0.04) or Medicare (OR 0.79; P<0.01) in Era 1 and patients without insurance in Era 2 (OR 0.78; P=0.01) underwent less CLND. In both eras, Blacks (OR 0.45; P<0.01, OR 0.59; P<0.01), head/neck lesions (OR 0.72; P<0.01, OR 0.66; P<0.01) and lower extremity lesions (OR 0.75; P<0.01, OR 0.72; P<0.01) underwent less CLND. However, Blacks experienced greatest increase in CLND usage (+9.2%).ConclusionsCLND usage continues to be low and racial/socioeconomic disparities persist. Until the results of MSLT-2 become available, continued focus on understanding poor adherence to, and improving rates of CLND is necessary.

TI  - The natural history of thin melanoma and the utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesCurrent literature may overestimate the risk of nodal metastasis from thin melanoma due to reporting of data only from lesions treated with SLNB. Our objective was to define the natural history of thin melanoma, assessing the likelihood of nodal disease, in order to guide selection for SLNB.MethodsRetrospective review. The primary outcome was the rate of nodal disease. Clinicopathologic factors were evaluated to find associations with nodal disease.ResultsFive hundred and twelve lesions, follow up available for 488 (median: 48 months). Lesions treated with WLE/SLNB compared to WLE alone were more likely to have high-risk features. The rate of nodal disease was higher in the WLE/SLNB group (24 positive SLNB, five false-negative SLNB with nodal recurrence: 10.2%) compared to WLE alone (four nodal recurrences: 2.0%). Univariate analysis showed age 45, Breslow depth 0.85mm, mitotic rate >1mm(2), and ulceration were associated with nodal disease. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of age 45 and ulceration.ConclusionsSLNB for melanoma 0.75-0.99mm should be considered in patients age 45, Breslow depth 0.85mm, mitotic rate >1mm(2), and/or with ulceration. Thin melanoma <0.85mm without high-risk features may be treated with WLE alone.

TI  - Amazonian flood impacts on managed Brazilnut stands along Brazil's Madeira River: A sustainable forest management system threatened by climate change
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact of flooding on tropical forest ecosystems and their management is a little-studied area that is expected to become increasingly important under projected climate change. A demonstration of this was provided by the record-breaking 2014 flood of the Madeira River in Brazil. We assessed factors affecting survival of Brazilnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) under root asphyxia caused by flooding in the Lago do Capana Grande Extractive Reserve in Manicore municipality (county), Amazonas state, Brazil. Mortality was surveyed in three Brazilnut groves (castanhais) in 680 individual Brazilnut trees of which 357 had been exposed to flooding and 200 had been flooded for at least 83 days, which was the threshold for mortality effects. Trees were georeferenced and measured for DBH and the height above the ground of the flood-water mark. This information, together with topography from satellite data and water levels from hydrographic gauges, allowed calculation of the time each tree was flooded. None of the 323 unflooded trees died. The analysis indicates a relationship between mortality and duration of root asphyxia, killing 17% of the individuals exposed to flooding and 35% of the individuals that were flooded for periods greater than 109 days. Nevertheless, survival exceeded 50% for all flooding durations. The data suggest that larger trees have a greater probability of mortality for any given period of asphyxia. Expected increases in extreme flood events threaten a sustainable forest management system based on harvest of non-timber products.

TI  - Seasonality of albedo and FAPAR in a boreal forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are continuously used to monitor albedo and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), which are key components in determining the energy balance and productivity of forests. However, due to the mismatch between spatial resolution of the satellite data and forest stand size, coarse resolution satellite products cannot capture the fine-scale variations in forest structure. Therefore, forest radiation budget models are important tools in quantifying albedo and FAPAR at stand scale. However, due to the lack of suitable input data, simulations are often restricted to summer conditions only and the seasonal patterns are not considered. We modeled the time series of albedo and FAPAR for an entire growing season for 20 forest plots in the boreal zone in Finland (61 degrees 50' N, 24 degrees 17' E) using an exceptional ground reference data set. Canopy gap fractions and the spectra of forest floor were monitored in the plots throughout the growing season. Data on the seasonality of spectra of tree foliage were also available. The modeled albedo and FAPAR were upscaled and compared against albedo and FAPAR derived from MODIS satellite data. We showed that forest radiation budget models capable of adequately taking into account foliage clumping and its effects on multiple scattering are the most appropriate for simulating albedo of boreal coniferous forests. Our results also indicated negative albedoproductivity relations in boreal coniferous forests. In addition, we demonstrated that not only the overall level, but also the seasonal patterns of albedo and FAPAR differ between tree species. Therefore, the use of only peak growing season albedo or FAPAR values when estimating climate impacts of forest management can be misleading.

TI  - Yardang geometries in the Qaidam Basin and their controlling factors
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperarid Qaidam Basin features extensive fields of yardangs (covering an area of similar to 40,000km(2)) sculpted in tectonically folded sedimentary rocks. We extracted the geometries of 16,749 yardangs, such as length-to-width ratio (L/W), spatial density, and spacing, from multi-source remote sensing data provided by Google Earth (TM). We classified the yardangs into four types based on their L/W: short-axis (1-2), whale-back (2-6), hogsback (6-10) and long-ridge (10 210). We interpreted the yardang geometries in the context of their geologic setting (bedding orientation, location along anticline crests or syncline troughs, and lithologic heterogeneity). Our results show that the yardang geometries in the Qaidam Basin are mainly controlled by the structural geology and rheology of the sedimentary rocks (e.g., strike and dip of bedding, the presence or absence of interbedded soft and hard beds, and structural position with folds), the angle between geomorphically-effective wind directions and the strike of bedding, and the relative cumulative wind shear force where two geomorphically-effective wind directions are present. Our analysis revealed the following: 1) nearly 69% of the yardangs with long-ridge and hogsback geometries are distributed in syncline areas whereas 73% of the yardangs with short-axis geometries are distributed in anticline areas; 2) the L/W ratio of yardangs exposed along the windward limbs of anticlines is lower than that of yardangs exposed along the leeward limbs; and 3) in the westernmost parts of the basin, yardangs are locally sculpted into mounds by two geomorphically-effective wind directions.

TI  - An improved optical classification scheme for the Ocean Colour Essential Climate Variable and its applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) has produced a climate-quality, error characterised, dataset of ocean-colour products (a designated Essential Climate Variable or 'ECV'). The OC-CCI project uses an optical classification scheme based on fuzzy logic (Moore et al. 2001), to assign product uncertainties on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In this study we show that the pre-existing set of optical water classes derived from in-water remote-sensing reflectance data are insufficient to classify all R-rs spectra present in satellite data at the global scale, particularly in oligotrophic regions. We generate a new set of optical water classes from millions of satellite-derived ocean-colour spectra, providing an improvement in distribution of cumulative class membership values. The use of these classes for uncertainty assignment are demonstrated for chlorophyll-a, utilising a large in situ database of measurements. In addition to being used for uncertainty assignment, performance of multiple chlorophyll algorithms is assessed within each of the classes and a method for blending algorithms while avoiding sharp boundaries, in order to improve final product quality, using class membership is illustrated.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of satellite-based high-resolution yield estimation: A test of multiple scalable approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast, accurate and inexpensive estimates of crop yields at the field scale are useful for many applications. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we recently developed a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that integrates crop simulations with satellite imagery and gridded weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates for multiple crops in different regions. Existing versions of SCYM typically capture one-third to half of the variation in reported county-scale yields. Using rainfed maize in the US Midwest as an example, this study tested multiple approaches for improving SCYM's accuracy, including (i) calibrating the phenology parameters of the crop model (APSIM) used to generate training samples for SCYM; (ii) using an ensemble of three crop models (APSIM-Maize, CERES-Maize, and Hybrid-Maize) instead of a single model; (iii) using simulated biomass from the crop models instead of simulated yields to train SCYM, with the former assuming a constant harvest index (HI). Results show substantial improvement in performance, as assessed using reported county yields by USDA-NASS, both from calibrating APSIM phenology parameters and from training SCYM on simulated biomass rather than yields. Using a multi-model ensemble further improves SCYM, although the benefit is limited. The proposed preferred version of SCYM on average captures 75% of the yield variation for 2001-2015 in the 31 states (i.e. Illinois, Indiana and Iowa) where SCYM is trained, with RMSE typically less than 1 t/ha, and explains 41% to 83% of multi-year yield variations when tested across nine Midwestern US states for 2008-2015. This level of accuracy is particularly notable given that only data from 2014 were used to calibrate phenology parameters. The yield estimates for multiple years in multiple states utilized 1184 Landsat tiles, but could be completed in about 2 h per year by using the GEE platform. All approaches tested in this study do not require any site-specific measurements, and thus can be readily extended to other regions and crops.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Europe, climate trends are expected to be characterized by an increase in temperatures and less water availability. Analyzing the role of structural factors and the influence of a changing climate provides insights into the evolution of forest ecosystems in regions with similar environmental conditions. The Mediterranean fringe of the Iberian Peninsula is of particular interest due to its diverse topo climatic conditions and the increase in drought episodes during the last decades. This work studies forest dynamics in large areas of this geographical region by analyzing nine forest transitions. Vegetation covers were classified from three Landsat scenes for the period 1987-2012, and sub-periods 1987-2002 and 2002-2012. Conditions were described by topography derived variables, human factors and drought-occurrence variables. Boosted regression trees were used to identify the most important variables and describe the relationships between the forest dynamics and key factors. Variables such as solar radiation, topographic wetness index and tolerance to drought have been shown to be key factors in forest succession and when comparisons are made between vegetation groups. Main findings: The transition rate to Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean broadleaf forests has increased during the analyzed period, while the transition rate to coniferous forests has decreased; Transitions to Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean broadleaf forests are positively associated with drought occurrence while transitions to conifers are negatively affected by drought; Transitions from shrublands to forest stages are more vulnerable to factors controlling water availability; Important interactions between topography derived variables and drought have been found. The study provides robust evidence that drought occurrence plays an important role in the decline of conifers and the expansion of broadleaves, which could become the dominant species in many areas of the Mediterranean if climate model forecasts are met.

TI  - Benchmarking CMIP5 models with a subset of ESA CCI Phase 2 data using the ESMValTool
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is now moving into its sixth phase and aims at a more routine evaluation of the models as soon as the model output is published to the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). To meet this goal the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the systematic evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP, has been developed and a first version (1.0) released as open source software in 2015. Here, an enhanced version of the ESMValTool is presented that exploits a subset of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Phase 2 and this version is used to demonstrate the value of the data for model evaluation. This subset includes consistent, long-term time series of ECVs obtained from harmonized, reprocessed products from different satellite instruments for sea surface temperature, sea ice, cloud, soil moisture, land cover, aerosol, ozone, and greenhouse gases. The ESA CCI data allow 'extending the calculation of performance metrics as summary statistics for some variables and add an important alternative data set in other cases where observations are already available. The provision of uncertainty estimates on a per grid basis for the ESA CCI data sets is used in a new extended version of the Taylor diagram and provides important additional information for a more objective evaluation of the models. In our analysis we place a specific focus on the comparability of model and satellite data both in time and space. The ESA CCI data are well suited for an evaluation of results from global climate models across ESM compartments as well as an analysis of long-term trends, variability and change in the context of a changing climate. The enhanced version of the ESMValTool is released as open source software and ready to support routine model evaluation in CMIP6 and at individual modeling centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Detecting and attributing vegetation changes on China's Loess Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Attributing vegetation changes can provide fundamental information for environmental resources management, especially for those regions with vulnerable ecosystems. The vegetation on China's Loess Plateau has been reported to be greatly changed especially due to the Grain for Green Program launched in 1999; however, its attribution has rarely been quantitatively investigated. This study analyzed the temporal changes in vegetation coverage in terms of Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over 1982-2015, introduced topographical factors to interpret the spatial patterns of vegetation, and quantified the contributions of human activities to vegetation changes. Vegetation greening trend exhibits in the southeast part, and the greening rates over 2000-2015 are greater than those for 1982-1999. The overall spatial pattern does not change much; however, the low-value NDVI is moving to higher elevations while the high-value NDVI to lower elevations, and most types of NDVI to smaller slopes. Climate variability and human activities both contribute to vegetation change, among which human activities account for 55% of vegetation changes over 2000-2015 for the whole study area.

TI  - The surface urban heat island response to urban expansion: A panel analysis for the conterminous United States
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI), the phenomenon that urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas, has significant socioeconomic and environmental impacts. With current and anticipated rapid urbanization, improved understanding of the response of UHI to urbanization is important for developing effective adaptation measures and mitigation strategies. Current studies mainly focus on a single or a few big cities and knowledge on the response of UHI to urbanization for large areas is limited. As a major indicator of urbanization, urban area size lends itself well for representation in prognostic models. However, we have little knowledge on how UHI responds to urban area size increase and its spatial and temporal variation over large areas. In this study, we investigated the relationship between surface UHI (SUHI) and urban area size in the climate and ecological context, and its spatial and temporal variations, based on a panel analysis of about 5000 urban areas of 10 km(2) or larger, in the conterminous U.S. We found statistically significant positive relationship between SUHI and urban area size, and doubling the urban area size led to a SUHI increase as high as 0.7 degrees C. The response of SUHI to the increase of urban area size shows spatial and temporal variations, with stronger SUHI increase in Northern U.S., and during daytime and summer. Urban area size alone can explain as much as 87% of the variance of SUHI among cities studied, but with large spatial and temporal variations. Urban area size shows higher association with SUHI in regions where the thermal characteristics of land cover surrounding the urban area are more homogeneous, such as in Eastern U.S., and in the summer months. This study provides a practical approach for large-scale assessment and modeling of the impact of urbanization on SUHI, both spatially and temporally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterizing spatiotemporal dynamics in phenology of urban ecosystems based on Landsat data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal phenology of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon cycle and ecosystem productivity. In urban environments, vegetation phenology is also important because of its influence on public health (e.g., allergies), and energy demand (e.g. cooling effects). In this study, we studied the potential use of remotely sensed observations (i.e. Landsat data) to derive some phenology indicators for vegetation embedded within the urban core domains in four distinctly different U.S. regions (Washington, D.C., King County in Washington, Polk County in Iowa, and Baltimore City and County in Maryland) during the past three decades. We used all available Landsat observations (circa 3000 scenes) from 1982 to 2015 and a self-adjusting double logistic model to detect and quantify the annual change of vegetation phenophases, i.e. indicators of seasonal changes in vegetation. The proposed model can capture and quantify not only phenophases of dense vegetation in rural areas, but also those of mixed vegetation in urban core domains. The derived phenology indicators show a good agreement with similar indicators derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in situ observations, suggesting that the phenology dynamic depicted by the proposed model is reliable. The vegetation phenology and its seasonal and interannual dynamics demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern in urban domains with an earlier (9-14 days) start-of-season (SOS) and a later (13-20 days) end-of-season (EOS), resulting in an extended (5-30 days) growing season length (GSL) when compared to the surrounding suburban and rural areas in the four study regions. There is a general long-term trend of decreasing SOS (-0.30 day per year), and increasing EOS and GSL (0.50 and 0.90 day per year, respectively) over past three decades for these study regions. The magnitude of these trends varies among the four urban systems due to their diverse local climate conditions, vegetation types, and different urban-rural settings. The Landsat derived phenology information for urban domains provides more details when compared to the coarse-resolution datasets such as MODIS, thus improves our understanding of human-natural systems interactions (or feedbacks) in urban domains. Such information is very valuable for urban planning in light of rapid urbanization and expansion of major metropolitans at the national and global levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - MRGPRX2 is essential for sinomenine hydrochloride induced anaphylactoid reactions
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells are unique immunocytes that function as sentinel cells in host defense reactions such as immediate hypersensitivity responses and anaphylactic responses. The mast cell specific receptor MRGPRX2 (Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2) triggers mast cell degranulation-a key process in anaphylactic reactions. We sought to better understand anaphylactic reaction induced by sinomenine hydrochloride (SH). MRGPRX2-related pseudo-allergic reactions induced by SH were investigated using the hindpaw swelling and extravasation assay in vivo and mast cell degranulation assays in vitro. MrgprB2 knockout mice exhibit a reduced SH-induced inflammation effect. Furthermore, MRGPRX2 (the orthologous gene of MrgprB2) related human mast cells are activated by SH in a dose-dependent manner; however, MRGPRX2 knockdown mast cells showed reduced degranulation. The results showed a kind of mechanism that SH-induced anaphylactoid reactions were mediated by MRGPRX2 via activating PLC molecular signaling pathways to provoke mast cells Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation.

TI  - Vicarious radiometric calibration/validation of Landsat-8 operational land imager using a ground reflected radiance-based approach with Baotou site in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration of the Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) sensor is a key step that enables additional quantitative research and application of the data. This study introduces a ground reflected radiance-based approach to vicarious radiometric validate the Landsat-8 OLI onboard radiometric calibration results. Vicarious radiometric calibration/validation field campaign of the Landsat-8 OLI sensor was carried out at the Baotou site in Inner Mongolia, China, on March 27, 2015, October 28, 2015, March 29, 2016, and April 21, 2016. The relative errors of the OLI bands are within 5% for the ground reflected radiance-based approach when compared with satellite observations of top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance in the OLI bands, and the average 1 sigma standard deviation of the four results using the vicarious radiometric calibration is less than 0.025. A well-calibrated Terra MODIS sensor was used to cross-validate the Landsat-8 OLI sensor, and the relative errors are within 10%. The results suggest that the OLI onboard the Landsat-8 satellite displays stable radiometric performance for the four calibration/validation days. An uncertainty analysis of the ground reflected radiance-based approach showed an overall uncertainty of less than 4.5%, taking into account uncertainty sources, including surface characteristics, atmospheric characteristics, radiative transfer, solar irradiance, and the calibration model.

TI  - Marine debris boost in juvenile Magellanic penguins stranded in south-eastern Brazil in less than a decade: Insights into feeding habits and habitat use
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a marine sentinel for the southern Atlantic Ocean that is a proxy of environmental quality. The presence of marine debris (macro-debris) in the stomach contents of emaciated juvenile penguins stranded from 21 degrees S to 23 degrees S was compared at different times (2000 and 2008), and the debris ingestion pathway was determined. The frequency of marine debris in the stomachs doubled in less than a decade, and flexible plastics remained the main ingested item over time (68-70%). The pelagic octopus, Argonauta nodosa, which inhabits the sea surface, was the most important prey species recovered in the stomach contents. The poor physical condition of the penguins that reach the northern migration limit (study area) reduces the diving capacity of the animals and increases their vulnerability to debris ingestion. Considering their preferred prey and physical condition, we conclude that the penguins likely ingested the marine debris in surface waters.

TI  - Assessing the fitness-for-purpose of satellite multi-mission ocean color climate data records: A protocol applied to OC-CCI chlorophyll-<i>a</i> data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, trend estimates are used as indicators to compare the multi-annual variability of different satellite chlorophyll-a (Chla) data and to assess the fitness-for-purpose of multi-mission Chia products as climate data records (CDR). Under the assumption that single-mission products are free from spurious temporal artifacts and can be used as benchmark time series, multi-mission CDRs should reproduce the main trend patterns observed by single-mission series when computed over their respective periods. This study introduces and applies quantitative metrics to compare trend distributions from different data records. First, contingency matrices compare the trend diagnostics associated with two satellite products when expressed in binary categories such as existence, significance and signs of trends. Contingency matrices can be further summarized by metrics such as Cohen's is index that rates the overall agreement between the two distributions of diagnostics. A more quantitative measure of the discrepancies between trends is provided by the distributions of differences between trend slopes. Thirdly, maps of the level of significance P of a t-test quantifying the degree to which two trend estimates differ provide a statistical, spatially-resolved, evaluation. The proposed methodology is applied to the multi-mission Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OCCCI) Chla data. The agreement between trend distributions associated with OC-CCI data and single-mission products usually appears as good as when single-mission products are compared. As the period of analysis is extended beyond 2012 to 2015, the level of agreement tends to be degraded, which might be at least partly due to the aging of the MODIS sensor on-board Aqua. On the other hand, the trends displayed by the OC-CCI series over the short period 2012-2015 are very consistent with those observed with VIIRS. These results overall suggest that the OC-CCI Chla data can be used for multi-annual time series analysis (including trend detection), but with some caution required if recent years are included, particularly in the central tropical Pacific. The study also recalls the challenges associated with creating a multi-mission ocean color data record suitable for climate research. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Estimating Spring Terminus Submarine Melt Rates at a Greenlandic Tidewater Glacier Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic forcing of the Greenland Ice Sheet is believed to promote widespread thinning at tidewater glaciers, with submarine melting proposed as a potential trigger of increased glacier calving, retreat, and subsequent acceleration. The precise mechanism(s) driving glacier instability, however, remain poorly understood, and while increasing evidence points to the importance of submarine melting, estimates of melt rates are uncertain. Here we estimate submarine melt rate by examining freeboard changes in the seasonal ice tongue of Kangiata Nunaata Sermia (KNS) at the head of Kangersuneq Fjord (KF), southwest Greenland. We calculate melt rates for March and May 2013 by differencing along-fjord surface elevation, derived from high-resolution TanDEM-X digital elevation models (DEMs), in combination with ice velocities derived from offset tracking applied to TerraSAR-X imagery. Estimated steady state melt rates reach up to 1.4 +/- 0.5m d(-1) near the glacier grounding line, with mean values of up to 0.8 +/- 0.3 and 0.7 +/- 0.3m d(-1) for the eastern and western parts of the ice tongue, respectively. Melt rates decrease with distance from the ice front and vary across the fjord. This methodology reveals spatio-temporal variations in submarine melt rates (SMRs) at tidewater glaciers which develop floating termini, and can be used to improve our understanding of ice-ocean interactions and submarine melting in glacial fjords.

TI  - Retrieving vegetation canopy water content from hyperspectral thermal measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of vegetation canopy water content using thermal hyperspectral (TIR, 8-14 mu m) measurements is investigated in this study. Vegetation water content indicators such as fuel moisture content (FMC, %, mass based) and equivalent water thickness (EWT, g cm(-2), area based) play significant roles in plant physiology, as well as in the modelling of fire risk and behavior, particularly in forests. Although retrieval of these parameters, in particular EWT, has been demonstrated from optical and TIR measurements, to our knowledge their prediction at canopy level in the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the application of hyperspectral TIR data for predicting FMC and EWT parameters at canopy level is explored here. The emissivity of spectral data in the TIR region is measured for four species (Azalea japonica, Buxus sempervirens, Euonymus japonicus, and Ficus benjamina) under controlled laboratory conditions, using a portable MIDAC Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. EWT, FMC, and their corresponding canopy emissivity measurements are assessed by destructive sampling of the leaves. Leaf area, as well as fresh and dry mass of the harvested leaves, is determined for all four species. Partial least square regression and artificial neural networks, using various spectral subsets, are used to predict the two variables of interest. Higher estimation accuracies have been obtained for both FMC and EWT at canopy level using artificial neural networks. Unexpectedly, the FMC at canopy level, as a mass-based variable, more accurately retrieved using either method. This is contrary to previous findings using multispectral and hyperspectral data. Our results suggest that plant mass may play a greater role in determining spectral emissivity than plant area does.

TI  - Stratification and sample allocation for reference burned area data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical estimation protocols are one of the key means to ensure that independent and objective information on product accuracy is communicated to end-users. Methods for validating burned area products have been developed based on a probability sample of a space by time partitioning of the population. We extend this basic methodology to improve stratification and sample allocation, key elements of a sampling design used to collect burned area reference data. We developed and evaluated an approach to partition each year and biome into low and high burned area (BA) strata. Because the threshold used to separate the sampling units into low and high BA can vary by year and biome, this approach offers a more targeted stratification than used in previous studies for which a common threshold was applied to all biomes. A hypothetical population of validation data was then used to quantitatively compare the precision of accuracy estimates derived from different stratification and sample size allocation options. We evaluated two options that had been previously examined in the BA validation literature, and extended previous studies by adding two new options specifically developed for ratio estimates. Stratification based on mapped BA reduced standard errors of the global burned area accuracy estimates from one-half to one-eighth relative to standard errors of simple random sampling. Stratifying by mapped BA was also found to reduce standard errors of accuracy estimates for most year by biome strata indicating that this advantage of stratification and sample allocation applies generally to a range of conditions (i.e., biomes and years).The most precise estimates were obtained using a sample size per stratum allocation n(h) proportional to N-h root(BA(h)) over bar where N-h is the number of units in stratum h and (BA(h)) over bar is the mean mapped BA for stratum h. The best sampling design from our analyses was then used to select a set of 1,000 samples from a hypothetical population of validation data and confidence intervals were computed for each sample. Close to 95% of these confidence intervals contained the true population value thus confirming the validity of confidence intervals produced from the estimates and standard errors.

TI  - Error sources and guidelines for quality assessment of glacier area, elevation change, and velocity products derived from satellite data in the Glaciers_cci project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide a large range of information on glacier dynamics and changes. Results are often reported, provided and used without consideration of measurement accuracy (difference to a true value) and precision (variability of independent assessments). Whereas accuracy might be difficult to determine due to the limited availability of appropriate reference data and the complimentary nature of satellite measurements, precision can be obtained from a large range of measures with a variable effort for determination. This study provides a systematic overview on the factors influencing accuracy and precision of glacier area, elevation change (from altimetry and DEM differencing), and velocity products derived from satellite data, along with measures for calculating them. A tiered list of recommendations is provided (sorted for effort from Level 0 to 3) as a guide for analysts to apply what is possible given the datasets used and available to them. The more simple measures to describe product quality (Levels 0 and 1) can often easily be applied and should thus always be reported. Medium efforts (Level 2) require additional work but provide a more realistic assessment of product precision. Real accuracy assessment (Level 3) requires independent and coincidently acquired reference data with high accuracy. However, these are rarely available and their transformation into an unbiased source of information is challenging. This overview is based on the experiences and lessons learned in the ESA project Glaciers_cci rather than a review of the literature.

TI  - Synergistic use of Landsat 8 OLI image and airborne LiDAR data for above-ground biomass estimation in tropical lowland rainforests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing a robust and cost-effective method for accurately estimating tropical forest's carbon pool over large area is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +). This study aims at examining the independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to accurately estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of primary tropical rainforests in Sabah, Malaysia. Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r = -0.411 to -0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r = 0.366-0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data. The results showed that the model based on a combination of the two remote sensing data achieved the highest accuracy (R-adj(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 17.36%) whereas the models using Landsat 8 OLI data airborne LiDAR data independently obtained the moderate accuracy (R-adj(2) = 0.52, RMSE = 24.22% and R-adj(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 25.25%, respectively). Our study indicated that texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data provided useful information for AGB estimation and synergistic use of Landsat 8 OLI and airborne LiDAR data could improve the AGB estimation of primary tropical rainforest.

TI  - The impact of fire on sand dune stability: Surface coverage and biomass recovery after fires on Western Australian coastal dune systems from 1988 to 2016
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to determine the common response of coastal sand dunes in Western Australia (WA) to fire on decadal time-scales, in terms of ecological-geomorphic-climatic interactions to test the hypothesis that fire plays a role in coastal dune destabilisation. Fires are commonly suggested to have contributed to widespread dune reactivation in Australia and globally, a hypothesis that is relatively untested. We used data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager missions to monitor changes in surface coverage on coastal sand dunes in south-west WA after fires. We analysed 31 fire scars from 1988 to 2016 in two Landsat scenes on the west and south coast of WA. Recovery ratios derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to monitor patterns in post-fire biomass and surface cover. Recovery ratios are correlated with indices of bum severity, and meteorological data to investigate relationships. We also used Maximum Likelihood Classification to monitor changes in bare sand area. Results suggest that recovery followed a strongly consistent pattern, and is characterised by rapid vegetation cover re-establishment within six to twelve months. Prior to this, some aeolian activity may have occurred but without substantial surface changes. Initial germination and/or resprouting were followed by steady growth up to seven years, where NDVI typically neared pre-fire values. Some variation in early recovery occurred between the west and south coast, possibly owing to relative proportions of reseeding and resprouting plants. A log regression explained 75% of the recovery pattern (79% on the south coast). Precipitation had some ability to explain recovery up to nine months post-fire (r(2) = 029 to 0.54). No relationships were observed between estimates of bum severity and recovery. After nine months, the biggest cause of spatial variation in recovery was the pre-fire community composition and related seedbank or resprouting density. Image classification did not identify any new blowout features except where fires were not the primary cause. Results suggest that fires are not presently contributing to the destabilisation of coastal dunes in south-west WA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High resolution stream water quality assessment in the Vancouver, British Columbia region: a citizen science study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing land cover and climate regimes modify water quantity and quality in natural stream systems. In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-mresolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term dynamics of a floodplain shallow lake in the Pantanal wetland: Is it all about climate?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological variability over seasonal and multi-annual timescales strongly shapes the ecological structure and functioning of floodplain ecosystems. The current IPCC climate scenario foresees an increase in the frequency of extreme events. This, in conjunction with other anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., river regulation or land-use changes) poses a serious threat to the natural functioning of these ecosystems. In this study we aimed to i) evaluate the long-term variability of the flooded area of the third largest floodplain lake in the Brazilian Pantanal using remote sensing techniques, and ii) analyze the possible factors influencing this variability. Changes in open-water and riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation areas were mapped by applying an ad hoc-developed remote-sensing method (including a newly developed normalized water index, NWI) to 221 Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, acquired between 1984 and 2011. Added to the lake's natural swing between riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation expansion and retraction, our analyses revealed large interannual changes, grouped into three main periods within the studied time interval. Moreover, our results indicate that this floodplain-lake system is losing open-water area, paired with an increase in riparian flood-plain- wetland vegetation. The system's long-term dynamics are not all climate related, but are the result of a combination of drivers. The start of the Manso dam's operation upstream of the studied system, and the subsequent river regulation because of the dam operation, coupled with climatic oscillation appear to be responsible for the observed changes. However, other factors which were not considered in this study might also be important in this process and contributing to the reduction of the system's resilience to droughts (e.g., land-use changes). This study illustrates the serious conservation risks that the Pantanal faces in the near future, given the current climate-change scenario and the accumulation of dam building projects in this region.

TI  - Beyond Antigenic Match: Possible Agent-Host and Immuno-epidemiological Influences on Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness During the 2015-2016 Season in Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Vaccine effectiveness estimates for 2015-2016 seasonal influenza vaccine are reported from Canada. Findings suggest that agent-host and immuno-epidemiologic factors beyond antigenic match-including viral genomic variation, birth (immunological) cohort effects, repeat vaccination, and potential within-season waning immunity-may influence vaccine performance.Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for 2015-2016 seasonal influenza vaccine are reported from Canada's Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN). This season was characterized by a delayed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) epidemic and concurrent influenza B(Victoria) virus activity. Potential influences on VE beyond antigenic match are explored, including viral genomic variation, birth cohort effects, prior vaccination, and epidemic period.Methods. VE was estimated by a test-negative design comparing the adjusted odds ratio for influenza test positivity among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated participants. Vaccine-virus relatedness was assessed by gene sequencing and hemagglutination inhibition assay.Results. Analyses included 596 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 305 B(Victoria) cases and 926 test-negative controls. A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were considered antigenically related to vaccine (unchanged since 2009), despite phylogenetic clustering within emerging clade 6B.1. The adjusted VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-57%). Compared to other age groups, VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower for adults born during 1957-1976 (25%; 95% CI, -16%-51%). The VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was also lower for participants consecutively vaccinated during both the current and prior seasons (41%; 95% CI, 18%-57%) than for those vaccinated during the current season only (75%; 95% CI, 45%-88%), and the VE among participants presenting in March-April 2016 (19%; 95% CI, -15%-44%) was lower than that among those presenting during January-February 2016 (62%; 95% CI, 44%-74%). The adjusted VE for B(Victoria) viruses was 54% (95% CI, 32%-68%), despite lineage-level mismatch to B(Yamagata) vaccine. The further variation in VE as observed for A(H1N1)pdm09 was not observed for B(Victoria).Conclusions. Influenza VE findings may require consideration of other agent-host and immuno-epidemiologic influences on vaccine performance beyond antigenic match, including viral genomic variation, repeat vaccination, birth (immunological) cohort effects, and potential within-season waning of vaccine protection.

TI  - Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) using copper-enriched oxygen carriers supported on fly ash
T2  - FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An experimental investigation on chemical activity and stability of innovative CuO-based oxygen carriers (OC) supported on coal fly ash, towards Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) and Chemical Looping Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) is presented. The materials were prepared by granulation of fine powders of CuO and fly ash (FA), with 40-60-80 wt% CuO loading (Cu4OFA, Cu6OFA and Cu8OFA), using a high shear granulator. CLC and CLOU activities were investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the presence of a reactive fuel or an inert atmosphere, respectively. A rather stable CLOU capacity (Ro-CLOU) in the range of 4-8 g O-2/100 g OC was found over 42 redox cycles, in agreement with the stoichiometry of the prepared samples. CLC oxygen carrying capacity (Ro-CLC) with gaseous fuel, on the other hand, has evidenced a quick decline for the material with higher copper loading (80 wt% CuO). Furthermore, both oxygen carriers with 40-60 wt% CuO were tested for combustion of coal in a macro-TGA rig using CO2 as carrier gas and different OC:fuel ratios. First, a blank test in the absence of the OC was carried out to characterize the fast devolatilization and slow gasification reactions taking place due to the exposure of the fuel to high temperature and CO2-rich atmosphere. The comparison of the weight loss curve evolution with and without oxygen carrier, and the measured residual carbon after test, enabled to extract the CLOU effect for each combination of material/solid fuel.

TI  - Progress in space-borne studies of permafrost for climate science: Towards a multi-ECV approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed climate data records (CDRs) provide a basis for spatially distributed global climate model (GCM) inputs and validation methods. GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space.Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself.Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils.

TI  - Using 3DVAR data assimilation to measure offshore wind energy potential at different turbine heights in the West Mediterranean
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, offshore wind energy potential is measured around the Iberian Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands using the WRF meteorological model without 3DVAR data assimilation (the N simulation) and with 3DVAR data assimilation (the D simulation). Both simulations have been checked against the observations of six buoys and a spatially distributed analysis of wind based on satellite data (second version of Cross Calibrated Multi-Platform, CCMPv2), and compared with ERA-Interim (ERAI). Three statistical indicators have been used: Pearson's correlation, root mean square error and the ratio of standard deviations. The simulation with data assimilation provides the best fit, and it is as good as ERAI, in many cases at a 95% confidence level. Although ERAI is the best model, in the spatially distributed evaluation versus CCMPv2 the D simulation has more consistent indicators than ERAI near the buoys. Additionally, our simulation's spatial resolution is five times higher than ERAI. Finally, regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, we have represented the annual and seasonal capacity factor maps over the study area, and our results have identified two areas of high potential to the north of Menorca and at Cabo Begur, where the wind energy potential has been estimated for three turbines at different heights according to the simulation with data assimilation.

TI  - Hydro-geomorphic controls on the development and distribution of acid sulfate soils in Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference
CL  - Univ Maryland, College Park, MD
AB  - Coastal planning policies and regulations in Indonesia have not adequately considered acid sulfate soils (ASS) as a constraint on development. Aquaculture is often undertaken in unsuitable areas, and fish and shrimp culture systems, in particular, fail after a short period of production because of the impacts of ASS on pond water quality and, subsequently, on fish and shrimp health. This study describes a mapping approach based on an understanding of the hydro-geomorphic controls on the formation and the distribution of ASS in Central Java, Indonesia. The underlying approach was to identify associations between ASS development and distribution within estuarine hydro-geomorphological units (HGUs). This study utilized a multi-level methodology involving multi-resolution, remotely-sensed data and GIS analysis, coupled with field and laboratory-based data, to obtain hydro-geomorphic and soil information at different mapping scales. An estuary classification scheme for Central Java identified river, tide and wave-dominated estuaries as the dominant estuary types. HGUs were identified in each estuary type to define the relationships between landform development processes and pyrite concentration in soil layers. Thirty-nine HGUs were classified based on landforms, marine and fluvial hydrology, geomorphic processes, land use, and vegetation types. Field and laboratory assessment of soil properties were undertaken to identify the horizontal distribution of ASS in the HGUS and its vertical character in soil profiles. In contrast to previous studies, the results showed that estuaries located in low-energy environments on the north coast have low (< 0.1%) pyrite concentrations in 90% of their HGUs. Decades-old intensive aquaculture and dredging activities, that led to repeated oxidation and leaching, were identified as factors for low pyrite "concentrations. On the south coast, the combination of a high river and marine energy environment created scattered landforms with soils that have very high (4-9%) pyrite concentrations. These ASS-bearing HGUs mostly developed in low energy estuarine environments overlying former high river energy environments. The information generated for each HGU facilitated the development of an ASS mapping model that incorporates knowledge on the relationship between soil and landform formation in Central Java estuaries. Knowing where ASS occur is essential to minimize the risk of environment degradation. Using multi-resolution, remotely sensed data decreases cost and labour, compared to more traditional mapping approaches, especially to identify sampling sites for field surveys. The resulting maps and mapping methods will improve land capability assessment for brackishwater aquaculture and other coastal land use in Indonesia.

TI  - Validating canopy clumping retrieval methods using hemispherical photography in a simulated <i>Eucalypt</i> forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The so-called clumping factor (Omega) quantifies deviation from a random 3D distribution of material in a vegetation canopy and therefore characterises the spatial distribution of gaps within a canopy. Omega is essential to convert effective Plant or Leaf Area Index into actual LAI or PAL which has previously been shown to have a significant impact on biophysical parameter retrieval using optical remote sensing techniques in forests, woodlands, and savannas. Here, a simulation framework was applied to assess the performance of existing in situ clumping retrieval methods in a 3D virtual forest canopy, which has a high degree of architectural realism. The virtual canopy was reconstructed using empirical data from a Box Ironbark Eucalypt forest in Eastern Australia. Hemispherical photography (HP) was assessed due to its ubiquity for indirect LAI and structure retrieval. Angular clumping retrieval method performance was evaluated using a range of structural configurations based on varying stem distribution and LAI. The CLX clumping retrieval method (Leblanc et al., 2005) with a segment size of 15 was the best performing clumping method, matching the reference values to within 0.05 Omega on average near zenith. Clumping error increased linearly with zenith angle to > 0.3 Omega (equivalent to a 30% PAI error) at 75 for all structural configurations. At larger zenith angles, PAS errors were found to be around 25-30% on average when derived from the 55-60 degrees zenith angle. Therefore, careful consideration of zenith angle range utilised from HP is recommended. We suggest that plot or site clumping factors should be accompanied by the zenith angle used to derive them from gap size and gap size distribution methods. Furthermore, larger errors and biases were found for HPs captured within 1 m of unrepresentative large tree stems, so these situations should be avoided in practice if possible.

TI  - Impact of canopy representations on regional modeling of evapotranspiration using the WRF-ACASA coupled model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we couple the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) with the Advanced Canopy Atmosphere-Soil Algorithm (ACASA), a high complexity land surface model, to investigate the impact of canopy representation on regional evapotranspiration. The WRF-ACASA model uses a multilayer structure to represent the canopy, consequently allowing microenvironmental variables such as leaf area index (LAI), air and canopy temperature, wind speed and humidity to vary both horizontally and vertically. The improvement in canopy representation and canopy-atmosphere interaction allow for more realistic simulation of evapotranspiration on both regional and local scales. The coupled WRF-ACASA model is compared with the widely used intermediate complexity Noah land surface model in WRF (WRF-Noah) for both potential (ETo) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Two LAI datasets (USGS and MODIS) are used to study the model responses to surface conditions. Model evaluations over a diverse surface stations from the CIMIS and AmeriFlux networks show that an increase surface representations increase the model accuracy in ETa more so than ETo. Overall, while the high complexity of WRF-ACASA increases the realism of plant physiological processes, the model sensitivity to surface representation in input data such as LAI also increases.

TI  - Comparing soil moisture anomalies from multiple independent sources over different regions across the globe
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought events can affect large regions across the world, implying the need for a suitable global tool for an accurate monitoring of this phenomenon. Soil moisture anomalies are considered a good metric to capture the occurrence of agricultural drought events, and they have become an important component of several operational drought monitoring systems. In the framework of the JRC Global Drought Observatory (GDO, http://edo.jrc.ec.europa. eu/gdo/), the suitability of three datasets as possible representations of root zone soil moisture anomalies has been evaluated: (1) the soil moisture from the Lisflood distributed hydrological model (namely LIS), (2) the remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature data from the MODIS satellite (namely LST), and (3) the ESA Climate Change Initiative combined passive/active microwave skin soil moisture dataset (namely CCI). Due to the independency of these three datasets, the triple collocation (TC) technique has been applied, aiming at quantifying the likely error associated with each dataset in comparison to the unknown true status of the system. TC analysis was performed on five macro-regions (namely North America, Europe, India, southern Africa and Australia) detected as suitable for the experiment, providing insight into the mutual relationship between these datasets as well as an assessment of the accuracy of each method. Even if no definitive statement on the spatial distribution of errors can be provided, a clear outcome of the TC analysis is the good performance of the remote sensing datasets, especially CCI, over dry regions such as Australia and southern Africa, whereas the outputs of LIS seem to be more reliable over areas that are well monitored through meteorological ground station networks, such as North America and Europe. In a global drought monitoring system, the results of the error analysis are used to design a weighted-average ensemble system that exploits the advantages of each dataset.

TI  - Estimated net radiation in an Amazon-Cerrado transition forest by Landsat 5 TM
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon-Cerrado transition forest is an extensive region with unique characteristics of radiation exchanges. The measurements of the net radiation (Rn) in this ecosystem are limited to the local scale, and their spatial distribution can be carried out by remote sensing techniques, of which accuracy needs to be evaluated. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the accuracy of the model of surface Rn derived from measured solar radiation and estimates of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface albedo (a), and land surface temperature (LST) estimated by images of Landsat 5 TM in an Amazon-Cerrado transition forest. The Rn, NDVI, alpha, and LST were estimated by Landsat 5 TM images and related to micrometeorological measurements in a tower of the study area. There was seasonality of micrometeorological variables with higher values of incident solar radiation, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit during the dry season. However, there was no seasonality of Rn. NDVI decreased and a increased during the dry season, while LST was nearly constant. The Rn had negative correlation with a and positive with NDVI. Both instantaneous and daily Rn estimated with Landsat 5 TM images showed high correlation and low error values when compared with Rn measured in the study area.

TI  - Forest loss in New England: A projection of recent trends
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - New England has lost more than 350,000 ha of forest cover since 1985, marking a reversal of a two-hundred-year trend of forest expansion. We a cellular land-cover change model to project a continuation of recent trends (1990 +/- 2010) in forest loss across six New England states from 2010 to 2060. Recent trends were estimated using a continuous change detection algorithm applied to twenty years of Landsat images. We addressed three questions: (1) What would be the consequences of a continuation of the recent trends in terms of changes to New England's forest cover mosaic? (2) What social and biophysical attributes are most strongly associated with recent trends in forest loss, and how do these vary geographically? (3) How sensitive are projections of forest loss to the reference period-i.e. how do projections based on the period spanning 1990-to-2000 differ from 2000-to-2010, or from the full period, 1990-to-2010? Over the full reference period, 8201 ha yr-1 and 468 ha yr-1 of forest were lost to low-and high-density development, respectively. Forest loss was concentrated in suburban areas, particularly near Boston. Of the variables considered, 'distance to developed land' was the strongest predictor of forest loss. The next most important predictor varied geographically: 'distance to roads' ranked second in the more developed regions in the south and 'population density' ranked second in the less developed north. The importance and geographical variation in predictor variables were relatively stable between reference periods. In contrast, there was 55% more forest loss during the 1990-to-2000 reference period compared to the 2000-to-2010 period, highlighting the importance of understanding the variation in reference periods when projecting land cover change. The projection of recent trends is an important baseline scenario with implications for the management of forest ecosystems and the services they provide.

TI  - Quality aspects of the Wegener Center multi-satellite GPS radio occultation record OPSv5.6
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for high-quality atmospheric data records, which are applicable in climate studies, is undisputed. Using such records requires knowledge of the quality and the specific characteristics of all contained data sources. The latest version of the Wegener Center (WEGC) multi-satellite Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) record, OPSv5.6, provides globally distributed upper-air satellite data of high quality, usable for climate and other high-accuracy applications. The GPS RO technique has been deployed in several satellite missions since 2001. Consistency among data from these missions is essential to create a homogeneous long-term multi-satellite climate record. In order to enable a qualified usage of the WEGC OPSv5.6 data set we performed a detailed analysis of satellite-dependent quality aspects from 2001 to 2017. We present the impact of the OPSv5.6 quality control on the processed data and reveal time-dependent and satellite-specific quality characteristics. The highest quality data are found for MetOp (Meteorological Operational satellite) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). Data from FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (Formosa Satellite mission-3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) are also of high quality. However, comparatively large day-to-day variations and satellite-dependent irregularities need to be taken into account when using these data. We validate the consistency among the various satellite missions by calculating monthly mean temperature deviations from the multi-satellite mean, including a correction for the different sampling characteristics. The results are highly consistent in the altitude range from 8 to 25 km, with mean temperature deviations less than 0.1 K. At higher altitudes the OPSv5.6 RO temperature record is increasingly influenced by the characteristics of the bending angle initialization, with the amount of impact depending on the receiver quality.

TI  - A component-based system for agricultural drought monitoring by remote sensing
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, various kinds of remote sensing-based drought indexes have been proposed and widely used in the field of drought monitoring. However, the drought-related software and platform development lag behind the theoretical research. The current drought monitoring systems focus mainly on information management and publishing, and cannot implement professional drought monitoring or parameter inversion modelling, especially the models based on multi-dimensional feature space. In view of the above problems, this paper aims at fixing this gap with a component-based system named RSDMS to facilitate the application of drought monitoring by remote sensing. The system is designed and developed based on Component Object Model (COM) to ensure the flexibility and extendibility of modules. RSDMS realizes general image-related functions such as data management, image display, spatial reference management, image processing and analysis, and further provides drought monitoring and evaluation functions based on internal and external models. Finally, China's Ningxia region is selected as the study area to validate the performance of RSDMS. The experimental results show that RSDMS provide an efficient and scalable support to agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - Desertification, resilience, and re-greening in the African Sahel - a matter of the observation period?
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the turn of the millennium various scientific publications have been discussing a re-greening of the Sahel after the 1980s drought mainly based on coarse-resolution satellite data. However, the author's own field studies suggest that the situation is far more complex and that both paradigms, the "encroaching Sahara" and the "re-greening Sahel", need to be questioned.This paper discusses the concepts of desertification, resilience, and re-greening by addressing four main aspects: (i) the relevance of edaphic factors for a vegetation re-greening, (ii-iii) the importance of the selected observation period in the debate on Sahel greening or browning, and (iv) modifications in the vegetation pattern as possible indicators of ecosystem changes (shift from originally diffuse to contracted vegetation patterns).The data referred to in this paper cover a time period of more than 150 years and include the author's own research results from the early 1980s until today. A special emphasis, apart from fieldwork data and remote sensing data, is laid on the historical documents.The key findings summarised at the end show the following: (i) vegetation recovery predominantly depends on soil types; (ii) when discussing Sahel greening vs. Sahel browning, the majority of research papers only focus on post-drought conditions. Taking pre-drought conditions (before the 1980s) into account, however, is essential to fully understand the situation. Botanical investigations and remote-sensing-based time series clearly show a substantial decline in woody species diversity and cover density compared to pre-drought conditions; iii) the self-organised patchiness of vegetation is considered to be an important indicator of ecosystem changes.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation of Drought in China from 1982 to 2010 Based on a modified Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (mTVDI)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts cause huge losses of society and environment, therefore it is important to study the spatial-temporal pattern of drought. The traditional remote sensing drought indices (AVI, VCI and TCI) only consider the single factor representing the soil moisture (surface temperature or NDVI). The comprehensive remote sensing drought indices (VSWI and TVDI) can estimate the soil moisture more accurately, but they are not suitable for large scale region especially with great elevation variation. In this study, a modified Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (mTVDI) was constructed based on the correction of elevation and dry edge. Compared with the traditional drought indices, mTVDI had a better relationship with soil moisture in all selected months (R = -0.376, -0.406, -0.459, and -0.265, p < 0.05). mTVDI was used to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of drought in China from 1982 to 2010. The results showed that droughts appeared more frequently in Northwest China and the southwest of Tibet while drought centers of North and Southwest China appeared in Huanghuaihai Plain and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau respectively. The frequency of drought was increasing as a whole while the frequency of severe drought increased significantly by 4.86% and slight drought increased slowly during 1982 to 2010. The results are useful for the understanding of drought and policy making of climate change.

TI  - Application of time transfer functions to <i>Gaia</i>'s global astrometry Validation on DPAC simulated <i>Gaia</i>-like observations
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. A key objective of the ESA Gaia satellite is the realization of a quasi-inertial reference frame at visual wavelengths by means of global astrometric techniques. This requires accurate mathematical and numerical modeling of relativistic light propagation, as well as double-blind-like procedures for the internal validation of the results, before they are released to the scientific community at large.Aims. We aim to specialize the time transfer functions (TTF) formalism to the case of the Gaia observer and prove its applicability to the task of global sphere reconstruction (GSR), in anticipation of its inclusion in the GSR system, already featuring the Relativistic Astrometric MODel (RAMOD) suite, as an additional semi-external validation of the forthcoming Gaia baseline astrometric solutions. Methods. We extended the current GSR framework and software infrastructure (GSR2) to include TTF relativistic observation equations compatible with Gaia's operations. We used simulated data generated by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) to obtain different least-squares estimations of the full (five-parameter) stellar spheres and gauge results. These were compared to analogous solutions obtained with the current RAMOD model in GSR2 (RAMOD@GSR2) and to the catalog generated with the Gaia RElativistic Model (GREM), the model baselined for Gaia and used to generate the DPAC synthetic data.Results. Linearized least-squares TTF solutions are based on spheres of about 132 000 primary stars uniformly distributed on the sky and simulated observations spanning the entire 5 yr range of Gaia's nominal operational lifetime. The statistical properties of the results compare well with those of GREM. Finally, comparisons to RAMOD@GSR2 solutions confirmed the known lower accuracy of that model and allowed us to establish firm limits on the quality of the linearization point outside of which an iteration for nonlinearity is required for its proper convergence. This has proved invaluable as RAMOD@GSR2 is prepared to go into operations on real satellite data.

TI  - Quantification of CO emissions from the city of Madrid using MOPITT satellite retrievals and WRF simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of mega-cities leads to air quality problems directly affecting the citizens. Satellite measurements are becoming of higher quality and quantity, which leads to more accurate satellite retrievals of enhanced air pollutant concentrations over large cities. In this paper, we compare and discuss both an existing and a new method for estimating urban-scale trends in CO emissions using multi-year retrievals from the MOPITT satellite instrument. The first method is mainly based on satellite data, and has the advantage of fewer assumptions, but also comes with uncertainties and limitations as shown in this paper. To improve the reliability of urban-to-regional scale emission trend estimation, we simulate MOPITT retrievals using the Weather Research and Forecast model with chemistry core (WRF-Chem). The difference between model and retrieval is used to optimize CO emissions in WRF-Chem, focusing on the city of Madrid, Spain. This method has the advantage over the existing method in that it allows both a trend analysis of CO concentrations and a quantification of CO emissions. Our analysis confirms that MOPITT is capable of detecting CO enhancements over Madrid, although significant differences remain between the yearly averaged model output and satellite measurements (R-2 = 0.75) over the city. After optimization, we find Madrid CO emissions to be lower by 48% for 2002 and by 17% for 2006 compared with the EdgarV4.2 emission inventory. The MOPITT-derived emission adjustments lead to better agreement with the European emission inventory TNO-MAC-III for both years. This suggests that the downward trend in CO emissions over Madrid is overestimated in EdgarV4.2 and more realistically represented in TNO-MACC-III. However, our satellite and model based emission estimates have large uncertainties, around 20% for 2002 and 50% for 2006.

TI  - Surface lowering of the debris-covered area of Kanchenjunga Glacier in the eastern Nepal Himalaya since 1975, as revealed by Hexagon KH-9 and ALOS satellite observations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the geodetic mass balance of Kanchenjunga Glacier, one of the largest debris-covered glaciers in the easternmost Nepal Himalaya, which possesses a negative mass balance of -0.18 +/- 0.17mw.e.a(-1) for the 1975-2010 study period, estimated using digital elevation models (DEMs) generated from Hexagon KH-9 and ALOS PRISM stereo images. Accurate DEMs, with a relative uncertainty of +/- 5.5 m, were generated from the intensive and manual editing of triangulated irregular network (TIN) models on a stereo MirrorTM/3D Monitor. The glacier ice-flow velocity field was also calculated using a feature-tracking method that was applied to two ALOS orthoimages taken in 2010. The elevation differences between the two DEMs highlight considerable surface lowering across the debriscovered area, and a slight thickening in the accumulation area of Kanchenjunga Glacier between 1975 and 2010. The magnitude and gradient of surface lowering are similar among the six glacier tributaries, even though they are situated at different elevations, which may reflect variations in the iceflow velocity field. The pattern of surface lowering correlates well with the ice-flow velocity field over the debriscovered portion of the main tributary, suggesting that the glacier dynamics significantly affect surface lowering by altering the emergence velocity along the glacier, particularly in the compressive ablation area. Surface-lowering patterns partially correspond to the supraglacial pond area fraction of the glacier, with enhanced surface lowering observed in areas that possess a larger pond area fraction. These findings support the hypothesis that supraglacial ponds may intensify ice wastage and play a key role in the heterogeneous surface lowering of debris-covered glaciers. The estimated mass loss of Kanchenjunga Glacier is moderate compared with other debris-covered glaciers in neighboring Himalayan regions, which may be due to the lower pond area fraction of Kanchenjunga Glacier relative to other glaciers.

TI  - Intrapartum factors associated with neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy: a case-controlled study
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) affects 2-4/1000 live births with outcomes ranging from negligible neurological deficits to severe neuromuscular dysfunction, cerebral palsy and death. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the sub cohort of NE that appears to be driven by intrapartum events. Our objective was to identify antepartum and intrapartum factors associated with the development of neonatal HIE.Methods: Hospital databases were searched using relevant diagnosis codes to identify infants with neonatal encephalopathy. Cases were infants with encephalopathy and evidence of intrapartum hypoxia. For each hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy case, four controls were randomly selected from all deliveries that occurred within 6 months of the case.Results: Twenty-six cases met criteria for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy between 2002 and 2014. In multivariate analysis, meconium-stained amniotic fluid (aOR 12.4, 95% CI 2.1-144.8, p = 0.002), prolonged second stage of labor (aOR 9.5, 95% CI 1.0-135.3, p = 0.042), and the occurrence of a sentinel or acute event (aOR 74.9, 95% CI 11.9-infinity, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The presence of a category 3 fetal heart rate tracing in any of the four 15-min segments during the hour prior to delivery (28.0% versus 4.0%, p = 0.002) was more common among hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy cases.Conclusion: Prolonged second stage of labor and the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid are risk factors for the development of HIE. Close scrutiny should be paid to labors that develop these features especially in the presence of an abnormal fetal heart tracing. Acute events also account for a substantial number of HIE cases and health systems should develop programs that can optimize the response to these emergencies.

TI  - Accurate beacon positioning method for satellite-to-ground optical communication
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In satellite laser communication systems, accurate positioning of the beacon is essential for establishing a steady laser communication link. For satellite-to-ground optical communication, the main influencing factors on the acquisition of the beacon are background noise and atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we consider the influence of background noise and atmospheric turbulence on the beacon in satellite-to-ground optical communication, and propose a new locating algorithm for the beacon, which takes the correlation coefficient obtained by curve fitting for image data as weights. By performing a long distance laser communication experiment (11.16 km), we verified the feasibility of this method. Both simulation and experiment showed that the new algorithm can accurately obtain the position of the centroid of beacon. Furthermore, for the distortion of the light spot through atmospheric turbulence, the locating accuracy of the new algorithm was 50% higher than that of the conventional gray centroid algorithm. This new approach will be beneficial for the design of satellite-to ground optical communication systems. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) previously carried out a validation study of case definitions for 8 chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, depression, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, parkinsonism and epilepsy) using direct review of "raw" electronic medical record data. Although effective, this method is time-consuming and can present methodological and organizational challenges. We aimed to determine whether the processed and standardized data contained with the CPCSSN database might function as a reference standard for case definition validation.METHODS: Using a traditional validation study design, we compared the case identification results of the chart reviews for the 8 chronic diseases with the results of a manual review of the CPCSSN processed data for the same conditions in the same patient sample. Patients were randomly sampled from the June 30, 2012 CPCSSN database, with oversampling of patients with rare conditions.RESULTS: We analyzed data for 1906 patients. Manual review of the CPCSSN records for case ascertainment yielded sensitivity ranging from 77.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.3%-81.6%) for depression to 97.2% (95% CI 95.4%-99.0%) for diabetes. Specificity was high for all definitions (range 93.1% [95% CI 91.4%-94.7%] to 99.4% [95% CI 99.0%-99.8%]). Positive predictive values and negative predictive values also showed high accuracy of the manual CPCSSN record review relative to review of the raw chart data.INTERPRETATION: The use of CPCSSN records as the reference standard to validate case definitions substantially reduces the burden on sentinel physicians and clinic managers as well as on researchers while offering a reference standard that is a reasonable substitution for chart review.

AB  - Objective: To explore the HIV epidemic and related factors among MSM in Jilin province. Methods: During the implementation of sentinel surveillance program from 2010 to 2015, continuous cross-sectional studies were conducted to monitor the awareness of AIDS, sexual behavior, HIV and syphilis positive rates, with the sample size no less than 400 in each surveillance site. Results: From 2010 to 2015, a total of 7 823 MSM were involved in this study. The overall HIV prevalence among MSM was 5.4% (42/7 823), with an increasing trend during 2010 and 2015 (Trend test chi(2)=110.023, P<0.001). The rates of awareness on AIDS were higher than 90.0%. The proportion of consistent condom use was 27.0% (2 112/7 823) in the last 6 months, and significant differences were found in these years (chi(2)=234.038, P<0.001). Results from multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the HIV infection related risk factors among MSM in Jilin province would include: residency from other provinces (aOR=1.797, 95%CI: 1.185-2.726), recruitment through internet (aOR=1.717, 95%CI: 1.332-2.215), diagnosed of having sexually transmitted diseases in the previous year (aOR=1.893, 95%CI: 1.356-2.643) and positive testing on syphilis (aOR=4.309, 95%CI: 3.097-5.995). And consistent condom uses in the last 6 months (aOR=0.387, 95%CI: 0.143-0.557), tested HIV in the last year (aOR=0.632, 95%CI: 0.375-0.891) were preventive factors. Conclusions: HIV prevalence was increasing among MSM in Jilin province, but both the proportion of consistent condom use and the former HIV testing rate were at a low level. Aggressive measurement including consistent condom use and periodical HIV testing among MSM was warranted.
AB  - 目的： 了解吉林省MSM人群HIV的感染状况及其相关因素。 方法： 2010－2015年，根据《全国艾滋病哨点监测方案》的要求，在艾滋病哨点监测期内，通过横断面调查的方法对吉林省MSM艾滋病知识知晓率、性行为状况、HIV和梅毒抗体阳性率水平等进行连续监测，每个监测哨点样本量≥400人。 结果： 2010－2015年吉林省共监测MSM 7 823人，HIV感染率为5.4%（42/7 823），HIV感染率呈逐年上升趋势（趋势chi(2)=110.023，P<0.001）。2010－2015年，MSM艾滋病知识知晓率均>90.0%。最近6个月坚持使用安全套的比例为27.0%（2 112/7 823），不同年份的差异有统计学意义（chi(2)=234.038，P<0.001）。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，MSM感染HIV的可能危险因素包括外省户籍（aOR=1.797，95%CI：1.185~2.726）、网络招募（aOR=1.717，95%CI：1.332~2.215）、最近1年曾诊断过性病（aOR=1.893，95%CI：1.356~2.643）和梅毒抗体阳性（aOR=4.309，95%CI：3.097~5.995）；可能保护性因素包括最近6个月同性性行为坚持使用安全套（aOR=0.387，95%CI：0.143~0.557）、最近1年曾检测过HIV（aOR=0.632，95%CI：0.375~0.891）。 结论： 2010－2015年吉林省MSM人群HIV感染率呈上升趋势，坚持使用安全套的比例和HIV检测率均较低，应采取有效措施促进MSM定期做HIV检测和坚持使用安全套。.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze the behavior change and related factors regarding HIV/STD epidemics among female sex workers (FSWs) in Qingdao city. Methods: According to the requirements set by the"National HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance program", information on demographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, and HIV-related services among female sex workers (FSWs) was collected from ten consecutive annual cross-sectional surveys from 2006 to 2015. Blood samples were drawn for serological tests on both HIV and syphilis antibodies. Results: Data from the sampled FSWs over the ten years, a higher proportion of participants who were aged 30 or more, married or cohabited and on-call FSW were followed. The prevalence of syphilis increased significantly from 1.0% (4/420) in 2006 to 13.3% (53/400) in 2015 (trend chi(2)=54.22, P<0.001). Rates on illicit drug use were ranging from 12.0% (48/400) and 55.5% (222/400) while the rate on consistent condom use with clients in the last month showed decreasing, with trend chi(2)=170.62, P<0.001. The proportion of HIV-related knowledge score ≥6 (trend chi(2)=152.96, P<0.001), or ever been tested for HIV (trend chi(2)=114.87, P<0.001) were both significantly increased over the last ten years. Between 2009 and 2015, results from the annual stratified analysis showed that the FSWs who used drugs were more likely than the FSWs who were non-drug users less consistently using condoms with clients in last month and being syphilis positive (P<0.05). On-call FSWs were more likely to be syphilis positive (P<0.05) than the non on-call FSWs. Conclusions: The prevalence of syphilis among FSWs in Qingdao city had been rising over the last ten years, with synthetic drug abuse as an important risk factor. Better targeted surveillance and intervention efforts among those drug-using FSWs seemed important to reduce the epidemics.
AB  - 目的： 分析山东省青岛市暗娼人群行为变化特征和艾滋病性病流行因素，为制订艾滋病防治对策和干预措施提供依据。 方法： 2006－2015年在哨点监测期4－7月按《全国艾滋病哨点监测实施方案》要求收集当地暗娼人口学特征及相关行为信息，并采集静脉血进行艾滋病、梅毒检测。 结果： 连续10年调查样本显示，年龄≥30岁、已婚/同居和应召暗娼所占比例呈增长趋势；梅毒感染率从2006年1.0%（4/420）上升至2015年13.3%（53/400）（趋势chi(2)=54.22，P<0.001）；吸食合成毒品率在12.0%（48/400）和55.5%（222/400）之间波动；最近1个月与客人发生性行为坚持安全套使用率呈下降趋势（趋势chi(2)=170.62，P<0.001）；艾滋病知识得分≥6（趋势chi(2)=152.96，P<0.001）和最近1年做过艾滋病检测比例（趋势chi(2)=114.87，P<0.001）呈上升趋势；2009－2015年分年度分层分析，吸食毒品与不吸食毒品的暗娼相比有更高的梅毒感染率和不安全性行为（P<0.05），应召暗娼梅毒感染率高于场所招募暗娼（P<0.05）。 结论： 青岛地区暗娼人群梅毒感染率呈上升趋势，吸食合成毒品是影响青岛市性病艾滋病传播重要危险因素，建议加强对吸毒暗娼人群监测力度，开展有针对性干预措施。.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) is the latest breakthrough in remote sensing of physiological response of plants. We studied the seasonality of sal (Shorea robusta) forest canopies analysing space-borne SIF and reflectance data collected over moist and dry sites in central India. Results indicate that the monthly response of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS NDVI and GPP differs significantly across the wet and dry forest sites. SIF explained higher seasonal variations and was also better correlated to rainfall across sites compared to NDVI.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Data from the HIV/AIDS surveillance sentinel sites was used to identify the recent HIV-1 infections and to estimate the HIV-1 incidence and epidemic trends among intravenous drug users (IDU), MSM, female sex workers and men attending the sexually transmitted disease clinics in Sichuan province. Methods: Specimens collected from IDUs, MSM, female sex workers and men attending the sexually transmitted disease clinics sentinel sites were confirmed as HIV-1 positive and tested with BED-CEIA. Annual HIV-1 prevalence and incidence rates were calculated and the incidence was adjusted by McNermar method. Results: A total number of 194 223 serum specimens were collected and HIV antibody tested, with 5 297 HIV-1 positive. 4 640 of the positives underwent BED-CEIA, with 749 identified as recent infections. During 2011-2015, HIV-1 incidence rates of the four types of population appeared as 5.16% (95%CI: 4.65-5.66), 0.22% (95%CI:0.16-0.28), 0.57%(95%CI: 0.45-0.69), 7.53% (95%CI: 6.06-9.01) and 0.44% (95%CI: 0.36-0.53) respectively. Significant differences were seen in the HIV-1 incidence rates. Conclusions: The HIV-1 incidence rates of IDUs from other sentinel sites in Sichuan province, female sex workers and men attending the sexually transmitted disease clinics appeared low, showing that the AIDS prevention and control activities worked effectively. However, the HIV-1 incidence of MSM was still at high level and even rising, suggesting that HIV-1 transmission between MSM and IDUs was possible.

TI  - Calibration of a parsimonious distributed ecohydrological daily model in a data-scarce basin by exclusively using the spatio-temporal variation of NDVI
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecohydrological modeling studies in developing countries, such as sub-Saharan Africa, often face the problem of extensive parametrical requirements and limited available data. Satellite remote sensing data may be able to fill this gap, but require novel methodologies to exploit their spatiotemporal information that could potentially be incorporated into model calibration and validation frameworks.The present study tackles this problem by suggesting an automatic calibration procedure, based on the empirical orthogonal function, for distributed ecohydrological daily models. The procedure is tested with the support of remote sensing data in a data-scarce environment-the upper Ewaso Ngiro river basin in Kenya. In the present application, the TETIS-VEG model is calibrated using only NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from MODIS. The results demonstrate that (1) satellite data of vegetation dynamics can be used to calibrate and validate ecohydrological models in water-controlled and datascarce regions, (2) the model calibrated using only satellite data is able to reproduce both the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and the observed discharge at the outlet and (3) the proposed automatic calibration methodology works satisfactorily and it allows for a straightforward incorporation of spatio-temporal data into the calibration and validation framework of a model.

TI  - Reconstruction of inflation from scalar field non-minimally coupled with the Gauss-Bonnet term
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the early time inflation in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity where the scalar field is minimally coupled with the Gauss-Bonnet four-dimensional topological invariant. The theory belongs to a class of Horndeski models where the field equations are at the second order, like in General Relativity. A viable inflationary scenario must correctly reproduce the last Plank satellite data. By starting from some simple assumptions on the field and on the coupling function between the field and the Gauss-Bonnet term, we derive the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the model. Once the model is viable, it is finally possible to fully reconstruct its Lagrangian.

TI  - Estimation of subpixel snow sublimation from multispectral satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow sublimation is an important hydrological process and its spatial and temporal variation remains largely unknown; however, few studies have been conducted to quantify its spatial variability. Our study focuses on the evaluation of two algorithms, Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation and the bulk aerodynamic (BA) parameterization of snow sublimation. The two methods were first evaluated against eddy covariance (EC) measurements of latent heat flux at towers located in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin (China). Both methods were in good agreement with the ground observations with high coefficient of determination (R-2) and low root mean squared error (RMSE). Next, we estimated subpixel snow sublimation using remote sensing data at a 1-km x 1-km spatial resolution. The results based on satellite data were evaluated against ground measurements at the two experimental sites. The P-M equation gave R-2 =0.75, RMSE = 8.4 W m(-2) for Dashalong site and R-2 = 0.36, RMSE = 9.1 W m(-2) for the Dadongshu site and performed better than the BA parameterization, which gave R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 17.5 W m(-2) for the Dashalong site and R-2 = 0.06, RMSE 1/4 21.2 W m(-2) for the Dadongshu site. Overall, the results indicate that P-M is promising for estimating snow sublimation at the regional scale using satellite observations. (c) The Authors.

TI  - [Effect of Atmospheric Haze Based on Multi-source Remote Sensing Data Considering the Size Effect of Landscape Sources and Sinks].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Based on a geo-weighted regression model, this study analyzes the relationship between the landscape patterns of sources and sinks in urban areas and atmospheric haze pollution. First, the classification result of the study area is divided into a number of square grids with side lengths of 2-9 km. Heterogeneity indices at different scales are calculated and compared to select an optimal scale for the following analysis. Then, the category level landscape indices, such as PLAND, PD, COHEDION, LPI, and FRAC_MN, are calculated in each grid. The aerosol optical thickness (AOD) of Wuhan is used to represent the degree of atmospheric haze pollution. Furthermore, the mean value of the pixels in each grid is regarded as the value of the grid's center. Next, the landscape sources and sinks of atmospheric haze pollution are selected based on the analysis of the correlation between landscape indices and AOD. To make the following analysis more efficient, the indices selected previously are determined using their correlation coefficients. Finally, the geo-weighted regression analysis model is used to analyze the relationship between the landscape indices of the category level and AOD. In addition, the influences of industrial, commercial, and residential areas on haze pollution are analyzed based on the result of the classification of urban functional areas. The results show that the heterogeneity of the whole landscape is most obvious at a 6 km scale, so 6 km is the optimal scale for the analysis. The landscape sources of atmospheric haze pollution are the buildings, and the landscape sinks are shrubs and woodland. Reducing the proportion of landscape source area and increasing the degree of fragmentation can cut down aerosol optical thickness. Distributing the landscape sources and sinks evenly and interspersedly could effectively reduce aerosol optical thickness, which represents atmospheric haze pollution. For Wuhan City, the main sources of haze pollution are commercial and residential areas in the city center, representing public sources. Since it is not easy to adjust existing facilities and infrastructure, adjusting built-up areas slightly and planning reasonably for those areas that are not yet built up can reduce atmospheric haze pollution.

TI  - An improved ENSO simulation by representing chlorophyll-induced climate feedback in the NCAR Community Earth System Model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Nio-Southern oscillation (ENSO) simulated in the Community Earth System Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR CESM) is much stronger than in reality. Here, satellite data are used to derive a statistical relationship between interannual variations in oceanic chlorophyll (CHL) and sea surface temperature (SST), which is then incorporated into the CESM to represent oceanic chlorophyll -induced climate feedback in the tropical Pacific. Numerical runs with and without the feedback (referred to as feedback and non-feedback runs) are performed and compared with each other. The ENSO amplitude simulated in the feedback run is more accurate than that in the non-feedback run; quantitatively, the Nino3 SST index is reduced by 35% when the feedback is included. The underlying processes are analyzed and the results show that interannual CHL anomalies exert a systematic modulating effect on the solar radiation penetrating into the subsurface layers, which induces differential heating in the upper ocean that affects vertical mixing and thus SST. The statistical modeling approach proposed in this work offers an effective and economical way for improving climate simulations.

TI  - The Genetic Legacy of the Indian Ocean Slave Trade: Recent Admixture and Post-admixture Selection in the Makranis of Pakistan
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - From the eighth century onward, the Indian Ocean was the scene of extensive trade of sub-Saharan African slaves via sea routes controlled by Muslim Arab and Swahili traders. Several populations in present-day Pakistan and India are thought to be the descendants of such slaves, yet their history of admixture and natural selection remains largely undefined. Here, we studied the genome-wide diversity of the African-descent Makranis, who reside on the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan, as well that of four neighboring Pakistani populations, to investigate the genetic legacy, population dynamics, and tempo of the Indian Ocean slave trade. We show that the Makranis are the result of an admixture event between local Baluch tribes and Bantu-speaking populations from eastern or southeastern Africa; we dated this event to similar to 300 years ago during the Omani Empire domination. Levels of parental relatedness, measured through runs of homozygosity, were found to be similar across Pakistani populations, suggesting that the Makranis rapidly adopted the traditional practice of endogamous marriages. Finally, we searched for signatures of post-admixture selection at traits evolving under positive selection, including skin color, lactase persistence, and resistance to malaria. We demonstrate that the African-specific Duffy-null blood group-believed to confer resistance against Plasmodium vivax infection-was recently introduced to Pakistan through the slave trade and evolved adaptively in this P. vivax malaria-endemic region. Our study reconstructs the genetic and adaptive history of a neglected episode of the African Diaspora and illustrates the impact of recent admixture on the diffusion of adaptive traits across human populations.

TI  - Outcome of Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor: Does Antiplatelet Therapy Really Matter? Analysis of a Retrospective Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is considered to be at a moderate or high risk of bleeding during surgical procedure. The number of patients on antiplatelet (AP) drugs has been increasing; we wanted to assess their impact on the outcome of patients undergoing scheduled TURBT. Materials and Methods: A retrospective assessment of noninferiority of 450 consecutive procedures performed between April 2013 and June 2015 was conducted. Patients were divided in two groups: naive or AP drug users. The primary endpoint was the average length of stay (ALOS). Noninferiority was set at 1 day. A subgroup analysis comparing the acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) group and clopidogrel group to the naive group was performed. Multivariate analysis was performed to find the determinants of a longer ALOS. Chi-square or Fisher tests were used to analyze categorical variables, and Student's or Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze quantitative variables. Results: We included 325 patients who underwent TURBT: 117 received AP drugs (ASA, 85; clopidogrel, 32) and 208 were naive to AP drugs (of whom 117 were consecutively analyzed). The ALOSs were 2.5 days (naive group) and 2.9 days (AP group). The subgroup analysis showed ALOSs of 2.6 days (ASA group) and 3.7 days (clopidogrel group). Clopidogrel therapy (odds ratio=4.1 [1.7-9.6]) and the duration and depth of resection emerged as determinants of a longer ALOS in multivariate analysis. Perioperative management of AP therapies was achieved according to recommended practices. Conclusions: The ALOS of patients receiving AP drugs was not clinically different from naive patients. This result was identical for patients receiving ASA. However, clopidogrel increased the length of stay, making us question its use in perioperative management.

TI  - National epidemiology of initial and recurrent <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection in the Veterans Health Administration from 2003 to 2014
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPrior studies demonstrated marked increases in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the United States (U.S.) in recent years. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of initial and recurrent CDI in a national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort over a 12-year period.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study of all adult VHA beneficiaries with CDI (ICD-9-CM code 008.45) plus a positive CDI stool test between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2014. Data were obtained from the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure. Recurrence was defined as a second ICD-9-CM code plus a new course of CDI therapy following a minimum three-day gap after the initial therapy was completed. CDI incidence and outcomes were presented descriptively and longitudinally.ResultsOverall, 30,326 patients met study inclusion criteria. CDI incidence increased from FY 2003 (1.6 per 10,000) to FY 2013 (5.1 per 10,000). Thereafter, CDI incidence decreased through FY 2014 (4.6 per 10,000). A total of 5,011 patients (17%) experienced a first recurrence and, of those, 1,713 (34%) experienced a second recurrence. Recurrence incidence increased 10-fold over the study period, from (0.1 per 10,000) in FY 2003, to (1.0 per 10,000) in FY 2014. Overall, 30-day mortality and median hospital length of stay (LOS) decreased among initial episodes over the study period. Mortality was higher for initial episodes (21%) compared to first recurrences (11%) and second recurrences (7%). Median hospital LOS was longer for first episodes (13 days) compared to first (9 days) and second recurrences (8 days).ConclusionsInitial and recurrent CDI episodes increased among veterans over a 12-year period. Outcomes, such as mortality and hospital LOS improved in recent years; both of these outcomes are worse for initial CDI episodes than recurrent episodes.

TI  - Group sparsity based regularization model for remote sensing image stripe noise removal
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise degradation is a common phenomenon in remote sensing image, which largely affects the visual quality and brings great difficulty for subsequent processing. In contrast to existing stripe noise removal (destriping) models in which the reconstruction is performed to directly estimate the clean image from the striped one, the proposed model achieves the destriping by estimating the stripe component firstly. Since the stripe component possesses column sparse structure, the group sparsity is employed in this study. In addition, difference-based constraints are used to describe the direction information of the stripes. Then, we build a novel convex optimization model which consists of a unidirectional total variation term, a group sparsity term and a gradient domain fidelity term solved by an efficient alternating direction method of multiplier. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experiment results on simulated and real data are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the pathogen spectrum and epidemiological characters of infectious diarrhea cases in Shanghai from July 2013 to June 2015. Methods: From July 2013 to June 2015, using multi-stage sampling to select 22 hospitals as adult diarrhea surveillance sentinels, and 3 district central hospitals together with Shanghai municipal children's hospital as children diarrhea surveillance sentinels. A total of 6 267 diarrhea cases were sampled. The demographic characters, main clinical manifestations and signs of cases were investigated, and stool specimens were collected to conduct the bacteria culture and virus nucleic acid detection. The difference of positive rate of bacteria and virus in different seasons, and age difference of relevant pathogens were compared. Results: Among 6 267 cases, 3 262 (52.05%) were male, and most of them were in 50-69 years group (1 999 cases, 31.90%) and 30-49 years group (1 691 cases, 26.98%). Totally, 2 783 positive specimens were detected out of 6 267 specimens with the positive rate being 44.41%. A total of 7 kinds of bacteria and 5 kinds of viruses were detected. The positive rate for bacterium was 12.61%(790 cases), mainly being vibrio parahaemolyticus (256 cases), diarrheagenic E.coli (239 cases) and salmonella (209 cases). The positive rate for virus was 31.80% (1 993 cases), mainly being norovirus (1 172 cases) and rotavirus (546 cases). The positive rates of viruses in winter of 2013 and 2014 were 57.89%(429 cases) and 62.14%(522 cases) respectively, higher than those of bacterium in the same periods which were 2.43% (18 cases) and 2.86% (24 cases) respectively. The positive rates of bacterium in summer of 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 14.56% (97 cases), 25.29%(258 cases) and 21.21% (49 cases), also higher than those of viruses in the same periods which were 7.51% (50 cases), 8.43%(86 cases) and 11.69% (27 cases) respectively, all of the above differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The cases of 50-69 years group had the highest positive rate of pathogen, which was 47.57% (951/1 999). Secondly was those of 30-49 years group with 47.13% (797/1 691). Positive rate of pathogen for cases of 0-2 years group was 35.74% (213/596). Conclusion: The pathogen spectrumes of infectious diarrhea in Shanghai are mainly vibrio parahaemolyticus, diarrheagenic E.coli, salmonella, norovirus and rotavirus. The summer and winter season peak was obvious. Specific etiological surveillance and control strategies should be strengthened aiming at focus groups including children and the elderly in different seasons.

TI  - A decade of changes in nitrogen oxides over regions of oil and natural gas activity in the United States
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2 + NO) are a highly regulated species that play a major role in the formation of photochemical smog. While NOx emissions are generally decreasing over the U.S. as a result of more stringent environmental policies and improved emissions control technologies, the shale oil and natural gas industry is reversing this rate of changes in certain regions. We present here a quantitative analysis of NOx levels over the seven main U.S. shale plays (Bakken, Eagle Ford, Permian, Niobrara-Codell, MarcellusUtica, Haynesville, and Barnett) between 2005 and 2015 using measurements of tropospheric NO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA EOS-Aura aircraft. We develop and apply a methodology that seeks to maximise pollutant signals from oil and gas activities. For reference, we also examine the national trend averaged over the lower 48 states. Consistent with previous studies, we find NOx across the U.S. is generally declining. During the low-production phase of oil and natural gas production (2005-2009), we find declining trends in tropospheric NOx that are similar to the national trend (-4.6% yr(-1)) in 6 of the 7 study regions (-8 to -2% yr(-1)). In the high-production phase (2010-15), we find an increasing NOx trend in 5 of the 7 study basins (0.4 to 4.5% yr(-1)) while the national trend continued to decline (-0.3% yr(-1)). Over the most intensive oil-producing shale plays (Bakken, Eagle Ford, Permian and Niobrara-Codell), we observe a rapid growth (1-4.5% yr(-1)), which correlates well (r(2) = 0.6-0.9) with their annual oil production rates and/or drilling rigs. In contrast, trends across the mainly gas-producing regions (Haynesville, Barnett, and Marcellus-Utica) show decreases (-0.4 to -1.7% yr(-1)) similar to the national trend, with the exception of the Marcellus-Utica where a slight increase (0.4 +/- 0.2% yr(-1)) may be an indication of a small regional increase. Our study shows the important decadal effect that shale oil and natural gas operations has had on the tropospheric NO2 levels, and the potential consequences for regional air quality.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural networks for building extraction from orthoimages and dense image matching point clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of buildings from remote sensing data is an attractive research topic, useful for several applications, such as cadastre and urban planning. This is mainly due to the inherent artifacts of the used data and the differences in viewpoint, surrounding environment, and complex shape and size of the buildings. This paper introduces an efficient deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) toward building extraction from orthoimages. In contrast to conventional deep approaches in which the raw image data are fed as input to the deep neural network, in this paper the height information is exploited as an additional feature being derived from the application of a dense image matching algorithm. As test sites, several complex urban regions of various types of buildings, pixel resolutions and types of data are used, located in Vaihingen in Germany and in Perissa in Greece. Our method is evaluated using the rates of completeness, correctness, and quality and compared with conventional and other "shallow" learning paradigms such as support vector machines. Experimental results indicate that a combination of raw image data with height information, feeding as input to a deep CNN model, provides potentials in building detection in terms of robustness, flexibility, and efficiency.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To estimate the influenza infection rate among severe acute respiratory infection(SARI) cases and the hospitalization rates of SARI attributable to influenza, based on two sentinel hospital surveillance databases in Beijing, 2015. Methods: Surveillance was conducted at two sentinel hospitals in Beijing in 2015. A total of 1 842 patients who admitted to the sentinel hospitals and met the definition of SARI were enrolled in the study. The respiratory tract specimens of SARI cases were collected, and sent to laboratories within 48 hours for influenza RNA detection. The catchment area of sentinel hospitals was defined by reviewing the home address of inpatients; A total of 1 491 patients were sampled and tested for influenza. The population size of catchment areas was obtained from demographic year book. We investigated the number of pneumonia patients admitted to the sentinel hospitals and other hospitals in catchment areas in 2015, and calculated the proportions of pneumonia patients that were admitted to sentinel hospitals in catchment areas. The catchment population size was calculated using the number of total population of catchment areas multiply by the proportions of pneumonia patients that were admitted at sentinel hospitals. Results: Among 1 491 patients, 13.7% (205 cases) was test positive for influenza viruses, 2 (0.9%) cases positive for influenza A (H1N1), 91 (44.6%) cases influenza A (H3N2), 1 (0.5%) case influenza B/Victoria, 111 (54.0%) cases influenza B/Yamagata. Influenza was associated with an estimated 30 (95%CI:9-51) SARI hospitalizations per 100 000 during 2015. The hospitalization rate was 243 (95%CI: 232-255), 86 (95%CI: 59-112),1(95%CI: 0-5), 8 (95%CI: 0-23) and 92 (95%CI: 16-168) SARI hospitalizations per 100 000 population for<5 years children, 5-14 years children, 15-24 years adult, 25-59 years adult and ≥60 years population, respectively. The hospitalization rate of SARI attributed to influenza A and B was 14 (95%CI:4-17) and 16 (95%CI:0-23) per 100 000 population, respectively. Conclusion: The influenza positive rate among SARI cases was relatively high. The hospitalization burden of SARI attributed to influenza was the greatest in children under 5 year-old.

TI  - HIV Surveillance Among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Clinics: Evolution and Current Direction.
T2  - JMIR public health and surveillance
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Since the late 1980s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sentinel serosurveillance among pregnant women attending select antenatal clinics (ANCs) based on unlinked anonymous testing (UAT) has provided invaluable information for tracking HIV prevalence and trends and informing global and national HIV models in most countries with generalized HIV epidemics. However, increased coverage of HIV testing, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and antiretroviral therapy has heightened ethical concerns about UAT. PMTCT programs now routinely collect demographic and HIV testing information from the same pregnant women as serosurveillance and therefore present an alternative to UAT-based ANC serosurveillance. This paper reports on the evolution and current direction of the global approach to HIV surveillance among pregnant women attending ANCs, including the transition away from traditional UAT-based serosurveillance and toward new guidance from the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS on the implementation of surveillance among pregnant women attending ANCs based on routine PMTCT program data.

TI  - Three faces of node importance in network epidemiology: Exact results for small graphs
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW E
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate three aspects of the importance of nodes with respect to susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) disease dynamics: influence maximization (the expected outbreak size given a set of seed nodes), the effect of vaccination (how much deleting nodes would reduce the expected outbreak size), and sentinel surveillance (how early an outbreak could be detected with sensors at a set of nodes). We calculate the exact expressions of these quantities, as functions of the SIR parameters, for all connected graphs of three to seven nodes. We obtain the smallest graphs where the optimal node sets are not overlapping. We find that (i) node separation is more important than centrality for more than one active node, (ii) vaccination and influence maximization are the most different aspects of importance, and (iii) the three aspects are more similar when the infection rate is low.

TI  - Performance of the METRIC model in estimating evapotranspiration fluxes over an irrigated field in Saudi Arabia using Landsat-8 images
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for hydrological modeling and efficient crop water management in hyper-arid climates. In this study, we applied the METRIC algorithm on Landsat-8 images, acquired from June to October 2013, for the mapping of ET of a 50 ha center-pivot irrigated alfalfa field in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. The METRIC-estimated energy balance components and ET were evaluated against the data provided by an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower installed in the field. Results indicated that the METRIC algorithm provided accurate ET estimates over the study area, with RMSE values of 0.13 and 4.15 mm d(-1). The METRIC algorithm was observed to perform better in full canopy conditions compared to partial canopy conditions. On average, the METRIC algorithm overestimated the hourly ET by 6.6% in comparison to the EC measurements; however, the daily ET was underestimated by 4.2 %.

TI  - Persistent Organic Pollutants in the East Antarctic Atmosphere: Inter-Annual Observations from 2010 to 2015 Using High-Flow-Through Passive Sampling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the first multiyear sampling effort for POPs in the eastern Antarctic atmosphere, 32 PCBs and 38 organochlorine pesticides were targeted in air collected with a high-flow-through passive sampler. Agricultural chemicals were found to dominate atmospheric profiles, in particular HCB and endosulfan-I, with average concentrations of 12 600 and 550 fg/m(3), respectively. HCB showed higher concentrations in the austral summer, indicative of local, temperature-dependent volatilisation, while endosulfan-I appeared to show fresh, late-austral-summer input followed by temporally decreasing levels throughout the year. The current-use herbicide, trifluralin, and the legacy pesticides mirex and toxaphene, were detected in Antarctic air for the first time. Trifluralin was observed at low but increasing levels over the five-year period. Its detection in the Antarctic atmosphere provides evidence of its persistence and long-range environmental transport capability. While a time frame of five years exceeds the duration of most Antarctic air monitoring efforts, it is projected that continuous monitoring at the decadal scale is required to detect an annual 10% change in atmospheric concentrations of key analytes. This finding emphasizes the importance of continuous, long-term monitoring efforts in polar regions, that serve a special role as sentinel environments of hemispheric chemical usage trends.

TI  - The potential of using remote sensing data to estimate air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the Baltic Sea
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present the first climatological map of air-sea CO2 flux over the Baltic Sea based on remote sensing data: estimates of pCO(2) derived from satellite imaging using self-organizing map classifications along with class-specific linear regressions (SOMLO methodology) and remotely sensed wind estimates. The estimates have a spatial resolution of 4 km both in latitude and longitude and a monthly temporal resolution from 1998 to 2011. The CO2 fluxes are estimated using two types of wind products, i.e. reanalysis winds and satellite wind products, the higher-resolution wind product generally leading to higher-amplitude flux estimations.Furthermore, the CO2 fluxes were also estimated using two methods: the method of Wanninkhof et al. (2013) and the method of Rutgersson and Smedman (2009). The seasonal variation in fluxes reflects the seasonal variation in pCO(2) unvaryingly over the whole Baltic Sea, with high winter CO2 emissions and high pCO(2) uptakes. All basins act as a source for the atmosphere, with a higher degree of emission in the southern regions (mean source of 1.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for the South Basin and 0.9 for the Central Basin) than in the northern regions (mean source of 0.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and the coastal areas act as a larger sink (annual uptake of -4.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) than does the open sea (4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). In its entirety, the Baltic Sea acts as a small source of 1.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) on average and this annual uptake has increased from 1998 to 2012.

TI  - Semantic labeling of high-resolution aerial images using an ensemble of fully convolutional networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing data classification has been a challenging and promising research topic in the community of remote sensing. In recent years, with the rapid advances of deep learning, remarkable progress has been made in this field, which facilitates a transition from hand-crafted features designing to an automatic end-to-end learning. A deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs) based ensemble learning method is proposed to label the high-resolution aerial images. To fully tap the potentials of FCNs, both the Visual Geometry Group network and a deeper residual network, ResNet, are employed. Furthermore, to enlarge training samples with diversity and gain better generalization, in addition to the commonly used data augmentation methods (e.g., rotation, multiscale, and aspect ratio) in the literature, aerial images from other datasets are also collected for cross-scene learning. Finally, we combine these learned models to form an effective FCN ensemble and refine the results using a fully connected conditional random field graph model. Experiments on the ISPRS 2-D Semantic Labeling Contest dataset show that our proposed end-to-end classification method achieves an overall accuracy of 90.7%, a state-of-the-art in the field.

AB  - Objective:To investigate the related factors of mucosal melanoma of head and neck with lymph node metastasis for early diagnosis and further treatments. Method:A retrospective analysis of 117 cases of head and neck mucosal malignant melanoma patients which received surgical treatment was performed. Eleven cases of patients with pathologically confirmed lymph node metastasis and 33 cases without lymph node metastasis (1∶3) were randomly selected to analyze. The related factors of lymph node metastasis of head and neck mucosal melanoma patients including age, gender, whether the existence of recurrence, bone invasion, lesion location were analyzed. The single factor and logistic regression analysis were performed, P<0.05 difference was statistically significant. Result:The lymph node metastasis rate of head and neck mucosal melanoma was 9.40%(11/117), the single factor analysis showed that there were 3 factors to be associated with lymph node metastasis, which was recurrence (P=0.0000), bone invasion (P=0.001), primary position (P=0.007). Recurrence (P=0.021) was a risk factor for lymph node metastasis according to the Logistic regression analysis, and the impact of bone invasion (P=0.487) and primary location (P=0.367) remained to be further explored. Conclusion:The patients of head and neck mucosal melanoma with the presence of recurrent usually accompanied by a further progression of the disease, such as lymph node metastasis, so for recurrent patients should pay special attention to the situation of lymph node and choose the reasonable treatment.

TI  - Reconstructing spatial-temporal continuous MODIS land surface temperature using the DINEOF method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key states of the Earth surface system. Remote sensing has the capability to obtain high-frequency LST observations with global coverage. However, mainly due to cloud cover, there are always gaps in the remotely sensed LST product, which hampers the application of satellite-based LST in data-driven modeling of surface energy and water exchange processes. We explored the suitability of the data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) method in moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LST reconstruction around Ali on the Tibetan Plateau. To validate the reconstruction accuracy, synthetic clouds during both daytime and nighttime are created. With DINEOF reconstruction, the root mean square error and bias under synthetic clouds in daytime are 4.57 and -0.0472 K, respectively, and during the nighttime are 2.30 and 0.0045 K, respectively. The DINEOF method can well recover the spatial pattern of LST. Time-series analysis of LST before and after DINEOF reconstruction from 2002 to 2016 shows that the annual and inter-annual variabilities of LST can be well reconstructed by the DINEOF method.

TI  - Epidemiology of influenza in West Africa after the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, 2010-2012
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Over the last decade, capacity for influenza surveillance and research in West Africa has strengthened. Data from these surveillance systems showed influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 circulated in West Africa later than in other regions of the continent.Methods: We contacted 11 West African countries to collect information about their influenza surveillance systems (number of sites, type of surveillance, sampling strategy, populations sampled, case definitions used, number of specimens collected and number of specimens positive for influenza viruses) for the time period January 2010 through December 2012.Results: Of the 11 countries contacted, 8 responded: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. Countries used standard World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or slight variations thereof. There were 70 surveillance sites: 26 SARI and 44 ILI. Seven countries conducted SARI surveillance and collected 3114 specimens of which 209 (7%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive SARI patients, 132 (63%) were influenza A [ 68 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 64 influenza A(H3N2)] and 77 (37%) were influenza B. All eight countries conducted ILI surveillance and collected 20,375 specimens, of which 2278 (11%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive ILI patients, 1431 (63%) were influenza A [ 820 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 611 influenza A(H3N2)] and 847 (37%) were influenza B. A majority of SARI and ILI case-patients who tested positive for influenza (72% SARI and 59% ILI) were children aged 0-4 years, as were a majority of those enrolled in surveillance. The seasonality of influenza and the predominant influenza type or subtype varied by country and year.Conclusions: Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 continued to circulate in West Africa along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B during 2010-2012. Although ILI surveillance systems produced a robust number of samples during the study period, more could be done to strengthen surveillance among hospitalized SARI case-patients. Surveillance systems captured young children but lacked data on adults and the elderly. More data on risk groups for severe influenza in West Africa are needed to help shape influenza prevention and clinical management policies and guidelines.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a 1: 50,000 geomorphological map of the Talacasto river alluvial fan (93 km(2)), located in the Central Andean Precordillera of Argentina. The aim of this map is to identify and classify dynamic and potentially destructive geomorphological processes such as gully erosion, headward erosion, concentrated erosion, laminar erosion and similar features that are present in an alluvial fan, so as to identify unstable sectors for public infrastructure. This map is the result of combining remote sensing data, aerial photographs analysis and fieldwork. Landforms and active geomorphological processes are identified, classified and illustrated for this Quaternary alluvial fan. Four Quaternary landscape subunits were classified, taking into account morphogenetic characteristics and erosional processes such as: (1) Exhumed and erosional landforms inducted by neotectonic activity; (2) Alluvial landforms; (3) Polygenetic landforms covered in glacis; and (4) Playa lake landforms. The presence of desert pavements and salt-hardened subsoil formations contributes to the generation and transmission of surface runoff during summer heavy rains, causing alluvial hazards and damages in routes and roads.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study maps distribution and spatial congruence between Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and species richness of IUCN listed conservation-dependent and endemic avian fauna in Palawan, Philippines. Grey Level Co-Occurrence Texture Matrices (GLCMs) extracted from Landsat and ALOS-PALSAR were used in conjunction with local field data to model and map local-scale field AGB using the Random Forest algorithm (r = 0.92 and RMSE = 31.33 Mg.ha(-1)). A support vector regression (SVR) model was used to identify the factors influencing variation in avian species richness at a 1km scale. AGB is one of the most important determinants of avian species richness for the study area. Topographic factors and anthropogenic factors such as distance from the roads were also found to strongly influence avian species richness. Hotspots of high AGB and high species richness concentration were mapped using hotspot analysis and the overlaps between areas of high AGB and avian species richness was calculated. Results show that the overlaps between areas of high AGB with high IUCN red listed avian species richness and endemic avian species richness were fairly limited at 13% and 8% at the 1-km scale. The overlap between 1) low AGB and low IUCN richness, and 2) low AGB and low endemic avian species richness was higher at 36% and 12% respectively. The enhanced capacity to spatially map the correlation between AGB and avian species richness distribution will further assist the conservation and protection of forest areas and threatened avian species.

TI  - Effect of aerosols on different regime of clouds and their precipitation over Tehran city
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we investigate the impact of aerosols on different cloud regimes and amount of their precipitation over Tehran for the period of 2003-2014, utilizing data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and surface data from local synoptic stations. The regimes were determined using a k-means clustering method on retrieved cloud properties. The results indicate that in mixed clouds, increase in aerosols has led to increase in the mean cloud effective radius (CER), cloud height as well as lighting and precipitation amounts of weak and moderate convective cells which may be attributed to more freezing of cloud droplets above the 0 degrees C isotherm and its associated latent heat releases. Vice versa, warm clouds intensity in polluted air condition are weeker than clean air condition. The results also showed that, nimbostratus clouds thickness and their precipitation increase under high aerosol index (AI). Both TRMM and rain gauges data, however, showed that the average amount of precipitation has decreased during polluted episodes in comparison with clean episodes during the period of study. Elaborating on the observed overall changes in the amount of precipitation, it may be concluded that over Seeding was a critical factor in reducing the mean precipitation over Tehran. Also, observed differences on clouds microphysics over different parts of the city may be related to local pollutions, type of ambient air aerosols and topography conditions.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat-8, ASTER and Sentinel 1 satellite remote sensing data in automatic lineaments extraction: A case study of Sidi Flah-Bouskour inlier, Moroccan Anti Atlas
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Certainly, lineament mapping occupies an important place in several studies, including geology, hydrogeology and topography etc. With the help of remote sensing techniques, lineaments can be better identified due to strong advances in used data and methods. This allowed exceeding the usual classical procedures and achieving more precise results. The aim of this work is the comparison of ASTER, Landsat-8 and Sentinel 1 data sensors in automatic lineament extraction. In addition to image data, the followed approach includes the use of the pre-existing geological map, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as the ground truth. Through a fully automatic approach consisting of a combination of edge detection algorithm and line-linking algorithm, we have found the optimal parameters for automatic lineament extraction in the study area. Thereafter, the comparison and the validation of the obtained results showed that the Sentinel 1 data are more efficient in restitution of lineaments. This indicates the performance of the radar data compared to those optical in this kind of study. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Purification of Body and Soul for the Next Journey. Practices Surrounding Death and Dying Among Muslim Women
T2  - OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims, first, to compare normative Islamic practices toward death and dying and actual practices of Moroccan Muslim women. Second, it seeks to compare the views and practices of middle-aged and elderly women. Qualitative empirical research was conducted with 30 middle-aged and elderly Moroccan Muslim women living in Antwerp (Belgium) and with 15 experts in the field. Our study shows that religious beliefs and worldview have a great impact on Muslims' practices surrounding death and dying. More specifically, practices are strongly shaped by their eschatological beliefs. The rituals are perceived as preparations for the hereafter, entailing purification of both soul and body, and demonstrate the belief in a continued existence of the soul. We found striking similarities between our participants' views and normative Islamic views. We did not find a more secular understanding of death and dying among the middle-aged women.

TI  - A Review of Ocean/Sea Subsurface Water Temperature Studies from Remote Sensing and Non-Remote Sensing Methods
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Oceans/Seas are important components of Earth that are affected by global warming and climate change. Recent studies have indicated that the deeper oceans are responsible for climate variability by changing the Earth's ecosystem; therefore, assessing them has become more important. Remote sensing can provide sea surface data at high spatial/temporal resolution and with large spatial coverage, which allows for remarkable discoveries in the ocean sciences. The deep layers of the ocean/sea, however, cannot be directly detected by satellite remote sensors. Therefore, researchers have examined the relationships between salinity, height, and temperature of the oceans/Seas to estimate their subsurface water temperature using dynamical models and model-based data assimilation (numerical based and statistical) approaches, which simulate these parameters by employing remotely sensed data and in situ measurements. Due to the requirements of comprehensive perception and the importance of global warming in decision making and scientific studies, this review provides comprehensive information on the methods that are used to estimate ocean/sea subsurface water temperature from remotely and non-remotely sensed data. To clarify the subsurface processes, the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of the existing methods are also investigated.

TI  - Specificity of Atmospheric Correction of Satellite Data on Ocean Color in the Far East
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculation errors in ocean-brightness coefficients in the Far Eastern are analyzed for two atmospheric correction algorithms (NIR and MUMM). The daylight measurements in different water types show that the main error component is systematic and has a simple dependence on the magnitudes of the coefficients. The causes of the error behavior are considered. The most probable explanation for the large errors in ocean-color parameters in the Far East is a high concentration of continental aerosol absorbing light. A comparison between satellite and in situ measurements at AERONET stations in the United States and South Korea has been made. It is shown the errors in these two regions differ by up to 10 times upon close water turbidity and relatively high aerosol optical-depth computation precision in the case of using the NIR correction of the atmospheric effect.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF-A/VEGF-C expression in lymph node microenvironment and association with melanoma metastasis and survival
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional lymph nodes are affected frequently by melanoma metastasis. Its microenvironment may be associated with tumor progression. We investigated sentinel nodes with and without tumor and negative nodes surrounding positive nodes, looking for patterns related to tumor immune interaction and lymphovascular progression. We quantified programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A/VEGF-C expressions in lymph nodes of 103 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Two groups were studied: negative sentinel lymph nodes and positive ones. Negative lymph nodes of sequential lymphadenectomy from positive cases were also studied. Markers were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results were related to clinical/histological outcomes. VEGF-A/VEGF-C analysis showed higher positivity in metastatic nodes and higher positivity in the surrounding negative nodes from positive cases in comparison with nonmetastatic patients. Programmed cell death-ligand 1, studied only in metastasis, presented high positivity, not associated with prognosis. PD-1 expressions were similar in the groups with a 1% cutoff and higher in the metastasis with a 5% cutoff. Higher VEGF-A expression was related to higher pathological stages. PD-1 expression in the lymph node was associated with higher survival. Other clinical and histopatological variables were not associated with marker expression patterns. VEGF-A and VEGF-C expressions in lymph nodes were associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis. PD-1 expression in the lymph node was related to higher survival rates and this should be explored in the context of adjuvant immunotherapy. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Enhanced MODIS Atmospheric Total Water Vapour Content Trends in Response to Arctic Amplification
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the strength of the water vapour feedback within Arctic climate change, 15 years of the total column-integrated density of water vapour (TCWV) from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) are analysed. Arctic TCWV distribution, trends, and anomalies for the 2001-2015 period, broken down into seasons and months, are analysed. Enhanced local spring TCWV trends above the terrestrial Arctic regions are discussed in relation to land snow cover and vegetation changes. Upward TCWV trends above the oceanic areas are discussed in lien with sea ice extent and sea surface temperature changes. Increased winter TCWV (up to 40%) south of the Svalbard archipelago are observed; these trends are probably driven by a local warming and sea ice extent decline. Similarly, the Barents/Kara regions underwent wet trends (up to 40%), also associated with winter/fall local sea ice loss. Positive late summer TCWV trends above the western Greenland and Beaufort seas (about 20%) result from enhanced upper ocean warming and thereby a local coastal decline in ice extent. The Mackenzie and Siberia enhanced TCWV trends (about 25%) during spring are found to be associated with coincident decreased snow cover and increased vegetation, as a result of the earlier melt onset. Results show drier summers in the Eurasia and western Alaska regions, thought to be affected by changes in albedo from changing vegetation. Other TCWV anomalies are also presented and discussed in relation to the dramatic decline in sea ice extent and the exceptional rise in sea surface temperature.

TI  - Multi-parametric variational data assimilation for hydrological forecasting
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble forecasting is increasingly applied in flow forecasting systems to provide users with a better understanding of forecast uncertainty and consequently to take better-informed decisions. A common practice in probabilistic streamflow forecasting is to force deterministic hydrological model with an ensemble of numerical weather predictions. This approach aims at the representation of meteorological uncertainty but neglects uncertainty of the hydrological model as well as its initial conditions. Complementary approaches use probabilistic data assimilation techniques to receive a variety of initial states or represent model uncertainty by model pools instead of single deterministic models.This paper introduces a novel approach that extends a variational data assimilation based on Moving Horizon Estimation to enable the assimilation of observations into multi-parametric model pools. It results in a probabilistic estimate of initial model states that takes into account the parametric model uncertainty in the data assimilation.The assimilation technique is applied to the uppermost area of River Main in Germany. We use different parametric pools, each of them with five parameter sets, to assimilate streamflow data, as well as remotely sensed data from the H-SAF project. We assess the impact of the assimilation in the lead time performance of perfect forecasts (i.e. observed data as forcing variables) as well as deterministic and probabilistic forecasts from ECMWF. The multi-parametric assimilation shows an improvement of up to 23% for CRPS performance and approximately 20% in Brier Skill Scores with respect to the deterministic approach. It also improves the skill of the forecast in terms of rank histogram and produces a narrower ensemble spread.

TI  - Flood Mapping Tools for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response Using Satellite Data and Hydrodynamic Models: A Case Study of Bagmathi Basin, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Bihar is one of the major flood prone region in India affecting thousands of human lives and livelihoods during the recurrent floods occurring due to the monsoonal rains. While it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of extreme flood events, disaster planning can help in mitigating its detrimental effects. Monitoring flood extent using satellite observations just after the flood disasters is a core component of rapid emergency response process, which enables the emergency rescue teams to prioritize their efforts in critical areas to save lives and protect health, in addition to providing near real-time flooding information to the decision makers and planners. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of less data intensive, but equally robust hydrodynamic models to develop flood extent maps in conjunction with freely available remote sensing imageries at different scales. MODIS TERRA satellite data was used to map flood extent from 2001 to 2016 for entire Bihar. Two hydraulic models namely FLDPLN and RRI applied for the Bagmathi basin to evaluate our objectives. Both these models are of varying complexity but generate flood extent patterns with minimum amount of input data. The proposed approach is suited for mapping flood extents to provide an input information in near real time (h) when there is no availability to detailed hydraulic models and satellite datasets. Flood inundation extents from FLDPLN and RRI models were validated with Landsat-7 and MODIS TERRA derived flood extents for model performance. The results show acceptable spatial agreement between model predicted and Landsat-7 observed flood extents, denoting the utility of these tools for flood mapping application in data scarce environments.

TI  - Modified Penman-Monteith equation for monitoring evapotranspiration of wheat crop: Relationship between the surface resistance and remotely sensed stress index
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role for detecting plant water status, estimating crop water needs and optimising irrigation management. Accurate estimates of ET at field scale are therefore critical. The present paper investigates a remote sensing and modelling coupled approach for monitoring actual ET of irrigated wheat crops in the semi-arid region of Tensift Al Haouz (Morocco). The ET modelling is based on a modified Penman-Monteith equation obtained by introducing a simple empirical relationship between surface resistance (r(c)) and a stress index (SI). SI is estimated from Landsat-derived land surface temperature (LST) combined with the LST endmembers (in wet and dry conditions) simulated by a surface energy balance model driven by meteorological forcing and Landsat-derived fractional vegetation cover. The proposed model is first calibrated using eddy covariance measurements of ET during one growing season (2015-2016) over an experimental flood irrigated wheat field located within the irrigated perimeter named R3. It is then validated during the same growing season over another drip-irrigated wheat field located in the same perimeter. Next, the proposed ET model is implemented over a 10 x 10 km(2) area in R3 using a time series of Landsat-7/8 reflectance and LST data. The comparison between modelled and measured ET fluxes indicates that the model works well. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values over drip and flood sites were 13 and 12 W m(-2), respectively. The proposed approach has a great potential for detecting crop water stress and estimating crop water requirements over large areas along the agricultural season. (C) 2017 IAgrE.

AB  - This article employs an interdisciplinary approach to explore some psychological dimensions of mathematical creativity and the dogmatism that can emerge when mathematical applications are confined within a single worldview. More specifically, it explores some ways in which mathematics has been confined and distorted in service of dogmatic conceptions of important phenomena, and for various purposes, some unwittingly damaging and others wittingly nefarious. Some of the topics dealt with include the dogmatic use of distorted mathematical modeling in economics, the sterile certainty that arises from excessive entrapment within the mechanistic worldview in various disciplines, and the dogmatism of artificial precision in educational reform initiatives. Methods for breaking free of dogmatism and for injecting ethics into mathematical applications also are explored.

TI  - Chart validation of inpatient ICD-9-CM administrative diagnosis codes for ischemic stroke among IGIV users in the Sentinel Distributed Database
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD) is a large database of patient-level medical and prescription records, primarily derived from insurance claims and electronic health records, and is sponsored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for drug safety assessments. In this chart validation study, we report on the positive predictive value (PPV) of inpatient ICD-9-CM acute ischemic stroke (AIS) administrative diagnosis codes (433.x1, 434.xx, and 436) in the SDD.As part of an assessment of the risk of thromboembolic adverse events following treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IGIV), charts were obtained for 131 potential post-IGIV AIS cases. Charts were abstracted by trained nurses and then adjudicated by stroke experts using pre-specified diagnostic criteria.Case status could be determined for 128 potential AIS cases, of which 34 were confirmed. The PPVs for the inpatient AIS diagnoses recorded in the SDD were 27% overall [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 19-35], 60% (95% CI: 32-84) for principal-position diagnoses, 42% (95% CI: 28-57) for secondary diagnoses, and 6% (95% CI: 2-15) for position-unspecified diagnoses (which in the SDD generally originate from separate physician claims associated with an inpatient stay).Position-unspecified diagnoses were unlikely to represent true AIS cases. PPVs for principal and secondary inpatient diagnosis codes were higher, but still meaningfully lower than estimates from prior chart validation studies. The low PPVs may be specific to the IGIV user study population. Additional research is needed to assess the validity of AIS administrative diagnosis codes in other study populations within the SDD.

TI  - Livestock as sentinels for an infectious disease in a sympatric or adjacent-living wildlife reservoir host
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A central question to address in managing wildlife diseases is how much effort and resources are required to reduce infection prevalence to below a requisite threshold? This requires surveillance for infection in at least one species involved in the infection cycle, a process that is often expensive and time-consuming but one which could be enhanced using additional sources of readily-obtainable surveillance data. We demonstrate how surveillance data from ruminant livestock monitored for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in New Zealand can be employed in spatially-explicit modelling to help predict the probability of freedom from Mycobacterium bovis infection in a sympatric wildlife reservoir species, the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). We apply the model to a case study and compare resulting probabilities of freedom when utilizing (1) livestock data only, (2) wildlife data only, and (3) combined livestock-plus-wildlife surveillance data. Results indicated that the greatest probability of M. bovis eradication was achieved using wildlife monitoring data supplemented with livestock surveillance data. This combined approach lessened the time required for a confident (95% probability) declaration of regional eradication. However, the combined model was sensitive to the precision of the input parameters, and we describe ways to account for this. In a broad sense, this modelling approach is flexible in that any spatial arrangement of wildlife habitat and farms can be analysed, provided infection is readily detectable in both the wild and domestic animal(s) of interest. It is applicable to monitoring any communicable wildlife disease that affects regularly-tested livestock. The potential benefits to wildlife disease management include reduced surveillance costs and more rapid achievement of targeted reductions in disease prevalence.

TI  - Measurement and Partitioning of Evapotranspiration for Application to Vadose Zone Studies
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into its constituent components, evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), is important for numerous hydrological purposes including assessing impacts of management practices on water use efficiency and improved validation of vadose zone models that parameterize E and T separately. However, most long-established observational techniques have short observational timescales and spatial footprints, raising questions about the representativeness of these measurements. In the past 15 yr, new approaches have allowed ET partitioning at spatial scales ranging from the pedon to the globe and at long timescales. In this update, we review some recent methodological developments for partitioning ET. These include micrometeorological approaches involving the flux variance partitioning of high-frequency eddy covariance observations and proxies for photosynthesis and transpiration such as measurements of isotopic fractionation and carbonyl sulfide uptake. We discuss advances in partitioning the energy balance between canopy and soil using remote sensing. We conclude that the flux variance partitioning with raw eddy covariance data and the two-source energy balance approaches with remote sensing platforms may have the greatest potential for partitioning ET, in part because large public repositories of eddy covariance and satellite data could be readily reprocessed to partition ET.

TI  - Identification of Agricultural Management Zones Through Clustering Algorithms with Thermal and Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision Agriculture entails the appropriate management of the inherent variability of soil and crops, resulting in an increase of economic benefits and a reduction of environmental impact. However, site-specific treatments require maps of the soil variability to identify areas of land that share similar properties. In order to produce these maps, we propose a cost-efficient method that combines clustering algorithms with publicly available satellite imagery. The method does not require exploring the parcels with any special equipment or taking samples of the soil for laboratory analysis. The proposed method was tested in a case study for three vineyard parcels with topographical dissimilarities. The study compares different spectral and thermal bands from the Landsat 8 satellite as well as vegetation and moisture indices to determine which one produces the best clustering. The experimental results seem promising for identification of agricultural management zones. The findings suggest that thermal bands produce better clustering than those based on the NDVI index.

TI  - Decaying Lava Extrusion Rate at El Reventador Volcano, Ecuador, Measured Using High-Resolution Satellite Radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava extrusion at erupting volcanoes causes rapid changes in topography and morphology on the order of tens or even hundreds of meters. Satellite radar provides a method for measuring changes in topographic height over a given time period to an accuracy of meters, either by measuring the width of radar shadow cast by steep sided features, or by measuring the difference in radar phase between two sensors separated in space. We measure height changes, and hence estimate extruded lava volume flux, at El Reventador, Ecuador, between 2011 and 2016, using data from the RADARSAT-2 and TanDEM-X satellite missions. We find that 39 new lava flows were extruded between 9 February 2012 and 24 August 2016, with a cumulative volume of 44.8Mm(3) dense rock equivalent and a gradually decreasing eruption rate. The average dense rock rate of lava extrusion during this time is 0.310.02m(3)s(-1), which is similar to the long-term average from 1972 to 2016. Apart from a volumetrically small dyke opening event between 9 March and 10 June 2012, lava extrusion at El Reventador is not accompanied by any significant magmatic ground deformation. We use a simple physics-based model to estimate that the volume of the magma reservoir under El Reventador is greater than 3km(3). Our lava extrusion data can be equally well fit by models representing a closed reservoir depressurising during the eruption with no magma recharge, or an open reservoir with a time-constant magma recharge rate of up to 0.350.01m(3)s(-1).

TI  - Landsat-based classification in the cloud: An opportunity for a paradigm shift in land cover monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land cover maps play an important role in many applications, including monitoring of smallholder-dominated agricultural landscapes. New cloud-based computing platforms and satellite sensors offer opportunities for generating land cover maps designed to meet the spatial and temporal requirements of specific applications. Such maps can be a significant improvement compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser than 300 m, are often not representative of areas with fast-paced land use change, and have a fixed set of cover classes. Here, we present two approaches for land cover classification using the Landsat archive within Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification was performed with (1) season-based composites, where median values of individual bands and vegetation indices were generated from four years for each of four seasons, and (2) metric-based composites, where different quantiles were computed for the entire four-year period. These approaches were tested for six land cover types spanning over 18,000 locations in Zambia, with ground "truth" determined by visual inspection of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. The methods were trained on 30% of these points and tested on the remaining 70%, and results were also compared with existing land cover products. Overall accuracies of about 89% were achieved for the season- and metric-based approaches for individual classes, with 93% and 94% accuracy for distinguishing.cropland from non-cropland. For the latter task, the existing Globeland30 dataset based on Landsat had much lower accuracies (around 77% on average), as did existing cover maps at coarser resolutions. Overall, the results support the use of either season or metric-based classification approaches. Both produce better results than those obtained from previous classifiers, which supports a general paradigm shift away from dependence on standard static products and towards custom generation of on-demand cover maps designed to fulfill the needs of each specific application.

TI  - Towards fine resolution global maps of crop yields: Testing multiple methods and satellites in three countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the greatest challenges in monitoring food security is to provide reliable crop yield information that is temporally consistent and spatially scalable. An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and sub field level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000 km(2)), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000 km(2)), and wheat in northern India (450,000 km(2)). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat's sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R-2 >= 0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R-2 > 0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30 m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.

TI  - Changes in Ideational Profiles of Women of Reproductive Age in Urban Nigeria: The Role of Health Communication
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Reproductive health indicators in Nigeria remain among the poorest in the world. Modern contraceptive prevalence rate has remained practically at the same level since 2003. Whereas contraceptive use is higher in urban compared with rural areas, the majority of urban women are not using a modern contraceptive method. Low contraceptive use in the country results from unfavorable ideational variables, including knowledge, values, beliefs, and norms. Ideational segmentation allows program planners to identify groups that are homogenous with respect to ideational variables and which have similar informational and skills strengthening needs. In this study, we conducted latent class analyses with longitudinal data collected from a sample of women in 2010/2011 and 2014 to identify distinct ideational segments among women of reproductive age in six Nigerian cities at the two points in time. The analysis revealed three ideational segments at baseline: (a) Inefficacious, misinformed and unsupported, labeled Disempowered, 58.8%; (b) Efficacious, misinformed, and unsupported, labeled Unsupported, 31.8%; and (c) efficacious, supported but misinformed, labeled Skeptics, 9.4%. These groups differ in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and contraceptive use and intention to use. At endline, four ideational segments were identified: (a) Inefficacious, misinformed and unsupported, labeled Disempowered, 28.9%; (b) Efficacious, supported but misinformed, labeled Skeptics, 28.5%; (c) Efficacious, informed but unsupported, labeled Unsupported, 27.0%; and (d) efficacious, informed and supported, labeled Empowered, 15.6%. Exposure to Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative communication interventions was one of the most significant predictors of improvements in ideational characteristics over time. Messages tailored to the informational needs of the various ideational segments and that address their worldview are needed to increase contraceptive use.

TI  - Condor-E Spacecraft with a Synthetic Aperture Antenna and Its Capabilities
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main parameters of a small spacecraft (SSC) (Condor-E) and its onboard radar with a synthetic aperture antenna (SAR) are presented in the paper. Two such SSCs were launched in Russia into a 500-km orbit in June 2013 and in December 2014. The structure of the radar with synthetic aperture antenna and the basic parameters of three standard imaging modes: detailed Spotlight (DSL), detailed Stripmap (DSM), and Scan-SAR are also presented. All three modes are accompanied by radar images generated during flight tests. In this paper it is examined whether it is possible to introduce new modes (an interferometric assessment of terrain relief in the case of an "oblique" survey and the selection of moving targets) and the relevant pictures are provided. Condor-E SAR and TerraSAR are compared as typical space radars in their design and experimental modes. We conclude that the SARs perform similarly and give hope for the further augmentation of both SAR capabilities, including new modes without serious hardware modifications.

TI  - Mapping and estimating land change between 2001 and 2013 in a heterogeneous landscape in West Africa: Loss of forestlands and capacity building opportunities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In West Africa, accurate classification of land cover and land change remains a big challenge due to the patchy and heterogeneous nature of the landscape. Limited data availability, human resources and technical capacities, further exacerbate the challenge. The result is a region that is among the more understudied areas in the world, which in turn has resulted in a lack of appropriate information required for sustainable natural resources management. The objective of this paper is to explore open source software and easy-to-implement approaches to mapping and estimation of land change that are transferrable to local institutions to increase capacity in the region, and to provide updated information on the regional land surface dynamics. To achieve these objectives, stable land cover and land change between 2001 and 2013 in the Kara River Basin in Togo and Benin were mapped by direct multitemporal classification of Landsat data by parameterization and evaluation of two machine -learning algorithms. Areas of land cover and change were estimated by application of an unbiased estimator to sample data following international guidelines. A prerequisite for all tools and methods was implementation in an open source environment, and adherence to international guidelines for reporting land surface activities. Findings include a recommendation of the Random Forests algorithm as implemented in Orfeo Toolbox, and a stratified estimation protocol - all executed in the QGIS graphical use interface. It was found that despite an estimated reforestation of 10,0727 +/- 3480 ha (95% confidence interval), the combined rate of forest and savannah loss amounted to 56,271 +/- 9405 ha (representing a 16% loss of the forestlands present in 2001), resulting in a rather sharp net loss of forestlands in the study area. These dynamics had not been estimated prior to this study, and the results will provide useful information for decision making pertaining to natural resources management, land management planning, and the implementation of the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD).

TI  - Building Damage Assessment in the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, Earthquake Using Only Post-Event Dual Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper takes the 2015 Nepal earthquake as a case study to explore the use of post-event dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images for earthquake damage assessment. The radar scattering characteristics of damaged and undamaged urban areas were compared by using polarimetric features derived from PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 images, and the results showed that distinguishing between damaged and undamaged urban areas with a single polarimetric feature is challenging. A split-based image analysis, feature selection, and supervised classification were employed on a PALSAR-2 image. The texture features derived from the intensity of cross-polarization show higher correlations with the damage class. Additionally, feature selection revealed a positive influence on the overall performance. Employing 70% of the data for training and 30% data for testing, the support vector machine classifier achieved an accuracy of 80.5% compared with the reference data generated from the damage map that was provided by the United Nations Operational Satellite Applications Programme.

TI  - The Impact of Sentinel Node-Mapping in Staging High-Risk Endometrial Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the impact of sentinel lymph node (SLN)-mapping on the staging of high-risk endometrial cancer (endometrioid grade 3, serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, deep myometrial invasion, or angiolymphatic invasion).The study analyzed a series of 236 patients treated at AC Camargo Cancer Center from June 2007 to February 2017. The compared 75 patients who underwent SLN-mapping (SLN group) with 161 patients who received pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy (N-SLN group). Patients with adnexal, peritoneal, or suspicious node metastases were excluded from the study.The groups did not differ in terms of age, histologic type, or presence of deep myometrial invasion. The overall detection rate for SLNs was 85.3%, and bilateral SLNs were observed in 60% of the patients. Of 20 positive SLNs, 8 (40%) were detected only after immunohistochemistry (IHC). The findings showed an overall sensitivity of 90%, a negative predictive value of 95.7%, and a false-negative predictive value of 4.3%. The SLN group had more pelvic node metastases detected than the N-SLN group (26.7 vs 14.3%; p = 0.02). However, the rate of para-aortic node metastases did not differ between the two groups (13.5 vs 5.6%; p = 0.12). Five patients (3.5%) in the N-SLN group had isolated para-aortic node metastases versus none in the patients with SLN mapped. Additionally, the SLN group received more adjuvant chemotherapy (48 vs 33.5%; p = 0.03).The data suggest that SLN-mapping identifies more pelvic node metastases than lymph node dissection alone and increases the node detection rate by 12.5% after IHC. Furthermore, no isolated para-aortic node metastases are observed when SLN is detected.

TI  - Real-Time Surveillance of Influenza Morbidity: Tracking Intensive Care Unit Resource Utilization
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Existing real-time surveillance of influenza morbidity, based primarily on time-trended U.S. hospitalization and death data, is inadequate. These surveillance methods do not accurately predict hospital resource requirements or sufficiently capture the public health impact of the current influenza season.Objectives: To determine the feasibility and potential usefulness of tracking surrogate markers of influenza morbidity among patients hospitalized with influenza.Methods: We performed a pilot study at three tertiary care referral hospitals and retrospectively collected and analyzed data on patients admitted with influenza during the 2013-2014 influenza season. We analyzed traditional influenza surveillance metrics, including weekly statistics on admissions and deaths, as well as weekly rates and trends of intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) utilization.Results: In our three-hospital cohort, 431 patients were hospitalized with influenza and spent a total of 1,520 days in ICUs. Eighty-six (20%) of these patients required 1,080 days of mechanical ventilation, and 17 patients (4%) received 229 days of ECMO. Trends of ICU and mechanical ventilation use were similar but differed notably from trends of ECMO use, hospitalization, and death. In particular, at two hospitals, increases in utilization of ICU and mechanical ventilation among patients with influenza occurred several weeks after increases in hospitalization rates. Furthermore, ICU, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO utilization rates at the three-hospital network remained elevated for several weeks after the influenza-associated hospitalization rate declined.Conclusions: Surrogate markers of influenza severity were feasible to collect and revealed trends of ICU resource utilization that differed notably from trends of hospitalization and death given by traditional influenza surveillance metrics. A national network of sentinel hospitals that prospectively collects, time-trends, and reports additional influenza morbidity data would be useful to hospital administrators, hospital epidemiologists, infection preventionists, and public health officials.

TI  - Prioritization of subwatersheds based on quantitative morphometric analysis in lower Bhavani basin, Tamil Nadu, India using DEM and GIS techniques
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed prioritization is one of the most important processes in natural resource management system especially in areas of sustainable watershed development and planning. Morphometric characteristics are the viable entity to understand the hydrological behavior of the subwatershed. For prioritization of subwatershed, morphometric analysis was utilized by using the linear, areal, and relief aspects of the drainage basin. In this context, remote sensing and GIS has been proved to be an efficient tool to identify the morphological features. The Survey of India (SOI) topographical maps, satellite data IRS-LISS III, and Cartosat DEM data were utilized to understand the drainage pattern and also for prioritization of subwatershed areas. The prioritization of subwatershed has been attempted using novel and quantitative approaches based on compound parameter ranking for soil erosion. Lower compound factors were chosen as the most feasible for soil erosion. Based on the observation, eight subwatersheds with a higher degree of the slope were severely prone to soil erosion and remaining 21 subwatersheds occur in low-lying areas that can be developed as sustainable watersheds. The identified subwatershed requires immediate soil remediation and water conservation measures for efficient watershed planning and management. The proposed study might be helpful for resource planners, government agencies. private sectors, and other stake holders to take up soil conservation measures and fixation of water-harvesting structures for better decision making.

TI  - European guidelines (ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO consensus conference) for the management of endometrial cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. In France, in 2015, EC was the first gynecological cancer in terms of incidence. Its prognosis is considered favorable because it is most often limited to the uterus at diagnosis. Nevertheless, it is a heterogeneous pathology and 5-year overall survival can vary from 92 % to 42 % in FIGO stage I depending on its histological characteristics. This great heterogeneity leads to important disparities in its surgical management as well as in indications for adjuvant therapies. A consensus conference including three different European learned societies (ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO) has recently established new recommendations in order to standardize its management. One of the main points is the emergence of a new subgroup of patients at risk of recurrence (high-intermediate risk group). Concerning nodal staging, indications are still somewhat blurred for intermediate and high-intermediate risk groups. The sentinel lymph node biopsy remains an experimental procedure in contrast with American guidelines. Concerning adjuvant therapies, the place of chemotherapy and its combination with external beam radiotherapy should be explored, especially for patients with high risk EC and for certain histological subtypes.

TI  - Red Edge Index as an Indicator of Vegetation Growth and Vigor Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a major constituent element of chlorophyll and thylakoid proteins in the plant canopy. The amount of foliar nitrogen reflects the growth of vegetation as it affects the photosynthetic process and the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with canopy. Non-destructive approach using space-borne hyperspectral remote sensing has shown potential in estimating the nitrogen content in leaves. This study used hyperspectral image from Hyperion sensor to indicate the strand growth and vigor of Shorea robusta (Sal) forest in Doon Valley by estimating foliar nitrogen. Identification of sampling sites was done in a Sal forest patch of area (270 ha) using crown closure information based on LAI measurement. High spatial resolution satellite data, RapidEye was used for LAI mapping using ground truth data. Leaf spectra using field spectroradiometer, as well as leaf samples were collected from each sample site. The different red edge indices derived from Hyperion data were correlated against laboratory analyzed leaf nitrogen mass. Amongst these indices, Modified Normalized Difference Red Edge (MNDRE) index showed highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.89) with nitrogen mass. For generating spatial nitrogen mass map, regression equation was developed based on MNDRE index. Predicting potential of satellite based MNDRE was validated from field based spectra, as showed r = 0.91. Spatially depicted nitrogen information using hyperspectral satellite image, is one of the first demonstration of the work carried out in the tropical species of Himalaya. Spatial N distribution map has potential to be used in predicting carbon sequestration potential and disturbances caused due to pest-insect infestation, anthropogenic pressure and site degradation.

TI  - Contributions of Actual and Simulated Satellite SAR Data for Substrate Type Differentiation and Shoreline Mapping in the Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on the land cover types present and the horizontal position of the land-water interface is needed for sensitive coastal ecosystems throughout the Arctic, both to establish baselines against which the impacts of climate change can be assessed and to inform response operations in the event of environmental emergencies such as oil spills. Previous work has demonstrated potential for accurate classification via fusion of optical and SAR data, though what contribution either makes to model accuracy is not well established, nor is it clear what shorelines can be classified using optical or SAR data alone. In this research, we evaluate the relative value of quad pol RADARSAT-2 and Landsat 5 data for shoreline mapping by individually excluding both datasets from Random Forest models used to classify images acquired over Nunavut, Canada. In anticipation of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), we also simulate and evaluate dual and compact polarimetric imagery for shoreline mapping. Results show that SAR data is needed for accurate discrimination of substrates as user's and producer's accuracies were 5-24% higher for models constructed with quad pol RADARSAT-2 and DEM data than models constructed with Landsat 5 and DEM data. Models based on simulated RCM and DEM data achieved significantly lower overall accuracies (71-77%) than models based on quad pol RADARSAT-2 and DEM data (80%), with Wetland and Tundra being most adversely affected. When classified together with Landsat 5 and DEM data, however, model accuracy was less affected by the SAR data type, with multiple polarizations and modes achieving independent overall accuracies within a range acceptable for operational mapping, at 89-91%. RCM is expected to contribute positively to ongoing efforts to monitor change and improve emergency preparedness throughout the Arctic.

T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a workflow for a semi-automated forest/non-forest detection is proposed that is based on multitemporal Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) C-band backscatter and TanDEM-X Coregistered Single look Slant range Complex (CoSSC) X-band imagery and an unsupervised random forest classification approach. Therefore, numerous features that refer to frequency, polarisation, and texture were extracted from SAR data of different seasons. The aim was to develop a processing scheme that is feasible for semi-automated forest mapping and monitoring from SAR data at high spatial resolution and on annual scale. It was tested for seven study sites in Germany and Canada which represent different biomes and forest types. Results were validated against field observations and existing forest maps. The best performance for the German study sites was achieved with multitemporal Sentinel-1 backscatter data from the onset of the growing season with small incidence angle and VH polarisation, together with extracted textural features and TanDEM-X data. Producer's accuracies for the forest class of the different study sites ranged from 88.4 to 98.0%. User's accuracies ranged from 85.5 to 87.0%. Using Sentinel-1 data covering the whole growing season at a 12 day repetition rate, ascending and descending orbits and VV and VH polarisations led to comparable results. Limited data availability for the Canadian study sites resulted in on average to less reliable results than at the German sites with a higher range of producer's (62.4-98.8%) and user's accuracies (46.2-90.2%).

TI  - Lynch syndrome and endometrial cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lynch syndrome is a hereditary predisposition to many tumors, in the forefront of which endometrial cancer in women. It is related to the mutation of a mismatch repair gene, involved in DNA mismatch repair. This mutation leads to a loss of expression of the corresponding protein, and to genome instability in tumor cells. Cumulative risk at the age of 70 years is over 40 %. Endometrial cancers related to Lynch syndrome are most of the time sentinel (They reveal the predisposition in half of families.) and are characterized by young age at onset (before 60 years) and low body mass index compared with patients presenting sporadic tumors. Pathological tumor characteristics are debated but it seems to be two types of tumors according to age, older patients having standard tumors and younger ones more aggressive pattern. Endometrial cancers related to Lynch syndrome can be synchronous of ovarian cancer. Therapeutic management does not present any particularity. Conservative treatment can be considered more frequently due to young age of patients but has to respect usual guidelines. Prognosis of these tumors is controversial. Gynaecological screening, although its benefit has not been proved, appears crucial in this population, as well as prophylactic surgery, which remains the best prevention.

TI  - Semi-Automated Surface Water Detection with Synthetic Aperture Radar Data: A Wetland Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new method is proposed for semi-automated surface water detection using synthetic aperture radar data via a combination of radiometric thresholding and image segmentation based on the simple linear iterative clustering superpixel algorithm. Consistent intensity thresholds are selected by assessing the statistical distribution of backscatter values applied to the mean of each superpixel. Higher-order texture measures, such as variance, are used to improve accuracy by removing false positives via an additional thresholding process used to identify the boundaries of water bodies. Results applied to quad-polarized RADARSAT-2 data show that the threshold value for the variance texture measure can be approximated using a constant value for different scenes, and thus it can be used in a fully automated cleanup procedure. Compared to similar approaches, errors of omission and commission are improved with the proposed method. For example, we observed that a threshold-only approach consistently tends to underestimate the extent of water bodies compared to combined thresholding and segmentation, mainly due to the poor performance of the former at the edges of water bodies. The proposed method can be used for monitoring changes in surface water extent within wetlands or other areas, and while presented for use with radar data, it can also be used to detect surface water in optical images.

TI  - Chlorophyll Fluorescence Data Reveals Climate-Related Photosynthesis Seasonality in Amazonian Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia is the world largest tropical forest, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. Thus, understanding climate controls of photosynthetic activity in this region is critical. The establishment of the relationship between photosynthetic activity and climate has been controversial when based on conventional remote sensing-derived indices. Here, we use nine years of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2) sensor, as a direct proxy for photosynthesis, to assess the seasonal response of photosynthetic activity to solar radiation and precipitation in Amazonia. Our results suggest that 76% of photosynthesis seasonality in Amazonia is explained by seasonal variations of solar radiation. However, 13% of these forests are limited by precipitation. The combination of both radiation and precipitation drives photosynthesis in the remaining 11% of the area. Photosynthesis tends to rise only after radiation increases in 61% of the forests. Furthermore, photosynthesis peaks in the wet season in about 58% of the Amazon forest. We found that a threshold of approximate to 1943 mm per year can be defined as a limit for precipitation phenological dependence. With the potential increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts, forests that have the photosynthetic process currently associated with radiation seasonality may shift towards a more water-limited system.

TI  - Becoming homo sapiens sapiens: Mapping the psycho-cultural transformation in the anthropocene
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - If it is true that humans are about to leave behind the environmental conditions we have known for the 150,000-200,000 years of our species' existence, then we are now changing the context in which we have evolved to date. This means Homo sapiens will have to co-evolve further with the climatic and environmental conditions it is creating through its planetary impact in the Anthropocene. Given the rapidity of the changes humans have set in motion, however, this next evolutionary phase may be cultural rather than biological, reflected in behaviors, practices, artifacts, institutions and underlying values and worldviews, and, therefore, psychological. Such a psycho-cultural transformation is frequently called for, but rarely explored in detail. This paper presents a model of psychological transformation from the fields of depth psychology and anthropology known as an archetypal death-rebirth process. Applied to a cultural transformation, the model offers a frame to interpret this time of unprecedented environmental and cultural endings. It gives purpose and meaning to the suffering involved in transformations and, crucially, offers hope through the vision of renewal. Its tripartite progression of severance, threshold, and reincorporation provides a map for navigating the terra quasi-incognita of this transformation that tells us what to expect and therefore how to respond. Finally, it offers an explication of how a transformation far more profound than changes in actions and policies may allow us to become the truly wise humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, our species' name denotes we could be.

TI  - An Evaluation of the CHIMERE Chemistry Transport Model to Simulate Dust Outbreaks across the Northern Hemisphere in March 2014
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust is one of the most important aerosols over the world, affecting health and climate. These mineral particles are mainly emitted over arid areas but may be long-range transported, impacting the local budget of air quality in urban areas. While models were extensively used to study a single specific event, or make a global analysis at coarse resolution, the goal of our study is to simultaneously focus on several affected areasEurope, North America, Central Asia, east China and the Caribbean areafor a one-month period, March 2014, avoiding any parameter fitting to better simulate a single dust outbreak. The simulation is performed for the first time with the hemispheric version of the CHIMERE model, with a high horizontal resolution (about 10 km). In this study, an overview of several simultaneous dust outbreaks over the Northern Hemisphere is proposed to assess the capability of such modeling tools to predict dust pollution events. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the most striking episodes is presented with comparisons to satellite data, ground based particulate matter and calcium measurements. Despite some overestimation of dust concentrations far from emission source areas, the model can simulate the timing of the arrival of dust outbreaks on observational sites. For instance, several spectacular dust storms in the US and China are rather well captured by the models. The high resolution provides a better description and understanding of the orographic effects and the long-range transport of dust plumes.

TI  - High performance GPU computing based approaches for oil spill detection from multi-temporal remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills have adverse effects on the environment and economy. Near real time detection and response activities enable to better manage the required resources at the incident area for clean-up and control operations. Multi temporal remote sensing (RS) technologies are widely used to detect and monitor oil spills on the Ocean surfaces. However, current techniques using RS data for oil spill detection are time consuming and expensive in terms of computational cost and related infrastructure. The main focus of this work is oil spill detection from voluminous multi-temporal LANDSAT-7 imagery using high performance computing technologies such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and Message Passing Interface (MPI) to speed up the detection process and provide rapid response. Kepler compute architecture based GPU (Tesla K40) with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which is a parallel programming mechanism for GPU is used in the development of the detection algorithms. Oil spill detection techniques that were adapted to GPU based processing include band-ratio and Morphological attribute profile (MAP) based on six structural and shape description attributes namely, Gray mean, standard deviation, elongation, shape complexity, solidity and orientation. Experimental results show the significant gains in the computational speed of these techniques when implemented on a GPU and MPI. A GPU vs. CPU comparison shows that the proposed approach achieves a speedup of around 10 x for MAP and 14 x for band ratio approaches, which includes the data transfer cost. However, the MPI implementation using 64 cores outperforms the GPU, and executes the time intensive task of computing the above said attributes in only 18 min, whereas a GPU consumes around an hour.

TI  - Geospatial technology applied to spatiotemporal assessment of Harike Wetland, Punjab
T2  - Lakes & Reservoirs Research and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The Harike Wetland situated in Punjab is a Ramsar site and a wetland of national importance. The present study was undertaken to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the wetland on the basis of geospatial technology and ground-based studies. Landsat images for the years 2002 and 2014 were acquired from the United States Geological Survey and classified digitally to generate landuse/land cover maps involving four classes (water, grassland (including water hyacinth), agriculture, built-up (settlement), barren land). The total area of the Harike Wetland was found to be 8023.68ha. Water sampling at eleven sites was carried out and evaluated for physicochemical parameters. The water quality at several sampling points was found to be severely degraded. Change detection analysis revealed the submerged area (area under water) and grassland (including water hyacinth) had decreased over the past 12years, whereas that area under agriculture and built-up land has increased, indicating a shrinkage in the total wetland area. The present study also indicated that the near-infrared band is a good indicator of water quality parameters, as indicated by the significant positive correlation between the near-infrared band and relevant water parameters. Because the wetland is important from both an ecological perspective and economic perspective, regular monitoring is recommended, for which geospatial technology has proven to be very useful.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability significantly impact the agricultural growth, stress, cropping pattern, phenophase and its vulnerability. Satellite derived indices, climate and socio-economic data sets have been used to study the time series trend of agricultural NDVI and agriculture drought vulnerability for two states of India namely Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The study uses NOAA AVHRR GIMMS NDVI.3g. v1 (1982-2015) data set. The trend analysis of climate and soil moisture was carried out to understand their impact on the agriculture growth/stress, length of the growing period (LGP) and projected agriculture NDVI for IPCC climate AR5 2050 RCP 2.6 scenario. A novel approach is applied to the integrated data sets i.e. satellite and climate variables including socio-economic to assess the agricultural drought vulnerability at the district level, and at the tehsil level of united Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states for the recent-past. We further projected the vulnerability using IPCC AR5 2050 and 2070 climate RCP 2.6 scenario. The study has revealed that climate and soil moisture have a significant impact on LGP and agriculture condition. The predicted agricultural NDVI are near like normal years (2007 and 2013) indicating climate change signatures are not expected in near future. There is a need to improve the understanding using higher resolution soil moisture data to plan appropriate adaptive and mitigation strategies for the agricultural drought conditions in changing climate scenario.

TI  - Quantifying Changes in the Gangotri Glacier of Central Himalaya: Evidence for Increasing Mass Loss and Decreasing Velocity
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of Gangotri, one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, has been a matter of scientific debate and close scrutiny of the global hydrologic community. To comprehend the current state of Gangotri Glacier, we estimated it's geodetic mass budget and ice velocity using optical satellite data. The spatial distribution of ice thickness, using a laminar flow equation, and possible locations of glacial lake formation are also analyzed. The geodetic mass budget of Gangotri Glacier, estimated for the period of 1999-2014, yielded a value of -0.55 +/- 0.42 mw.e.a(-1). Substantial decrease in ice velocity is also noted for a nearly contemporaneous period. The average decrease in velocity for the 14 year (1999-2000 to 2013-14) observation period is computed to be 6.98 +/- 6.53 ma(-1). While the deceleration is less pronounced in the accumulation areas and along the tributaries, palpable slowdown (11.07 +/- 6.53 ma(-1)) is observed along the main trunk of the glacier. The ice velocity maps produced are further used for computing glacier ice thickness and bedrock topography. Depressions in the bedrock topography are identified as potential sites for the formation of supraglacial lakes, as and when the snout retreats. In total, eight bed overdeepenings, with a maximum volume of 56.57 +/- 8.93 x 10(6) m(3), have been identified and demarcated as potential sites for lake formation. The results presented here highlight increasing mass loss and reducing velocity patterns of the Gangotri Glacier.

T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale:In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN), internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) is also the first-echelon drainage nodes reached by metastasising cancer cells from breast cancer, which can provide important prognostic information.Patient concerns:In this paper, we will introduce a case of breast cancer patient whose postoperative pathology result showed that she had internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IMSLN) metastases but no axillary sentinel lymph node (ASLN) metastases.Diagnoses:She was diagnosed as pT1cN1bM0 breast cancer based on the positive IMSLN but negative ASLN.Interventions:She received axillary-sentinel lymph node biopsy (A-SLNB) and internal mammary-sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) guided by modified injection technique. In the choice of chemotherapy, she received dose-dense ACx4 times followed Px4 times for chemotherapy. As to irradiation therapy, she received irradiation therapy include chest wall, superclavicular region, and internal mammary nodes.Outcomes:After performing IM-SLNB, the nodal staging of this patient increased (from N0 to N1b). And she received additional chemotherapy and irradiation therapy.Lessons:With the guidance of modified injection technique, the preoperative visualization rate of IMLN has been improved. IM-SLNB could be a minimally invasive technique for effective evaluation of the status of IMLN to provide information for staging and guide the adjuvant treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to test the method of polymerase chain reaction with following fragments' length restriction to deter mine the rs2124594 polymorphism and to study its contribution in the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the post Chornobyl period.METHODS: Genotypes of rs2124594 were determined in 109 patients with CLL of B cell origin including 53 patients irradiated due to the Chornobyl NPP accident. Genotypes distribution among CLL patients was compared with healthy persons of European origin (the 1000 Genomes Project data set was used as a reference).RESULTS: Validity of the tested method was confirmed by direct sequencing. Associations between CLL risks and C allele (OR = 2.37; 95 % CI 1.50-3.73; р = 0.003), CLL risks and CT genotype (OR = 2.10; 95 % CI 1.38-3.21; р = 0.0012) were found. Distributions of rs2124594 genotypes in exposed and non exposed to ionizing radiation CLL patients did not differ.CONCLUSIONS: The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 8q24 chromosome region (positioned at 127180736 and 127183014 near с MYC gene) with CLL risks was confirmed.

TI  - Hepatitis C testing and re-testing among people attending sexual health services in Australia, and hepatitis C incidence among people with human immunodeficiency virus: analysis of national sentinel surveillance data
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Direct acting antivirals are expected to drastically reduce the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). However, rates of HCV testing, re-testing and incident infection in this group remain uncertain in Australia. We assessed trends in HCV testing, re-testing and incident infection among HIV-positive individuals, and evaluated factors associated with HCV re-testing and incident infection.Methods: The study population consisted of HIV-positive individuals who visited a sexual health service involved in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) between 2007 and 2015. Poisson regression was used to assess trends and to evaluate factors associated with HCV re-testing and incident HCV infection.Results: There were 9227 HIV-positive individuals included in our testing rate analysis. Of 3799 HIV-positive/HCV-negative people that attended an ACCESS sexual health service more than once, 2079 (54.7%) were re-tested for HCV and were therefore eligible for our incidence analysis. The rate of HCV testing increased from 17.1 to 51.4 tests per 100 patient years between 2007 and 2015 (p for trend < 0.01). Over the same period, HCV re-testing rates increased from 23.9 to 79.7 tests per 100 person years (p for trend < 0.01). A clear increase in testing and re-testing began after 2011. Patients who identified as men who have sex with men and those with a history of injecting drug use experienced high rates of HCV re-testing over the course of the study period. Among those who re-tested, 157 incident HCV infections occurred at a rate of 2.5 events per 100 person years. Between 2007 and 2009, 2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015, rates of incident HCV were 0.8, 1.5, 3.9 and 2.7 events per 100 person years, respectively (p for trend < 0.01). Incident HCV was strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use.Conclusions: High rates of HCV testing and re-testing among HIV-positive individuals in Australia will assist strategies to achieve HCV elimination through rapid treatment scale up. Continued monitoring of HCV incidence in this population is essential for guiding both HCV prevention and treatment strategies.

TI  - Quantifying post-fire fallen trees using multi-temporal lidar
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive tree-felling due to root damage is a common fire effect on burnt areas in Scandinavia, but has so far not been analyzed in detail. Here we explore if pre- and post-fire lidar data can be used to estimate the proportion of fallen trees. The study was carried out within a large (14,000 ha) area in central Sweden burnt in August 2014, where we had access to airborne lidar data from both 2011 and 2015. Three data-sets of predictor variables were tested: POST (post-fire lidar metrics), D1F (difference between post- and pre-fire lidar metrics) and combination of those two (POST_DIF). Fractional logistic regression was used to predict the proportion of fallen trees. Training data consisted of 61 plots, where the number of fallen and standing trees was calculated both in the field and with interpretation of drone images. The accuracy of the best model was tested based on 100 randomly selected validation plots with a size of 25 x 25 m.Our results showed that multi-temporal lidar together with field-collected training data can be used for quantifying post-fire tree felling over large areas. Several height-, density- and intensity metrics correlated with the proportion of fallen trees. The best model combined metrics from both datasets (POST DIF), resulting in a RMSE of 0.11. Results were slightly poorer in the validation plots with RMSE of 0.18 using pixel size of 12.5 m and RMSE of 0.15 using pixel size of 6.25 m. Our model performed least well for stands that had been exposed to high-intensity crown fire. This was likely due to the low amount of echoes from the standing black tree skeletons. Wall-to-wall maps produced with this model can be used for landscape level analysis of fire effects and to explore the relationship between fallen trees and forest structure, soil type, fire intensity or topography.

TI  - Multiple remote sensing data sources to assess spatio-temporal patterns of fire incidence over Campos Amazonicos Savanna Vegetation Enclave (Brazilian Amazon)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire activity plays an important role in the past, present and future of Earth system behavior. Monitoring and assessing spatial and temporal fire dynamics have a fundamental relevance in the understanding of ecological processes and the human impacts on different landscapes and multiple spatial scales. This work analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas in one of the biggest savanna vegetation enclaves in the southern Brazilian Amazon, from 2000 to 2016, deriving information from multiple remote sensing data sources (Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance, TRMM pluviometry and Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers). A fire scars database with 30m spatial resolution was generated using a Landsat time series. MODIS daily surface reflectance was used for accurate dating of the fire scars. TRMM pluviometry data were analyzed to dynamically establish time limits of the yearly dry season and burning periods. Burned area extent, frequency and recurrence were quantified comparing the results annually/seasonally. Additionally, Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers were used to analyze fire incidence over different types of tree cover domains. In the last seventeen years, 1.03 million ha were burned within the study area, distributed across 1432 fire occurrences, highlighting 2005, 2010 and 2014 as the most affected years. Middle dry season fires represent 86.21% of the total burned areas and 32.05% of fire occurrences, affecting larger amount of higher density tree surfaces than other burning periods. The results provide new insights into the analysis of burned areas of the neotropical savannas, spatially and statistically reinforcing important aspects linked to the seasonality patterns of fire incidence in this landscape.

TI  - Bacterial and primary production in the Greenland Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial production rates were measured in water profiles collected in the Greenland Sea and adjacent areas. Hydrography and nutrients throughout the water column were measured along 75 degrees N from 12 degrees W to 10 degrees E at 20 km distance intervals. Net primary production rates from satellite sensed data were compared with literature values from C-14 incubations and used for regional and seasonal comparisons.Maximum bacterial production rates were associated with the region close to the edge of the East Greenland current, and the rates decreased gradually towards the center of the Greenland Sea central gyre. Integrated over the upper 20 m the maximum bacterial production rate was 17.9 mmol C m(-2) day(-1), and east of the center of the gyre the average integrated rate was 4.6 mmol C m(-2) day(-1). It is hypothesized that high bacterial production rates in the western Greenland Sea were sustained by organic material carried from the Arctic Ocean by the East Greenland Current.The depth profiles of nitrate and phosphate were very similar both sides of the Arctic front, with 2% higher values between 500 m and 2000 m in the Arctic domain, and a N/P ratio of 13.6. The N/Si ratio varied by depth and region, with increasing silicate depletion from 1500 m depth to the surface. The rate of depletion from 1500 m depth to surface in the Atlantic domain was twice as high as in the Arctic domain.Net primary production rates in the area between the edge of the East Greenland current and the center of the Greenland Sea gyre was 96 mmol C m(-2) day(-1) at the time of the expedition in 2006, and 78 mmol C m(-2) day(-1) east of the center including the Atlantic domain. Annual net primary production estimated from satellite data in the Greenland Sea increased substantially in the period between 2003 and 2016, and the rate of increase was lowest close to the East Greenland Current.

TI  - Improving Empirical Magnetic Field Models by Fitting to In Situ Data Using an Optimized Parameter Approach
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for comparing and optimizing the accuracy of empirical magnetic field models using in situ magnetic field measurements is presented. The optimization method minimizes a cost function-tau-that explicitly includes both a magnitude and an angular term. A time span of 21 days, including periods of mild and intense geomagnetic activity, was used for this analysis. A comparison between five magnetic field models (T96, T01S, T02, TS04, and TS07) widely used by the community demonstrated that the T02 model was, on average, the most accurate when driven by the standard model input parameters. The optimization procedure, performed in all models except TS07, generally improved the results when compared to unoptimized versions of the models. Additionally, using more satellites in the optimization procedure produces more accurate results. This procedure reduces the number of large errors in the model, that is, it reduces the number of outliers in the error distribution. The TS04 model shows the most accurate results after the optimization in terms of both the magnitude and direction, when using at least six satellites in the fitting. It gave a smaller error than its unoptimized counterpart 57.3% of the time and outperformed the best unoptimized model (T02) 56.2% of the time. Its median percentage error in vertical bar B vertical bar was reduced from 4.54% to 3.84%. The difference among the models analyzed, when compared in terms of the median of the error distributions, is not very large. However, the unoptimized models can have very large errors, which are much reduced after the optimization.Plain Language Summary We present a method for comparing and optimizing the accuracy of commonly used empirical models that reproduce the Earth's magnetic field for altitudes ranging from a thousand to hundreds of thousands of kilometers. This method uses magnetic field data from satellites orbiting the planet to create a "penalty function" and uses an optimization algorithm to minimize this function and find the model input parameters that produce the best results for a given date and time. Our results show that these models can be improved by the use of satellite data. The model known as TS04 produced the best results after the optimization procedure generating a smaller error in 57.3% of the points in our data set when compared to the standard (unoptimized) inputs. The optimized TS04 also outperformed the best unoptimized model by 56.2%. The differences among all the models analyzed are usually not very large; however, the unoptimized models can have very large errors, which are much reduced by the optimization.

TI  - The impact on survival of two different staging strategies in apparent early stage endometrial cancer comparing sentinel lymph nodes mapping algorithm and selective lymphadenectomy: An Italian retrospective analysis of two reference centers
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The role of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is still uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the survival outcomes of two different strategies in apparent uterine confined disease by comparing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and selective lymphadenectomy (LD).Methods. We retrospectively reviewed women with preoperative stage I endometrial cancer underwent surgical staging with either SLN mapping, or LD in two Italian centers.Results. Eight hundred and two women underwent surgical staging for preoperative stage I endometrial cancer were revised (145 Monza, 657 Rome). All patients underwent peritoneal washing, simple hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and nodal staging including SLN mapping, or LD. Overall 8229 lymph nodes were removed (1595 in Monza, 6634 in Rome). Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 33.1% and 52.4% in Monza and Rome, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients with positive pelvic LN were 16.7% and 73%, in SLN and LD groups, respectively (p = 0.002). Disease-free survival (DFS) curves did not showed a statistically significant difference between centers and strategies adopted (SLN mapping, LD, SLN + LD) with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.63-2.16; p = 0.475).Conclusions. Survival outcomes were similar for both strategies. The SLN strategy allowed to identify a higher rate of stage IIIC1 disease even with a lower median number of lymph node removed in SLN group. Applying a SLN algorithm does not impair the prognosis of endometrial cancer patients. The clinical impact and management of low volume metastasis in high-risk patients should be further clarify.

T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Joint Conference on Science and Technology (IJCST)
CL  - Bali, INDONESIA
AB  - Karst terrain as Gunungsewu karst landscape has a high vulnerability on its groundwater to contamination. Karstification process occurs on karst terrain produce much fissures, crack and holes on its rocks. It's become as entrance by surface water to the groundwater. Vegetation cover has a crucial rules to minimize the contamination possibility from surface pollutant. Vegetation reduces water velocity on karst surface and filters wastes. According to the attempt to protect the Gunungsewu karst groundwater, vegetation cover characterizing and mapping of the area are needed. The aim of the research are to characterizes and maps the spatial and temporal variability of the Gunungsewu karst vegetation cover density related to dry and wet season. Vegetation cover density can be measured with Landsat 8 OLI data by using vegetation index algorithm as NDVI and RVI. The NDVI and RVI mean value are used as a basis measurement of spatial and temporal variability. The spatial variability refers to spatial distribution of NDVI and RVI mean value in some spring catchment area sample. The temporal variability refers to NDVI and RVI mean value related to dry and wet season. Field observation and measurement of vegetation density is used to validate the NDVI and RVI value, The research shows that vegetation index spread in Gunungsewu karst landscape spatially and temporally. Vegetation index mean value in wet season is higher than one in dry season. The trend lines of vegetation index mean value increase from west part to east part of Gunungsewu karst landscape in wet season, and in contrary decrease in dry season. The NDVI value has higher correlation to vegetation cover density than the RVI value correlation.

TI  - Assessment of AOD variability over Saudi Arabia using MODIS Deep Blue products
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the variability of aerosol over The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this analysis, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product from Terra and Aqua satellites for the years 2000-2013 is used. The product is validated using AERONET data from ground stations, which are situated at Solar Village Riyadh and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Jeddah. The results show that both Terra and Aqua satellites exhibit a tendency to show the spatial variation of AOD with Aqua being better than Terra to represent the ground based AOD measurements over the study region. The results also show that the eastern, central, and southern regions of the country have a high concentration of AOD during the study period. The validation results show the highest correlation coefficient between Aqua and KAUST data with a value of 0.79, whilst the Aqua and Solar Village based AOD indicates the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values which are, 0.17 and 0.12 respectively. Furthermore, the Relative Mean Bias (RMB) based analysis show that the DB algorithm overestimates the AOD when using Terra and Solar Village data, while it underestimates the AOD when using Aqua with Solar Village and MUST data. The RMB value for Aqua and Solar Village data indicates that the DB algorithm is close to normal in the study region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances in a remote population of Alaska Natives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Many Alaska Native communities rely on a traditional marine diet that contains persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The indoor environment is also a source of POPs. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroallcyl substances (PFASs) are present both in the traditional diet and the home indoor environment.Objectives: We assessed exposure to PBDEs and PFASs among residents of two remote Alaska Native villages on St. Lawrence Island. Ninespine stickleback (Pungitious pungitious) and Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) were used to detect accumulation of these compounds in the local environment.Methods: Concentrations of PBDEs and PFASs were measured in dust collected from 49 households on St. Lawrence Island, as well as in blood serum from 85 island residents. Resident ninespine stickleback and Alaska blackfish were used as sentinels to detect accumulation of PBDEs and PFASs in the food web.Results: Serum concentrations of perfiuorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) were elevated, despite low concentrations of PFASs in dust samples. Concentrations of PBDEs in dust and serum were similar to those from the contiguous United States. Statistical associations between dust and serum concentrations are apparent for a small number of PBDEs, suggesting a possible route of exposure. Predominant compounds were similar between human sera and stickleback; however, blackfish accumulated PFASs not found in either stickleback or human sera.Conclusion: Household dust contributes to PBDE exposure, but not PFAS exposure. Elevated concentrations of long chain PFASs in serum are likely due to exposure from traditional foods. The presence of both PFASs and PBDEs in sentinel fish species suggests atmospheric deposition and bioaccumulation, as well as local environmental contamination. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate five smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay fitting (SG), locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing (LO), spline smoothing (SP), asymmetric Gaussian function fitting (AG), and double logistic function fitting (DL). We use ground tower measured NDVI (10 sites) and gross primary productivity (GPP, 4 sites) to evaluate the smoothed satellite-derived NDVI time-series, and elevation data to evaluate phenology parameters derived from smoothed NDVI. The results indicate that all smoothing methods can reduce noise and improve signal quality, but that no single method always performs better than others. Overall, the local filtering methods (SG and LO) can generate very accurate results if smoothing parameters are optimally calibrated. If local calibration cannot be performed, cross validation is a way to automatically determine the smoothing parameter. However, this method may in some cases generate poor fits, and when calibration is not possible the function fitting methods (AG and DL) provide the most robust description of the seasonal dynamics.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a validated tool to assess control in allergic rhinitis patients.Objective: The aim of this study was to validate the use of VAS in the MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis) app (Allergy Diary) on smartphones screens to evaluate allergic rhinitis symptoms and disease control.Methods: Each user filled 4 different VAS measuring overall, nasal, ocular, and asthma symptoms at least once. Following COSMIN guidelines, we evaluated internal consistency, (Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest), reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients), sensitivity, and acceptability of the MASK-Rhinitis VAS.Results: Between 1 August 2015 and 31 July 2016, the app was used 14 612 times in 15 countries. A total of 1225 users used it more than once, during the evaluated period. The tool resulted to be statistically satisfactory, showing excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's test > 0.84, test-retest > 0.7), reliability (> 0.9), and acceptability. In addition, the tool had a good sensitivity when users (n = 521) answered the VAS twice in less than 3 hours.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The MASK-rhinitis VAS is a reliable and valid tool to assess allergic control on smartphone screens, at the population level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is causing widespread glacier retreat, with many small glaciers disappearing from the world's mountain ranges. We obtained the annual mass balance of a small glacier (the Ningchan No. 1 Glacier) located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, from the years 2010 to 2015 using glaciological and geodetic methods. We also measured the glacier's thickness in 2014 using ground-penetrating radar. Employing topographical maps and ZY-3 images, we obtained Digital Elevation Models for 1972 and 2014. Our results showed that the mean annual mass balance from 2010 to 2015 was similar to-0.9 +/- 0.5 m w.e. The mean equilibrium line altitude was similar to 4680 m in the period 2010-15, which exceeds the maximum elevation of the glacier. The glacier has lost area and mass across its elevation range. The mean ice thickness was 24.0 +/- 2.5 m in 2014. From 1972 to 2014, the glacier's area shrank from 0.77 +/- 0.05 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 km(2), and the ice volume decreased by (14.96 +/- 0.97) x 106 m(3), equivalent to (12.72 +/- 0.82) x 106 t w.e. over the same period.

TI  - Implications of sensor design for coral reef detection: Upscaling ground hyperspectral imagery in spatial and spectral scales
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing offers a potential tool for large scale environmental surveying and monitoring. However, remote observations of coral reefs are difficult especially due to the spatial and spectral complexity of the target compared to sensor specifications as well as the environmental implications of the water medium above. The development of sensors is driven by technological advances and the desired products. Currently, spaceborne systems are technologically limited to a choice between high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution, but not both. The current study explores the dilemma of whether future sensor design for marine monitoring should prioritise on improving their spatial or spectral resolution. To address this question, a spatially and spectrally resampled ground-level hyperspectral image was used to test two classification elements: (1) how the tradeoff between spatial and spectral resolutions affects classification; and (2) how a noise reduction by majority filter might improve classification accuracy. The studied reef, in the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat), Israel, is heterogeneous and complex so the local substrate patches are generally finer than currently available imagery. Therefore, the tested spatial resolution was broadly divided into four scale categories from five millimeters to one meter. Spectral resolution resampling aimed to mimic currently available and forthcoming spaceborne sensors such as (1) Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) that is characterized by 25 bands of 6.5 nm width; (2) VEN.sS with 12 narrow bands; and (3) the WorldView series with broadband multispectral resolution. Results suggest that spatial resolution should generally be prioritized for coral reef classification because the finer spatial scale tested (pixel size < 0.1 m) may compensate for some low spectral resolution drawbacks. In this regard, it is shown that the post-classification majority filtering substantially improves the accuracy of all pixel sizes up to the point where the kernel size reaches the average unit size (pixel < 0.25 m). However, careful investigation as to the effect of band distribution and choice could improve the sensor suitability for the marine environment task. This in mind, while the focus in this study was on the technologically limited spaceborne design, aerial sensors may presently provide an opportunity to implement the suggested setup.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove forests: Are we taking full advantage of technology?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. This paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research.

TI  - Exploratory Data Analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Measurements to Distinguish the Sea Surface Expressions of Naturally-Occurring Oil Seeps from Human-Related Oil Spills in Campeche Bay (Gulf of Mexico)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements for discriminating between two oil slick types observed on the sea surface: naturally-occurring oil seeps versus human-related oil spillsthe use of satellite sensors for this task is poorly documented in scientific literature. A long-term RADARSAT dataset (2008-2012) is exploited to investigate oil slicks in Campeche Bay (Gulf of Mexico). Simple Classification Algorithms to distinguish the oil slick type are designed based on standard multivariate data analysis techniques. Various attributes of geometry, shape, and dimension that describe the oil slick Size Information are combined with SAR-derived backscatter coefficientssigma-(sigma(o)), beta-(beta(o)), and gamma-(gamma(o)) naught. The combination of several of these characteristics is capable of distinguishing the oil slick type with -70% of overall accuracy, however, the sole and simple use of two specific oil slick's Size Information (i.e., area and perimeter) is equally capable of distinguishing seeps from spills. The data mining exercise of our EDA promotes a novel idea bridging petroleum pollution and remote sensing research, thus paving the way to further investigate the satellite synoptic view to express geophysical differences between seeped and spilled oil observed on the sea surface for systematic use.

TI  - Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in acral lentiginous melanoma: a study of a large cohort of cases from Latin America
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a poor prognosis subtype and is the most prevalent in non-Caucasian populations. The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been associated with poor prognosis in melanoma. A large cohort of ALM cases was studied to determine status of TIL and its association with outcome.All patients with cutaneous melanoma presenting from 2005 to 2012 at Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas in Peru were retrospectively identified. Clinicopathological information was obtained from the medical charts. A prospective evaluation of TIL was performed. Analysis of association between ALM and clinicopathological features including TIL as well as survival analysis compared the outcome of ALM to whole group and extremity NALM was performed.537 ALM from a total of 824 cutaneous melanoma cases were studied. Older age (p = 0.022), higher Breslow (p = 0.008) and ulceration (p < 0.001) were found to be more frequent in ALM. Acral had worse overall survival (OS) compared with the whole group (p = 0.04). Clinical stage (CS) I-II patients had a median OS of 5.3 (95% CI 4.3-6.2) for ALM and 9.2 (95% CI 5.0-7.0) for extremity NALM (p = 0.016). Grade 0 (absence of TIL), I, II and III were found in 7.5, 34.5, 32.1, and 25.9%, respectively. Lower TIL grade was associated with larger tumor size (p = 0.003), higher Breslow (p = 0.001), higher Clark level (p = 0.007), higher CS (p = 0.002), extremity location (p = 0.048), histological subtype ALM (p = 0.024) and better OS (p = 0.001).ALM is highly prevalent in Peru and carries poor outcome. Lower TIL levels were associated with poor outcome and ALM.

TI  - InSAR to support sustainable urbanization over compacting aquifers: The case of Toluca Valley, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper illustrates how InSAR alone can be used to delineate potential ground fractures related to aquifer system compaction. An InSAR-derived ground fracturing map of the Toluca Valley, Mexico, is produced and validated through a field campaign. The results are of great interest to support sustainable urbanization and show that InSAR processing of open-access Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 satellites can lead to reliable and cost-effective products directly usable by cities to help decision-making.The Toluca Valley Aquifer (TVA) sustains the water needs of two million inhabitants living within the valley, a growing industry, an intensively irrigated agricultural area, and 38% of the water needs of the megalopolis of Mexico City, located 40 km east of the valley. Ensuring water sustainability, infrastructure integrity, along with supporting the important economic and demographic growth of the region, is a major challenge for water managers and urban developers. This paper presents a long-term analysis of ground fracturing by interpreting 13 years of InSAR-derived ground displacement measurements. Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) techniques are applied over three SAR datasets totalling 93 acquisitions from Envisat, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-IA satellites and covering the period from 2003 to 2016.From 2003 to 2016, groundwater level declines of up to 1.6 m/yr, land subsidence up to 77 mm/yr, and major infrastructure damages are observed. Groundwater level data show highly variable seasonal responses according to their connectivity to recharge areas. However, the trend of groundwater levels consistently range from -0.5 to -1.5 m/yr regardless of the well location and depth. By analysing the horizontal gradients of vertical land subsidence, we provide a potential ground fracture map to assist in future urban development planning in the Toluca Valley.

TI  - Estimation and mapping of above-ground biomass of mangrove forests and their replacement land uses in the Philippines using Sentinel imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) missions offers a new opportunity for land-based biomass mapping and monitoring especially in the tropics where deforestation is highest. Yet, unlike in agriculture and inland land uses, the use of Sentinel imagery has not been evaluated for biomass retrieval in mangrove forest and the non-forest land uses that replaced mangroves. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Sentinel imagery for the retrieval and predictive mapping of above-ground biomass of mangroves and their replacement land uses. We used Sentinel SAR and multi spectral imagery to develop biomass prediction models through the conventional linear regression and novel Machine Learning algorithms. We developed models each from SAR raw polarisation backscatter data, multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and canopy biophysical variables. The results show that the model based on biophysical variable Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 was more accurate in predicting the overall above-ground biomass. In contrast, the model which utilised optical bands had the lowest accuracy. However, the SAR-based model was more accurate in predicting the biomass in the usually deficient to low vegetation cover non-forest replacement land uses such as abandoned aquaculture pond, cleared mangrove and abandoned salt pond. These models had 0.82-0.83 correlation/agreement of observed and predicted value, and root mean square error of 27.8-28.5 Mg ha(-1). Among the Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, the red and red edge bands (bands 4, 5 and 7), combined with elevation data, were the best variable set combination for biomass prediction. The red edge-based Inverted Red Edge Chlorophyll Index had the highest prediction accuracy among the vegetation indices. Overall, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide satisfactory results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of the above-ground biomass of mangroves and the replacement non-forest land uses, especially with the inclusion of elevation data. The study demonstrates encouraging results in biomass mapping of mangroves and other coastal land uses in the tropics using the freely accessible and relatively high-resolution Sentinel imagery.

TI  - Seasonal Variability in Regional Ice Flow Due to Meltwater Injection Into the Shear Margins of Jakobshavn Isbrae
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of meltwater injection into the shear margins of Jakobshavn Isbrae via drainage from water-filled crevasses on ice flow is examined. We use Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager panchromatic, high-resolution imagery to monitor the spatiotemporal variability of seven water-filled crevasse ponds during the summers of 2013 to 2015. The timing of drainage from water-filled crevasses coincides with an increase of 2 to 20% in measured ice velocity beyond Jakobshavn Isbrae shear margins, which we define as extramarginal ice velocity. Some water-filled crevasse groups demonstrate multiple drainage events within a single melt season. Numerical simulations show that hydrologic shear weakening due to water-filled crevasse drainage can accelerate extramarginal flow by as much as similar to 35% within 10km of the margins and enhance mass flux through the shear margins by 12%. This work demonstrates a novel mechanism through which surface melt can influence regional ice flow.

TI  - Evaluation of Poly(Lactic-co-glycolic) Acid Alone or in Combination with Hydroxyapatite on Human-Periosteal Cells Bone Differentiation and in Sinus Lift Treatment
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most recent advances in tissue engineering in the fields of oral surgery and dentistry have aimed to restore hard and soft tissues. Further improvement of these therapies may involve more biological approaches and the use of dental tissue stem cells in combination with inorganic/organic scaffolds. In this study, we analyzed the osteoconductivity of two different inorganic scaffolds based on poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid alone (PLGA-Fisiograft) or in combination with hydroxyapatite (PLGA/HA-Alos) in comparison with an organic material based on equine collagen (PARASORB Sombrero) both in vitro and in vivo. We developed a simple in vitro model in which periosteum-derived stem cells were grown in contact with chips of these scaffolds to mimic bone mineralization. The viability of cells and material osteoconductivity were evaluated by osteogenic gene expression and histological analyses at different time points. In addition, the capacity of scaffolds to improve bone healing in sinus lift was examined. Our results demonstrated that the osteoconductivity of PLGA/HA-Alos and the efficacy of scaffolds in promoting bone healing in the sinus lift were increased. Thus, new clinical approaches in sinus lift follow-up should be considered to elucidate the clinical potential of these two PLGA-based materials in dentistry.

TI  - China's Search for Ideological Values in World Politics: Chinese Adaptation to Liberal Order Drawn from Political Reports of the Chinese Communist Party Congress since 1977
T2  - PACIFIC FOCUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States and China have now become the world's leading countries but, problematically, there is no strategically shared consensus among policymakers and scholars in these countries on how to manage the bilateral relationship or the international system in the long term. This G-2-style entity, effectively a hegemonic condominium or duopoly, could stably manage the international system and short-circuit a hegemonic war between the dominant and rising powers. China's adaptation to international liberal order has appeared in Chinese Communist Party Congress (CCPC) documents during the last four decades. From the 11th CCPC in 1977 to the 18th CCPC in 2012, there were many changes in Chinese terminology seeking its ideological values in world politics. Traditional terminology of the Marxist-Leninist worldview was replaced with China's new political ideology based on material interest; meanwhile, China's historical theme of peace and development underlies the basic position of Chinese foreign policy. Negating hegemonic power still often offers a traditional view of world politics and China has proposed more positive terminologies about international relations rather than merely criticizing US hegemony and the inequalities of the global distribution of power. According to the political report of the Chinese Communist Party, China has revised its position and adapted a more active engagement to international liberal order. The foreign affairs section of the CCPC political report reveals a significant increase in interest-oriented terminology, which engages with the current Western liberal order. The world should look forward to learning about how China supports liberal order and cooperates with the United States in global politics.

TI  - Variability of Total Suspended Matter in the Northern Coastal Bay of Bengal as Observed from Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal regions of northern Bay of Bengal (BoB) are one of the most turbid areas owing to the large freshwater discharge from the three major river systems. This study is conducted to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of total suspended matter (TSM) in the northern BoB. TSM concentration derived from medium resolution imaging spectrometer for the period 2002-2011 is used for this study. TSM concentration is observed to be the highest during summer monsoon season along the north-eastern region, off the Ganges-Brahmaputra river mouth. The variability of the TSM concentration depicts the role of river runoff associated with the summer monsoon in influencing the same. It is observed that the sediment concentration tapers away towards the offshore regions with the maximum extent observed up to 21.5A degrees N latitude. Interannual variability is also observed with highest TSM concentrations occurring in the years 2003, 2008 and 2011 and least during 2004. Time series analysis performed at three major river discharge regions illustrated the distinct and highly variable nature of TSM dynamics prevailing in the northern BoB.

TI  - Does lymph node status influence adjuvant therapy decision-making in women 70 years of age or older with clinically node negative hormone receptor positive breast cancer?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Women >= 70 years old with clinically (c) lymph node (LN) negative (-), hormone receptor (HR) positive (+) breast cancer are recommended not to be routinely staged with a sentinel LN biopsy. We sought to determine how this affects adjuvant decision-making.Methods: Statistical analyses were performed to determine the association of LN evaluation with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cLN-, HR + breast cancer patients in the National Cancer Database.Results: Between 2004 and 2013, there were 193,728 patients aged 70-90 with cLN-, HR + breast cancer; 15.0% were LN+. LN + patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy (28.3% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001), hormonal therapy (83.6% vs. 71.4%, p < 0.001), post-lumpectomy radiation therapy (81.4% vs. 73.6%, p < 0.001) and post-mastectomy radiation therapy (30.3% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001).Conclusion: 15% of patients aged 70-90 will be LN+. These patients more frequently receive systemic and radiation therapy. LN status may affect treatment in these patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of a sentinel surveillance system for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in the country of Georgia, 2015-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Due to reports of substandard influenza preparedness, the country of Georgia developed two influenza surveillance systems. This paper describes these surveillance systems in their capacity to detect influenza.Methods: Two surveillance systems for influenza operate in Georgia: an influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance system for out-patient cases, based in the capital, Tbilisi, and a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance system for in-patient cases with five sentinel sites - one in Tbilisi, and four in Kutaisi. Patients in these surveillance systems provide samples for laboratory testing, including influenza confirmation.Results: From 2015-2016, 825 cases were surveilled in the ILI surveillance system and 1367 cases were surveilled in the SARI surveillance system, with 222 (26.9%) and 451 (33.0%) positive for influenza, respectively. Influenza positivity varied by age with adults 30-64 years having highest proportion of influenza-positive cases at 42.2%.Conclusions: The sensitivity of the surveillance systems to influenza was relatively high compared to neighboring countries. These findings show the importance of influenza surveillance in the country of Georgia. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - The success of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy: A single institution review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The appropriate management of the axilla among women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy is in evolution.Method: A retrospective review of a prospective database of women with breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant systemic therapy using endocrine/chemotherapy (NE/CT) from 2002 to 2015 was performed.Results: We reviewed 253 women: triple negative breast cancer (30%), ER_HER2- (44%) breast cancer and HER2+ (25%) disease. The mean age was 55 years (SD = 12). 197 patients were analyzed based on their axillary disease. 33 patients (35%) who had clinical N1-3 disease prior to neoadjuvant therapy had no axillary metastases at definitive surgery. There were no significant differences in overall survival or local/regional recurrence between patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or SLNB+ALND (p = 0.05061 and p = 0.33).Conclusion: SLNB is a viable technique in patients with breast cancer undergoing NE/CT. Patients with pre-neoadjuvant therapy proven axillary disease may be a candidate for SLNB as opposed to planned ALND with good multidisciplinary review of their response and localization of previously positive lymph nodes.

TI  - Temporal evolution of photon energy emitted from two-component advective flows: origin of time lag
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - X-ray time lag of black hole candidates contains important information regarding the emission geometry. Recently, study of time lags from observational data revealed very intriguing properties. To investigate the real cause of this lag behavior with energy and spectral states, we study photon paths inside a two-component advective flow (TCAF) which appears to be a satisfactory model to explain the spectral and timing properties. We employ the Monte Carlo simulation technique to carry out the Comptonization process. We use a relativistic thick disk in Schwarzschild geometry as the CENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer (CENBOL) which is the Compton cloud. In TCAF, this is the post-shock region of the advective component. Keplerian disk on the equatorial plane which is truncated at the inner edge i.e. at the outer boundary of the CENBOL, acts as the soft photon source. Ray-tracing code is employed to track the photons to a distantly located observer. We compute the cumulative time taken by a photon during Comptonization, reflection and following the curved geometry on the way to the observer. Time lags between various hard and soft bands have been calculated. We study the variation of time lags with accretion rates, CENBOL size and inclination angle. Time lags for different energy channels are plotted for different inclination angles. The general trend of variation of time lag with QPO frequency and energy as observed in satellite data is reproduced.

TI  - Co-Orbital Sentinel 1 and 2 for LULC Mapping with Emphasis on Wetlands in a Mediterranean Setting Based on Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data combined with the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) machine learning classifier for mapping land use and land cover (LULC) with emphasis on wetlands. In this context, the added value of spectral information derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to the classification accuracy was also evaluated. As a case study, the National Park of Koronia and Volvi Lakes (NPKV) located in Greece was selected. LULC accuracy assessment was based on the computation of the classification error statistics and kappa coefficient. Findings of our study exemplified the appropriateness of the spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel data in obtaining a rapid and cost-effective LULC cartography, and for wetlands in particular. The most accurate classification results were obtained when the additional spectral information was included to assist the classification implementation, increasing overall accuracy from 90.83% to 93.85% and kappa from 0.894 to 0.928. A post-classification correction (PCC) using knowledge-based logic rules further improved the overall accuracy to 94.82% and kappa to 0.936. This study provides further supporting evidence on the suitability of the Sentinels 1 and 2 data for improving our ability to map a complex area containing wetland and non-wetland LULC classes.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing for Ocean Biology: An Indian Perspective
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Oceans play an important role in maintaining the Earth's climate and provide vital natural resources. Ocean biota, in particular phytoplankton plays a fundamental role in regulating the Earth's energy balance. Atmospheric carbon is fixed by these organisms and further phytoplankton acts as primary producers in oceanic food webs. Space based observations using ocean colour sensors have provided unique information about the global distribution and temporal variability of oceanic phytoplankton. India has made significant progress in developing ocean colour science and have launched two ocean colour sensors namely OCM-1 and OCM-2. The data provided by these remote sensing instruments, on phytoplankton distribution around Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has been extensively used to understand marine ecosystem, as well as for identifying productive regions for potential fishing zones. This paper provides a review of work done in India during the last three decades in the broad field of space based marine biology.

TI  - Detection of Fog Using Temporally Consistent Algorithm With INSAT-3D Imager Data Over India
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fog detection algorithm using INSAT-3D imager data has been developed and tested. The algorithm emphasizes continuous fog detection as the current fog detection algorithm which is used for the operational fog product generation over India is having temporal discontinuity during dawn and dusk. Moreover, currently, the INSAT-3D fog product over India is being generated with different algorithms for day and night. In this paper, a single algorithm using brightness temperature difference of 3.9 and 10.8 mu m wavelength for both day and night has been used. The thermal infrared, water vapor, and visible channel spectral information (for daytime) has been used as additional criteria to reduce false alarm. The thresholds used are determined dynamically using an image-based method. The spatial homogeneity test, which is a special characteristic of fog, has also been carried out to minimize false detection. Validation was carried out against visibility data over five airports in the Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains of India. It shows that probability of detection and false detection to be 66% and 10%, respectively, for 2013-2014 and 68% and 10% for 2015-2016. The algorithm is able to capture the entire life cycle of fog from formation to dissipation, consistently for both the season with different weather conditions.

TI  - Atmospheric aerosol variability above the Paris Area during the 2015 heat wave - Comparison with the 2003 and 2006 heat waves
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol layers during the heat wave of July 2015 over Paris Area have been studied using a N-2-Raman lidar with co- and cross-polarized channels. The lidar observations are examined to allow the identification of main aerosol types and their origins, in synergy with measurements of the AERONET sun photometer network and back trajectory studies from the HYSPLIT model. The results are compatible with spaceborne observations of MODIS and CALIOP. As for previous heat waves of August 2003 and July 2006 occurring in France, the aerosol optical thickness is very large, up to 0.8 at the lidar wavelength of 355 nm (between 0.5 and 0.7 at 550 nm). However, air mass trajectories highlight that the observed aerosol layers may have multiple and diverse origins during the 2015 heat wave (North America, Northwest Africa, Southern and Northern Europe). Biomass burning, pollution and desert dust aerosols have been identified, using linear particle depolarization ratio, lidar ratio and analysis of back trajectories initiated at the altitudes and arrival times of the plumes. These layers are elevated and are shown to have little impact on surface aerosol concentrations (PM10 < 40 mu g m(-3) or PM2.5< 25 mu g m(-3)) and therefore no influence on the local air quality during the 2015 heat wave, unlike in 2003 and 2006. However, they significantly modify the radiative budget by trapping part of the solar ingoing/outgoing fluxes, which leads to a mean aerosol radiative forcing close to +50 +/- 17 Wm(-2) per aerosol optical thickness unit at 550 nm (AOT(550)) for solar zenith angles between 55 and 75 degrees, which are available from sunphotometer measurements. This value is smaller than those of the 2003 and 2006 heat waves, which are assessed to be +95 +/- 13 and +70 +/- 18 Wm(-2)/AOT(550), respectively. The differences between the heat wave of 2015 and the others are mainly due to both the nature and the diversity of aerosols, as indicated by the dispersion of the single scattering albedo distributions at 550 nm: 0.90 +/- 0.03, 0.95 +/- 0.02 and 0.93 +/- 0.04 for 2003, 2006 and 2015, respectively.

TI  - Empirical Modeling of Leaf Chlorophyll Content in Coffee (<i>Coffea Arabica</i>) Plantations With Sentinel-2 MSI Data: Effects of Spectral Settings, Spatial Resolution, and Crop Canopy Cover
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Approaches to monitor coffee leaf Chl are necessary for field, landscape, regional, and national scale decision making to improve coffee stand health and productivity and to reduce yield losses. In this study, we investigated the influence of spectral settings, spatial resolution, and age-related crop canopy cover on leaf Chl modeling performance with Sentinel-2 MSI data. We ran the random forest algorithm to predict coffee leaf Chl using all nine Sentinel-2 MSI bands at 20 m, all nine bands at 10 m, five bands at 10 m, and four bands at 20 m spatial resolutions for all coffee stands (3-8 years, N = 72), and then for mature stands only (5-8 years, N = 60). Results showed that the best modeling results (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 6.8) were achieved when all the bands at 10 m spatial resolution were used inmodeling coffee leafChl for all coffee stands. The prediction accuracy improved (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 5.9) when only mature coffee stands were used. The 20-m bands (red-edge and shortwave infrared) performed similarly in coffee leaf Chl estimation as using all bands at 20 m and using only 10-m bands for all coffee stands and for mature coffee stands. Accuracy metrics were highest and error values lowest when coffee leaf Chlwas estimated for mature stands only compared towhen all coffee stands were modeled. We concluded that Sentinel-2MSI is a valuable dataset for predicting coffee Chl; however, based on our findings, we suggest that finer spatial resolutions of 10 m applied on mature coffee stands should be adopted in modeling coffee Chl.

TI  - High abundance of protein-like fluorescence in the Amerasian Basin of Arctic Ocean: Potential implication of a fall phytoplankton bloom
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seawater samples from the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas were collected along,a shelf-slope-basin gradient and analyzed for chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (i.e., CDOM and FDOM, respectively). Unexpected high protein -like FDOM (035 +/- 0.40 and 0.24 +/- 0.34 RU for peaks B and T, respectively) levels were identified, which corresponded to 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those documented by previous reports. This unique phenomenon could be attributed to a fall phytoplankton bloom. The seawater chl-alpha data, estimated from in situ fluorescence measurements and satellite remote sensing data, showed the subsurface chl-a maximum of up to 1.52 mg m(-3) at similar to 25-70 m depths and the surface monthly average values (August 2015) up to 0.55 to 0.71 mg m(-3), which fall in the range of similar to 0.5-2.0 mg m(-3) during fall phytoplankton blooms in this area. Meanwhile, the depth profile of DOM parameters revealed subsurface maxima of protein-like fluorescence peaks along the shelf-slope gradient. The positive correlations between the protein-like peaks and biological index implied the lateral transport of DOM and nutrients from the shelf to the slope and basin. Despite still being a largely ice-covered environment, potential shifts in the ecosystem appear to make progress in response to changing climate in the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A New Regionalization Scheme for Effective Ecological Restoration on the Loess Plateau in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To prevent potentially unsuitable activities during vegetation restoration, it is important to examine the impact of historical restoration activities on the target ecological system to inform future restoration policies. Taking the Loess Plateau of China as an example, a regionalization method and corresponding scheme were proposed to select suitable vegetation types (forested lands, woody grasslands/bushlands, grasslands, or xerophytic shrublands and semi-shrublands) for a given location using remote sensing technology in order to analyze the vegetation growth status before and after the largest ecological conservation project in the country: The Grain for Green Program (GTGP). To design the scheme, remote sensing data covering the periods before and after the implementation of the GTGP (the 1980s and 2001-2013) were collected, along with soil, meteorological, and topographic data. The net primary production (NPP) values for 2001-2013 were calculated using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Locations representing the native vegetation and the restored vegetation were first recognized using maps of vegetation cover. Then, for the restored vegetation area, the places suitable for planting the covered vegetation type were selected by comparing the NPP value of the corresponding vegetation type in the native vegetation area to the NPP value in the site under consideration. Third, half of these sites were uniformly selected based on their NPP value, and these areas and the native vegetation area were used as training regions. Based on weather, soil, and topographic data, a new regionalization scheme was designed using standardized Euclidean distances. Finally, data from the remainder of the Loess Plateau were used to validate the new regionalization scheme, which was also compared to an existing Chinese eco-geographical regionalization scheme. The results showed that the new regionalization scheme performed well, with an average potential classification accuracy of 81.81%. Compared with the eco-geographical regionalization scheme, the new scheme exhibited improved the consistency of vegetation dynamics, reflecting the potential to better guide vegetation restoration activities on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Estimating surface <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Which remote sensing model to use?
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Various approaches and models have been proposed to remotely estimate surface pCO(2) in the ocean, with variable performance as they were designed for different environments. Among these, a recently developed mechanistic semi-analytical approach (MeSAA) has shown its advantage for its explicit inclusion of physical and biological forcing in the model, yet its general applicability is unknown. Here, with extensive in situ measurements of surface pCO(2), the MeSAA, originally developed for the summertime East China Sea, was tested in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where river plumes dominate water's biogeochemical properties during summer. Specifically, the MeSAA-predicted surface pCO(2) was estimated by combining the dominating effects of thermodynamics, river-ocean mixing and biological activities on surface pCO(2). Firstly, effects of thermodynamics and river-ocean mixing (pCO(2@Hmixing)) were estimated with a two-endmember mixing model, assuming conservative mixing. Secondly, pCO(2) variations caused by biological activities (Delta pCO(2@bio)) was determined through an empirical relationship between sea surface temperature (SST)-normalized pCO(2) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 8-day composite chlorophyll concentration (CHL). The MeSAA-modeled pCO(2) (sum of pCO(2@Hmixing) and Delta pCO(2@bio)) was compared with the field-measured pCO(2). The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 22.94 mu atm (5.91%), with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.25, mean bias (MB) of - 0.23 mu atm and mean ratio (MR) of 1.001, for pCO(2) ranging between 316 and 452 mu atm. To improve the model performance, a locally tuned MeSAA was developed through the use of a locally tuned Delta pCO(2@bio) term. A multivariate empirical regression model was also developed using the same dataset. Both the locally tuned MeSAA and the regression models showed improved performance comparing to the original MeSAA, with R-2 of 0.78 and 0.84, RMSE of 12.36 mu atm (3.14%) and 10.66 mu atm (2.68%), MB of 0.00 mu atm and - 0.10 mu atm, MR of 1.001 and 1.000, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the uncertainties in the predicted pCO(2) as a result of the uncertainties in the input variables of each model. Although the MeSAA was more sensitive to variations in SST and CHL than in sea surface salinity (SSS), and the locally tuned MeSAA and the empirical regression models were more sensitive to changes in SST and SSS than in CHL, generally for these three models the bias induced by the uncertainties in the empirically derived parameters (river endmember total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), biological coefficient of the MeSAA and locally tuned MeSAA models) and environmental variables (SST, SSS, CHL) was within or close to the uncertainty of each model. While all these three models showed that surface pCO(2) was positively correlated to SST, the MeSAA showed negative correlation between surface pCO(2) and SSS and CHL but the locally tuned MeSAA and the empirical regression showed the opposite. These results suggest that the locally tuned MeSAA worked better in the river dominated northern GOM than the original MeSAA, with slightly worse statistics but more meaningful physical and biogeochemical interpretations than the empirical regression model.Because data from abnormal upwelling were not used to train the models, they are not applicable for waters with strong upwelling, yet the empirical regression approach showed ability to be further tuned to adapt to such cases.

TI  - A pan-tropical cascade of fire driven by El Nino/Southern Oscillation
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a pronounced influence on year-to-year variations in climate(1). The response of fires to this forcing(2) is complex and has not been evaluated systematically across different continents. Here we use satellite data to create a climatology of burned-area and fire-emissions responses, drawing on six El Nino and six La Nina events during 1997-2016. On average, reductions in precipitation and terrestrial water storage increased fire emissions in pan-tropical forests by 133% during and following El Nino as compared with La Nina. Fires peaked in equatorial Asia early in the ENSO cycle when El Nino was strengthening (Aug-Oct), before moving to southeast Asia and northern South America (Jan-Apr), Central America (Mar-May) and the southern Amazon (Jul-Oct) during the following year. Large decreases in fire occurred across northern Australia during Sep-Oct of the second year from a reduced fuel availability. Satellite observations of aerosols and carbon monoxide provided independent confirmation of the spatiotemporal evolution of fire anomalies. The predictable cascade of fire across different tropical continents described here highlights an important time delay in the Earth system's response to precipitation redistribution. These observations help to explain why the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 increases during El Nino(3) and may contribute to improved seasonal fire forecasts.

TI  - Cancer-Induced Bone Pain Management Through Buddhist Beliefs
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dealing with physical pain represents a huge public health expenditure, especially for cancer-induced bone pain, one of the most difficult health issues, which impairs appetite, sleep, and mobility, negatively impacting quality of life and evoking mental problems. Although some literature has reported positive correlation between religion and pain management, there is a dearth of research examining the effectiveness of Buddhism on this topic. This study investigates the usefulness of Buddhist beliefs in managing cancer-induced bone pain through a case example. It illustrates how an advanced cancer patient, with the assistance of a counsellor, perceived pain and coped with it and pain-induced mental problems via Buddhist teachings and practices, including the four noble truths, the law of dependent origination, and karma. It offers alternative perspectives for helping professionals (such as physicians, nurses, counsellors, social workers, hospice and palliative service providers, and pain management practitioners) who are keen to equip themselves with a wider worldview and life view to better serve their clients.

TI  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast: Four case reports and review of the literature
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale:Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the breast is a rare entity comprising specific morphological and immunohistochemical features, and has been previously only reported in 33 cases.Patient concerns:Four cases of MEC of the breast are reported in this study. All patients were women with ages ranging from 39 to 66 years. The lesions consisted of neoplastic solid nests and cystic spaces sometimes filled with mucoid material.Diagnoses:At high power, the tumors were composed of various proportions of basaloid, intermediate, epidermoid, and mucinous cells in different cases. All cases were classified as low-grade MEC of the breast. Tumor cells exhibited low levels of hormonal receptor expression in two cases (cases 1 and 3), and immunonegativity in one case (case 2). On the contrary, estrogen receptors (ER) were positively expressed in 60% of tumor cells in case 4. Tumor cells did not express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu protein in all the cases.Interventions:Modified radical mastectomy (Auchincloss) was performed in the first two cases, while the remaining two patients underwent mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy.Outcomes:All patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrent disease after a period ranging from 4 months to 156 months.Lessons:MEC of the breast is a rare primary carcinoma that is difficult to diagnose. Multiple tissue blocks are necessary before obtaining all cell types. Special stains for mucin and electron microscopy would be helpful in suspected cases. Hormonal factors might have an impact on the biological behavior of tumors, but further studies are needed to draw conclusions.

TI  - Integrated water security plan for water scarcity villages in central India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Madhya Pradesh in India has been facing severe problem of drinking water scarcity during summer. The problem is compounded by local geological setup and moderate rainfall and excessive irrigation over draft. Taking cue from a holistic approach, a water security plan is prepared on watershed basis for water scarcity villages in Bamori block of Guna district in Madhya Pradesh which builds for sustainability of water source and utilization to cater the water needs at village level. The present investigations entail that GW withdrawal and recharge value signifying that withdrawal substantially exceeds the recharge, leading to the depletion of groundwater level. About 99.48 % groundwater is used for irrigation and rest for domestic uses. GW stage development (> 100 %) indicates that the scope of GW development is already exhausted and comes under over-exploited/critical category. Physicochemical groundwater quality parameters are within the permissible limits. Thematic information was derived from satellite data which serve as a basis of generated composite thematic layer and useful for preparation of water security plan and GW augmentation. The study reveals that systematic scientific investigations help in development of GW resources which can cater the needs of population residing in the area. It requires development of institutional capabilities at the village level for preparing holistic plans for water security in water scarcity villages.

TI  - Fractal-Based Pattern Extraction From Time-Series NDVI Data for Feature Identification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial coarseness of time-series satellite data (>= 250 m) and land cover mixing within a pixel poses difficulties in identifying a unique reference profile for each land cover class in regional level mapping. This problem is exaggerated further in a hilly terrain with different topographic, climatic, environmental conditions, and landscape composition. In this regard, this study aims to evaluate the usefulness of two reference-independent fractal dimension (FD) estimation techniques (box counting and rescaled range) for identifying land cover classes from the MODIS (MOD13Q1-v5) 16-day interval time-series normalized difference vegetation index profile at the pixel level. We have analyzed the FD images from each technique using Welch's t-statistics to evaluate the interclass mean FD variations in Himachal Pradesh-a mountainous state in Northern India. Furthermore, a support vector machine-based classification is performed using time-series principal components in conjunction with FD measures to assess the effectiveness of FD images in improving the accuracy of land use and land cover classification. The experiments revealed that the use of FD images has considerably increased the user accuracy and helped in accurately detecting mixed pixels which are dominated by agriculture class.

TI  - Mapping diffuse photosynthetically active radiation from satellite data in Thailand
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, calculation of monthly average hourly diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using satellite data is proposed. Diffuse PAR was analyzed at four stations in Thailand. A radiative transfer model was used for calculating the diffuse PAR for cloudless sky conditions. Differences between the diffuse PAR under all sky conditions obtained from the ground-based measurements and those from the model are representative of cloud effects. Two models are developed, one describing diffuse PAR only as a function of solar zenith angle, and the second one as a multiple linear regression with solar zenith angle and satellite reflectivity acting linearly and aerosol optical depth acting in logarithmic functions. When tested with an independent data set, the multiple regression model performed best with a higher coefficient of variance R-2 (0.78 vs. 0.70), lower root mean square difference (RMSD) (12.92% vs. 13.05%) and the same mean bias difference (MBD) of -2.20%. Results from the multiple regression model are used to map diffuse PAR throughout the country as monthly averages of hourly data. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An effective ensemble classification framework using random forests and a correlation based feature selection technique
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classification of heterogeneous land surfaces with homogeneous land cover classes is a challenging task as satellite images are characterized by a large number of features in the spectral and spatial domains. The identifying relevance of a feature or feature set is an important task for designing an effective classification scheme. Here, an ensemble of random forests (RF) classifiers is realized on the basis of relevance of features. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) was utilized to assess the relevance of a subset of features by studying the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. Predictability of RF was greatly improved by random selection of the relevant features in each of the splits. An investigation was carried out on different types of images from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat ETM+) and QuickBird sensors. It has been observed that the performance of the RF classifier was significantly improved while using the optimal set of relevant features compared with a few of the most advanced supervised classifiers such as maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), Navie Bayes, multi-layer perception (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and bagging.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the efficacy of the Biogents Gravid Aedes Trap (BG-GAT) and Biogents-2 Sentinel (BG2S) trap to assess differences in adult mosquito collection rates between these 2 mosquito surveillance methods in northeastern Florida. Species diversity of trap collections was significantly greater for BG2S than for BG-GAT, with 14 mosquito species collected from the former trap and 4 species from the latter. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were the 2 predominant species collected in both traps. Overall, BG2S traps collected significantly more mosquitoes (in some instances nearly 5 times) than the BG-GAT, regardless of species. There was no significant difference between the 2 traps with respect to gravid status when total species and number of mosquitoes collected were compared. However, at the species level, 8% of Ae. aegypti were gravid from the BG-GAT collections compared with 1% from the BG2S. The number of gravid Cx. quinquefasciatus was also considerably greater (59%) for the BG-GATs than for BG2S traps (2%), but these relationships were not statistically significant due to high variability in collections between traps.

TI  - Neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and modified multivisceral transplantation for an advanced small intestinal neuroendocrine neoplasm: an updated case report.
T2  - Innovative surgical sciences
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Small intestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (SI-NEN) frequently metastasise to regional lymph nodes, and surgery is the mainstay of therapy for such patients. However, despite the possible use of advanced surgical techniques, the resection of both primary and locoregional diseases is not always attainable. Intestinal and multivisceral transplantation has been performed in a small number of patients with conventionally nonresectable, slow-growing tumours threatening the mesenteric root but has remained controversial. The use of donor skin in "sentinel flaps" in transplantation theoretically offers advantages in tailoring immunosuppression and monitoring for rejection. We represent (with extended follow-up) the first case of a patient with inoperable extensive mesenteric metastases from SI-NEN, who underwent neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy before a modified multivisceral transplant with a concomitant vascularised sentinel forearm flap. At 48 months after transplantation, our patient remained at full physical activity with no evidence of disease recurrence on either tumour biochemistry or radiological imaging.

TI  - In Situ and Satellite Observation of CDOM and Chlorophyll-a Dynamics in Small Water Surface Reservoirs in the Brazilian Semiarid Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed chlorophyll-a and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) dynamics from field measurements and assessed the potential of multispectral satellite data for retrieving water-quality parameters in three small surface reservoirs in the Brazilian semiarid region. More specifically, this work is comprised of: (i) analysis of Chl-a and trophic dynamics; (ii) characterization of CDOM; (iii) estimation of Chl-a and CDOM from OLI/Landsat-8 and RapidEye imagery. The monitoring lasted 20 months within a multi-year drought, which contributed to water-quality deterioration. Chl-a and trophic state analysis showed a highly eutrophic status for the perennial reservoir during the entire study period, while the non-perennial reservoirs ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with changes associated with the first events of the rainy season. CDOM characterization suggests that the perennial reservoir is mostly influenced by autochthonous sources, while allochthonous sources dominate the non-perennial ones. Spectral-group classification assigned the perennial reservoir as a CDOM-moderate and highly eutrophic reservoir, whereas the non-perennial ones were assigned as CDOM-rich and oligotrophic-dystrophic reservoirs. The remote sensing initiative was partially successful: the Chl-a was best modelled using RapidEye for the perennial one; whereas CDOM performed best with Landsat-8 for non-perennial reservoirs. This investigation showed potential for retrieving water quality parameters in dry areas with small reservoirs.

TI  - You're Hired! Mortality Salience Increases Americans' Support for Donald Trump
T2  - ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Support for presidential candidate Donald Trump increased in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, California, similar to Americans' greater enthusiasm for President George W. Bush after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center. According to terror management theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon; Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski), people are prone to embrace charismatic politicians in times of historical upheaval to mitigate existential terror. Consistent with this view, previous research has demonstrated that reminders of death (relative to an aversive control condition) increased support for a charismatic leader in a hypothetical gubernatorial election, and support for President Bush and his policies in Iraq prior to the 2004 presidential election. The present Study 1 hypothesized and found that a death reminder increased support for Donald Trump. Study 2 found that while Hillary Clinton was viewed more favorably than Donald Trump in an aversive control condition, Mr. Trump was viewed more favorably in response to a death reminder while impressions of Mrs. Clinton were unaffected. Study 3 demonstrated that asking people to think about immigrants moving into their neighborhood increased the accessibility of implicit death thoughts. These findings suggest that electoral outcomes and public policy can be affected when existential concerns are aroused.

TI  - Evolution to environmental contamination ablates the circadian clock of an aquatic sentinel species
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental contamination is a common cause of rapid evolution. Recent work has shown that Daphnia pulex, an important freshwater species, can rapidly evolve increased tolerance to a common contaminant, sodium chloride (NaCl) road salt. While such rapid evolution can benefit organisms, allowing them to adapt to new environmental conditions, it can also be associated with unforeseen tradeoffs. Given that exposure to environmental contaminants can cause circadian disruption, we investigated whether the circadian clock was affected by evolving a tolerance to high levels of road salt. By tracking the oscillations of a putative clock gene, period, we demonstrated that D.pulex express permRNA with approximately 20-hr oscillations under control conditions. This putative circadian rhythm was ablated in response to high levels of salinity; populations adapted to high NaCl concentrations exhibited an ablation of period oscillation. Moreover, we showed that while gene expression is increased in several other genes, including clock, actin, and Na+/K+-ATPase, upon the adaptation to high levels of salinity, per expression is unique among the genes we tracked in that it is the only gene repressed in response to salt adaptation. These results suggest that rapid evolution of salt tolerance occurs with the tradeoff of suppressed circadian function. The resultant circadian disruption may have profound consequences to individuals, populations, and aquatic food webs by affecting species interactions. In addition, our research suggests that circadian clocks may also be disrupted by the adaptation to other environmental contaminants.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An important component of the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative is the active post-market risk identification and analysis (ARIA) system, which utilizes semi-automated, parameterized computer programs to implement propensity-score adjusted and self-controlled risk interval designs to conduct targeted surveillance of medical products in the Sentinel Distributed Database. In this manuscript, we review literature relevant to the development of these programs and describe their application within the Sentinel Initiative.RECENT FINDINGS: These quality-checked and publicly available tools have been successfully used to conduct rapid, replicable, and targeted safety analyses of several medical products. In addition to speed and reproducibility, use of semi-automated tools allows investigators to focus on decisions regarding key methodological parameters. We also identified challenges associated with the use of these methods in distributed and prospective datasets like the Sentinel Distributed Database, namely uncertainty regarding the optimal approach to estimating propensity scores in dynamic data among data partners of heterogeneous size.SUMMARY: Future research should focus on the methodological challenges raised by these applications as well as developing new modular programs for targeted surveillance of medical products.

TI  - Tracking Dynamic Northern Surface Water Changes with High-Frequency Planet CubeSat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent deployments of CubeSat imagers by companies such as Planet may advance hydrological remote sensing by providing an unprecedented combination of high temporal and high spatial resolution imagery at the global scale. With approximately 170 CubeSats orbiting at full operational capacity, the Planet CubeSat constellation currently offers an average revisit time of <1 day for the Arctic and near-daily revisit time globally at 3 m spatial resolution. Such data have numerous potential applications for water resource monitoring, hydrologic modeling and hydrologic research. Here we evaluate Planet CubeSat imaging capabilities and potential scientific utility for surface water studies in the Yukon Flats, a large sub-Arctic wetland in north central Alaska. We find that surface water areas delineated from Planet imagery have a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of <11% and geolocation accuracy of <10 m as compared with manual delineations from high resolution (0.3-0.5 m) WorldView-2/3 panchromatic satellite imagery. For a 625 km(2) subarea of the Yukon Flats, our time series analysis reveals that roughly one quarter of 268 lakes analyzed responded to changes in Yukon River discharge over the period 23 June-1 October 2016, one half steadily contracted, and one quarter remained unchanged. The spatial pattern of observed lake changes is heterogeneous. While connections to Yukon River control the hydrologically connected lakes, the behavior of other lakes is complex, likely driven by a combination of intricate flow paths, underlying geology and permafrost. Limitations of Planet CubeSat imagery include a lack of an automated cloud mask, geolocation inaccuracies, and inconsistent radiometric calibration across multiple platforms. Although these challenges must be addressed before Planet CubeSat imagery can achieve its full potential for large-scale hydrologic research, we conclude that CubeSat imagery offers a powerful new tool for the study and monitoring of dynamic surface water bodies.

TI  - How <i>Toxoplasma</i> and malaria parasites defy first, then exploit host autophagic and endocytic pathways for growth
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Infections caused by the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium and Toxoplasma are wide-spread, life-threatening and therapeutically challenging. These pathogens are obligate intracellular microorganisms that invade mammalian cells by forming a self-made niche, the parasitophorous vacuole that is impervious to host lysosomal fusion. Shortly after invasion, a noncanonical xenophagic pathway resembling LC3-associated phagocytosis is activated by the host cell to control infections,. However, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma have elaborated strategies to avoid clearance by the sentinel activities of the host autophagic system. After this initial confrontation, replicating Plasmodium and Toxoplasma adeptly usurp, for their own benefit, host autophagic and endocytic structures by attracting these organelles to their vacuole, likely to access their nutrient-rich content. The pleomorphic function of the autophagy system, from microbial defense to nutrient supply, is reflected by its ambivalent role during the intracellular development of these apicomplexan parasites.

TI  - Remote sensing for restoration planning: how the big picture can inform stakeholders
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing in ecosystem management has transformed how land managers, practitioners, and policymakers evaluate ecosystem loss, gain, and change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Less developed is the use of these spatial tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating ecosystem restoration projects and especially so in multifunctional landscapes. We use a case study approach in a multistakeholder tropical dryland restoration project to highlight the potential of remotely sensed products to quantitatively and economically guide often conflicting restoration priorities with stakeholder objectives. High-resolution digital elevation models derived from an airborne remote sensing platform informed land managers tasked with endangered species restoration by guiding their efforts to highly suitable areas of the landscape where plant growth, performance, and survival should be greater. In turn, satellite-based monitoring offered a temporal approach to broadly quantify vegetation fire risk in order to restrict fire promoting activities in dry landscapes most modified by fire promoting invasive grasses. Together, the delineation of high suitability areas for plant-based restoration and low suitability areas for wildfire management ultimately releases moderate suitability land for alternative land uses deemed important in multistakeholder landscapes. We review the benefits of using remotely sensed data for restoration planning, and highlight the costs and benefits of various data sources.

TI  - Analysis of surface deformations over the whole Italian territory by interferometric processing of ERS, Envisat and COSMO-SkyMed radar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric processing of series of data acquired over time by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites makes it possible to measure millimetric deformations (typically due to landslides, subsidence and earthquake or volcanic phenomena) and to monitor the stability of terrain and infrastructures. Despite the unique capability to observe very large areas, this technology has been typically applied to the analysis of relatively small sites or specific geophysical phenomena. In this work, we present the first application of this technology to a national scale project, which required the processing, through advanced persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) techniques, of about 20,000 SAR images acquired from 1992 to 2014 over the whole Italian territory by the ERS, Envisat, and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. The obtained results provide a huge database of surface deformation measurements covering the last 20 years and the whole Italian territory, which represents an extremely useful and pioneering service for geo-hazards mapping and prevention.

TI  - Loire and Gironde turbid plumes: Characterization and influence on thermohaline properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Symposium of Oceanography of the Bay of Biscay (ISOBAY)
CL  - Bilbao, SPAIN
AB  - Knowledge and predictability of turbid river plumes is of great importance because they modulate the properties of the seawater adjacent to river mouths. The Loire and Gironde Rivers form the most important plumes in the Bay of Biscay, as they provide > 75% of total runoff. The development of the turbid plume under the influence of its main drivers was analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data from the period 2003-2015. River discharge was found to be the main driver, followed by wind, which also had an important effect in modulating the turbid plume during periods of high river discharge. Seaward and upwelling favorable winds enhanced the dispersion of plumes on seawater, whereas landward and downwelling favorable winds limited mixing with the adjacent ocean water. The maximum extension of the turbid plume was reached under landward winds. In addition, the spatio-temporal evolution of the East Atlantic pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation was observed to affect the dynamics of plumes: positive values of both indices favored a greater extension of the plume. Thermohaline properties differed inside and outside the area affected by both rivers. In particular, these rivers maintain winter stratification inside the turbid plume, which results in a different warming ratio when compared with the adjacent ocean.

TI  - Temporal and spatial variation in phytoplankton biomass based on remote sensing data in the East China Sea.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - The rich natural resources that occur in the East China Sea (ECS) provide great economic benefits to the associated coastal districts; therefore, research on the water quality in this region is of great significance. As biological indicators of water quality, information regarding temporal and spatial distributions of phytoplankton biomass and growth cycles, as well as modifications caused by climate change is important for understanding the ecology of the ECS. Many researchers have been concerned about the characteristics of phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic Ocean; however, there are few relevant studies in this region. The present study occurred during a period of phytoplankton bloom in the ECS and provides a significant reference value for an ecologically representative area. The present study selected nine regions with the same area at different geographical locations, latitudes, and ecological characteristics, and applied chlorophyll a (Chl-a) data from Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to analyze the spatial-temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton bloom phenomenon in the ECS during 1997-2015. The Gauss curve model was adopted by fitting the data collected to obtain the time of bloom initiation, bloom peak, bloom completion, and bloom duration in the ECS. The Gauss curve fitting model was applicable to conform to the Gaussian distribution of the data. To test whether the dataset accorded with a normal distribution (Gaussian distribution), the study applied the Kolmogorov. Smirnov test. The single-peak moving Gaussian model was applied to fit the spring and summer algal bloom outbreaks and define the phytoplankton blooms at the beginning and end of the marker for Chl-a concentration to reach a peak of 20%. The research demonstrated the distribution pattern at the spatial scale, with phytoplankton biomass in the open sea being lower than that in the offshore area. The areas with maximum biomass were the seas of the Yangtze River estuary, the Taizhou region, and the two areas closest to the Yellow Sea. The areas with minimum biomass were the seas of the Nanji Islands and Taiwan Strait. Therefore, the closer the phytoplankton was to the South China Sea, the lower was the biomass. Algal blooms occurred in the Yangtze River estuary from June to September and in the Yangtze River estuary in May and from July to August. Phytoplankton blooms at Taizhou Island occurred during May and July. The algae in the eastern part of the ECS occurred from November and December to January and February in the following year. Phytoplankton blooms at Nanji Islands concentrated during February and March, and the ECS algae in the northern areas between May and June. The biomass of phytoplankton in the northern outer seas was low and algae were mostly present in March and April. In general, the two sections of the research region, which were divided by the Nanji Islands, demonstrated the same regularity, the time taken for phytoplankton to reach peak biomass was prolonged, and the duration of the phytoplankton blooms increased from high latitudes to low latitudes.

TI  - Investigating spatiotemporal snow cover variability via cloud-free MODIS snow cover product in Central Alborz Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is a major source of streamflow in Central Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. Hence, understanding the spatial distribution and temporal variation of snow is crucial for proper management of limited water resources in this region. Since the in-situ measurements in the area are not sufficient, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products, for which their capabilities in providing a spatially distributed and accurate mapping of snow have been well demonstrated. In this analysis, we considered all the available MODIS acquisitions from both Aqua and Terra satellites for a total of 4873 daily tiles of MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 with 500-meters spatial resolution (version 5), collected during the winter seasons between years 2002 and 2015. The problem of cloud coverage, with serious constraints to the snow mapping in the area, is addressed by developing a sequential cloud removal algorithm, which applies different methods subsequently considering their performance in each month. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce 94% of cloud coverage and preserve the accuracy of cloud-removed area by 93%. In addition, a clear decreasing trend in snow cover is observed in the region. For example, trend analysis (at 10% significance level) shows that 61% of areas between 2000 and 2300 m elevation levels experienced a reduction in duration of annual snow cover. Moreover, a general reduction in the duration of snow season is also evident over the entire study area. In spite of short duration (13 years) used in this research, outcomes indicate a severe snow cover reduction during recent years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Deep-Learning-Based Forecasting Ensemble to Predict Missing Data for Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of missing data in remote sensing analysis is manifold. The situation becomes more serious during multi-temporal analysis when data at various a-periodic timestamps are missing. In this work, we have proposed a deep-learning-based framework ( Deep-STEP_ FE) for reconstructing the missing data to facilitate analysis with remote sensing time series. The idea is to utilize the available data from both earlier and subsequent timestamps, while maintaining the causality constraint in spatiotemporal analysis. The framework is based on an ensemble of multiple forecasting modules, built upon the observed data in the time-series sequence. The coupling between the forecasting modules is accomplished with the help of dummy data, initially predicted using the earlier part of the sequence. Then, the dummy data are progressively improved in an iterative manner so that it can best conform to the next part of the sequence. Each of the forecasting modules in the ensemble is based on Deep-STEP, a variant of the deep stacking network learning approach. The work has been validated using a case study on predicting the missing images in normalized difference vegetation index time series, derived from Landsat-7 TM-5 satellite imagery over two spatial zones in India. Comparative performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting ensemble.

TI  - Forest fragmentation and human population varies logarithmically along elevation gradient in Hindu Kush Himalaya - utility of geospatial tools and free data set
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is the largest and the most diverse mountain region in the world that provides ecosystem services to one fifth of the total world population. The forests are fragmented to different degrees due to expansion and intensification of human land use. However, the quantitative relationship between fragmentation and demography has not been established before for HKH vis-A -vis along elevation gradient. We used the globally available tree canopy cover data derived from Landsat-TM satellite to find out the decadal forest cover change over 2000 to 2010 and their corresponding fragmentation levels. Using SRTM-derived DEM, we observed high forest cover loss up to 2400 m that highly corroborated with the population distribution pattern as derived from satellite observation. In general, forest cover loss was found to be higher in south-eastern part of HKH. Forest fragmentation obtained using 'area-weighted mean radius of gyration' as indicator, was found to be very high up to 2400 m that also corroborated with high human population for the year 2000 and 2010. We observed logarithmic decrease in fragmentation change (area-weighted mean radius of gyration value), forest cover loss and population growth during 2000-2010 along the elevation gradient with very high R (2) values (i.e., 0.889, 0.895, 0.944 respectively). Our finding on the pattern of forest fragmentation and human population across the elevation gradient in HKH region will have policy level implication for different nations and would help in characterizing hotspots of change. Availability of free satellite derived data products on forest cover and DEM, grid-data on demography, and utility of geospatial tools helped in quick evaluation of the forest fragmentation vis-a-vis human impact pattern along the elevation gradient in HKH.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Simulation of LAI on Basis of Rainfall and Growing Degree Days
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dimensionless Leaf Area Index (LAI) is widely used to characterize vegetation cover. With recent remote sensing developments LAI is available for large areas, although not continuous. However, in practice, continuous spatial-temporal LAI datasets are required for many environmental models. We investigate the relationship between LAI and climatic variable rainfall and Growing Degree Days (GDD) on the basis of data of a cold semi-arid region in Southwest Iran. For this purpose, monthly rainfall and temperature data were collected from ground stations between 2003 and 2015; LAI data were obtained from MODIS for the same period. The best relationship for predicting the monthly LAI values was selected from a set of single- and two-variable candidate models by considering their statistical goodness of fit (correlation coefficients, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients, Root Mean Square Error and mean absolute error). Although various forms of linear and nonlinear relationships were tested, none showed a statistically meaningful relationship between LAI and rainfall for the study area. However, a two-variable nonlinear function was selected based on an iterative procedure linking rainfall and GDD to the expected LAI. By taking advantage of map algebra tools, this relationship can be used to predict missing LAI data for time series simulations. It is also concluded that the relationship between MODIS LAI and modeled LAI on basis of climatic variables shows a higher correlation for the wet season than for dry season.

TI  - Large areas surface deformation analysis through a cloud computing P-SBAS approach for massive processing of DInSAR time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present in this work a methodology for computing surface deformation time series and mean velocity maps of large areas. Our approach relies on the availability of a multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from ascending and descending orbits over an area of interest, and also permits us to estimate the vertical and horizontal (East-West) components of the Earth's surface deformation. The adopted methodology is based on an advanced cloud computing implementation of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) processing chain which allows the unsupervised processing of large SAR data volumes, from the raw data (level-0) imagery up to the generation of the corresponding DInSAR time series and maps. The solution presented, which is highly scalable, has been tested on ascending and descending ENVISAT SAR archives comprising approximately 400 GB of data, which have been acquired over a large area of southern California (US) that extends over about 90,000 km(2). Such an input dataset has been processed in parallel by exploiting 280 computing nodes of the Amazon Web Services Cloud environment The overall processing lasted about 8 h and cost approximately $1900 USD. Moreover, to produce the final mean deformation velocity maps of the vertical and horizontal (East-West) displacement components of the whole investigated area, we also took advantage of the information available from external GPS measurements that permit us to account for possible regional trends not easily detectable by DInSAR and to refer the P-SBAS measurements to an external geodetic datum.The results presented clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach that paves the way to the extensive use of the available ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT SAR data archives. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be particularly suitable to deal with the very large data flow provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation, thus permitting the extension of the DInSAR analyses at a nearly global scale.

TI  - WorldView-2 sensor for the detection of hematite and goethite in tropical soils
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to simulate the bands of the WorldView-2 sensor from laboratory specters, in order to study its potential to detect iron oxides, besides proposing a spectral index based on the depth of the spectral feature (RHGt(Pf)). The iron index (IFe) and the hematite index (IHm), developed by Madeira Netto for bands of Landsat TM-5 sensor, were adjusted for WorldView-2 to test the potential of the new yellow band. The results showed that the yellow band degrades to 2% compared to the red one. This is due to fact that mineral quantification and identification are in the absorption feature, not in the reflectance one, and it is only improved in the visualization of color. A new spectral index, the RHGt(PF), based on the depth feature with the continuum-removed spectra, was proposed, since the new bands of the WorldView-2 sensor the coastal blue and yellow bands-allow a better individualization of the absorption features for goethite and hematite separately. The new index is statistically similar to the ratio Hm / Gt + Hm; however, it is not similar to the mineralogical relation obtained with Munsell colors.

Infections of adults are mostly asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms, while transplacental crossing of these viruses to the developing fetus can have important teratogenic effects. Research mainly focused on congenital malformations has established a correlation between the developmental stage at which a fetus is infected and the outcome of an Akabane virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar correlation also applies to Schmallenberg virus infections but is not yet entirely conclusive. Experimental and field data furthermore suggest that Akabane virus is more efficient in inducing congenital malformations than Aino and Schmallenberg virus, certainly in cattle.The mechanism by which these Simbu viruses cross-pass yearly periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climate zones remains undefined. Yearly wind-borne reintroductions of infected midges from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been proposed, just as overwintering in long-lived adult midges. Experimental and field data however indicate that a role of vertical virus transmission in the ruminant host currently cannot be excluded as an overwintering mechanism. More studies on Culicoides biology and specific groups of transplacentally infected newborn ruminants without gross malformations are needed to shed light on this matter.

TI  - Subsidence related to groundwater pumping for breweries in Merchtem area (Belgium), highlighted by Persistent Scaterrer Interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - ERS, ENVISAT and TerraSAR-X Synthetic Aperture Radar scenes covering the time span 1992-2014 were processed using a Persistent Scatterer technique to study the ground movements in Merchtem (25 km NW of Brussels, Belgium). The processed datasets, covering three consecutive time intervals, reveal that the investigated area is affected by a global subsidence trend related to the extraction of groundwater in the deeper Cambro-Silurian aquifer. Through time the subsidence pattern is reduced and replaced by an uplift related to the rising water table attested by piezometers located in this aquifer. The subsidence is finally reduced to a zone where currently three breweries are very active and pump groundwater in the Ledo-Paniselian aquifer and in the Cambro-Silurian for process water for the production.

TI  - Determining the Frequency of Dry Lake Bed Formation in Semi-Arid Mongolia From Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Mongolian Plateau, the desert steppe, mountains, and dry lake bed surfaces may affect the process of dust storm emissions. Among these three surface types, dry lake beds are considered to contribute a substantial amount of global dust emissions and to be responsible for hot spots of dust outbreaks. The land cover types in the study area were broadly divided into three types, namely desert steppe, mountains, and dry lake beds, by a classification based on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) calculated from MODIS Terra satellite images, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). This dry lake beds extracting method using remote sensing offers a new technique for identifying dust hot spots and potential untapped groundwater in the dry lands of the Gobi region. In the study area, frequencies of dry lake bed formation were calculated during the period of 2001 to 2014. The potential dry lake area corresponded well with the length of the river network based on hydrogeological characterization (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.001). We suggest that the threshold between dry lake bed areas and the formation of ephemeral lakes in semi-arid regions is eight days of total precipitation.

TI  - Enhanced system for maternal mortality surveillance in France, context and methods
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maternal mortality, despite its rarity in rich countries, remains a fundamental indicator of maternal health. It is considered as a "sentinel event", consequence of dysfunctions of the health care system, often cumulative. In addition to the classical epidemiological surveillance outcomes-number of deaths, maternal mortality ratio and identification of the subgroups of women at risk-its study allows an accurate analysis of each deceased woman's trajectory to identify opportunities for improvements in the content or organization of care; the correction of which will make it possible to prevent deaths but also upstream morbid events affected by the same dysfunctions. To achieve this dual epidemiological and clinical audit objective, an ad hoc enhanced system is needed. France has had such a system since 1996, the National Confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (ENCMM), coordinated by the Inserm Epope team. The first step is the multi-source identification (direct declaration, death certificate, birth certificates, hospital discharge data) of women who died during pregnancy or within one year of its end. The second step is the collection of detailed information for each death by a pair of clinical assessors. The third stage is the review of these anonymized documents by the National Committee of Experts on Maternal Mortality, which judges whether the death is maternal (causal link) and makes a judgment on the adequacy of care and avoidability of death. The synthesis of the information thus collected for maternal deaths in the period 2010-2012 is the subject of the last report. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improvement of Gaofen-3 Absolute Positioning Accuracy Based on Cross-Calibration
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) mission was launched in August 2016, equipped with a full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor in the C-band, with a resolution of up to 1 m. The absolute positioning accuracy of GF-3 is of great importance, and in-orbit geometric calibration is a key technology for improving absolute positioning accuracy. Conventional geometric calibration is used to accurately calibrate the geometric calibration parameters of the image (internal delay and azimuth shifts) using high-precision ground control data, which are highly dependent on the control data of the calibration field, but it remains costly and labor-intensive to monitor changes in GF-3's geometric calibration parameters. Based on the positioning consistency constraint of the conjugate points, this study presents a geometric cross-calibration method for the rapid and accurate calibration of GF-3. The proposed method can accurately calibrate geometric calibration parameters without using corner reflectors and high-precision digital elevation models, thus improving absolute positioning accuracy of the GF-3 image. GF-3 images from multiple regions were collected to verify the absolute positioning accuracy after cross-calibration. The results show that this method can achieve a calibration accuracy as high as that achieved by the conventional field calibration method.

TI  - Geomorphic Response of a Low-Gradient Channel to Modern, Progressive Base-Level Lowering: Nahal HaArava, the Dead Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The geomorphic response of channels to base-level fall is an important factor in landscape evolution. To better understand the complex interactions between the factors controlling channel evolution in an emerging continental shelf setting, we use an extensive data set (high-resolution digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and Landsat imagery) of a newly incising, perennial segment of Nahal (Wadi) HaArava, Israel. This channel responds to the rapid and progressive lowering of its base-level, the Dead Sea (>30m in similar to 35years; similar to 0.5-1.3myr(-1)). Progressively evolving longitudinal profiles, channel width, sinuosity, and knickpoint retreat during the last few decades were documented or reconstructed. The results indicate that even under fast base-level fall, rapid delta progradation on top of the shelf and shelf edge can moderate channel mouth slopes and, therefore, largely inhibit channel incision and knickpoint propagation. This channel elongation stage ends when the delta reaches an extended accommodation within the receiving basin and fails to keep the channel mouth slopes as low as the channel bed slopes. Then, processes of incision, narrowing, and meandering begin to shape the channel and expand upstream. When the down-cutting channel encounters a more resistant stratum within the channel substrate, these processes are restricted to a downstream reach by formation of a retreating vertical knickpoint. When the knickpoint and the channel incise to a level below this stratum, a spatially continuous, diffusion-like evolution characterizes the channel's response and source-to-sink transport can be implemented. These results emphasize the mouth slope and channel substrate resistance as the governing factors over long-term channel evolution, whereas flash floods have only local and short-lived impacts in a confined, continuously incising channel. The documented channel response applies to eustatic base-level fall under steepening basin bathymetry, rapid delta progradation, and lithologic variations in the channel substrate.

TI  - A nation-wide system for landslide mapping and risk management in Italy: The second Not-ordinary Plan of Environmental Remote Sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are frequent events that may cause human casualties and injuries as well as damage to urban and man-made structures, with extensive loss of economic resources. For this reason, landslide mapping is a primary tool for hazard and risk assessment. Italian Ministry of Environment, thanks to great availability and functionality of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data promoted the Not-ordinary Plan of Environmental Remote Sensing (Piano Straordinario di Telerilevamento Ambientale, PST-A in Italian) in 2008, as to constitute a national database of active or potential instability phenomena affecting the Italian territory, based on the exploitation of interferometric products (ERS and ENVISAT). In this paper, the PST-A-3 is described. A procedure based on the integration of engineering-geological approaches and SAR interferometry data belonging to COSMO-SkyMed constellation (100 frames 40 x 40 km) has been here implemented over 7,400 km(2) of the Italian territory. First, landslides have been mapped by field geologists, defining type and state of activity. Simultaneously to field surveys, remote sensing data have been analyzed as to detect areas with considerable displacement registered by the satellite. Both products have been overlaid, also quantifying the coincidence between the events reported according to the two detection methodologies and subtracting those landslide not recordable by the satellite, finally obtaining an updated landslide inventory map with 4,522 newly detected phenomena. Therefore, PST-A-3 proves to be a valuable system for local authorities, in order to provide a contribution to risk management but also for the forecasting of landslide events, as testified by two case studies selected. Thanks to the PST-A experience, the use of such strategy to other countries could represent a valid contribution to land management at worldwide scale.

TI  - Barest Pixel Composite for Agricultural Areas Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many soil remote sensing applications rely on narrow-band observations to exploit molecular absorption features. However, broadband sensors are invaluable for soil surveying, agriculture, land management and mineral exploration, amongst others. These sensors provide denser time series compared to high-resolution airborne imaging spectrometers and hold the potential of increasing the observable bare-soil area at the cost of spectral detail. The wealth of data coming along with these applications can be handled using cloud-based processing platforms such as Earth Engine. We present a method for identifying the least-vegetated observation, or so called barest pixel, in a dense time series between January 1985 and March 2017, based on Landsat 5, 7 and 8 observations. We derived a Barest Pixel Composite and Bare Soil Composite for the agricultural area of the Swiss Plateau. We analysed the available data over time and concluded that about five years of Landsat data were needed for a full-coverage composite (90% of the maximum bare soil area). Using the Swiss harmonised soil data, we derived soil properties (sand, silt, clay, and soil organic matter percentages) and discuss the contribution of these soil property maps to existing conventional and digital soil maps. Both products demonstrate the substantial potential of Landsat time series for digital soil mapping, as well as for land management applications and policy making.

TI  - Integration of Satellite Tracking Data and Satellite Images for Detailed Characteristics of Wildlife Habitats
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods of analysis of the results got from satellite tracking of large terrestrial mammals differ in the level of their integration with additional geographic data. The reliable fine-scale cartographic basis for assessing specific wildlife habitats can be developed through the interpretation of multispectral remote sensing data and extrapolation of the results to the entire estimated species range. Topographic maps were ordinated according to classified features using self-organizing maps (Kohonen's SOM). The satellite image of the Ussuriiskyi Nature Reserve area was interpreted for the analysis of movement conditions for seven wild Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) equipped with GPS collars. 225 SOM classes for cartographic visualization are sufficient for the detailed mapping of all natural complexes that were identified as a result of interpretation. During snow-free periods, tigers preferred deciduous and shrub associations at lower elevations, as well as mixed forests in the valleys of streams that are adjacent to sparse forests and shrub watershed in the mountain ranges; during heavy snow periods, the animals preferred the entire range of plant communities in different relief types, except for open sites in meadows and abandoned fields at foothills. The border zones of different biotopes were typically used by the tigers during all seasons. Amur tigers preferred coniferous forests for long-term movements.

TI  - Mesoscale Eddies in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean: Three-Dimensional Eddy Structures and Heat/Salt Transports
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The region encompassing the Kuroshio Extension (KE) in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean (25 degrees N-45 degrees N and 130 degrees E-180 degrees E) is one of the most eddy-energetic regions of the global ocean. The three-dimensional structures and transports of mesoscale eddies in this region are comprehensively investigated by combined use of satellite data and Argo profiles. With the allocation of Argo profiles inside detected eddies, the spatial variations of structures of eddy temperature and salinity anomalies are analyzed. The results show that eddies predominantly have subsurface (near-surface) intensified temperature and salinity anomalies south (north) of the KE jet, which is related to different background stratifications between these regions. A new method based on eddy trajectories and the inferred three-dimensional eddy structures is proposed to estimate heat and salt transports by eddy movements in a Lagrangian framework. Spatial distributions of eddy transports are presented over the vicinity of the KE for the first time. The magnitude of eddy-induced meridional heat (freshwater volume) transport is on the order of 0.01 PW (10(3) m(3)/s). The eddy heat transport divergence results in an oceanic heat loss south and heat gain north of the KE, thereby reinforcing and counteracting the oceanic heat loss from air-sea fluxes south and north of the KE jet, respectively. It also suggests a poleward heat transport across the KE jet due to eddy propagation.

TI  - Dengue serotype circulation in natural populations of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ae. aegypti is the main vector of dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. The transmission dynamics of these arboviruses, especially the arboviral circulation in the mosquito population during low and high transmission seasons in endemic areas are still poorly understood. We conducted an entomological survey to determine dengue infection rates in Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These collections were performed in 2012-2013 during a Rio de Janeiro epidemic, just before the introduction and spread of ZIKV and CHIKV in the city. MosquiTrap and BG-Sentinel traps were installed in three fixed and seven itinerant neighborhoods each month over ten months. Mosquitoes were in supernatants pools tested and individually confirmed for DENV infection using RT-PCR. A total of 3053 Aedes mosquitos were captured and Ae. aegypti was much more frequent (92.9%) than Ae. albopictus (6.8%). Ae. aegypti females accounted for 71.8% of captured mosquitoes by MosquitTrap (c) and were the only species found naturally infected with DENV (infection rate = 0.81%). Only one Ae. aegypti male, collected by BG-sentinel, was also tested positive for DENV. The peak of DENV-positive mosquitoes coincided the season of the highest incidence of human cases. The most common serotypes detected in mosquitoes were DENV-3 (24%) and DENV-1 (24%), followed by DENV-4 (20%), DENV-2 (8%) and DENV-1 plus DENV4 (4%), while 95% of laboratory-confirmed human infections in the period were due to DENV-4. These contrasting results suggest silent maintenance of DENV serotypes during the epidemics, reinforcing the importance of entomological and viral surveillance in endemic areas.

T2  - Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary dissection (AD) is an integral part of the surgical staging of breast cancer. This operation can be source of major long term complications, e. g., lymphedema. Reducing the radicality of these operations has been the subject of many clinical trials, especially those addressing the metastatic infiltration of axillary lymph nodes uncovered either by clinical staging or by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (when the clinical staging was negative). Exact clinical (mainly ultrasonographic) staging and marking of the lymph nodes detected by staging plays a key role in deciding the optimum clinical regimen.PURPOSE: Three possibilities were tested in clinical trials: The possibility of replacing the AD by radiotherapy in the case of tumorous infiltration of SLN, when clinical staging was negative; the possibility of omitting AD (in patients with positive clinical axillary staging) and replacing it with SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; and the possibility of marking lymph nodes in axilla that were suspected of infiltration at the time of clinical staging.RESULTS: The studies showed clear evidence that avoiding AD was safe in oncology patients who showed infiltration of axillary SLN and negative clinical staging. Despite the high false negativity of using SLN biopsies in patients with a positive clinical staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, this false negativity could be reduced by using lymph node marking. By implementing these methods, it should be possible to define exactly the group of patients in whom complete pathological remission occurs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Key words: breast neoplasms - axilla - lymph nodes The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study. The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical papers.Submitted: 17. 4. 2017Accepted: 2. 7. 2017.

TI  - Modeling and Predicting Carbon and Water Fluxes Using Data-Driven Techniques in a Forest Ecosystem
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of carbon and water fluxes of forest ecosystems is of particular importance for addressing the problems originating from global environmental change, and providing helpful information about carbon and water content for analyzing and diagnosing past and future climate change. The main focus of the current work was to investigate the feasibility of four comparatively new methods, including generalized regression neural network, group method of data handling (GMDH), extreme learning machine and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), for elucidating the carbon and water fluxes in a forest ecosystem. A comparison was made between these models and two widely used data-driven models, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). All the models were evaluated based on the following statistical indices: coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error and mean absolute error. Results indicated that the data-driven models are capable of accounting for most variance in each flux with the limited meteorological variables. The ANN model provided the best estimates for gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), while the ANFIS model achieved the best for ecosystem respiration (R), indicating that no single model was consistently superior to others for the carbon flux prediction. In addition, the GMDH model consistently produced somewhat worse results for all the carbon flux and evapotranspiration (ET) estimations. On the whole, among the carbon and water fluxes, all the models produced similar highly satisfactory accuracy for GPP, R and ET fluxes, and did a reasonable job of reproducing the eddy covariance NEE. Based on these findings, it was concluded that these advanced models are promising alternatives to ANN and SVM for estimating the terrestrial carbon and water fluxes.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in gynecological oncology
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The intraoperative mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is part of the treatment strategy for a number of types of tumor. To retrospectively compare results from the mapping of pelvic SLNs for gynecological oncology, using distinct dyes, the present review was conducted to determine the clinical significance of SLN mapping for gynecological oncology. In addition, the present study aimed at identifying an improved choice for SLN mapping tracers in clinical application. Each dye exhibits demerits when applied in the clinical environment. The combination of radioisotopes and blue dyes was identified to exhibit the most accurate detection rate of SLN drainage of gynecological oncology. However, contrast agents were unable to identify whether a SLN is positive or negative for metastasis prior to pathologic examination; additional studies are required.

TI  - Comparison of a sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm and comprehensive lymphadenectomy in the detection of stage IIIC endometrial carcinoma at higher risk for nodal disease
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To determine if a sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm will detect metastatic nodal disease in patients with intermediate -/high-risk endometrial carcinoma.Methods. Patients were identified and surgically staged at two collaborating institutions. The historical cohort (2004-2008) at one institution included patients undergoing complete pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy to the renal veins (LND cohort). At the second institution an SLN mapping algorithm, including pathologic ultra staging, was performed (2006-2013) (SLN cohort). Intermediate-risk was defined as endometrioid histology (any grade), >= 50% myometrial invasion; high-risk as serous or clear cell histology (any myometrial invasion). Patients with gross peritoneal disease were excluded. Isolated tumor cells, micro-metastases, and macro-metastases were considered node-positive.Results. We identified 210 patients in the LND cohort, 202 in the SLN cohort. Nodal assessment was performed for most patients. In the intermediate-risk group, stage IIIC disease was diagnosed in 30/107 (28.0%) (LND), 29/82 (35.4%) (SLN) (P = 0.28). In the high-risk group, stage IIIC disease was diagnosed in 20/103 (19.4%) (LND), 26 (21.7%) (SLN) (P = 0.68). Paraaortic lymph node (LN) assessment was performed significantly more often in intermediate-/high-risk groups in the LND cohort (P < 0.001). In the intermediate-risk group, paraaortic LN metastases were detected in 20/96 (20.8%) (LND) vs. 3/28 (10.7%) (SLN) (P = 0.23). In the high-risk group, paraaortic LN metastases were detected in 13/82 (15.9%) (LND) and 10/56 (17.9%) (SLN) (%, P = 0.76).Conclusions. SLN mapping algorithm provides similar detection rates of stage IIIC endometrial cancer. The SLN algorithm does not compromise overall detection compared to standard LND. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The quality improvement attitude survey: Development and preliminary psychometric characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims and objectivesTo report the development of a tool to measure nurse's attitudes about quality improvement in their practice setting and to examine preliminary psychometric characteristics of the Quality Improvement Nursing Attitude Scale.BackgroundHuman factors such as nursing attitudes of complacency have been identified as root causes of sentinel events. Attitudes of nurses concerning use of Quality and Safety Education for nurse's competencies can be most challenging to teach and to change. No tool has been developed measuring attitudes of nurses concerning their role in quality improvement.DesignA descriptive study design with preliminary psychometric evaluation was used to examine the preliminary psychometric characteristics of the Quality Improvement Nursing Attitude Scale. Registered bedside clinical nurses comprised the sample for the study (n=57).MethodsQuantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Cronbach's alpha reliability. Total score and individual item statistics were evaluated. Two open-ended items were used to collect statements about nurses' feelings regarding their experience in quality improvement efforts.ResultsStrong support for the internal consistency reliability and face validity of the Quality Improvement Nursing Attitude Scale was found. Total scale scores were high indicating nurse participants valued Quality and Safety Education for Nurse competencies in practice. However, item-level statistics indicated nurses felt powerless when other nurses deviate from care standards. Additionally, the sample indicated they did not consistently report patient safety issues and did not have a feeling of value in efforts to improve care.ConclusionsFindings suggested organisational culture fosters nurses' reporting safety issues and feeling valued in efforts to improve care. Participants' narrative comments and item analysis revealed the need to generate new items for the Quality Improvement Nursing Attitude Scale focused on nurses' perception of their importance in quality and safety and their power to enact principles.Relevance to the practiceThe Quality Improvement Nursing Attitude Scale-Revised edition was designed to help in understanding nurses' attitudes and values. It can be used to further explore broad concepts of quality improvement efforts.

TI  - Validation and comparison of two stroke prognostic models for in hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality.
T2  - European stroke journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to validate and compare two clinical prognostic models for mortality which include the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS); the Age and NIHSS Score (ANS) and case mix model (CMM) of the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Program (SSNAP). The NIHSS on admission was also tested as a prognostic score.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the SSNAP register for a cohort of patients (ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke) admitted over 1 year to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, England were accessed. The ANS and CMM were calculated and tested for in hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality using calibration plots with Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, receiver operating characteristics curves and other measures of prognostic accuracy.RESULTS: Of 848 patients, 110 (12.9%) died in hospital, 112 (13.2%) at 30 days and 164 (19.2%) at 90 days. Calibration for all three scores was good, although Hosmer-Lemeshow test p values were <0.05 with the NIHSS alone for in hospital and 30-day deaths, suggesting deviation from good fit. The c-statistics for in hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality were ANS (0.783, 0.782, 0.779) and CMM (0.783, 0.774, 0.758), respectively. The NIHSS alone showed fair discrimination but performed less well. A NIHSS score ≥6 was associated with significant mortality (p<0.0001) in comparison to a score <6.CONCLUSION: A simple prognostic model containing age and admission NIHSS only, performed as well as a more complex score at predicting in hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality. Admission NIHSS recording should be encouraged for stroke registries.

TI  - Bronchoprotective mechanisms for specialized pro-resolving mediators in the resolution of lung inflammation
T2  - MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Bronchi are exposed daily to irritants, microbes and allergens as well as extremes of temperature and acid. The airway mucosal epithelium plays a pivotal role as a sentinel, releasing alarmins when danger is encountered. To maintain homeostasis, an elaborate counter-regulatory network of signals and cellular effector mechanisms are needed. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are chemical mediators that enact resolution programs in response to injury, infection or allergy. SPMs are enzymatically derived from essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with potent cell-type specific immunoresolvent properties. SPMs signal by engaging cell-based receptors to turn off acute inflammatory responses and restore tissue homeostasis. Several common lung diseases involving the airways, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), are characterized by unresolved bronchial inflammation. In preclinical murine models of lung disease, SPMs carry potent bronchoprotective actions. Here, we review cellular and molecular effects for SPM-initiated catabasis in the lung and their human translation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study of Wetland Ecosystem Vegetation Using Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to estimate the aboveground net production (ANP) of wetland ecosystems for the key area at the South Taiga zone of West Siberia. The vegetation index and aboveground production are related by linear dependence and are specific for each wetland ecosystem. The NDVI grows with an increase in the ANP at wooded oligotrophic ecosystems. Open oligotrophic bogs and eutrophic wetlands are characterized by an opposite relation. Maps of aboveground production for wetland ecosystems are constructed for each study year and for the whole period of studies. The average aboveground production for all wetland ecosystems of the key area, which was estimated with consideration for the area they occupy and using the data of satellite measurements of the vegetation index, is 305 g C/m(2)/yr. The total annual carbon accumulation in aboveground wetland vegetation in the key area is 794600 t.

TI  - A complete snow avalanche activity record from a Norwegian forecasting region using Sentinel-1 satellite-radar data
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Snow Science Workshop (ISSW)
CL  - Breckenridge, CO
AB  - Collecting a complete dataset of snow avalanche activity in a given avalanche forecasting region throughout an entire winter is a seemingly simple task that is very difficult to accomplish. Traditional field-based methods are too time and cost consuming and limited to good visibility and accessible terrain. Different remote sensing methods have been proposed to assist in monitoring of snow avalanche activity, with satellite-borne radar remote sensing allowing for all-weather and all-light conditions monitoring. Here we present a complete, two-year snow avalanche activity record from a Norwegian forecasting region using Sentinel-1A radar satellite imagery. We used a change detection method to manually identify avalanche debris based on localized backscatter increase in avalanche runout zones and assess these detections using multi-temporal and multi-sensor datasets. We then used the complete dataset of snow avalanche activity to exemplify different applications from validating issued avalanche bulletins, to generating avalanche path maps, and creating a snow climate classification. Comparing manual identification in Sentinel-1A images and a very high resolution Radarsat-2 image suggest overall underestimation of avalanche activity, also when considering the non-detectability of small avalanche debris. We foresee that with the further increase in satellite-radar data availability and the improvement of automatized snow avalanche detection, the presented methodologies will be able to assist in operational avalanche forecasting worldwide in the near future.

TI  - The geomorphological evidences of subsidence in the Nile Delta: Analysis of high resolution topographic DEM and multi-temporal satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the relevance of landforms to the subsidence of the Nile Delta using a high resolution topographic digital elevation model (DEM) and sets of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. 195 topographic map sheets produced in 1946 at 1:25,000 scale were digitized, and the DEM was interpolated. The undertaken processing techniques have distinguished all the natural low-lying closed depressions from the artificial errors induced by the interpolation of the DEM. The local subsidence of these depressions from their surroundings reaches a maximum depth of 2.5 m. The regional subsidence of the Nile Delta has developed inverted topography, where the tracts occupied by the contemporary distributary channels are standing at higher elevations than the areas in between. This inversion could be related to the differences in the hydrological and sedimentological properties of underlying sediments, as the channels are underlain by water-saturated sands while the successions of clay and silt on flood plains are prone to compaction. Furthermore, the analysis of remote sensing and topographic data clearly show significant changes in the land cover and land use, particularly in the northern lagoons and adjacent sabkhas, which are dominated by numerous low subsiding depressions. The areas covered by water logging and ponds are increasing on the expense of agricultural areas, and aquaculture have been practiced instead. The precise estimation of subsidence rates and distribution should be worked out to evaluate probable changes in land cover and land use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantitative estimates of flash flood discharge into waste water disposal sites in Wadi Al Saaf, the Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrology of Wadi Al Saaf was investigated to estimate the quantitative parameters of flash flood and its interaction with the landuse using multitude of remote sensing data, digital elevation models (DEM), field work and topographic survey. The waste water is being conveyed into the lower part of this catchment through a transient drain "Al Saaf Drain" and the newly constructed treatment plant for "Al Saaf City". The flash flood of May 2014 was completely trapped into the oxidation pools of the treatment plant and its surrounding low areas in the wadi floor. The active channels and accumulated water bodies of this flash flood were traced from the satellite images acquired shortly after the event. The DEM was analyzed into geographic information system (GIS) to estimate the distributed unit hydrograph given the application of Manning's for the open channel flow equation. The surveyed cross-sectional areas of the active channels and their equivalent hydraulic radii gave a mean peak discharge of 110 m(3) per second. The estimated net discharge was 2.1 million cubic meters as calculated from the surveyed topography for the pools and depressions areas, which trapped that flash flood. The wadi is dominated by surface runoff as the percolation into the underlying alluvium is very limited due to the occurrence of thick Pliocene clays few meters below the surface. Furthermore, the seepage of waste water from "Al Saaf Drain" into the artificial depressions of the clay quarries has created massive ponds which are susceptible to breaching by the flash floods. Therefore, the interaction of flash floods with the water bodies in the catchment must be prevented in order to advert any negative environmental consequences. Moreover, the cultivation of edible crops with the waste water is being practiced; this research has suggested specific mitigation measures to be taken to achieve sustainability for the water resources management.

TI  - Synergic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images for Operational Soil Moisture Mapping at High Spatial Resolution over Agricultural Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture mapping at a high spatial resolution is very important for several applications in hydrology, agriculture and risk assessment. With the arrival of the free Sentinel data at high spatial and temporal resolutions, the development of soil moisture products that can better meet the needs of users is now possible. In this context, the main objective of the present paper is to develop an operational approach for soil moisture mapping in agricultural areas at a high spatial resolution over bare soils, as well as soils with vegetation cover. The developed approach is based on the synergic use of radar and optical data. A neural network technique was used to develop an operational method for soil moisture estimates. Three inversion SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) configurations were tested: (1) VV polarization; (2) VH polarization; and (3) both VV and VH polarization, all in addition to the NDVI information extracted from optical images. Neural networks were developed and validated using synthetic and real databases. The results showed that the use of a priori information on the soil moisture condition increases the precision of the soil moisture estimates. The results showed that VV alone provides better accuracy on the soil moisture estimates than VH alone. In addition, the use of both VV and VH provides similar results, compared to VV alone. In conclusion, the soil moisture could be estimated in agricultural areas with an accuracy of approximately 5 vol % (volumetric unit expressed in percent). Better results were obtained for soil with a moderate surface roughness (for root mean surface height between 1 and 3 cm). The developed approach could be applied for agricultural plots with an NDVI lower than 0.75.

TI  - Estimated Healthcare Costs of Melanoma in Australia Over 3 Years Post-Diagnosis
T2  - APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Skin cancer exerts a large and growing burden on health systems. With new pharmacotherapies for metastatic melanoma now available, a contemporary understanding of the cost burden of melanoma control is warranted.Objective To comprehensively assess the healthcare costs of malignant melanoma diagnosis and treatment in Australia, over 3 years after diagnosis.Methods We developed a decision-analytic model and micro-costing method to estimate the mean cost per patient for melanoma, incorporating all diagnostic and treatment modalities used in Australia (2017 AU$). By using the deidentified 10% sample of Medicare Benefits Scheme, we analysed health service use and supplemented our analyses with published estimates. We took a health system cost perspective, and addressed input uncertainty with sensitivity analyses.Results The mean annual cost per patient for melanoma stage 0/I/II was AU$ 1681 (US$ 1175) rising to AU$ 37,729 (US$ 26,365) for stage III resectable, and AU$ 115,109 (US$ 80,440) for stage III unresectable/IV. Three-year costs for stage III unresectable/IV were AU$ 187,720. Nationally, the annual estimated cost for treatment of all new cases of in situ and invasive melanomas was AU$ 201 million (95% CI: AU$ 187 to AU$ 216 million). When we included treatments for presumptive melanoma later found to be benign lesions, the estimated annual cost burden reached AU$ 272 million.Conclusion With rapidly rising treatment costs, there is a need to consider a comprehensive melanoma control strategy that includes primary prevention of skin cancers and cost-effective sun protection initiatives.

TI  - The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP), an updated and enhanced version of the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) cloud liquid water path (CLWP) climatology, currently provides 29 years (1988-2016) of monthly gridded (1 degrees) oceanic CLWP information constructed using Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) intercalibrated 0.25 degrees-resolution retrievals. Satellite sources include SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, SSMIS, AMSR-2, and GMI. To mitigate spurious CLWP trends, the climatology is corrected for drifting satellite overpass times by simultaneously solving for the monthly average CLWP and the monthly mean diurnal cycle. In addition to a longer record and six additional satellite products, major enhancements relative to the UWisc climatology include updating the input to version 7 RSS retrievals, correcting for a CLWP bias (based on matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes), and constructing a total (cloud 1 rain) liquid water path (TLWP) record for use in analyses of columnar liquid water in raining clouds. Because the microwave emission signal from cloud water is similar to that of precipitation-sized hydrometeors, greater uncertainty in the CLWP record is expected in regions of substantial precipitation. Therefore, the TLWP field can also be used as a quality-control screen, where uncertainty increases as the ratio of CLWP to TLWP decreases. For regions where confidence in CLWP is highest (i.e., CLWP: TLWP > 0.8), systematic differences in MAC CLWP relative to UWisc CLWP range from -15% (e.g., global oceanic stratocumulus decks) to +15%-10% (e.g., portions of the higher latitudes, storm tracks, and shallower convection regions straddling the ITCZ). The dataset is currently hosted at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center.

TI  - Satellite Radiothermovision Analysis of the Evolution of a System of Interacting Typhoons
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we develop further the satellite radiothermovision methods for analyzing the evolution of tropical cyclones. The complicated case of Goni and Atsani interacting typhoons is considered. It has been shown that, although their interaction does not explicitly influence the features of the typhoon trajectories, indications of the formation of complex advective fluxes in the lower troposphere can be revealed from both a qualitative analysis of miscellaneous satellite data and a quantitative estimation of latent heat advection. At the same time, in contrast to the previous works, we had to introduce the integration contours of a complex form (differing from a circular one) into the analysis, so that the energy balance of the typhoon system is correctly described. In a general way, defining such contours is a separate problem whose solution is probably related to the invocation of a large volume of additional satellite information. Due to the peculiarity of the considered case of Goni and Atsani twin typhoons, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a simplified approach that uses a composite contour formed by overlapping two circular ones. Generally, as in the cases previously considered, we found the interrelation between the intensification and dissipation of typhoons (tropical cyclones) and the modes of convergent and divergent advection of latent heat with amplitudes sufficient to support the total power of the system.

TI  - Satellite Radiothermovision on Synoptic and Climatically Significant Scales
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is focused on the development of a methodological basis for the authors' approach to the processing of large volumes of satellite radiothermal data, which is known as satellite radiothermovision. A closed scheme for calculating the latent heat flux (and other integral characteristics of the dynamics of geophysical fields) through arbitrary contours (boundaries) has been constructed and mathematically described. The opportunity for working with static, as well as movable and deformable boundaries of arbitrary shape, has been provided. The computational scheme was tested using the example of calculations of the atmospheric advection of the latent heat from the North Atlantics to the Arctic in 2014. Preliminary analysis of the results showed a high potential of the approach when applying it to the study of a wide range of synoptic and climatically significant atmospheric processes of the Earth. Some areas for the further development of the satellite radiothermovision approach are briefly discussed. It is noted that expanding the analysis of the available satellite data to as much data as possible is of considerable importance. Among the immediate prospects is the analysis of large arrays of data already accumulated and processed in terms of the satellite radiothermovision ideology, which are partially presented and continuously updated on a specialized geoportal.

TI  - Breaking new ground in mapping human settlements from space - The Global Urban Footprint
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, approximately 7.2 billion people inhabit the Earth and by 2050 this number will have risen to around nine billion, of which about 70% will be living in cities. The population growth and the related global urbanization pose one of the major challenges to a sustainable future. Hence, it is essential to understand drivers, dynamics, and impacts of the human settlements development. A key component in this context is the availability of an up-to-date and spatially consistent map of the location and distribution of human settlements. It is here that the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) raster map can make a valuable contribution. The new global GUF binary settlement mask shows a so far unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.4 '' (similar to 12 m) that provides - for the first time - a complete picture of the entirety of urban and rural settlements. The GUF has been derived by means of a fully automated processing framework the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) - that was used to analyze a global coverage of more than 180,000 TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X radar images with 3 m ground resolution collected in 2011-2012. The UFP consists of five main technical modules for data management, feature extraction, unsupervised classification, mosaicking and post-editing. Various quality assessment studies to determine the absolute GUF accuracy based on ground truth data on the one hand and the relative accuracies compared to established settlements maps on the other hand, clearly indicate the added value of the new global GUF layer, in particular with respect to the representation of rural settlement patterns. The Kappa coefficient of agreement compared to absolute ground truth data, for instance, shows GUF accuracies which are frequently twice as high as those of established low resolution maps. Generally, the GUF layer achieves an overall absolute accuracy of about 85%, with observed minima around 65% and maxima around 98%. The GUF will be provided open and free for any scientific use in the full resolution and for any non-profit (but also non-scientific) use in a generalized version of 2.8 '' (similar to 84 m). Therewith, the new GUF layer can be expected to break new ground with respect to the analysis of global urbanization and peri-urbanization patterns, population estimation, vulnerability assessment, or the modeling of diseases and phenomena of global change in general.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in early breast cancer. A review on recent and ongoing randomized trials
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is regarded as the standard procedure for nodal staging in patients with early breast cancer. In the last decade several randomized trials have been evaluating its role and indications.Materials and methods: This article reviews recent and ongoing randomized trials on SLNB.Results: Four randomized controlled trials have recently shown evidence that SLNB either alone or followed by radiation therapy is effective for the management in patients with low axillary tumor burden in early breast cancer. Nine randomized controlled trials on SLNB are ongoing: four assessing its role in case of positive sentinel node, three evaluating whether SLNB itself can be omitted when the preoperative nodal imaging is negative, two are studying SLNB in the neoadjuvant setting.Discussion and conclusion: SLNB either alone or with axillary radiotherapy has been shown to be non-inferior to complete axillary dissection in terms of local recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival in early breast cancer with minimally metastatic axilla. So far, results from ongoing trials are going to confirm the appropriate treatment in patients with limited axillary nodal involvement, the role and the timing of SLNB within the neoadjuvant setting and to define whether surgery can be avoided in the axilla in early stage breast cancer patients with negative preoperative imaging.

TI  - Occurrence of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-<i>p</i>-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans and Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Fruit and Vegetables from the "Land of Fires" Area of Southern Italy
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-concentrations dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in fruit and vegetables collected in farms located in the well-known "Land of Fires" area of Southern Italy, in an effort to learn more about the environmental pollution of this high-risk area due to illegal waste dumping and uncontrolled burning near cultivated fields. Concentrations were in the range 0.011-2.26 ng g(-1) for the six "indicator" non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs), and 0.0009-0.096 pg WHO toxic equivalent (TEQ) g(-1) for the sum of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and PCDD/Fs. Lacking maximum limits for these contaminants in fruit and vegetables, the concentration values found were compared with the action levels set out in the EU Recommendations. These levels were never exceeded in the examined samples. In the present study, the highest mean value for PCDD/Fs + DL-PCB corresponded to apricots, olives, and nuts, while the lowest values were observed in endive and green beans. The results showed also that NDL-PCB levels in apricots were much higher than in any other food, suggesting that they can accumulate PCBs: this fruit might be proposed as a "sentinel" of the presence of these contaminants in the environment.

TI  - Improved DisTrad for Downscaling Thermal MODIS Imagery over Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne thermal sensors provide important physical parameters for urban studies. However, due to technical constraints, spaceborne thermal sensors yield a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolution. The aims of this study are (1) to downscale the three originally low spatial resolution (960 m) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra) land surface temperature image products (MOD11_L2, MOD11A1 and MOD11A2) to resolutions of 60, 90, 120, 240 and 480 m; and (2) to propose an improved version of the DisTrad method for downscaling the MODIS/Terra land surface temperature products over urban areas. The proposed improved DisTrad is based on a better parameterization of the original DisTrad residuals in urban areas. The improved resampling technique is based on a regression relationship between the residuals of the temperature estimation and the impervious percentage index. Validation of the improved DisTrad, the original DisTrad, and the uniformly disaggregated MODIS land surface temperature images (UniTrad) are performed by comparative analysis with a time-coincident Landsat 7 ETM+ thermal image. Statistical results indicate that the improved DisTrad method shows a higher correlation (R-2 = 0.48) with the observed temperatures than the original DisTrad (R-2 = 0.43) and a lower mean absolute error (MAE = 1.88 degrees C) than the original DisTrad (MAE = 2.07 degrees C). It is concluded that the improved DisTrad method has a stronger capability to downscale land surface temperatures in urban areas than the original DisTrad.

TI  - Retrieving topsoil moisture using RADARSAT-2 data, a novel approach applied at the east of the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This manuscript proposes an approach for estimating soil moisture content over corn fields using C-band SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 satellite. An image based approach is employed to remove the vegetation contribution to the satellite signals. In particular, the absolute difference between like and cross polarized signals (ADLC) is employed for segmenting the canopy growth cycle into tiny stages. Each stage is represented by a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the like polarized signals. For periods of bare soils and vegetation cover, CDFs are compared and the vegetation contribution is quantified. The portion which represent the soil contributions (sigma degrees(HHsoil)) to the satellite signals; are employed for inversely running Oh model and the water cloud model for estimating soil moisture, canopy water content and canopy height respectively. The proposed approach shows satisfactory performance where high correlation of determination (R-2) is detected between the field observations and the corresponding retrieved soil moisture, canopy water content and canopy height (R-2 = 0.64, 0.97 and 0.98 respectively). Soil moisture retrieval is associated with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 m(3) m(-3) while estimating canopy water content and canopy height have RMSE of 0.38 kg m(-2) and 0.166 m respectively.

TI  - Data-Driven Models for the Spatio-Temporal Interpolation of Satellite-Derived SST Fields
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived products are of key importance for the high-resolution monitoring of the ocean surface on a global scale. Due to the sensitivity of spaceborne sensors to the atmospheric conditions as well as the associated spatio-temporal sampling, ocean remote sensing data may be subject to high-missing data rates. The spatio-temporal interpolation of these data remains a key challenge to deliver L4 gridded products to endusers. Whereas operational products mostly rely on model-driven approaches, especially optimal interpolation based on Gaussian process priors, the availability of large-scale observation and simulation datasets calls for the development of novel data-driven models. This study investigates such models. We extend the recently introduced analog data assimilation to high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields using a multiscale patch-based decomposition. Using an observing system simulation experiment for sea surface temperature, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed data-driven scheme for the real missing data patterns of the high-resolution infrared METOP sensor. It has resulted in a significant improvement w.r.t. state-of-the-art techniques in terms of interpolation error (about 50% of relative gain) and spectral characteristics for horizontal scales smaller than 100 km. We further discuss the key features and parameterizations of the proposed data-driven approach as well as its relevance with respect to classical interpolation techniques.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Long-Term MODIS C5.1 and C6 Products against AERONET Observations over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol products are the most widely used satellite retrieved aerosol optic depth (AOD) products, which compensate for the spatial lack of ground-based sun photometer observations. The newly released Collection 6 (C6) aerosol products have some improvements compared to the Collection 5.1 (C5.1) products with optimized algorithms and newly revised upstream products. Additionally, a three-kilometer resolution AOD product was added in the C6 product. In this study, the accuracies and regional applicability of long-term (2001-2015) different MODIS C5.1 and C6 aerosol products in China were evaluated against the 16 AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) observations with observations over more than three years. The overall analysis indicates that the C6 DT (Dark Target) 10 km products slightly improved the retrieval accuracies, with about 3% more data falling within the Expected Error (EE) envelope. However, for Deep Blue (DB) products, the C6 algorithm significantly improved the accuracy over all of China, and increased the successful retrieval number by extending retrieval coverages. Regional analysis demonstrated that the C6 DT 10 km product did not perform well in East China, with only 33.5% of retrievals falling within the EE envelope. For the DB product, the C6 algorithm significantly increased the number successfully retrieved, and was more accurate in all four regions in China. The validation of the DT 3 km product suggests large differences existed between the Terra and Aqua results. The accuracy of the Aqua DT 3 km product is obviously higher than that of the Terra DT 3 km product. The results of the study suggest that proper AOD products need to be considered when evaluating aerosol loading situations in different regions in China.

TI  - Quantifying Disaster Physical Damage Using Remote Sensing Data-A Technical Work Flow and Case Study of the 2014 Ludian Earthquake in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster damage assessment is an important basis for the objective assessment of the social impacts of disasters and for the planning of recovery and reconstruction. It is also an important research field with regard to disaster mitigation and risk management. Quantitative assessment of physical damage refers to the determination of the physical damage state of the exposed elements in a disaster area, reflecting the aggregate quantities of damages. It plays a key role in the comprehensive damage assessment of major natural hazard-induced disasters. The National Disaster Reduction Center of China has established a technical work flow for the quantitative assessment of disaster physical damage using remote sensing data. This article presents a quantitative assessment index system and method that can be integrated with high-resolution remote sensing data, basic geographical data, and field survey data. Following the 2014 Ludian Earthquake in Yunnan Province, China, this work flow was used to assess the damage to buildings, roads, and agricultural and forest resources, and the assessment results were incorporated into the Disaster Damage Comprehensive Assessment Report of the 2014 Ludian Earthquake for the State Council of China. This article also outlines some possible improvements that can be addressed in future work.

TI  - Endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy and endoscopic axillary lymphadenectomy without liposuction in patients with early stage breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Our purpose was to present a new method of endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy (ESLNB) and endoscopic axillary lymphadenectomy (EALND) without liposuction for treating early-stage breast cancer, and compare results with traditional open dissection.Methods: The medical records of patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent EALND/ESLNB without liposuction or traditional open dissection between March 2015 and September 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes between the 2 groups were compared.Results: A total 65 patients with a mean age of 41.2 +/- 9.3 years (range, 23-60 years) were included. Thirty-three patients underwent traditional open lymph node dissection and 32 patients underwent endoscopic treatment. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, tumor location, and tumor disease stage (all, p > 0.05). The mean operating time was significantly higher in the endoscopic group (91.2 vs. 75.2 min, p = 0.022), while the mean blood loss was significantly lower (28.7 vs. 37.0 ml, p = 0.034). The mean number of SLNs harvested in the open (2.4 +/- 1.6) and the endoscopic (2.3 +/- 1.4) groups were not different (p = 0.829), with a sentinel lymph node retrieval rate of 80%. The mean number of axillary lymph nodes harvested in the open (13.8 +/- 3.3) and the endoscopic (13.3 +/- 3.1) groups were not different (p = 0.457). Scars were minimal in the endoscopic group.Conclusion: ESLNB and EALND without liposuction for early-stage breast cancer is feasible, has a low complication rate, a lymph node harvest rate similar to that of open dissection, and has good cosmetic results. Future studies, however, are required to evaluate oncological outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating stand density, biomass and tree species from very high resolution stereo-imagery - towards an all-in-one sensor for forestry applications?
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of various forest inventory attributes from high spatial resolution airborne remote sensing data has been widely examined and proved to be successful at the experimental level. Nevertheless, the operational use of these data in automated procedures to support forest inventories and forest management is still limited to a small number of cases. The reasons for this are high data costs, limited availability of remote sensing data over large areas and resistance from practitioners. In this review the main aim is to stimulate debate about spaceborne very high resolution stereo-imagery (VHRSI) as an alternative to airborne remote sensing data by presenting: (1) a case study on the retrieval of stand density, aboveground biomass and tree species using a set of easy-to-calculate variables obtained from VHRSI data combined with image processing and nonparametric classification and modelling approaches; and (2) the results of an expert opinion survey on the potential of VHRSI as compared with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), hyperspectral and airborne digital imagery to derive a range of forest inventory attributes. In the case study, stand density was estimated with r(2) = 0.71 and RMSE = 156 trees (rel./norm. RMSE = 24.9 per cent/12.4 per cent), biomass with r(2) = 0.64 and RMSE of 36.7 t/ha (rel./norm. RMSE = 20.0 per cent/12.8 per cent) while tree species classifications with five species reached overall accuracies of 84.2 per cent (kappa = 0.81). These results were comparable to earlier studies in the same test site, obtained with more expensive airborne acquisitions. Expert opinions were more diverse for VHRSI and aerial photographs (Shannon index values of 0.94 and 0.97) than for LiDAR and hyperspectral data (Shannon index values 0.69 and 0.88). In our opinion, this reflects the current state-of-the-art in the application of VHRSI for automatically retrieving forest inventory attributes. The number of studies using these data is still limited, and the full potential of these datasets is not yet completely explored. Compared with LiDAR and hyperspectral data, which both mostly received high scores for forest inventory products matching the sensor systems' strengths, VHRSI and aerial photographs received more homogeneous scores indicating their potential as multi-purpose instruments to collect forest inventory information. In summary, considering the simpler acquisition, reasonable price and the comparably easy data format and handling of VHRSI compared with other sensor types, we recommend further research on the application of these data for supporting operational forest inventories.

TI  - Roads to ruin: conservation threats to a sentinel species across an urban gradient
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization poses a global challenge to species conservation. This is primarily understood in terms of physical habitat loss, as agricultural and forested lands are replaced with urban infrastructure. However, aquatic habitats are also chemically degraded by urban development, often in the form of toxic stormwater runoff. Here we assess threats of urbanization to coho salmon throughout developed areas of the Puget Sound Basin in Washington, USA. Puget Sound coho are a sentinel species for freshwater communities and also a species of concern under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Previous studies have demonstrated that stormwater runoff is unusually lethal to adult coho that return to spawn each year in urban watersheds. To further explore the relationship between land use and recurrent coho die-offs, we measured mortality rates in field surveys of 51 spawning sites across an urban gradient. We then used spatial analyses to measure landscape attributes (land use and land cover, human population density, roadways, traffic intensity, etc.) and climatic variables (annual summer and fall precipitation) associated with each site. Structural equation modeling revealed a latent urbanization gradient that was associated with road density and traffic intensity, among other variables, and positively related to coho mortality. Across years within sites, mortality increased with summer and fall precipitation, but the effect of rainfall was strongest in the least developed areas and was essentially neutral in the most urbanized streams. We used the best-supported structural equation model to generate a predictive mortality risk map for the entire Puget Sound Basin. This map indicates an ongoing and widespread loss of spawners across much of the Puget Sound population segment, particularly within the major regional north-south corridor for transportation and development. Our findings identify current and future urbanization-related threats to wild coho, and show where green infrastructure and similar clean water strategies could prove most useful for promoting species conservation and recovery.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GLLaS) on board FY-4A is a Michelson interferometer infrared sounder. The interferogram is sampled at discrete points. The zero path difference (ZPD), which is the peak of the interferogram, is not sampled. This effectively shifts the interferogram and adds a linear phase to the spectrum. A linear regression on the residual phase of the calibrated spectrum will reveal the shift. This method has been used in the interferogram signal processing of the GIIRS, and has obtained a better results.

TI  - Ground-level predation on artificial caterpillars indicates no enemy-free time for lepidopteran larvae
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lepidoptera is one of the most diverse orders of insects, their larvae are very abundant in many habitats, and frequent prey of various predators. To decrease predation risk, caterpillars developed several means of defence, among them timing their activity to avoid predators (seeking enemy-free time). Although the enemy-free time hypothesis is often invoked to explain caterpillar behaviour, empirical evidence for it is scarce. We tested whether such enemy-free time exists in a temperate forest by comparing predation pressure on artificial caterpillars during day and night on the ground in forest fragments in Denmark. We found a high predation rate, 23.9% d(-1), and higher predation rate at night (30.9% d(-0.5)) than during the day (17.0% d(-0.5)), both by invertebrate (23.3% d(-0.5) vs. 12.4% d(-0.5)) and vertebrate (8.5% d(-0.5) vs. 3.3% d(-0.5)) predators. The most important predators were chewing insects (73.4% of all attacks) and small mammals (19.0%). Attack rates on red caterpillars were higher (30.0% d(-1)) than on green ones (19.5% d(-1)). Overall, these data do not support the idea that night activity can provide enemy-free time for solitary caterpillars on the temperate forest floor.

TI  - The carabid <i>Pterostichus melanarius</i> uses chemical cues for opportunistic predation and saprophagy but not for finding healthy prey
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel prey method can quantify predation pressure in various habitats. Real prey is assumed to more realistically mimic the predator experience but the predator can rarely be identified. Artificial prey made of plasticine may lack real chemical cues, but provides information about predator identity. However, the relationship between predation pressure registered by artificial versus real prey is not clear. We tested the relative attractiveness of artificial caterpillars, and intact, wounded, or dead larvae of the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) for the carabid predator Pterostichus melanarius Illiger (Coleoptera: Carabidae). P. melanarius adults were attracted to dead caterpillars more than to live or wounded ones. Coating artificial caterpillars with caterpillar haemolymph increased their attractiveness. However, predators were not attracted more to healthy, real caterpillars than to "untreated" artificial ones. We conclude that using artificial caterpillars does not underestimate predation pressure by this carabid on healthy caterpillars.

TI  - Reconstructing the evolution of a deep seated rockslide (Marzell) and its response to glacial retreat based on historic and remote sensing data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study a combination of different topographic data from historic topographic maps and remote sensing is used to reconstruct and monitor the behaviour of the high alpine ice contact rockslide system Marzell and its response to glacial debuttressing in the Eastern Alps. Topographic data from archives (historical topographic maps, national glacier inventories, aerial images, orthoimages and ALS data) and data from monitoring campaigns (geodetic measurements, terrestrial laser scanning and UAV imaging campaigns) are processed to georeferenced images and/or elevation data, respectively. The data from different data sources is compiled and analysed with the aim to i) reconstruct the extent, thickness and volume changes of the glacier since 1893 and ii) to analyse the rockslide deformation evolution by extracting information about the displacement direction, dip angle, velocity and partial failure of rockslide slabs since 1951. The rockslide is compound of different rockslide slabs which move downwards as rigid blocks along basal shear zones. The analyses and interpretation of the data suggest a rotational type of rockslide failure mechanisms. The rockslide activity correlates with the ice volume loss at the adjacent part of the glacier. In the period between 1971 and 1997 the annual average rockslide activity was about 0.05 m/a and the annual average ice thickness loss was 0.1 m/a. Since the end of the last century the annual average ice thickness loss increased dramatically to 5 m/a. In that period the rockslide activity accelerated. The highest rockslide activity (up to 1.5 m/a) was observed in the 2000s when half of the slope toe was exposed because of glacier retreat. Since 2010 a deceleration of the rockslide can be observed. In the vicinity of the rockslide the glacier almost disappeared and lost 99.88% of its ice volume between 1893 and 2014. The geomorphological and geological information gathered about the rockslide evolution and the glacier retreat form the base for further rockslide analyses and allow to study and model the influence from glacial debuttressing.

TI  - Estimation of Sunflower Yield Using a Simplified Agrometeorological Model Controlled by Optical and SAR Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at estimating the yield of sunflower at field scale by testing different ways to control an agrometeorological model, using the leaf area index (LAI) and/or the dry mass (DM) of the crop. The LAI is derived from multitemporal satellite images acquired in the visible, near-infrared, and microwave wavelengths by five sensors (Formosat-2, Spot-4/5, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2), over a region located in southwestern France, while the DM is measured in situ. Results show that the temporal dynamics of LAI and DM can be accurately simulated over the five studied working farms (R-DM(2) > 0.85 and R-LAI(2) > 0.94 with a relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) < 30%), when the model is controlled by both the DM (measured over only one field) and the LAI (estimated from the modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) or sigma(C-VV)degrees). The seed yield is then accurately estimated (R (2) > 0.85) over 140 ha, with low errors ranging from 0.20 to 0.54 t.ha(-1) by using both the LAI derived from microwave and optical data (LAI(MTVI2) and LAI(sigma C-VV degrees)), in order to reduce the overestimations related to the excessive development of the LAI during the first phenological stages, or to the presence of dew on the vegetation, respectively, affecting the LAI derived from the MTVI2 or sigma(C-VV)degrees.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of <i>Anopheles</i> species at three locations in the Republic of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Weekly changes in adult Anopheles species were monitored at Camp Humphreys (CH), Ganghwa Island (GH), and Warrior Base (WB), from May-October, 2009-2010 to explore the relationship between Plasmodium vivax development and vector dynamics in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Adult females were trapped and dissected to determine parity for estimating longevity, mortality, and birthrate. A degree-day (DD) method was used to estimate the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of P. vivax and duration of the gonotrophic cycle and other life stages. Anopheles sinensis was the predominant species, with satellite data showing peak abundance occurring after the period of maximum greenness. Abundance peaks were location dependent, comprised nulliparous and parous females, and timing could not be fully explained by DD estimation. Parity showed synchronicity between locations and years and was highest for September and lowest during maximum greenness. Mosquito longevity was predicted to exceed the EIP (when malaria transmission is possible) during weeks 29, 31, 34, and near the end of the season. Area-wide changes in parity suggest a common cause; information on local larval habitat and agricultural practices may explain location-specific effects. DD estimates of EIP and parity could be used to predict when conditions are suitable for P. vivax transmission.

TI  - Climatic and anthropogenic drivers of northern Amazon fires during the 2015-2016 El Nino event
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The strong El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event that occurred in 20152016 caused extreme drought in the northern Brazilian Amazon, especially in the state of Roraima, increasing fire occurrence. Here we map the extent of precipitation and fire anomalies and quantify the effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers on fire occurrence during the 2015-2016 dry season (from December 2015 to March 2016) in the state of Roraima. To achieve these objectives we first estimated the spatial pattern of precipitation anomalies, based on long-term data from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), and the fire anomaly, based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) active fire detections during the referred period. Then, we integrated climatic and anthropogenic drivers in a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to quantify fire probability, assessing (1) the model accuracy during the 2015-2016 and the 2016-2017 dry seasons; (2) the relative importance of each predictor variable on the model predictive performance; and (3) the response curves, showing how each environmental variable affects the fire probability. Approximately 59% (132,900 km(2)) of the study area was exposed to precipitation anomalies <=-1 standard deviation (SD) in January and similar to 48% (similar to 106,800 km(2)) in March. About 38% (86,200 km(2)) of the study area experienced fire anomalies >= 1 SD in at least one month between December 2015 and March 2016. The distance to roads and the direct ENSO effect on fire occurrence were the two most influential variables on model predictive performance. Despite the improvement of governmental actions of fire prevention and firefighting in Roraima since the last intense ENSO event (1997-1998), we show that fire still gets out of control in the state during extreme drought events. Our results indicate that if no prevention actions are undertaken, future road network expansion and a climate-induced increase in water stress will amplify fire occurrence in the northern Amazon, even in its humid dense forests. As an additional outcome of our analysis, we conclude that the model and the data we used may help to guide on-the-ground fire-prevention actions and firefighting planning and therefore minimize fire-related ecosystems degradation, economic losses and carbon emissions in Roraima.

TI  - Land Cover Change in Northern Botswana: The Influence of Climate, Fire, and Elephants on Semi-Arid Savanna Woodlands
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Complex couplings and feedback among climate, fire, and herbivory drive short- and long-term patterns of land cover change (LCC) in savanna ecosystems. However, understanding of spatial and temporal LCC patterns in these environments is limited, particularly for semi-arid regions transitional between arid and more mesic climates. Here, we use post-classification analysis of Landsat TM (1990), ETM+ (2003), and OLI (2013) satellite imagery to classify and assess net and gross LCC for the Chobe District, a 21,000 km(2) area encompassing urban, peri-urban, rural, communally-managed (Chobe Enclave), and protected land (Chobe National Park, CNP, and six protected forest reserves). We then evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of LCC in relation to precipitation, fire detections (MCD14M, 2001-2013) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and dry season elephant (Loxodonta africana) aerial survey data (2003, 2006, 2012, 2013). Woodland cover declined over the study period by 1514 km(2) (16.2% of initial class total), accompanied by expansion of shrubland (1305 km(2), 15.7%) and grassland (265 km(2), 20.3%). Net LCC differed importantly in protected areas, with higher woodland losses observed in forest reserves compared to the CNP. Loss of woodland was also higher in communally-managed land for the study period, despite gains from 2003-2013. Gross (class) changes were characterized by extensive exchange between woodland and shrubland during both time steps, and a large expansion of shrubland into grassland and bare ground from 2003-2013. MODIS active fire detections were highly variable from year to year and among the different protected areas, ranging from 1.8 fires*year(-1)/km(2) in the Chobe Forest Reserve to 7.1 fires*year(-1)/km(2) in the Kasane Forest Reserve Extension. Clustering and timing of dry season fires suggests that ignitions were predominately from anthropogenic sources. Annual fire count was significantly related to total annual rainfall (p = 0.009, adj. R-2 = 0.50), with a 41% increase in average fire occurrence in years when rainfall exceeded long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP). Loss of woodland was significantly associated with fire in locations experiencing 15 or more ignitions during the period 2001-2013 (p = 0.024). Although elephant-mediated damage is often cited as a major cause of woodland degradation in northern Botswana, we observed little evidence of unsustainable pressure on woodlands from growing elephant populations. Our data indicate broad-scale LCC processes in semi-arid savannas in Southern Africa are strongly coupled to environmental and anthropogenic forcings. Increased seasonal variability is likely to have important effects on the distribution of savanna plant communities due to climate-fire feedbacks. Long-term monitoring of LCC in these ecosystems is essential to improving land use planning and management strategies that protect biodiversity, as well as traditional cultures and livelihoods under future climate change scenarios for Southern Africa.

TI  - Fire-Driven Decline of Endemic <i>Allosyncarpia</i> Monsoon Rainforests in Northern Australia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although contemporary fire regimes in fire-prone Australian savannas are recognised as having major impacts on an array of biodiversity and environmental values, a number of studies have observed significant monsoon rainforest expansion in recent decades. Here we assess the status of a locally extensive endemic monsoon rainforest type, dominated by Allosyncarpia ternata (Myrtaceae), restricted to sandstone terrain including in the World Heritage property, Kakadu National Park. We undertook assessments of: (1) geographic correlates of Allosyncarpia forest distribution; (2) change in canopy cover at 40 representative forest patches at topographically exposed sites with reference to a 60-year aerial photo and fine-scale image archive, and fire mapping data; and (3) structural characteristics associated with sites exhibiting stable, contracting, and increasing canopy cover. Mean canopy cover at sampled forest patches declined by 9.5% over the study period. Most canopy loss occurred at the most fire-susceptible patches. Assessment of structural characteristics at sampled sites illustrated that canopy expansion represented vegetative recovery rather than expansion de novo. The study (1) confirms the vulnerability of exposed margins of this forest type to fire incursions; (2) illustrates the magnitude of, and describes solutions for addressing, the regional conservation management challenge; and (3) serves as a reminder that, in savanna environments, severe fire regimes can substantially outweigh the woody growth-enhancing effects of other regional (e.g., increased rainfall) and global-scale (e.g., atmospheric CO2 fertilisation) drivers.

TI  - Electronic Video Monitoring in Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waivers for People With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While the number of available caregivers for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) is reducing, the number of people who need care and support is steadily increasing, effectively creating a vacuum of care. In response to this increasing problem, and as a result of advances in technology, telecare, and remote monitoring in the long-term support of people who are aging or have I/DD are becoming more prominent. Despite noted benefits, telecare and other forms of technological surveillance are relatively new for caregivers in service to people with I/DD. Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Section 1915(c) waivers are a critical funding stream for people with I/DDs and long-term support needs in the United States. In order to examine the implementation of electronic monitoring technology for people with I/DD, we examined which HCBS waivers were providing electronic monitoring services and how they were doing so. Ninety-nine I/DD-related HCBS 1915(c) waivers (44 states and the District of Columbia) were collected for fiscal year (FY) 2013 from the U. S. CMS Medicaid.gov website. We then examined this data to determine, if applicable, the electronic monitoring services provided, the projected number of users, and the average cost of each unit of service. We also examined the electronic monitoring service definitions to determine themes across services. We found seven out of the 99 HCBS FY 2013 waivers (7.1%) provided electronic monitoring services through nine different services. Moreover, very little funding was allocated for these services. Our findings highlight that electronic monitoring services are largely not being utilized for the more than 600,000 people with I/DD on Medicaid HCBS waivers. As HCBS waivers look to reduce costs and continue to support people with I/DD we believe more states will consider these technologies.

TI  - Landslide Mapping and Characterization through Infrared Thermography (IRT): Suggestions for a Methodological Approach from Some Case Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the potential of Infrared Thermography (IRT) as a novel operational tool for landslide surveying, mapping and characterization was tested and demonstrated in different case studies, by analyzing various types of instability processes (rock slide/fall, roto-translational slide-flow). In particular, IRT was applied, both from terrestrial and airborne platforms, in an integrated methodology with other geomatcs methods, such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and global positioning systems (GPS), for the detection and mapping of landslides' potentially hazardous structural and morphological features (structural discontinuities and open fractures, scarps, seepage and moisture zones, landslide drainage network and ponds). Depending on the study areas' hazard context, the collected remotely sensed data were validated through field inspections, with the purpose of studying and verifying the causes of mass movements. The challenge of this work is to go beyond the current state of the art of IRT in landslide studies, with the aim of improving and extending the investigative capacity of the analyzed technique, in the framework of a growing demand for effective Civil Protection procedures in landslide geo-hydrological disaster managing activities. The proposed methodology proved to be an effective tool for landslide analysis, especially in the field of emergency management, when it is often necessary to gather all the required information in dangerous environments as fast as possible, to be used for the planning of mitigation measures and the evaluation of hazardous scenarios. Advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the field of the explored applications were evaluated, as well as general operative recommendations and future perspectives.

AB  - The study uses the applications of remote sensing in analyzing the main topographic features of the study area. The digital elevation model derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite is used to devise spillway torrents and their tributaries of the different drainage basins in the study area. The digital rainfall data recorded by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) climate research satellite is used to determine places with the highest rainfall within the different drainage basins in the area. Other satellite data (e.g. Landsat-8) are used in identifying and studying the various geological structures in the study area, which intersect the spillway torrents. Such areas may allow seizure of large quantities of water as potential, close to the surface, groundwater (Quaternary) aquifer. Areas of potential hydrological traps have been identified and marked for further geophysical (geoelectrical) surveys. The geophysical studies helped in identifying the shallow geological structures and the thickness of the subsurface sediments. It also assists in determining the size of the groundwater aquifer and the water quality within these aquifers. The study showed a decline of freshwater aquifer in Quaternary sediments. The Tertiary groundwater aquifer is the most prevalent, where this appears normal saline aquifer. All the aquifers within the study area are being recharged from Quaternary sediments by rainwater. The cumulative annual precipitation rate increases in the South-East of the study area, specifically over Wadi Khulais and significantly drops to lower rainfall rates in the rest of the region. Running water permeates the Quaternary sediments, which in turn infiltrates and recharges the Tertiary aquifer. The salinity of the latter depends mostly on the nature of its constituent rocky material.

T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change in land surface temperature (LST) due to urbanization is a critical influence on the ecohydrological function and human health in cities. Past research has emphasized land cover composition and planimetric landscape pattern as drivers of LST patterns, but there have been few empirical studies examining the effects of vertical structure on thermal variation in cities. We used agglomerative cluster analysis to group 5 ha grid cells with similar land cover composition from high-resolution land cover data for our Aurora, Colorado, USA study area. We then compared the importance of different planimetric landscape pattern metrics and lidar-derived vertical structure variables as predictors of LST estimated from Landsat 5 thermal band data for each group. Variation in LST between cluster groups was analyzed with landscape and vertical structure data using random forest regression models and conditional variable importance metrics. Cluster analysis produced 7 distinct groups differing in land cover composition, planimetric landscape pattern, and vertical structure. Clusters with greater tree cover and higher mean tree height were generally cooler, while the height difference between buildings and trees had high conditional variable importance in random forest regression models. We found that the specific planimetric landscape pattern and vertical structure metrics most important for individual clusters differed, suggesting that the relative importance of variables depends on land-use and land cover. Our results highlight the importance of including vertical structure in empirical analyses of urban LST.

TI  - Urban forest structure and land cover composition effects on land surface temperature in a semi-arid suburban area
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using multispectral imagery and LiDAR data, we developed a high-resolution land cover dataset for a semi-arid, Colorado (USA) suburb. These data were used to evaluate patterns of land cover composition and vertical structure in relation to land use and age of development. Landsat 5 TM thermal band data for six separate dates were used to compare land surface temperature (LST) in urbanized and remnant shortgrass steppe reference areas. We used 2010 census blocks to extract LST and various explanatory variables for use in Random Forest models evaluating the relative importance of land cover composition, LiDAR-derived vertical structure variables, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on LST patterns.We found that land cover, vertical structure, and LST varied between areas with different land use and neighborhood age. Older neighborhoods supported significantly higher tree cover and mean tree height, but differences in LST were inconsistent between Landsat image dates. NDVI had the highest variable importance in Random Forests models, followed by tree height and the mean height difference between trees and buildings. Models incorporating NDVI, vertical structure, and land cover had the highest predictive accuracy but did not perform significantly better than models using just vertical structure and NDVI. Developed areas were cooler on average than shortgrass steppe reference areas, likely due to the influence of supplemental irrigation in urbanized areas. Patterns of LST were spatially variable, highlighting the complex ways land cover composition and vertical structure can affect urban temperature.

TI  - Mangrove resilience to climate extreme events in a Colombian Caribbean Island
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme events affect coastal vegetation in several ways. They cause massive tree defoliations and mortality that carry changes in vegetation structure and floristic composition. In order to assess these changes in dry tropical forests, coastal vegetation and mangroves in El Rosario archipelago, and their relationship with extreme events between 2002 and 2014, Quickbird and Worldview Satellite images with uneven periodicity were analyzed and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for these vegetation covers. Time series analysis was performed to oceanographic and climate variables such as maximum wind velocity, daily precipitation, significant wave height, peak wave period and maximum and minimum air temperatures. The first two axes of a redundancy analysis explained 65% of data variance (p value <= 0.05) and showed that the decrease of the NDVI and extension of beach vegetation were related to increases in wind frequency and intensity. However, mangrove vegetation was benefited by the increase in the frequency of short drought events, although their NDVI decreased when these drought events became longer. Drought events were related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) anomalies that had the strongest effects on coastal vegetation and dry forest, as shown by the minimum values of NDVI recorded in 2010. Mangrove vegetation was more resilient to such droughts and strong winds than coastal and dry forest vegetation due to their location along bays or surrounding internal lagoons.

TI  - Per-pixel bias-variance decomposition of continuous errors in data-driven geospatial modeling: A case study in environmental remote sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the usefulness of a per-pixel bias-variance error decomposition (BVD) for understanding and improving spatially-explicit data-driven models of continuous variables in environmental remote sensing (ERS). BVD is a model evaluation method originated from machine learning and have not been examined for ERS applications. Demonstrated with a showcase regression tree model mapping land imperviousness (0-100%) using Landsat images, our results showed that BVD can reveal sources of estimation errors, map how these sources vary across space, reveal the effects of various model characteristics on estimation accuracy, and enable in-depth comparison of different error metrics. Specifically, BVD bias maps can help analysts identify and delineate model spatial non-stationarity; BVD variance maps can indicate potential effects of ensemble methods (e.g. bagging), and inform efficient training sample allocation - training samples should capture the full complexity of the modeled process, and more samples should be allocated to regions with more complex underlying processes rather than regions covering larger areas. Through examining the relationships between model characteristics and their effects on estimation accuracy revealed by BVD for both absolute and squared errors (i.e. error is the absolute or the squared value of the difference between observation and estimate), we found that the two error metrics embody different diagnostic emphases, can lead to different conclusions about the same model, and may suggest different solutions for performance improvement. We emphasize BVD's strength in revealing the connection between model characteristics and estimation accuracy, as understanding this relationship empowers analysts to effectively steer performance through model adjustments.

TI  - Temperature and food-mediated variability of European Atlantic sardine recruitment
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the environmental conditions during larval development on the resulting recruitment strength was investigated for European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) at Atlanto-Iberian waters. Satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) data from the previous spawning seasons (January to March/April and October to December of the previous year) were related to recruitment success data in the main recruitment hotspots. Recruitment data was taken from yearly acoustic scientific cruises and from the ICES recruitment index estimated by an age-structured model for the entire stock. A linear discriminant analysis model using SST, Chla, and the abundance of spawners during the spawning season identified years of high and low recruitment for all the recruitment hotspots with an accuracy of >= 79%. In general, high recruitment years were associated with high Chla and low SST, although the most important variables to discriminate between the groups were area-specific. High recruitment years were mostly related to high food availability (Chla), particularly during the last quarter of the previous year. In Western Iberia and in the Gulf of Cadiz, high recruitment years were also associated to lower SST, whereas in the Bay of Biscay, where SST during the winter was generally below the optimal range approximate to 11-12 degrees C for sardine larval development, higher recruitment was associated with high SST. For ICES data of the southern European sardine stock, lower SST and higher Chla during the last quarter of the previous year were associated with high recruitment years and SST alone was able to discriminate between the two recruitment groups with 73% accuracy. Although the time-series of available data are still small, these significant relationships are consistent with field and laboratory studies relating larval growth and mortality with main environmental drivers. These relationships should be further investigated in the following years to evaluate if they can be used to construct reliable indicators to predict the level of recruitment and abundance with sufficient advance to help in the management of this important fishing resource.

TI  - Serial or Parallel Metastasis of Cutaneous Melanoma? A Study of the German Central Malignant Melanoma Registry
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than a century the Halstedian hypothesis of contiguous metastasis from the primary tumor through the lymphatics to distant sites shaped lymph node surgery for melanoma. We challenge this dogma of serial metastatic dissemination. A single-center series of 2,299 patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma was investigated to analyze overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival of stage IV patients with or without primary lymphatic metastasis. Results were then compared with those of 2,134 patients from three independent centers of the German Central Malignant Melanoma Registry. A multivariate binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for the initial metastatic pathway. Distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval = 0.91-1.14; P = 0.76) and overall survival (HR = 1.09; 95% CI = 0.96-1.23; P = 0.177) did not differ between stage IV patients with primary hematogenous or primary lymphatic metastasis. Melanoma localization was the only significant risk factor for the initial metastatic pathway. These findings indicate that regional and distant metastases originate from the primary tumor itself in a rather parallel than serial fashion and could explain the lack of survival benefit associated with immediate complete lymph node dissection in sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma patients.

TI  - Evaluating MODIS vegetation products using digital images for quantifying local peatland CO<sub>2</sub> gas fluxes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In peatlands plant growth and senescence affect annual ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, and CO2 fluxes show considerable inter-annual variability. Phenology is a fundamental indicator of ecosystem carbon dynamics and can be measured from remote sensing systems, but the extent to which satellite products provide useful proxies of peatland vegetation phenology is not well known. Using MODIS vegetation products coupled with field observations of phenology from a basic camera system and measurements of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) measured using a closed chamber method, we sought to establish the extent to which satellite observations capture phenological processes at a UK peatland site. Daily, true-colour digital images were captured with a time-lapse camera (Brinno TLC100) between 23-Apr-2013 and 29-Oct-2013 and converted into a Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI). These were compared with a range of MODIS vegetation products at various spatial resolutions. We found that vegetation products with finer spatial resolution (<500m) more accurately captured spring green-up (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 16-day product), whereas those with 8-day temporal resolution better captured whole-season dynamics. The 8-day Gross Primary Productivity (GPP8) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR8) products had the strongest daily Pearson's correlations with camera-derived GRVI (r>0.90). The camera-GRVI (P=0.005, r=0.98) and MODIS-GRVI (P=0.041, r=0.89) products showed the strongest significant correlations with gross primary productivity measured using static chambers in the field. This work demonstrates that freely available MODIS data captured up to 92% of the daily variation in phenology over an upland peatland. This approach shows great potential for capturing ecosystem carbon dynamics which underpin carbon trading schemes, a budding funding source for peatland restoration projects.

AB  - The 2010 influenza season was moderate overall, with more laboratory-confirmed cases than in earlier years (with the exception of 2009). That said, self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was equal to or lower than 2008 and earlier years. In 2010, the number of laboratory-confirmed notifications for influenza was 0.8 times the 5-year mean. High notification rates were reflected in an increase in presentations with ILI to sentinel general practices and emergency departments. Notification rates were highest in the 0-4 year age group. Infections during the season were predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with 90% of notifications being influenza A (56% A(H1N)1pdm09, 30% A(unsubtyped) and 4% A(H3N2)) and 10% being influenza B. The A(H1), A(H3) and B influenza viruses circulating during the 2010 season were antigenically similar to the respective 2010 vaccine strains. Almost all (99%) of the circulating influenza B viruses that were analysed were from the B/Victoria lineage.

TI  - Improving BeiDou precise orbit determination using observations of onboard MEO satellite receivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the precise orbit determination (POD) of the regional Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) has been a hot spot because of its special constellation consisting of five geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites and five inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO) satellites besides four medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites since the end of 2012. GEO and IGSO satellites play an important role in regional BDS applications. However, this brings a great challenge to the POD, especially for the GEO satellites due to their geostationary orbiting. Though a number of studies have been carried out to improve the POD performance of GEO satellites, the result is still much worse than that of IGSO and MEO, particularly in the along-track direction. The major reason is that the geostationary characteristic of a GEO satellite results in a bad geometry with respect to the ground tracking network. In order to improve the tracking geometry of the GEO satellites, a possible strategy is to mount global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers on MEO satellites to collect the signals from GEO/IGSO GNSS satellites so as that these observations can be used to improve GEO/IGSO POD. We extended our POD software package to simulate all the related observations and to assimilate the MEO-onboard GNSS observations in orbit determination. Based on GPS and BDS constellations, simulated studies are undertaken for various tracking scenarios. The impact of the onboard GNSS observations is investigated carefully and presented in detail. The results show that MEO-onboard observations can significantly improve the orbit precision of GEO satellites from metres to decimetres, especially in the along-track direction. The POD results of IGSO satellites also benefit from the MEO-onboard data and the precision can be improved by more than 50% in 3D direction.

TI  - Tumor Biology Predicts Pathologic Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients Presenting with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is used to convert patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) to operability, but has not traditionally been used to avoid mastectomy or axillary dissection in this subset.The purpose of this study was to determine the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in LABC patients, and identify factors predictive of pCR to determine if responding patients might be suitable for limited surgery.From 2006 to 2016, 1522 patients received NAC followed by surgery; 321 had advanced disease in the breast (cT4) and/or in the nodes (cN2/N3). pCR rates were assessed by T and N stage, and receptor subtype.Of 321 LABC patients, 223 were cT4, 77 were cN2, and 82 were cN3. Forty-three percent were hormone receptor (HR) positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/HER2-), 23% were triple negative, and 34% were HER2+. The overall pCR rate was 25% and differed by receptor subtype (HR+/HER2- 7%, triple negative 23%, HER2+ 48%; p < 0.001). Breast pCR occurred in 27% of patients and was similar in T4 versus non-T4 disease (29% vs. 22%; p = 0.26). Nodal pCR was achieved in 38% of cN+ patients and did not differ by nodal stage (cN1 43%, cN2 36%, cN3 32%; p = 0.23). Nodal pCR was significantly more common than breast pCR (p = 0.014) across all tumor subtypes. Receptor subtype was the only predictor of overall pCR (p < 0.001).In patients with LABC, pCR after NAC was seen in 25%, and did not differ by T or N stage. Tumor biology, but not extent of disease, predicted pCR. Studies assessing the feasibility of surgical downstaging with NAC in LABC patients are warranted.

TI  - Estimating Agricultural Crop Types and Fallow Lands Using Multi Temporal Sentinel-2A Imageries
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Meeting the food and nutritional demands of ever growing human population will cause immense pressure on agricultural lands and natural resource bases across the world. This challenge can be met only by proper land and water management, which consists of crucial components like understanding cropping systems and crop fallow dynamics for sustainable intensification. In this work, a methodology was developed for crop and crop fallow land estimation using multi-temporal, high spatial resolution Sentinel-2A data in a test site of Odisha state, in India, comprising of two districts i.e., Bhadrak and Jajpur. Customized codes were written to find temporal variation pattern of NDVI values for each pixel in the study area. Observing the variation of NDVI over time, we have attempted to estimate crop life cycle duration and their type with rigorous field inputs. The cropland and fallow land intensification maps showed 10-different cropping pattern with classification accuracy of 83.33%, and kappa coefficient of 0.81. We observed that (1) kharif is the major crop in the study area, while rabi mainly grows in areas where external fresh water sources are available (2) a large portion of the area remains fallow for most part of the year as mapped from Sentinel 2A data. There is scope to utilise the fallow lands for multi-cropping with appropriate land and water management, through the government policy prescriptions. With Sentinel-2B sensor now on board, the temporal resolution of satellite-2 (2A and 2B combined) could improve leading to improved classification and upgradation of the algorithm followed here.

TI  - Analyzing the Long-Term Phenological Trends of Salt Marsh Ecosystem across Coastal LOUISIANA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the phenology of the salt marsh ecosystem across coastal Louisiana (LA) for a 16-year time period (2000-2015) using NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer's (MODIS) eight-day average surface reflectance images (500 m). We compared the performances of least squares fitted asymmetric Gaussian (AG) and double logistic (DL) smoothing functions in terms of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from the raw phenology derived from the time-series composites. We performed derivative analysis to determine the appropriate start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) thresholds. After that, we extracted the seasonality parameters in TIMESAT, and studied the effect of environmental disturbances/anomalies on the seasonality parameters. Finally, we performed trend analysis using the derived seasonality parameters such as base green biomass (GBM) value, maximum GBM value, seasonal amplitude, and small seasonal integral. Based on root mean square error (RMSE) values and residual plots, we selected the best thresholds for SOS (5% of amplitude) and EOS (20% of amplitude), along with the best smoothing function. The selected SOS and EOS thresholds were able to capture the environmental disturbances that have affected the salt marsh ecosystem during the 16-year time period. Our trend analysis results indicate positive trends in the base GBM values in the salt marshes of LA. However, we did not notice as much of a positive trend in the maximum GBM levels. Hence, we observed mostly negative changes in the GBM amplitude and small seasonal integral values. These negative changes indicated the overall progressive decline in the rates of photosynthesis and biomass allocation in the LA salt marsh ecosystem, which is most likely due to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and sea level rise. The results illustrate both the relative efficiency of MODIS-based biophysical models for analyzing salt marsh phenology, and performances of the smoothing techniques in terms of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the MODIS-derived phenology.

TI  - Identification of historic landscape features and settlement mounds in the Western Nile Delta by means of remote sensing time series analysis and the evaluation of vegetation characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques gain increasing importance in landscape archaeological research. Traditional archaeological excavation techniques are slow and time in the Nile Delta is running out. The Nile Delta has been settled and used for agricultural cultivation since the Neolithic period and is shaped by the interplay of urbanization and agriculture. In particular, the study of ancient settlement mounds (tells) and landscape archaeological features such as former river channels requires urgent action. This study seeks to develop supervised classification techniques on the basis of multitemporal Landsat 8 images to easily monitor existing high tells in the Delta that have not been destroyed yet. In the 19th and early 20th centuries many tells were destroyed, because tell sediments (sebakh) were harvested on an industrial scale in order to be used as fertilizer. These activities continued on a smaller scale into the mid to later 20th century. Geochemical analysis of ancient settlement material (sebakh) has confirmed the high content of nutrients. In a second step which is based on these geochemical findings, we seek to identify the category of lost tells which had been transformed into agricultural areas. We suggest that the presence of ancient settlement material enhances the overall vegetation performance and indirectly allows identification of lost tells via describing the vegetation performance. In general, the vegetation performance is a new measure and invented within this study. It is calculated as the product of different measures describing the plant growth, namely the mean NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), growth statistics and crop rotations derived from a large set of multitemporal NDVI images. Our results show that there exists a relationship between vegetation performance and the appearance of archaeological material in the topsoil and such information can be useful for planning of non-invasive archaeological surveys. Remarkably the vegetation performance corresponds with the location of former Nile branches that are currently investigated by the authors on the basis of TandemX elevation data and sedimentological investigations of the area. Several factors such as water availability and salinity also affect plant growth and mask this relationship. Additionally, our methods to describe the number of crop rotations or growth statistics from NDVI time series help to analyse the agricultural areas in the Nile Delta. Therefore, the methods used in this study may offer important insights on aspects of urban sprawl and agricultural areas in the Nile Delta and beyond.

TI  - Single-stage excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma in selected patients: a retrospective case-control study
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sometimes, diagnostic excision of a primary melanoma would already necessitate skin grafting or transposition skin flaps, especially in areas with an esthetic or functional importance. The utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after skin reconstruction is controversial. We carried out a single-institution retrospective case-control study. In patients with a wide primary lesion at high clinical-dermatoscopic suspicion for invasive melanoma in anatomical region in which a reconstruction with a skin graft or a flap is required, we proposed the performance of a confocal microscopy examination and an incisional biopsy of the primary lesion. If these diagnostic methodologies confirmed the suspicion of melanoma, lymphatic mapping was performed before the wide excision (WE) of the primary lesion, and WE and SLNB were performed during the same operative procedure. The database evaluation showed 496 patients who had undergone a previous complete local excision and a subsequent SLNB (two-stage group), whereas 61 patients underwent WE and SLNB during the same surgical time (one-stage group). Histological results of the excisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma in all patients of the one-stage group. The false-negative rate was lower in the one-stage group (5.5%) than in the two-stage group (16.7%). Patients of the two groups showed a similar recurrence-free and overall survival period even when corrected for clinic-demographical variables. The concomitant execution of SLNB and WE after confocal microscopy examination and incisional biopsy appears to be a safe and accurate procedure in patients with a wide primary melanoma that requires a skin flaps or a skin graft to cover the residual defect.

TI  - Prognostic impact of preoperative serum interleukin-6 levels in patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma, defined by sentinel node biopsy
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Failure to detect recurrence and lymph node metastasis early represents a fundamental barrier to the improvement of survival rate in early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The present study evaluated the association between serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level and clinical outcomes in patients with early stage OSCC patients defined by sentinel node biopsy (SNB). A total of 53 patients with clinical stage I/II OSCC who underwent SNB were enrolled. SNB was determined by a radioisotope method, and was evaluated by histopathological examination and genetic analysis. Preoperative sera were measured for IL-6 by ELISA. In the clinical stage I/II patients, disease-free survival (DFS) was demonstrated to be higher in patients with negative SNB compared with patients with positive SNB. In total, 13 patients were demonstrated to exhibit lymph node metastasis by SNB or were reclassified to pathological stage T4 subsequent to analysis of the surgically resected specimens. Thus, 40 patients were diagnosed with early stage OSCC. Of these 40 patients, DFS of the patients with low serum IL-6 was significantly higher compared with the patients with high serum IL-6 (P=0.012). In 19 patients with negative SNB and low serum IL-6, the disease-free rate was 100%. These findings suggested that SNB staging and serum IL-6 level have a high prognostic value in patients with early stage OSCC. Additional investigation and longer follow-up times are warranted to improve understanding of the group of patients that may benefit from this procedure.

TI  - Quantifying riparian total evaporation along the Groot Letaba River: A comparison between infilled and spatially downscaled satellite derived total evaporation estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite earth observation data for the estimation of evapotranspiration has been well documented and represents a viable approach for the quantification of riparian water use at landscape to regional scales. However, the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution associated with imagery can limit the reliability of satellite-based evapotranspiration modelling. This study investigated two approaches to quantify evapotranspiration at a moderate spatial resolution (30 m) on a daily time step, for a perennial river flowing through a semi-arid, savanna landscape. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) Model was used to derive daily evapotranspiration from satellite imagery. The actual crop coefficient (Kc(act)) and output downscaling with linear regression (ODLR) approaches were then evaluated by comparing their respective estimates against Eddy covariance (ECET) measurements at two locations. Comparisons of ET estimates acquired using the Kc(act) and ODLR approaches against ECET, yielded RMSE values of; 1.88 and 2.57 mm d(-1) and 1.10 and 2.39 mm d(-1) (for two replicate transects), respectively. The poor performance of these techniques was largely attributed to the SEBS ET estimates used as inputs to these techniques, as SEBS may overestimate evapotranspiration during conditions of water stress.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Visual Band Imagery Outperforms Medium Resolution Spectral Imagery for Ecosystem Assessment in the Semi-Arid Brazilian Sertao
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid ecosystems play a key role in global agricultural production, seasonal carbon cycle dynamics, and longer-run climate change. Because semi-arid landscapes are heterogeneous and often sparsely vegetated, repeated and large-scale ecosystem assessments of these regions have to date been impossible. Here, we assess the potential of high-spatial resolution visible band imagery for semi-arid ecosystem mapping. We use WorldView satellite imagery at 0.3-0.5 m resolution to develop a reference data set of nearly 10,000 labeled examples of three classes-trees, shrubs/grasses, and bare land-across 1000 km(2) of the semi-arid Sertao region of northeast Brazil. Using Google Earth Engine, we show that classification with low-spectral but high-spatial resolution input (WorldView) outperforms classification with the full spectral information available from Landsat 30 m resolution imagery as input. Classification with high spatial resolution input improves detection of sparse vegetation and distinction between trees and seasonal shrubs and grasses, two features which are lost at coarser spatial (but higher spectral) resolution input. Our total tree cover estimates for the study area disagree with recent estimates using other methods that may underestimate treecover because they confuse trees with seasonal vegetation (shrubs and grasses). This distinction is important for monitoring seasonal and long-run carbon cycle and ecosystem health. Our results suggest that newer remote sensing products that promise high frequency global coverage at high spatial but lower spectral resolution may offer new possibilities for direct monitoring of the world's semi-arid ecosystems, and we provide methods that could be scaled to do so.

TI  - Daily Evapotranspiration Mapping Using Regression Random Forest Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient water management in agriculture requires an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET). Even though local measurements can be used to estimate the components of the surface energy balance, these values cannot be extrapolated to large areas due to the heterogeneity and complexity of agricultural and natural land surfaces and the dynamic nature of their heat processes. This extrapolation can be done by using satellite imagery, which provides information in the infrared thermal band; however, this band is not available in most current operational remote sensors. Our work hypothesis is that it is possible to generate a spatially distributed estimation of ETd without thermal band by using nonparametric models as regression random forest models (RRFM). Six Landsat-7 scenes were used to generate the RRFM. Results were evaluated by comparing the values of ETd provided by RRFM with that obtained using the surface energy balance model. It has been shown that the results generated by RRFM present a good agreement withMETRIC (mapping ET at high resolution using internalized calibration) results, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially for agricultural vegetation and forest land covers. Moreover, it has been detected that the RRFM estimation quality depends on the meteorological conditions on the days previous to the satellite register. It can be concluded that the ET d estimated by the RRFM would be feasible for real applications when the thermal band is not available.

TI  - Brown Carbon and Black Carbon in the Smoky Atmosphere during Boreal Forest Fires
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have investigated the variability of smoke aerosol absorbing ability with variations in the content of brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC). Using monitoring data on radiative characteristics of smoke aerosol at AERONET stations and the spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained by the MODIS spectrometer (Terra satellite), we have detected large-scale smokes during boreal forest fires in Russia and Canada (1995-2012). The spatial distribution (50A degrees-70A degrees N, 95A degrees-125A degrees W) and temporal variability (at AERONET station Fort McMurray) of AOD during the smoking of a part of Canada in July 2012 have been analyzed. AOD probability distributions for July 14-18, 2012, and an estimate of aerosol radiative forcing of smoke aerosol at the upper boundary of the atmosphere have been obtained. We have proposed a technique for the diagnostics of BrC and BC in smoke aerosol particles from the spectral dependence of the imaginary part of the refractive index. At a wavelength of 440 nm, the contributions of BrC and BC to the smokeaerosol absorbing abitity can be comparable in magnitude. In many cases, the absorption spectra of smoke aerosol can be adequately approximated by either power or exponential functions. The presence of BrC in smoke-aerosol particles highly extends the variety of observed absorption spectra in a smoky atmosphere and spectral dependences of single scattering albedo. In the spectral range of 440-1020 nm, the radiative characteristics of smoke aerosol are largely contributed by its fine mode.

TI  - Trend analysis of evapotranspiration over India: Observed from long-term satellite measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the lack of consistent spatial time series data on actual evapotranspiration (ET), very few studies have been conducted on the long-term trend and variability in ET at a national scale over the Indian subcontinent. The present study uses biome specific ET data derived from NOAA satellite's advanced very high resolution radiometer to investigate the trends and variability in ET over India from 1983 to 2006. Trend analysis using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test showed that the domain average ET decreased during the period at a rate of 0.22mm year(-1). A strong decreasing trend (m = -1.75mm year(-1), F = 17.41, P < 0.01) was observed in forest regions. Seasonal analyses indicated a decreasing trend during southwest summer monsoon (m = -0.320mm season(-1) year(-1)) and post-monsoon period (m = -0.188mm season(-1) year(-1)). In contrast, an increasing trend was observed during northeast winter monsoon (m = 0.156mm season(-1) year(-1)) and pre-monsoon (m = 0.068mm season(-1) year(-1)) periods. Despite an overall net decline in the country, a considerable increase (>4mm year(-1)) was observed over arid and semi-arid regions. Grid level correlation with various climatic parameters exhibited a strong positive correlation (r > 0.5) of ET with soil moisture and precipitation over semi-arid and arid regions, whereas a negative correlation (r<-0.5) occurred with temperature and insolation in dry regions of western India. The results of this analysis are useful for understanding regional ET dynamics and its relationship with various climatic parameters over India. Future studies on the effects of ET changes on the hydrological cycle, carbon cycle, and energy partitioning are needed to account for the feedbacks to the climate.

TI  - Lake ice phenology of Nam Co, Central Tibetan Plateau, China, derived from multiple MODIS data products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology, including freeze-up and break-up dates, is a sensitive indicator of climate change. However, uniformly created lake ice phenology records are still required on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) for a more accurate analysis of climate change. In this study, we present a new automated method to extend the interpretation of existing in-situ lake ice records, using multiple MODIS data products. Our results showed strong agreement with the in-situ data at Nam Co (Co means lake in Tibetan language) on the central TP. The multiple MODIS based method is therefore well-suited to the detection of lake ice phenology. The result showed that in 2000-2015, the mean lake ice duration (ID) in the middle of Nam Co was similar to 87 d: the freeze-up start (FUS) date delayed 0.58 d/yr and the break-up start (BUS) date delayed 0.09 d/yr, giving a total decrease in ID at the rate of 0.49 d/yr. We suggest the delayed freeze-up dates became more marked in response to climate warming. Changes in lake ice coverage in Nam Co are affected by a number of local and regional climatic factors, such as air temperature and wind speed.

TI  - Validation and head-to-head comparison of three nomograms predicting probability of lymph node invasion of prostate cancer in patients undergoing extended and/or sentinel lymph node dissection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The updated Winter nomogram is the only nomogram predicting lymph node invasion (LNI) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients based on sentinel node (SN) dissection (sLND). The aim of the study was to externally validate the Winter nomogram and examine its performance in patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), ePLND combined with SN biopsy (SNB) and sLND only. The results were compared with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and updated Briganti nomograms.Methods This retrospective study included 1183 patients with localized PCa undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) combined with pelvic lymphadenectomy and 224 patients treated with sLND and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), aiming to offer pelvic radiotherapy only in case of histologically positive SNs. In the RARP population, ePLND was applied in 956 (80.8%) patients,while 227 (19.2%) patients were offered ePLND combined with additional SNB.Results The median numbers of removed nodes were 10 (interquartile range, IQR = 6-14), 15 (IQR = 10-20) and 7 (IQR = 4-10) in the ePLND, ePLND + SNB, and sLND groups, respectively. Corresponding LNI rates were 16.6%, 25.5% and 42%. Based on the AUC, the performance of the Briganti nomogram (0.756) in the ePLND group was superior to both the MSKCC (0.744) and Winter nomogram (0.746). The Winter nomogram, however, was the best predictor of LNI in both the ePLND + SNB (0.735) and sLND (0.709) populations. In the calibration analysis, all nomograms showed better accuracy in the low/intermediate risk patients, while in the high-risk population, an overestimation of the risk for LNI was observed.Conclusion The SN-based updated nomogram showed better prediction in the SN population. The results were also comparable, relative to predictive tools developed with (e)PLND, suggesting a difference in sampling accuracy between SNB and non-SNB. Patients who benefit most from the nomogram would be those with a low/intermediate risk of LN metastasis.

TI  - A sealable ultrathin window sample cell for the study of liquids by means of soft X-ray spectroscopy
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new sample cell concept for the analysis of liquids or solid-liquid interfaces using soft X-ray spectroscopy is presented, which enables the complete sealing of the cell as well as the transport into vacuum via, for example, a load-lock system. The cell uses pressure monitoring and active as well as passive pressure regulation systems, thereby facilitating the full control over the pressure during filling, sealing, evacuation, and measurement. The cell design and sample preparation as well as the crucial sealing procedure are explained in detail. As a first proof-of-principle experiment, successful nitrogen K-edge fluorescence yield near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure experiments of a biomolecular solution are presented. For this purpose, it is shown that the careful evaluation of all involved parameters, such as window type or photon flux, is desirable for optimizing the experimental result.

TI  - An Object-Based Linear Weight Assignment Fusion Scheme to Improve Classification Accuracy Using Landsat and MODIS Data at the Decision Level
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellite images are extensively used in land-use studies due to their relatively high spatial resolution. However, the number of usable data sets is limited by the relatively long revisit interval and phenology effects can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images have higher temporal frequency and can provide extra time-series information. However, they are limited in their capability to classify heterogeneous landscapes due to their coarse spatial resolution. Fusion of different data sources is a potential solution for improving land-cover classification. This paper proposes a fusion scheme to combine Landsat and MODIS remote sensing data at the decision level. First, multiresolution segmentations on the two kinds of remote sensing data are performed to identify the landscape objects and are used as fusion units in subsequent steps. Then, fuzzy classifications are applied to each of the two different resolution data sets and the classification accuracies are evaluated. According to the performance of the two data sets in classification evaluation, a simple weight assignment technique based on the weighted sum of the membership of imaged objects is implemented in the final classification decision. The weighting factors are calculated based on a confusion matrix and the heterogeneity of detected land cover. The algorithm is capable of integrating the time-series spectral information of MODIS data with spatial contexts extracted from Landsat data, thus improving the land-cover classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy using the fusion technique increased by 7.43% and 10.46% compared with the results from the individual Landsat and MODIS data, respectively.

TI  - Mercury contamination level and speciation inventory in Lakes Titicaca & Uru-Uru (Bolivia): Current status and future trends
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems of the Bolivian Altiplano (similar to 3800 m a.s.l.) are characterized by extreme hydro-climatic constrains (e.g., high UV-radiations and low oxygen) and are under the pressure of increasing anthropogenic activities, unregulated mining, agricultural and urban development. We report here a complete inventory of mercury (Hg) levels and speciation in the water column, atmosphere, sediment and key sentinel organisms (i.e., plankton, fish and birds) of two endorheic Lakes of the same watershed differing with respect to their size, eutrophication and contamination levels. Total Hg (THg) and mono-methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations in filtered water and sediment of Lake Titicaca are in the lowest range of reported levels in other large lakes worldwide. Downstream, Hg levels are 3-10 times higher in the shallow eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru than in Lake Titicaca due to high Hg inputs from the surrounding mining region. High percentages of MMHg were found in the filtered and unfiltered water rising up from <1 to similar to 50% THg from the oligoihetero-trophic Lake Titicaca to the eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru. Such high % MMHg is explained by a high in situ MMHg production in relation to the sulfate rich substrate, the low oxygen levels of the water column, and the stabilization of MMHg due to abundant ligands present in these alkaline waters. Differences in MMHg concentrations in water and sediments compartments between Lake Titicaca and Uru-Uru were found to mirror the offset in MMHg levels that also exist in their respective food webs. This suggests that in situ MMHg baseline production is likely the main factor controlling MMHg levels in fish species consumed by the local population. Finally, the increase of anthropogenic pressure in Lake Titicaca may probably enhance eutrophication processes which favor MMHg production and thus accumulation in water and biota.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore large (60 m/pixel) and small scale (individual building level) temperature distribution patterns from thermal remote sensing data and to conclude what kind of information could be extracted from thermal remote sensing on regular basis. Landsat program provides frequent large scale thermal images useful for analysis of city temperature patterns. During the study correlation between temperature patterns and vegetation content based on NDVI and building coverage based on OpenStreetMap data was studied. Landsat based temperature patterns were independent from the season, negatively correlated with vegetation content and positively correlated with building coverage.Small scale analysis included spatial and raster descriptor analysis for polygons corresponding to roofs of individual buildings for evaluating insulation of roofs. Remote sensing and spatial descriptors are poorly related to heat consumption data, however, thermal aerial data median and entropy can help to identify poorly insulated roofs. Automated quantitative roof analysis has high potential for acquiring city wide information about roof insulation, but quality is limited by reference data quality and information on building types, and roof materials would be crucial for further studies.

TI  - Investigating the Influence of Variable Freshwater Ice Types on Passive and Active Microwave Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual-polarized airborne passive microwave (PM) brightness temperatures (T-b) at 6.9 GHz H/V, 19 GHz H/V and 37 GHz H/V and spaceborne active microwave (AM) X-band (9.65 GHz VV, VH) backscatter (sigma(0)) are observed coincident to in situ snow and lake-ice measurements collected over two lakes near Inuvik, Canada. Lake-ice thickness is found to be positively correlated with 19 GHz V emission (R = 0.67) and negatively with 19 GHz H emission (R = -0.79), indicating surface ice conditions influence microwave interaction. Lake ice types are delineated from TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using the iterative region growing with semantics (IRGS) segmentation algorithm implemented in the MAGIC (MAp Guided Ice Classification) system. The spatial extent of derived ice type classes correspond well to in situ observations. The overall magnitude of emission at 19 GHz H and X-band VH sigma(0) increase with the scattering potential of associated ice types (grey/rafted ice). Transects of 6.9 GHz PM and 19 GHz PM exhibit positive relationships with VH sigma(0) over freshwater lake ice, with the greatest R coefficients at H-pol (R = 0.64, 0.46). Conversely, 6.9 GHz T-b and 19 GHz T-b exhibit negative R coefficients in regions of brackish water due to tubular bubble and brine inclusions in the ice. This study identifies congruency between PM and AM scattering mechanisms over lake ice for the purpose of identifying the influence of ice types on overall microwave interaction within the lake-ice system.

TI  - Archaeological Exploration in Srirangapatna and Its Environ Through Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study involves exploration of archaeological structures in Srirangapatana and virtual reconstruction of Srirangapatana fort using geo-spatial techniques. Antiquity of this river island town goes back to ninth century AD which continued till British rule and hence has abundance of archaeological structures on it. Some of these structures are known and well-maintained while others are unprotected, unexcavated, hidden under thick vegetation or forgotten. To identify archaeological features such as buried/dilapidated/vegetation infested structures/features on ground, we used high resolution multispectral remote sensing data (0.5 and 5.6 m), Cartosat 1 stereo pairs (2.5 m), anaglyphs, historical documents, and analysed them on GIS platform. This study enabled us to: trace the concentric moats and fort-wall by using false colour composite image together with anaglyphs generated from Cartosat 1 stereo pair; explore hitherto unexplored and unexcavated archaeological features; identify unknown and abandoned temples/structures smothered with wild vegetation; locate exact location of currently non-existent site mentioned in historical records; identify the location of buried canal. This study also demonstrates how methodic use of various interpretation keys, image processing and analysis (such as NDVI, DEM, anaglyphs) can help in extracting archaeological features and direct archaeologists for further exploration.

TI  - Long-time variations of precipitable water vapour estimated from GPS, MODIS and radiosonde observations in Turkey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapour and its variations in the Earth's atmosphere are related to atmospheric activities and climate changes. However, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution and high-accuracy precipitable water vapour (PWV) and its variations using traditional techniques, particularly in Turkey with the complex weather variability caused by the proximity of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite observations provide unique ways to observe PWV variations at regional or global scale, e.g. global positioning system (GPS). In this study, long-time PWV variations and trends are investigated and obtained from 6-year continuous GPS observations in Turkey (January 2010-January 2016), which are compared with nearly co-located radiosonde and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations to check its accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) of PWV differences is about 1-3mm between radiosonde and GPS, and 3-7mm between MODIS and GPS. Furthermore, the linear trend and seasonal amplitudes, and phase of the GPS-estimated PWV signals are computed. Statistically significant trends are found at all stations. While stations near the Mediterranean Sea have increasing trends with about 0.30mmyear(-1), the stations at inland have increasing trends of about 0.10mmyear(-1). The annual phases between radiosonde, GPS and MODIS PWV at all the stations are almost close to each other with differences in 1 degrees-2 degrees. Finally, the relation between north Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and PWV trends is investigated. Results show that PWV trends agree with NAO behaviours especially for the stations near the Mediterranean Sea. The recent human activities may have impacts on long-term PWV variation trends.

TI  - A multi-step scheme for spatial analysis of solar and photovoltaic production variability and complementarity
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy resources are variable by nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system. The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system.This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions, from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate change projections analysis.The main steps of the method are the application of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the whole domain, the analysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained clusters for examining their complementarity.As an implementation example, we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale, which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters. Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type.The whole process described in the article provides the information of how solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or for interconnected systems involving several countries.

TI  - Sensitivity of GRACE-derived estimates of groundwater-level changes in southern Ontario, Canada
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Amidst changing climates, understanding the world's water resources is of increasing importance. In Ontario, Canada, low water conditions are currently assessed using only precipitation and watershed-based stream gauges by the Conservation Authorities in Ontario and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. Regional groundwater-storage changes in Ontario are not currently measured using satellite data by research institutes. In this study, contributions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data are compared to a hydrogeological database covering southern Ontario from 2003 to 2013, to determine the suitability of GRACE total water storage estimates for monitoring groundwater storage in this location. Terrestrial water storage data from GRACE were used to determine monthly groundwater storage (GWS) anomaly values. GWS values were also determined by multiplying groundwater-level elevations (from the Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network wells) by specific yield. Comparisons of GRACE-derived GWS to well-based GWS data determined that GRACE is sufficiently sensitive to obtain a meaningful signal in southern Ontario. Results show that GWS values produced by GRACE are useful for identifying regional changes in groundwater storage in areas with limited available hydrogeological characterization data. Results also indicate that GRACE may have an ability to forecast changes in groundwater storage, which will become useful when monitoring climate shifts in the near future.

TI  - Tropical land use land cover mapping in Para (Brazil) using discriminative Markov random fields and multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information. However, detection of, short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial temporal variability is a challenging task.We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Para with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat),for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to 79% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain.The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes.

TI  - Using MODIS remote sensing data for mapping the spatio-temporal variability of water quality and river turbid plume
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fox River is the main source of land-based pollutants that flows into the southern Green Bay of Lake Michigan. Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.

TI  - Evaluation of anticoagulation status for atrial fibrillation on early ischaemic stroke outcomes: a registry-based, prospective cohort study of acute stroke care in Surrey, UK
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The relationship of anticoagulation therapies with stroke severity and outcomes have been well documented in the literature. However, none of the previous research has reported the relationship of atrial fibrillation (AF)/anticoagulation therapies with urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia and length of stay in hyperacute stroke units (HASUs). The present study aimed to evaluate AF and anticoagulation status in relation to early outcomes in 1387 men (median age=75 years, IQR=65-83) and 1371 women (median age=83 years, IQR=74-89) admitted with acute ischaemic stroke to HASUs in Surrey between 2014 and 2016.Methods We conducted this registry-based, prospective cohort study using data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. Association between AF anticoagulation status with severe stroke on arrival (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >= 16), prolonged HASU stay (>3 weeks), UTI and pneumonia within 7 days of admission, severe disability on discharge (modified Rankin Scale score=4 and 5) and inpatient mortality was assessed by logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes and previous stroke.Results Compared with patients with stroke who are free from AF, those with AF without anticoagulation had an increased adjusted risk of having more severe stroke: 5.8% versus 14.0%, OR=2.4 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.6, P<0.001), prolonged HASU stay: 21.5% versus 32.0%, OR=1.4 (1.0-2.0, P=0.027), pneumonia: 8.2% versus 19.1%, OR=2.1 (1.4-2.9, P<0.001), more severe disability: 24.2% versus 40.4%, OR=1.6 (1.2-2.1, P=0.004) and mortality: 9.3% versus 21.7%, OR=1.9 (1.4-2.8, P<0.001), and AF patients with anticoagulation also had greater risk for having UTI: 8.6% versus 12.3%, OR=1.9 (1.2-3.0, P=0.004), pneumonia: 8.2% versus 11.5%, OR=1.6 (1.12.4, P=0.025) and mortality: 9.7% versus 21.7%, OR=1.9 (1.4-2.8, P<0.001). The median HASU stay for stroke patients with AF without anticoagulation was 10.6 days (IQR=2.8-26.4) compared with 5.8 days (IQR=2.3-17.5) for those free from AF (P<0.001).Conclusions Patients with AF, particularly those without anticoagulation, are at increased risk of severe stroke, associated with prolonged HASU stay and increased risk of early infection, disability and mortality.

TI  - Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland with C-Band Full Polarization SAR Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic mulching is an important technology in agricultural production both in China and the rest of the world. In spite of its benefit of increasing crop yields, the booming expansion of the plastic mulching area has been changing the landscape patterns and affecting the environment. Accurate and effective mapping of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) can provide useful information for leveraging its advantages and disadvantages. However, mapping the PMF with remote sensing is still challenging owing to its varying spectral characteristics with the crop growth and geographic spatial division. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Radarsat-2 data for mapping PMF. We obtained the backscattering intensity of different polarizations and multiple polarimetric decomposition descriptors. These remotely-sensed information was used as input features for Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results indicated that the features from Radarsat-2 data have great potential for mapping PMF. The overall accuracies of PMF mapping with Radarsat-2 data were close to 75%. Although the classification accuracy with the back-scattering intensity information alone was relatively lower owing to the inherent speckle noise in SAR data, it has been improved significantly by introducing the polarimetric decomposition descriptors. The accuracy was nearly 75%. In addition, the features derived from the Entropy/Anisotropy/Alpha (H/A/Alpha) polarimetric decomposition, such as Alpha, entropy, and so on, made a greater contribution to PMF mapping than the Freeman decomposition, Krogager decomposition and the Yamaguchi4 decomposition. The performances of different classifiers were also compared. In this study, the RF classifier performed better than the SVM classifier. However, it is expected that the classification accuracy of PMF with SAR remote sensing data can be improved by combining SAR remote sensing data with optical remote sensing data.

TI  - A comparative study of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasonography in the diagnosis of breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of F-18-FDG-PET/CT (PET/CT) with ultrasonography (US) in detection of primary breast cancer and axillary lymph nodes (ALN) metastasis of breast cancer.METHODS: One hundred and sixty four patients with breast carcinoma were recruited and analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent PET-CT and US. The PET/CT scan results for the diagnosis of primary breast cancer were compared with US. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT in detecting ALN metastasis was compared with histopathology.RESULTS: In 164 patients with cytologically established breast carcinoma, the sensitivity of PET/CT and US in the diagnosis of breast cancer were 86% (141/164), 91% (149/164), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity of PET/CT and US in ALN staging were 46% and 54%, 91% and 91%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT correlated with the ALN size, the SUVmax of primary breast cancer (P=0.02 and 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is very expensive, and not superior to US in detection of primary breast cancer and in ALN staging, but superior in detecting distant metastases. PET/CT cannot be recommended as a primary diagnostic procedure in early breast cancer. US should still remain the first line for the diagnosis of stage I breast cancer. In relation to the detection of axillary node metastases, both PET/CT and ultrasonography have poor sensitivity, and cannot replace staging by using the sentinel node procedure.

TI  - Classification of Multisensor and Multiresolution Remote Sensing Images Through Hierarchical Markov Random Fields
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes two methods for the supervised classification of multisensor optical and synthetic aperture radar images with possibly different spatial resolutions. Both the methods are formulated within a unique framework based on hierarchical Markov random fields. Distinct quad-trees associated with the individual information sources are defined to jointly address multisensor, multiresolution, and possibly multifrequency fusion, and are integrated with finite mixture models and the marginal posterior mode criterion. Experimental validation is conducted with Pleiades, COSMO-SkyMed, RADARSAT-2, and GeoEye-1 data.

TI  - Using Satellite Imagery to Examine the Relationship between Surface-Water Dynamics of the Salt Lakes of Western Texas and Ogallala Aquifer Depletion
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used Landsat imagery to examine surface-water dynamics over the past 27 years in 39 salt lakes (salinas) of the Southern High Plains of the U.S. These groundwater- and precipitation-fed wetlands are regionally unique habitats with high salt concentrations and halophytic biota that may be vulnerable to hydrological changes from groundwater extraction for agriculture coupled with drought. We documented amounts and occurrences of water within the 39 salinas, comparing summer and winter (representing periods of high and low groundwater demand, respectively) in 1986-2013. During this span in our study area, total and irrigated cropland acreage increased, and the saturated thickness of the Ogallala Aquifer decreased by similar to 18.3%. There was variation in inundation frequency by salina, with two never holding water during our study. A third of the salinas went dry at least once, slightly more in summer than winter. Occurrence of water was not simply a function of basin size or to depth to the aquifer. These wetlands are being impacted by human changes to the landscape that are diminishing groundwater inputs, effectively creating novel wetlands that are now primarily supplied by precipitation rather than groundwater, with altered hydrological and ecological traits that may exacerbate regional vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - Updating Landsat time series of surface-reflectance composites and forest change products with new observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of time series satellite data allows for the temporally dense, systematic, transparent, and synoptic capture of land dynamics over time. Subsequent to the opening of the Landsat archive, several time series approaches for characterizing landscape change have been developed, often representing a particular analytical time window. The information richness and widespread utility of these time series data have created a need to maintain the currency of time series information via the addition of new data, as it becomes available. When an existing time series is temporally extended, it is critical that previously generated change information remains consistent, thereby not altering reported change statistics or science outcomes based on that change information. In this research, we investigate the impacts and implications of adding additional years to an existing 29-year annual Landsat time series for forest change. To do so, we undertook a spatially explicit comparison of the 29 overlapping years of a time series representing 1984-2012, with a time series representing 1984-2016. Surface reflectance values, and presence, year, and type of change were compared. We found that the addition of years to extend the time series had minimal effect on the annual surface reflectance composites, with slight band-specific differences (r >= 0.1) in the final years of the original time series being updated. The area of stand replacing disturbances and determination of change year are virtually unchanged for the overlapping period between the two time-series products. Over the overlapping temporal period (1984-2012), the total area of change differs by 0.53%, equating to an annual difference in change area of 0.019%. Overall, the spatial and temporal agreement of the changes detected by both time series was 96%. Further, our findings suggest that the entire pre-existing historic time series does not need to be re-processed during the update process. Critically, given the time series change detection and update approach followed here, science outcomes or reports representing one temporal epoch can be considered stable and will not be altered when a time series is updated with newly available data.

TI  - Childhood bruising distribution observed from eight mechanisms of unintentional injury
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To inform the assessment of described mechanisms of bruising in children.Design Prospective cross-sectional study.Setting The emergency department, and children in the local community.Patients Children aged 0-13 years with bruises from unintentional injuries. Exclusions: bleeding disorder, medication affecting coagulation or child protection concerns.Interventions Injury incidents were categorised into one of eight causal mechanisms (fall from<1 m, 1-2 m, fall from standing height or less and hitting an object during fall, stairs or impact, crush, sports or motor vehicle collision).Main outcome measures Location, number and mechanism of bruising for each injury mechanism.Results 372 children had 559 injury incidents, resulting in 693 bruises; 85.2% of children were walking independently, with impact injuries and fall from standing height (including hitting an object) being the predominant mechanisms. A single bruise was observed in 81.7% of all incidents. Stair falls resulted in >= 3 bruises only with falls involving >= 10 steps (6/16). Bruising was rarely observed on the buttocks, upper arm, back of legs or feet. No bruises were seen in this dataset on ears, neck or genitalia. Petechial bruising was only noted in 1/293 unintentional incidents, involving a high-impact injury in a school-aged child.Conclusion These findings have the potential to aid an assessment of the plausibility of the explanation given for a child with bruising. Certain bruise distributions were rarely observed, namely multiple bruises from a single mechanism, petechiae and bruising to the ears, neck or genitalia.

TI  - Vision-Based Target Finding and Inspection of a Ground Target Using a Multirotor UAV System
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a system that uses an algorithm for target detection and navigation and a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for finding a ground target and inspecting it closely is presented. The system can also be used for accurate and safe delivery of payloads or spot spraying applications in site-specific crop management. A downward-looking camera attached to a multirotor is used to find the target on the ground. The UAV descends to the target and hovers above the target for a few seconds to inspect the target. A high-level decision algorithm based on an OODA (observe, orient, decide, and act) loop was developed as a solution to address the problem. Navigation of the UAV was achieved by continuously sending local position messages to the autopilot via Mavros. The proposed system performed hovering above the target in three different stages: locate, descend, and hover. The system was tested in multiple trials, in simulations and outdoor tests, from heights of 10 m to 40 m. Results show that the system is highly reliable and robust to sensor errors, drift, and external disturbance.

TI  - Google Earth Engine, Open-Access Satellite Data, and Machine Learning in Support of Large-Area Probabilistic Wetland Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern advances in cloud computing and machine-leaning algorithms are shifting the manner in which Earth-observation (EO) data are used for environmental monitoring, particularly as we settle into the era of free, open-access satellite data streams. Wetland delineation represents a particularly worthy application of this emerging research trend, since wetlands are an ecologically important yet chronically under-represented component of contemporary mapping and monitoring programs, particularly at the regional and national levels. Exploiting Google Earth Engine and R Statistical software, we developed a workflow for predicting the probability of wetland occurrence using a boosted regression tree machine-learning framework applied to digital topographic and EO data. Working in a 13,700 km(2) study area in northern Alberta, our best models produced excellent results, with AUC (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve) values of 0.898 and explained-deviance values of 0.708. Our results demonstrate the central role of high-quality topographic variables for modeling wetland distribution at regional scales. Including optical and/or radar variables into the workflow substantially improved model performance, though optical data performed slightly better. Converting our wetland probability-of-occurrence model into a binary Wet-Dry classification yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, which is virtually identical to that derived from the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory (AMWI): the contemporary inventory used by the Government of Alberta. However, our workflow contains several key advantages over that used to produce the AMWI, and provides a scalable foundation for province-wide monitoring initiatives.

TI  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as an Estimator for Abundance and Quality of Avian Herbivore Forage in Arctic Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tools that can monitor biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants are needed to understand how arctic herbivores may respond to the rapidly changing environment at high latitudes. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used to assess changes in abundance and distribution of terrestrial vegetative communities. However, the efficacy of NDVI to measure seasonal changes in biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants in the Arctic remains largely un-evaluated at landscape and fine-scale levels. We modeled the relationships between NDVI and seasonal changes in aboveground biomass and nitrogen concentration in halophytic graminoids, a key food source for arctic-nesting geese. The model was calibrated based on data collected at one site and validated using data from another site. Effects of spatial scale on model accuracy were determined by comparing model predictions between NDVI derived from moderate resolution (250 x 250 m pixels) satellite data and high resolution (20 cm diameter area) handheld spectrometer data. NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer was a superior estimator (R-2 0.67) of seasonal changes in aboveground biomass compared to satellite-derived NDVI (R-2 0.40). The addition of temperature and precipitation variables to the model for biomass improved fit, but provided minor gains in predictive power beyond that of the NDVI-only model. This model, however, was only a moderately accurate estimator of biomass in an ecologically-similar halophytic graminoid wetland located 100 km away, indicating the necessity for site-specific validation. In contrast to assessments of biomass, satellite-derived NDVI was a better estimator for the timing of peak percent of nitrogen than NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer. We confirmed that the date when NDVI reached 50% of its seasonal maximum was a reasonable approximation of the period of peak spring vegetative green-up and peak percent nitrogen. This study demonstrates the importance of matching the scale of NDVI measurements to the vegetation properties of biomass and nitrogen phenology.

TI  - The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the treatment of breast ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>: A Danish population-based study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The risk of axillary metastases in breast cancer patients with only ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is low. Thus, axillary staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should only be used according to the current guidelines to avoid over-treatment and unnecessary morbidity. In the present study, the use of SLNB in patients with DCIS was evaluated nationally and compared across Danish departments.Material and methods: A register-based study was conducted using the Danish Breast Cancer Group database. The use of SLNB in DCIS patients according to year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, size of lesion, Van Nuys classification, palpability, location and department of surgery was evaluated. The chi-squared test was used to test differences between the groups.Results: Data from 2618 Danish female patients diagnosed with DCIS between 2004 and 2015 were included; 54.3% of patients underwent SLNB. The use of SLNB increased from 26.6% in 2004 to 65.1% in 2015. A total of 1877 (71.7%) patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and 577 (22.0%) underwent mastectomy, of which 43.9% and 86.0% respectively had a concomitant SLNB. The SLNB was performed in 23.8% of 454 patients not included by the guidelines. The use of SLNB in combination with BCS differed significantly between departments ranging from 19.7% to 63.8%. A significant difference in the use of SLNB with BCS and mastectomy according to department capacity (high-volume departments versus low-volume departments) was observed.Conclusion: The use of SLNB in patients with DCIS and adherence to the Danish national guidelines varies among Danish breast surgery departments. To optimise the axillary treatment of patients with DCIS, an improved compliance to the national DCIS guidelines is necessary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intraoperative partial breast radiotherapy is an alternative or an adjunct to fractionated whole breast irradiation for the administration of adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer following breast conserving surgery. Establishing intraoperative radiotherapy as a therapeutic modality requires a multidisciplinary approach to patient selection, workup, surgery, radiation protocols, chemotherapy, and patient follow up. In this article, we review the published evidence for best clinical practice, as a guide to the introduction of intraoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Application of automated image analysis reduces the workload of manual screening of sentinel lymph node biopsies in breast cancer
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsBreast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases in women, with >1.67 million cases being diagnosed worldwide each year. In breast cancer, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) pinpoints the first lymph node(s) into which the tumour spreads, and it is usually located in the ipsilateral axilla. In patients with no clinical signs of metastatic disease in the axilla, an SLN biopsy (SLNB) is performed. Assessment of metastases in the SLNB, when using a conventional microscope, is performed by manually observing a metastasis and measuring its size and/or counting the number of tumour cells. This is done essentially to categorize the type of metastasis as macrometastasis, micrometastasis, or isolated tumour cells, which is used to determine which treatment the breast cancer patient will benefit most from. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether digital image analysis can be applied as a screening tool for SNLB assessment without compromising the diagnostic accuracy.Materials and resultsConsecutive SLNBs from 135 patients with localized breast cancer receiving surgery in the period February to August 2015 were collected and included in this study. Of the 135 patients, 35 were received at the Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, 50 at the Department of Pathology, Zealand University Hospital, and 50 at the Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were analysed by immunohistochemistry with the BenchMark ULTRA Ventana platform. Rigshospitalet used a mixture of cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, Zealand University Hospital used pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 and Odense used pancytokeratin CAM5.2 for detection of epithelial tumour cells. Slides were stained locally. SLNB sections were assessed in a conventional microscope according to national guidelines for SLNBs in breast cancer patients. The immunohistochemically stained sections were scanned with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer-XR digital whole slide scanner, and the images were analysed with Visiopharm's software by use of a custom-made algorithm for SLNBs in breast cancer. The algorithm was optimized to the CK antibodies and the local laboratory conditions, on the basis of staining intensity and background staining. Conventional microscopy was used as the gold standard for assessment of positive tumour cells, and the results were compared with those from digital image analysis. The algorithm showed a sensitivity of 100% (that is, no false-negative slides were observed), including 67.2%, 19.2% and 56.1% of the slides from the three pathology departments being negative, respectively. This means that, on average, the workload could have been decreased by 58.2% by use of the digital SLNB algorithm as a screening tool.ConclusionsThe SLNB algorithm showed a sensitivity of 100% regardless of the antibody used for immunohistochemistry and the staining protocol. No false-negative slides were observed, which proves that the SLNB algorithm is an ideal screening tool for selecting those slides that a pathologist does not need to see. The implementation of automated digital image analysis of SLNBs in breast cancer would decrease the workload in this context for examining pathologists by almost 60%.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this lecture I argue that anthropology can grasp the cultural peculiarity of modernity by critically scrutinizing its foundational categories of "economy" and "technology" and its particular ways of detaching exchange and production from morality. Economic and technological developments in nineteenth- century Britain are interpreted as local manifestations of global processes of unequal exchange and accumulation. The so- called Industrial Revolution reconfigured both the material circumstances and the worldview of the people at its imperial core. This modern worldview continues to shape contemporary aspirations to deal with global inequalities and environmental change, but remains incapable of grasping the interfusion of social and natural aspects of economic and technological development. Its delineation of the categories of "economy" and "technology" is conducive to a specific modality of exploitation that can be understood as a modern form of magic, defined as contingent on the unacknowledged material efficacy of human beliefs.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy validation for large tumors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains under discussion for large size tumors. The aim of this work has been to study the false negative rate (FNR) of SLNB for large tumors and predictive factors of false negative (FN).Materials and methods: A study of a multicentric cohort, involved patients presenting N0 breast cancer with a SLNB eventually completed by complementary axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). The main criteria were the FNR and the predictive factors of FN.Results: 12.415 patients were included: 748 with tumors >= 30 mm, 1101 with tumors> 20 and < 30 mm and 10.566 with tumors <= 20 mm, with a cALND respectively for 501 patients (67%), 523 (62.1%) and 2775 (26.3%).The FNR were respectively: 3.05% (IC95%: 1.3-4.8) for tumors >= 30 mm(star), 3.5% (1.8-5.2) for tumors> 20 and < 30 mm(star), 1.8% (1-2.4) for tumors <= 20 mm (p < 0.05) ((star) Not significant). At multivariate analysis, SN number harvested <= 2 (OR: 2.0, p = 0.023) and tumor size > 20 and < 30 mm (OR: 2.07, p = 0.017) were significant predictive factors of FN, without significant value for tumor size = 30 mm (OR: 1.83, p = 0.073).Conclusion: The FNR of SLNB was not higher amongst large size tumors compared to tumors of a smaller size. These results support the validation of SNLB for tumors up to 50 mm.

TI  - Multidate, multisensor remote sensing reveals high density of carbon-rich mountain peatlands in the paramo of Ecuador
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands store a significant portion of the global soil carbon (C) pool. However, tropical mountain peatlands contain extensive peat soils that have yet to be mapped or included in global C estimates. This lack of data hinders our ability to inform policy and apply sustainable management practices to these peatlands that are experiencing unprecedented high rates of land use and land cover change. Rapid large-scale mapping activities are urgently needed to quantify tropical wetland extent and rate of degradation. We tested a combination of multidate, multisensor radar and optical imagery (Landsat TM/PALSAR/RADARSAT-1/TPI image stack) for detecting peatlands in a 2715km(2) area in the high elevation mountains of the Ecuadorian paramo. The map was combined with an extensive soil coring data set to produce the first estimate of regional peatland soil C storage in the paramo. Our map displayed a high coverage of peatlands (614km(2)) containing an estimated 128.2 +/- 9.1 Tg of peatland belowground soil C within the mapping area. Scaling-up to the country level, paramo peatlands likely represent less than 1% of the total land area of Ecuador but could contain as much as similar to 23% of the above- and belowground vegetation C stocks in Ecuadorian forests. These mapping approaches provide an essential methodological improvement applicable to mountain peatlands across the globe, facilitating mapping efforts in support of effective policy and sustainable management, including national and global C accounting and C management efforts.

TI  - Study on Typhoon Center Monitoring Based on HY-2 and FY-2 Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The location of a typhoon center plays an important role in moving track monitoring and forecasting. More and more new satellites are used to monitor typhoons. Combining multiple sources of satellite data has become popular for tropical cyclone monitoring in recent years. In this letter, we demonstrate a robust method of locating the typhoon center based on meteorological satellite (Feng Yun-2 (FY-2) satellite) and microwave scatterometer data (Hai Yang-2 (HY-2) scatterometer). First, we locate the typhoon center using HY-2 and FY-2 data independently. Next, we combine the results of the HY-2 and FY-2 analysis to produce an improved method of locating typhoon centers. Finally, three representative typhoons ("ChanHom," "Soudelor," and "DuJuan") are used to validate our methodology. The results show that: 1) compared to FY-2 satellite data, the proposed results have more information on wind speed and direction and 2) compared to HY-2 satellite data, the proposed results have higher temporal resolution. Overall, the proposed method can improve typhoon monitoring results.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Freeze/Thaw Status in China via Fusion of MODIS and AMSR2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition of freeze/thaw (F/T) affects land-atmospheric interactions and other biospheric dynamics. Global F/T statuses are normally monitored using microwave remote sensing, but at coarse resolutions (e.g., 25 km). Integration of coarse microwave remote sensing data with finer satellite products represents an opportunity to further enhance our ability to map F/T statuses regionally and globally. Here, we implemented and tested an approach to generate daily F/T status maps at a 5-km spatial resolution through the fusion of passive microwave data from AMSR2 and land surface temperature products from MODIS, using China as our study area for the year 2013 and 2014. Moreover, possible influences from elevation, vegetation, seasonality, etc., were also analyzed, as such analysis provides a direction to improve the approach. Overall, our freeze/thaw maps agreed well with ground reference observations, with an accuracy of similar to 86.6%. The new F/T maps helped to identify regions subject to frequent F/T transitions through the year, such as the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Xinjiang, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Province. This study indicates that the combination of AMSR2 and MODIS observations provides an effective method to obtain finer F/T maps (5-km or lower) for extensive regions. The finer F/T maps improve our knowledge of the F/T state detected by satellite remote sensing, and have a wide range of applications in regional studies considering land surface heterogeneity and models (e.g., community land models).

TI  - Consolidation settlement of Salt Lake County tailings impoundment revealed by time-series InSAR observations from multiple radar satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailings impoundment failures may lead to catastrophically fatal, environmental and financial consequences. Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004-2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015-2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability.

TI  - Characteristics and Factors Influencing the Hysteresis of Water Area-Stage Curves for Poyang Lake
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood dynamics of large lake floodplain systems are typically complex. This paper analyses the characteristics and factors that influence the hysteresis of water area-stage curves for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China characterized by complex geomorphology and upstream-downstream exchange conditions. For this purpose, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) based on seven scenarios is established. The results indicate that the area-stage curve presents significant hysteretic characteristics due to different water surface gradients that emerge during the water-rising and water-falling periods. Counter-clockwise, clockwise, and splayed hysteresis directions observed at the northern, southern, and central hydrometric stations, respectively, are found in Poyang Lake for the first time. Upstream catchment inflows and Hukou stage reflecting the downstream condition are the main factors that influence hysteresis. The temporal fluctuation of catchment inflows and Hukou stage has a remarkably positive impact on hysteresis, namely, an increase in fluctuation brings about a larger hysteresis. The effects of magnitude change in the two factors on hysteresis are opposing. Catchment inflows are positively related, while the decline of the Hukou stage will produce a more pronounced hysteresis. The outcomes of this study will benefit the water management of Poyang Lake and other similar large lakes.

TI  - Green Spaces as an Indicator of Urban Health: Evaluating Its Changes in 28 Mega-Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces can yield considerable health benefits to urban residents. Assessing these health benefits is a key step for managing urban green spaces for human health and wellbeing in cities. In this study, we assessed the change of health benefits generated by urban green spaces in 28 megacities worldwide between 2005 and 2015 by using availability and accessibility as proxy indicators. We first mapped land covers of 28 megacities using 10,823 scenes of Landsat images and a random forest classifier running on Google Earth Engine. We then calculated the availability and accessibility of urban green spaces using the land cover maps and gridded population data. The results showed that the mean availability of urban green spaces in these megacities increased from 27.63% in 2005 to 31.74% in 2015. The mean accessibility of urban green spaces increased from 65.76% in 2005 to 72.86% in 2015. The increased availability and accessibility of urban green spaces in megacities have brought more health benefits to their residents.

TI  - Mapping major land cover dynamics in Beijing using all Landsat images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover in Beijing experienced a dramatic change due to intensive human activities, such as urbanization and afforestation. However, the spatial patterns of the dynamics are still unknown. The archived Landsat images provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect land cover changes over the past three decades. In this study, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trajectory to detect major land cover dynamics in Beijing. Then, we classified the land cover types in 2015 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud calculation. By overlaying the latest land cover types and the spatial distribution of land cover dynamics, we determined the main types where a land cover change occurred. The overall change detection accuracy for three types (vegetation loss associated with negative change in NDVI, vegetation gain associated with positive change in NDVI, and no changes) is 86.13%. We found that the GEE is a fast and powerful tool for land cover mapping, and we obtained a classification map with an overall accuracy of 86.61%. Over the past 30 years, 1402.28 km(2) of land was with vegetation loss and 109038 km(2) of land was revegetated in Beijing. The spatial pattern of vegetation loss and vegetation gain shows significant differences in different zones from the center of the city. We also found that 1162.71 km(2) of land was converted to urban and built-up, whereas 918.36 km(2) of land was revegetated to cropland, shrub land, forest, and grassland. Moreover, 202.67 km(2) and 156.75 km(2) of the land was transformed to forest and shrub land in the plain of Beijing that were traditionally used for cropland and housing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A global examination of the response of ecosystem water-use efficiency to drought based on MODIS data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) plays an important role in carbon and water cycles. Currently, the response of WUE to drought disturbance remains controversial. Based on the global ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) product and the evapotranspiration product (ET), both of which were retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as the drought index, this study comprehensively examined the relationship between ecosystem WUE (WUE = GPP/ET) and drought at the global scale. The response of WUE to drought showed large differences in various regions and biomes. WUE for arid ecosystems typically showed a negative response to drought, whereasWUE for humid ecosystems showed both positive and negative response to drought. Legacy effects of drought on ecosystem WUE were observed. Furthermore, ecosystems showed a sensitive response to abrupt changes in hydrological climatic conditions. The transition from wet to dry years should increase ecosystem WUE, and the opposite change in WUE should occur when an ecosystem experiences a transition from dry to wet years. This indicates the resilience of ecosystems to drought disturbance. Knowledge from this study should provide an in-depth understanding of ecosystem strategies for coping with drought.

TI  - Primary ectopic breast cancer of the vulva, treated with local excision of the vulva and sentinel lymph node biopsy: a case report.
T2  - Surgical case reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Primary breast cancer fairly infrequently occurs in ectopic breast tissue, and primary ectopic breast cancer of the vulva is particularly rare. Only 26 cases have been published in the English-language literature, and there has been no report of primary breast carcinoma of the vulva in Japan. We report a rare case of primary ectopic breast cancer of the vulva that was treated with local excision of the vulva and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The patient was a 72-year-old woman who had noticed a right vulvar tumor 10years earlier. The tumor was excised by the Department of Plastic Surgery of our hospital. The histology of the vulvar tumor revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, and immunohistochemical staining of the vulvar specimen showed the tumor cells to be 100% estrogen-receptor-positive and 100% progesterone-receptor-positive. All margins of resection were positive for neoplastic involvement. An additional local excision of the vulva and right inguinal SLNB were performed in our department. The intraoperative frozen section was negative for metastasis, and lymph node dissection was not performed. The final pathology was negative for residual disease, and a partially normal ductal component was present. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor was indicated post-operatively. The patient was asymptomatic and free of detectable disease at a 6-month follow-up. Due to the rarity of this diagnosis, there are no established guidelines for treatment. Although cases in which SLNB was performed are rare, we consider SLNB to be an effective alternative to inguinal node dissection for ectopic primary breast cancer of the vulva.

TI  - RivaMap: An automated river analysis and mapping engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are essential to the Earth's water cycle and deeply impact many human societies and ecosystems, yet they are currently monitored poorly at the global scale. In-situ gauging stations are distributed sparsely and heterogeneously and do not cover much of the world, whereas remotely sensed images are spatially and temporally dense and available globally. Remotely sensed multispectral images, such as the ones acquired by Landsat missions, are available to enable the analysis and surveying of rivers using suitable algorithms. However, existing algorithms are limited in ways that restrict the coverage of the produced results and that prevent the automated analysis of river networks at large scales over short periods of time. Ideally, river maps should be as "live" as possible, e.g., computed quickly and continuously as new Earth imaging data becomes available. Towards advancing progress on this problem, we describe an automated river analysis and mapping engine, RivaMap, that enables the computation of large-scale hydrography data sets from remotely sensed data in a short period of time. RivaMap facilitates water resource management by providing tools to delineate rivers and to estimate their width. As a practical application of RivaMap, we present a continental-scale centerline and width data set of North American rivers, that is automatically computed on Landsat data. We validate our mapping engine by comparing the RivaMap-generated data to a similar data set, NARWidth, and also to in-situ measurements. Our experimental results show that RivaMap is able to efficiently and accurately extract rivers from remotely sensed images at large scales. The outcomes of this research, the software, and the computed exemplary data set are publicly available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - APPLICATION OF LANDSCAPE METRICS FOR ASSESSMENT OF LAND USE/LAND COVER (LULC) CHANGES IN VARJIN PROTECTED AREA, IRAN
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are valuable ecosystems standpoint providing various ecological processes and functions. Unfortunately, during the recent decades, population growth and human development have been changed the land use/land cover of the most protected areas in the world. Varjin Protected Area is one of the oldest protected areas. In this study, landscape metrics were used to reveal landscape patterns in Varjin Protected Area using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 2000 and 2010. For this purpose, remotely sensed images have been corrected in terms of geometric and radiometric distortions and were then classified through hybrid method. The resulting land cover map was divided into four categories: residential, orchard, good rangeland quality, and poor rangeland quality. The proportion of the Class Area (CA) regarding residential class increased from 1986 to 2010 whereas the proportion of orchard class area was rather stable among the three dates. Concerning the poor rangeland quality, its total class area increased from 1986 to 2000 and then slightly declined from 2000 to 2010. Based on the Largest Patch Index (LPI), the dominant land cover class across the three dates was poor rangeland quality although the number of patches was shifted between the years 1986 and 2000. The isolation/proximity metrics represented by ENN_MN showed an increase of the residential class area, whereas the changes among other classes were limited. The main driving force of the residential area increase was the willingness of local people to sell their agricultural lands for a lot of money, so as rich Tehranian people to abandon air and noise pollution of the capital and immigrate to the protected area region, specifically to the "Villa Building". This study highlighted the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land use/land cover change over time.

TI  - Optimization of essential oil and fucoxanthin extraction from <i>Sargassum binderi</i> by Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO<sub>2</sub>) extraction with ethanol as co-solvent Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction of fucoxanthin is more advantageous over conventional solvent extraction as it is less toxic, less hazardous to the environment and preserves the bioactivity of fucoxanthin. A face-centered central composite design (FCCCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for SC-CO2 extraction of oils and fucoxanthin from the brown seaweed Sargassum binderi, with ethanol as a co-solvent. Three independent parameters namely, extraction temperature (A: 40, 50, 60 degrees C), pressure (B: 2900, 3625, 4350 psig and particle size (C: 90, 500 and 1000 mu m) were investigated to optimize extraction oil yields (EOY) and fucoxanthin yields (FY). A regression model was developed, tested for quality of fit (R-2) and expressed in the form of 3D response surface curve and 2D contour. The optimum extraction conditions were obtained at extraction temperature (A) 50 degrees C, pressure (B) 3625 psig and particle size (C) 500 mu m. Under these conditions, optimal EOY and FY were 10.04 mg/g and 3188.99 mu g/g, respectively. The difference between the lowest and the highest response in EOY and FY were 5.44 - 10.04 mg/g and 2109.10 - 3188.90 mu g/g, respectively. The lowest yields were identified at 60 degrees C, 2900 psig and 1000 mu m. The regression models generated showing interactions between the variables and EOY and FY response were significant as tested by ANOVA (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.0007, respectively) with high R-2 values (0.9848 and 0.9829, respectively). Interactions between the parameters had a strong synergistic effect on EOY and FY values, as indicated by the 3D response surface curve and 2D contour. The experimental results matched the predicted results closely. This indicated the suitability of the models developed and the success of FCCCD under RSM in optimizing the S. binderi extraction conditions. (C) All Rights Reserved

AB  - Alexander von Humboldt tends to be considered a romantic-naturalist author, due to the way he combines the scientific method of empirical analysis of nature with his aesthetic-subjective view that could be said to have some "romantic" characteristics. Nonetheless, the study of the lexicon used by Humboldt to describe nature reveals the predominance of strictly scientific and intersubjective language over subjective language. Even so, the presence of "romantic" semantic traits is not merely ornamental; rather, it has an aesthetic function, which, in Humboldt's perception of nature, is an indispensible subjective complement within his holistic worldview.

TI  - Scope to map soil management units at the district level from remotely sensed -ray spectrometry and proximal sensed EM induction data
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional method of soil mapping involves classifying soil into pre-existing classes using morphological observations and then air-photograph interpretation to extrapolate the information. To accelerate the process, less costly ancillary data can be used to assist mapping. However, digital soil mapping (DSM) is still affected by the classifications used to identify soil types. One reason is because the morphological characteristics are not mutually exclusive, which causes misclassification. In this study, we used a DSM approach, where ancillary data were surrogate for morphological data, with soil types identified by numerical clustering of remotely and proximally sensed data collected across a farming district near Gunnedah, Australia. Remotely sensed data were obtained from an air-borne gamma-ray (-ray) spectrometer survey, including potassium (K), thorium (Th), uranium (U) and total counts. Proximally sensed data were measured using EM38 (i.e. EM38h and EM38v). Using fuzzy k-means and a linear mixed model with measured physical (e.g. clay) and chemical (e.g. CEC) properties from the topsoil (0-0.30m) and subsoil (0.9-1.2m), we found that k=5 was also optimal given that mean-squared prediction error (i.e. sigma p,C2) was minimised. The approach highlighted subtle differences in physical and chemical properties in productive areas. The DSM was unsuccessful in identifying small units; however, inclusion of elevation data might overcome this limitation. This research has implications for providing fast, accurate and meaningful DSM at a district scale, where traditional methods are too expensive.

TI  - Estimating aboveground live understory vegetation carbon in the United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the key role that understory vegetation plays in ecosystems and the terrestrial carbon cycle, it is often overlooked and has few quantitative measurements, especially at national scales. To understand the contribution of understory carbon to the United States (US) carbon budget, we developed an approach that relies on field measurements of understory vegetation cover and height on US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subplots. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground understory carbon. A spatial model based on stand characteristics and remotely sensed data was also applied to estimate understory carbon on all FIA plots. We found that most understory carbon was comprised of woody shrub species (64%), followed by nonwoody forbs and graminoid species (35%) and seedlings (1%). The largest estimates were found in temperate or warm humid locations such as the Pacific Northwest and southeastern US, thus following the same broad trend as aboveground tree biomass. The average understory aboveground carbon density was estimated to be 0.977 Mg ha(-1), for a total estimate of 272 Tg carbon across all managed forest land in the US (approximately 2% of the total aboveground live tree carbon pool). This estimate is more than twice as low as previous FIA modeled estimates that did not rely on understory measurements, suggesting that this pool may currently be overestimated in US National Greenhouse Gas reporting.

TI  - Big Data and Multiple Methods for Mapping Small Reservoirs: Comparing Accuracies for Applications in Agricultural Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether or not reservoirs contain water throughout the dry season is critical to avoiding late season crop failure in seasonally-arid agricultural landscapes. Locations, volumes, and temporal dynamics, particularly of small (<1 Mm(3)) reservoirs are poorly documented globally, thus making it difficult to identify geographic and intra-annual gaps in reservoir water availability. Yet, small reservoirs are the most vulnerable to drying out and often service the poorest of farmers. Using the transboundary Volta River Basin (similar to 413,000 sq km) in West Africa as a case study, we present a novel method to map reservoirs and quantify the uncertainty of Landsat derived reservoir area estimates, which can be readily applied anywhere in the globe. We applied our method to compare the accuracy of reservoir areas that are derived from the Global Surface Water Monthly Water History (GSW) dataset to those that are derived when surface water is classified on Landsat 8 OLI imagery using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI with band 6 (MNDWI1), and Modified NDWI with band 7 (MNDWI2). We quantified how the areal accuracies of reservoir size estimates vary with the water classification method, reservoir properties, and environmental context, and assessed the options and limitations of using uncertain reservoir area estimates to monitor reservoir dynamics in an agricultural context. Results show that reservoir area estimates that are derived from the GSW data are 19% less accurate for our study site than MNDWI1 derived estimates, for a sample of 272 reservoir extents of 0.09 to 72 ha. The accuracy of Landsat-derived estimates improves with reservoir size and perimeter-area ratio, while accuracy may decline as surface vegetation increases. We show that GSW derived reservoir area estimates can provide an upper limit for current reservoir capacity and seasonal dynamics of larger reservoirs. Data gaps and uncertainties make GSW derived reservoir extents unsuitable for monitoring reservoirs that are smaller than 5.1 ha (holding similar to 49,759 m(3)), which constitute 674 (56%) reservoirs in the Volta basin, or monitoring seasonal fluctuations of most small reservoirs, limiting its utility for agricultural planning. This study is one of the first to test the utility and limitations of the newly available GSW dataset and provides guidance on the conditions under which this, and other Landsat-based surface water maps, can be reliably used to monitor reservoir resources.

TI  - Breast sentinel lymph node biopsy with imaging towards minimally invasive surgery
T2  - BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast sentinel lymph nodes are still commonly assessed through complete lymph node dissections, which is a time-consuming and radical approach because the nodes are difficult to identify. To prevent false diagnosis and achieve accurate results, minimally invasive, image-guided procedures are applied and constantly improved. The purpose of this paper is to present the currently used imaging modalities ultrasound, fluorescence, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hybrid imaging methods and comparing their effectiveness for breast sentinel lymph node biopsy. A definition for an ideal imaging system combining efficient minimally invasive techniques with workflow considerations is also discussed. As a conclusion, upcoming imaging methods and their future outlook with areas of advancement are presented.

T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The size of remotely sensed data is constantly growing, which causes problems related to data transfer and archiving. The most common solution of this problem is data compression. This work investigates the feasibility of sensor-level TLS data compression using JPEG-2000 lossless and lossy schemes. TLS data are treated as a multi-band image or a set of images consisting of range, intensity, and optionally RGB bands. The investigation focuses on performance assessment in terms of storage space saving, data distortion due to lossy compression, and compression and decompression speed. Experiments executed on real TLS data show that the proposed JPEG-2000 strategy for both lossy and lossless schemes allows to save more storage space than other compression methods. The lossy scheme resulted in the strongest compression and only had insignificant impact on data distortion. Finally, JPEG-2000 compression was identified as the fastest method. It is even suitable for real-time compression at sensor-level.

TI  - Characterizing flood hazard risk in data-scarce areas, using a remote sensing and GIS-based flood hazard index
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency in occurrence and severity of floods has increased globally. However, many regions around the globe, especially in developing countries, lack the necessary field monitoring data to characterize flood hazard risk. This paper puts forward methodology for developing flood hazard maps that define flood hazard risk, using a remote sensing and GIS-based flood hazard index (FHI), for the Nyamwamba watershed in western Uganda. The FHI was compiled using analytical hierarchy process and considered slope, flow accumulation, drainage network density, distance from drainage channel, geology, land use/cover and rainfall intensity as the flood causative factors. These factors were derived from Landsat, SRTM and PERSIANN remote sensing data products, except for geology that requires field data. The resultant composite FHI yielded a flood hazard map pointing out that over 11 and 18% of the study area was very highly and highly susceptible to flooding, respectively, while the remaining area ranged from medium to very low risk. The resulting flood hazard map was further verified using inundation area of a historical flood event in the study area. The proposed methodology was effective in producing a flood hazard map at the watershed local scale, in a data-scarce region, useful in devising flood mitigation measures.

TI  - Are Climate Extremities Changing Forest Fire Regimes in India? An Analysis Using MODIS Fire Locations During 2003-2013 and Gridded Climate Data of India Meteorological Department
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of forest fire in India, and their interrelationship with causal drivers i.e. climate (temperature, rainfall, dry-days, El Nio), fuel status (forest types, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and anthropogenic disturbances (distance from road and settlements, population density) were investigated. The Nino3 sea surface temperature index was used based on sea surface temperature anomalies recorded from February to June (fire season in India) through the years 2003-2013. This was used as the representative index of El Nio southern oscillations (ENSO). The correlations among different causal drivers and fire occurrence were investigated for the entire country and different bio-geographic zones within the country. In India, the forest fire were significantly (significance f < 0.05, confidence interval 95%) correlated with average dry-days (r 0.75) and maximum average temperature (r 0.76). It was further observed that El Nio increased the temperature and consequently the dryness, which created conducive conditions for fire to occur. The integrated fire frequency ratio, which is the ratio of percent of total fire occurrence in a particular driver class to the percent of total area of that driver class, was estimated for each year from 2003 to 2013 to investigate the fire susceptibility of different forests. The yearly fire frequency ratio was estimated to understand the dynamics of fire susceptibility across the country. The fire occurrence in Deccan Peninsula and the central Himalayas in particular were found to be more sensitive towards the climate anomalies.

TI  - A Copernicus downstream-service for the nationwide monitoring of surface displacements in Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced interferometric SAR processing techniques (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, Small Baseline Subset) are able to detect and monitor various surface displacements caused by e.g. gravitative mass movement, subrosion, groundwater extraction, fluid injection, natural gas extraction. These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities).In order to support the operational use of this technique a "Ground Motion Service Germany" has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000 km(2)) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented.The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of >30,000 km(2) and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction.To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the "Ground Motion Service Germany" and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products.

AB  - Availability of geospatial data from online data repositories and geoportals are increasing with rapid pace. For better utilization of these heterogeneous data sets, it is required to give more attention to develop web based algorithms as well as geocomputation models that allows high-level information extraction from distributed nature of geodata. The Open Geospatial Consortium specification such as Web Processing Service (WPS) provides the solutions for integrating remote sensing data for the computation of algorithms from distributed sources in multi-user environment. The main purpose of present study is to develop and implement a WPS based geoprocesses and analysis approach using Online Image Processing System. The software framework developed during this study is a platform independent solution which is developed using free and open source technology. As a demonstrative case study, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Built-up Index algorithms are annotated for automatic deployment in geoscientific processing workflow environment. The Sentinel-2 data sets and polygon geometry as region of interest are stored and published as web services for input dataset in application server repository. A case study for Champawat district of Uttarakhand state of India has been demonstrated to identify vegetation greenness and built-up sites during the summer season. In order to access the functionalities of the online application, an interactive and responsive Graphical User Interface is developed in web GIS environment. The proposed approach can be very effective and useful to address the key challenges in commercial desktop based software for geoprocessing and analysis of remote sensing data.

TI  - Thirty-Three Years of Ocean Benthic Warming Along the US Northeast Continental Shelf and Slope: Patterns, Drivers, and Ecological Consequences
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf is experiencing rapid warming, with potentially profound consequences to marine ecosystems. While satellites document multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability on the surface, our understanding of the status, trends, and drivers of the benthic environmental change remains limited. We interpolated sparse benthic temperature data along the New England Shelf and upper Slope using a seasonally dynamic, regionally specific multiple linear regression model that merged in situ and remote sensing data. The statistical model predicted nearly 90% of the variability of the data, resulting in a synoptic time series spanning over three decades from 1982 to 2014. Benthic temperatures increased throughout the domain, including in the Gulf of Maine. Rates of benthic warming ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 degrees C per decade, with fastest rates occurring in shallow, nearshore regions and on Georges Bank, the latter exceeding rates observed in the surface. Rates of benthic warming were up to 1.6 times faster in winter than the rest of the year in many regions, with important implications for disease occurrence and energetics of overwintering species. Drivers of warming varied over the domain. In southern New England and the mid-Atlantic shallow Shelf regions, benthic warming was tightly coupled to changes in SST, whereas both regional and basin-scale changes in ocean circulation affect temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, the Continental Shelf, and Georges Banks. These results highlight data gaps, the current feasibility of prediction from remotely sensed variables, and the need for improved understanding on how climate may affect seasonally specific ecological processes.

TI  - Social-ecological factors and preventive actions decrease the risk of dengue infection at the household-level: Results from a prospective dengue surveillance study in Machala, Ecuador
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn Ecuador, dengue virus (DENV) infections transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito are among the greatest public health concerns in urban coastal communities. Community-and household-level vector control is the principal means of controlling disease outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the impact of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) and socialecological factors on the presence or absence of DENV infections in the household.MethodsIn 2014 and 2015, individuals with DENV infections from sentinel clinics in Machala, Ecuador, were invited to participate in the study, as well as members of their household and members of four neighboring households located within 200 meters. We conducted diagnostic testing for DENV on all study participants; we surveyed heads of households (HOHs) regarding demographics, housing conditions and KAPs. We compared KAPs and social-ecological factors between households with (n = 139) versus without (n = 80) DENV infections, using bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models with and without interactions.ResultsSignificant risk factors in multivariate models included proximity to abandoned properties, interruptions in piped water, and shaded patios (p< 0.05). Significant protective factors included the use of mosquito bed nets, fumigation inside the home, and piped water inside the home (p< 0.05). In bivariate analyses (but not multivariate modeling), DENV infections were positively associated with HOHs who were male, employed, and of younger age than households without infections (p< 0.05). DENV infections were not associated with knowledge, attitude, or reported barriers to prevention activities.DiscussionSpecific actions that can be considered to decrease the risk of DENV infections in the household include targeting vector control in highly shaded properties, fumigating inside the home, and use of mosquito bed nets. Community-level interventions include cleanup of abandoned properties, daily garbage collection, and reliable piped water inside houses. These findings can inform interventions to reduce the risk of other diseases transmitted by the Ae. aegypti mosquito, such as chikungunya and Zika fever.

TI  - An approach for global monitoring of surface water extent variations in reservoirs using MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater resources are among the most basic requirements of human society. Nonetheless, global information about the space-time variations of the area of freshwater bodies, and the water stored in them, is surprisingly limited. We introduce a new approach that uses MODIS multispectral data to map the global areal extent and temporal variations of known reservoirs at 500 m spatial resolution at nominal eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2015. We evaluate the performance of the approach on 94 reservoirs by comparing the variations in surface area extents with satellite radar altimetry measurements. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies for five reservoirs on four continents to demonstrate the impact of different challenges on the performance of the approach. For three of these case studies, we also evaluate surface area estimates using Landsat-based surface extent reference maps. Altimetry based height measurements for the 94 reservoirs show higher correlation with surface area computed using our approach, compared to surface area computed using previous approaches. One of the main reasons for these improvements is a novel post-processing technique that makes use of imperfect labels produced by supervised classification approaches on multiple dates to estimate the elevation structure of locations and uses it to enhance the quality and completeness of imperfect labels. However, effective estimation of this elevation structure requires that the water body shows sufficient area variations. Hence, the post-processing approach will not be effective for water bodies that are mostly unchanged or are too small to have sufficient variation. The approach is still challenged in regions with frequent cloud cover, snow and ice coverage, or complicated geometries that will require remote sensing data at finer spatial resolution. The surface area estimates we describe here are publically available. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Snow Cover in the Karoon River Basin, Iran, 2003-2015
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karoon River Basin, with an area of about 67,000 km(2), is located in the southern part of Iran and has a complex mountainous terrain. No comprehensive study has been done on the spatial and temporal variations of snow cover in this region to date. In this paper, daily snow data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS Terra (MOD10A1) and MODIS Aqua (MYD10A1) were examined from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2015, to analyze snow cover variations. Due to difficulties created by cloud cover effects, it was crucial to reduce cloud contamination in the daily time series. Therefore, two common cloud removal methods were applied on the daily data. The results suggested that in winter nearly 43% of the Basin's area experienced a negative trend, while only 1.4% of the Basin had a positive trend for snow-covered days (SCD); trends in fall and spring were less evident in the data. Using a digital elevation model of the Basin, the trends of SCD in 100 m elevation intervals were calculated, indicating a significant positive trend in SCD during the fall season above 3500 m.

TI  - Moisture Content Measurement of Broadleaf Litters Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was implemented to monitor the moisture content of broadleaf litters. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models, incorporating optimal wavelength selection techniques, have been proposed to better predict the litter moisture of forest floor. Three broadleaf litters were used to sample the reflection spectra corresponding the different degrees of litter moisture. The maximum normalization preprocessing technique was successfully applied to remove unwanted noise from the reflectance spectra of litters. Four variable selection methods were also employed to extract the optimal subset of measured spectra for establishing the best prediction model. The results showed that the PLSR model with the peak of beta coefficients method was the best predictor among all of the candidate models. The proposed NIRS procedure is thought to be a suitable technique for on-the-spot evaluation of litter moisture.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration using the complementary relationship and the Budyko framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several models have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration. Among those, the complementary relationship has been the subject of many recent studies because it relies on meteorological data only. Recently, the modified Granger and Gray (GG) model showed its applicability across 34 diverse global sites. While the modified GG model showed better performances compared to the recently published studies, it can be improved for dry conditions and the relative evaporation parameter in the original GG model needs to be further investigated. This parameter was empirically derived from limited data from wet environments in Canada - a possible reason for decreasing performance with dry conditions. This study proposed a refined GG model to overcome the limitation using the Budyko framework and vegetation cover to describe relative evaporation. This study used 75 eddy covariance sites in the USA from AmeriFlux, representing 36 dry and 39 wet sites. The proposed model produced better results with decreasing monthly mean root mean square error of about 30% for dry sites and 15% for wet sites compared to the modified GG model. The proposed model in this study maintains the characteristics of the Budyko framework and the complementary relationship and produced improved evapotranspiration estimates under dry conditions.

TI  - Exploring the impact of green space health on runoff reduction using NDVI
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of green space health on local flooding based on the analysis of eighty-two watersheds in four Texas metropolitan statistical areas: Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. The runoff records in October 2007 and October 2012 were selected for the assessment. The study met the methodological challenge posed by comparison by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets produced based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery of the 250-m resolution as a proxy to represent the health of green space. Two linear regression models were employed to explain the variation in mean daily runoff depth in 2007 and 2012, while controlling multiple contextual variables. Results indicate that watersheds containing healthier green spaces were likely to generate lower amounts of runoff in both periods. Standardized coefficients of green space health also show that the NDVI is a powerful and significant predictor to explain variation in runoff. These findings illustrate the important role of urban green spaces in attenuating local flooding and may provide planners and decision-makers with a method to consider, using this kind of objective greenery index in further developing local and regional green infrastructure and land-use plans.

TI  - Improved Model for Predicting Axillary Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Clinically Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Pathological complete response (pCR) of axillary lymph node (LN) is frequently achieved in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Treatment of the axilla after NAC is not well established and the value of sentinel LN biopsy following NAC remains unclear. This study investigated the predictive value of axillary response following NAC and evaluated the predictive value of a model based on axillary response. Methods: Data prospectively collected on 201 patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer who were treated with NAC and underwent axillary LN dissection (ALND) were retrieved. A model predictive of axillary pCR was developed based on clinicopathologic variables. The overall predictive ability between models was compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Of 201 patients who underwent ALND after NAC, 68 (33.8%) achieved axillary pCR. Multivariate analysis using axillary LN pCR after NAC as the dependent variable showed that higher histologic grade (p=0.031; odds ratio [OR], 2.537; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.087-5.925) and tumor response rate >= 47.1% (p=0.001; OR, 3.212; 95% CI, 1.584-6.515) were significantly associated with an increased probability of achieving axillary pCR. The area under the ROC curve for estimating axillary pCR was significantly higher in the model that included tumor response rate than in the model that excluded this rate (0.732 vs. 0.649, p=0.022). Conclusion: Tumor response rate was the most significant independent predictor of axillary pCR in response to NAC. The model that included tumor response rate was a significantly better predictor of axillary pCR than the model that excluded tumor response rate.

TI  - Unusual Contralateral Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in a Second Primary Breast Cancer Detected by FDG PET/CT and Lymphoscintigraphy.
T2  - Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Contralateral metastatic axillary lymph nodes in a patient with breast cancer is a rare condition. Here, we present a 55-year-old woman with a second primary breast cancer. The patient underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) for staging work-up. Additionally, preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed to detect sentinel lymph nodes. FDG PET/CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the left nipple and right axillary lymph nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy identified the right axillary lymph nodes which was consistent with the FDG PET/CT findings. This case emphasizes the usefulness of FDG PET/CT and lymphoscintigraphy for identifying unpredictable contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis from a second primary breast cancer.

TI  - Image Fusion of Spectrally Nonoverlapping Imagery Using SPCA and MTF-Based Filters
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most spaceborne sensors have an inevitable tradeoff between spatial and spectral resolutions. This is a typical ill-posed inverse problem in the field of image fusion. To solve this problem, this letter proposes an image fusion method using spatial principal component analysis and modulation transfer function based filters. The key behind the proposed fusion method is to efficiently estimate the missing spatial details by considering the spatial structures of the low-resolution multispectral (MS) imagery. Also, this letter proposes a newly developed injection gain model to resolve the local and global dissimilarity between panchromatic and MS imageries, which could prevent over-and under-injections. Finally, spatial details, optimized to be injected into the MS images, were constructed and paired with the developed injection gain model to produce high-resolution MS images. Two data sets acquired by WorldView-2 are employed for validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method generates high-quality imagery in terms of both qualitative and quantitative standards.

T2  - Surgical case reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomas in various tissues, including the skin, brain, breast, thyroid, mucous membrane, and gastrointestinal tract, and is reported to increase the risk of malignant disease.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 52-year-old woman in whom a tumor was diagnosed in the left cerebellar hemisphere and treated by surgical resection. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation in exon 8 insertion was found in the brain tumor tissue and leukocytes. This finding supported the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome. She consequently developed endometrial cancer and underwent abdominal total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Four years later, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer was found in the right breast, and breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed.CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe a patient who was diagnosed as having familial breast cancer associated with PTEN mutation-related Cowden syndrome. We also reviewed reports of this syndrome in the literature for disease appraisal.

TI  - The rise of glyphosate and new opportunities for biosentinel early-warning studies
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glyphosate has become the most commonly used herbicide worldwide and is reputedly environmentally benign, nontoxic, and safe for use near wildlife and humans. However, studies indicate its toxicity is underestimated and its persistence in the environment is greater than once thought. Its actions as a neurotoxin and endocrine disruptor indicate its potential to act in similar ways to persistent organic pollutants such as the organochlorines dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dioxin. Exposure to glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides for both wildlife and people is likely to be chronic and at sublethal levels, with multiple and ongoing exposure events occurring in urban and agricultural landscapes. Despite this, there has been little research on the impact of glyphosate on wildlife populations, and existing studies appear in the agricultural, toxicology, and water-chemistry literature that may have limited visibility among wildlife biologists. These studies clearly demonstrate a link between chronic exposure and neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, cell damage, and immune suppression. There is a strong case for the recognition of glyphosate as an emerging organic contaminant and substantial potential exists for collaborative research among ecologists, toxicologists, and chemists to quantify the impact of glyphosate on wildlife and to evaluate the role of biosentinel species in a preemptive move to mitigate downstream impacts on people. There is scope to develop a decision framework to aid the choice of species to biomonitor and analysis methods based on the target contaminant, spatial and temporal extent of contamination, and perceived risk. Birds in particular offer considerable potential in this role because they span agricultural and urban environments, coastal, inland, and wetland ecosystems where glyphosate residues are known to be present.

TI  - Digital video surveillance of natural enemy activity on &ITDiaphorina citri &IT(Hemiptera: Liviidae) colonies infesting citrus in the southern California urban landscape
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is a significant economic pest of citrus because it vectors a bacterium that causes the lethal citrus disease huanglongbing. From 2015 to 2016, digital video recorders were used to identify natural enemy species attacking sentinel immature D. citri colonies deployed monthly at three urban sites in southern California. Natural enemy activity during both daylight and nighttime hours was recorded. To examine the impact of ant-hemipteran mutualisms on biological control efficacy, we compared natural enemy interactions with D. citri colonies that were either fully exposed or protected from walking arthropods with a sticky barrier. Spiders (Aranae), syrphid larvae (Syrphidae), predatory mites (Phytoseiidae), green lacewing larvae (Chrysopidae), thrips (Thripidae), and the introduced parasitoid, Tamarixia radiata, were the dominant natural enemy groups visiting immature D. citri colonies over the course of the study. A significant proportion of syrphid and green lacewing larvae, and T. radiata visits to the sentinel colonies resulted in D. citri attacks. Spiders rarely attacked immature D. citri. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, were the most common arthropod visiting D. citri colonies across all study sites and ants were active day and night. When ant access to D. citri colonies was restricted, natural enemy abundance and attack rates increased, particularly those by syrphids and T. radiata. This study highlights the importance of natural enemies and ant-psyllid interactions in the biological control of D. citri in urban citrus ecosystems. Therefore, conservation of natural enemies and ant control should be considered for the sustainable management of this pest-disease complex.

T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research examined the genotoxic activity in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) located in Mugla, Turkey, Aegean coast of Turkey. Genotoxic activities of 66 raw samples, taken from 17 different stations in the spring and summer seasons of the year 2013, were determined by using in vitro mutagenicity assay SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ37 strain bacteria activities. In the applied procedure, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and different solvent controls were taken into account to generate reliable results in terms of the corrected induction factors (CIF) used as a quantitative measure of genotoxic activity level. The SOS chromotest procedure was simply and rapidly performed as an early assay to explore for whether a potential genotoxic activity was presence in the in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) with no special measuring devices except a microplate reader. The implemented assay was successfully completed within only 24 h including the revival of the bacteria. The results showed that 11 samples (% 17 of total) were close to the threshold value of 1.5. The findings of this study clearly revealed that the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) had no potential genotoxic risks in terms of the organisms in marine ecosystem, since all of the calculated CIF values were determined to be below the threshold level. It was concluded that according to the SOS chromotest results, the levels of potential genotoxic agents were found to be under the limits for the offshore fishery.

TI  - An Ultralow-Dose 1-Day Protocol With Activities Lower Than 20 MBq for the Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast CancerExperiences After 150 Cases
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Common protocols for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer often include the injection of the tracer 1 day before surgery. In order to detect enough activity on the day of surgery, the applied activity in many protocols is as high as several hundred MBq. So far, very few protocols with an activity below 20 MBq have been reported. We developed an ultralow-dose 1-day protocol with a mean activity lower than 20 MBq in order to reduce radiation exposure for patients and staff. Here, we are presenting our experiences in 150 consecutive cases.Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients with clinically and sonographically negative axilla and no multicentricity underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy using an ultralow-dose protocol performed on the day of surgery. No patient received systemic therapy prior to sentinel node biopsy. After peritumoral injection of the tracer Technetium-99m, a lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all cases. Seven minutes before the first cut, we injected 5 mL of blue dye in the region of the areola.Results: In 148 (98.7%) of 150 patients, at least 1 sentinel lymph node could be identified by lymphoscintigraphy; the detection rate during surgery with combined tracers Technetium-99m and blue dye was 100%. The mean applied activity was 17.8 MBq (9-20). A mean number of 1.3 (0-5) sentinel lymph nodes were identified by lymphoscintigraphy and a mean number of 1.8 (1-5) sentinel lymph nodes were removed during sentinel lymph node biopsy.Conclusion: Ultralow-dose 1-day protocols with an activity lower than 20 MBq are a safe alternative to 1-day or 2-day protocols with significantly higher radiation doses in primary surgery for early breast cancer. Using Technetium-99m and blue dye in a dual tracer approach, detection rates of 100% are possible in clinical routine in order to reduce radiation exposure for patients and staff.

TI  - Oceanographic conditions and marine mammals: identifying a potential relationship in the coastal region of the Mexican Central Pacific
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA MARINA Y OCEANOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The oceanographic conditions that could influence richness and distribution of marine mammal species in the coastal area of the Mexican Central Pacific (MCP) were investigated throughout 2011. Marine mammals observations were obtained from two research platforms. CTD casts were deployed down to 100 m, water samples were taken monthly at six stations for determination of organic nutrients, and another 15 stations were sampled over a wider area only during the winter. Satellite images from MODIS-AQUA L2 were used to obtain sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) values, likewise altimetry data to identify mesoscale dynamic structures in the region. High salinity values (34.6), low concentrations of nitrates and nitrites ((similar to)3-4 mu M), silicates (5-7 mu M), Chl-alpha ((similar to)10 mg m(-3)), and low SST ((similar to)23.5 degrees C) were detected, as well as the presence of cyclonic gyres near the coast during the winter-spring period. This coincided with high marine mammal species richness in the area (from 5 to 9 species depending on spatial scale). The dominant species was Megaptera novaeangliae (0.092 sightings km(-1)), which was distributed close to the coast in shallow waters. Low salinity (32.8) and Chl-alpha values (0.1 mg m(-3)) were detected during the summer-fall period. High phosphate availability (2.5 mu M), presence of anticyclonic gyres, and high SST ((similar to)31 degrees C) were also found, coinciding with low species richness (3 species). The dominant species was Stenella attenuata (0.036 sightings km(-1)); those individuals were found distributed near the Jalisco-Colima coast (0-3 nm) in shallow waters with high inorganic nutrient availability. The principal components analysis showed that bathymetry (99.6%) was the main parameter explaining data variance; this parameter could therefore potentially modulate ecological aspects of marine mammals.

TI  - Location of Bare Soil Surface and Soil Line on the RED-NIR Spectral Plane
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil as a separate natural body occupies certain area with its own set of spectral characteristics within the RED-NIR spectral space. This is an ellipse-shaped area, and its semi-major axis is the soil line for a satellite image. The spectral area for a bare soil surface is neighboring to the areas of black carbon, straw, vegetating plants, and missing RED-NIR values. A reliable separation of the bare soil surface within the spectral space is possible with the technology of spectral neighborhood of soil line. The accuracy of this method is 90%. The determination of the bare soil surface using vegetation indices, both relative (NDVI), and perpendicular (PVI), is incorrect; the accuracy of these methods does not exceed 65%, and for most of the survey seasons it may be lower than 50%. The flat part of the "tasseled cap" described as the soil line, is not a synonym for the area of the bare soil surface. The bare soil surface on the RED-NIR plots occupies significantly smaller areas than the area of soil line according to Kauth and Thomas.

TI  - Parasites and endobiotic fungi in digestive gland cryosections of the mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> in the Northern Adriatic, Croatia
T2  - OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Histology has been used in the past to investigate the effects of diseases and parasite infections in native mussel populations that are often used as sentinel species in coastal environmental monitoring and as stock in mariculture. This paper presents the first study of parasite diversity using cryosections of the Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819 digestive gland. Mussels were sampled across the annual cycle at two sampling sites: St. Andrew and ACI Marina in the Northern Adriatic (Croatia). The protozoan of the genus Nematopsis Schneider, 1892 (Apicomplexa, Gregarina) was detected in digestive tubules, while the turbellarian (Urastomidae) Urastoma cyprinae von Graff, 1913 was found in the connective tissue at the edge of the digestive gland. The filamentous fungus Alternaria sp. (Fungi, Ascomycota) was detected in epithelial cells of the digestive tubule in cryosections. Nematopsis sp. occurred with the prevalence ranging from 20 to 100%, and the intensity of infection in less than 30 oocysts in most of the cases. U. cyprinae was detected in mussels sampled at St. Andrew and had a prevalence of 20% in September. Conidia of Alternaria sp. were found in mussels sampled at St. Andrew in September and November. Cryosections provide a useful and affordable means for monitoring parasites and endobiotic fungi.

M3  - Article
AB  - The basic model for the recognition of natural and anthropogenic objects using their spectral and textural features is described in the problem of hyperspectral air-borne and space-borne imagery processing. The model is based on improvements of the Bayesian classifier that is a computational procedure of statistical decision making in machine-learning methods of pattern recognition. The principal component method is implemented to decompose the hyperspectral measurements on the basis of empirical orthogonal functions. Application examples are shown of various modifications of the Bayesian classifier and Support Vector Machine method. Examples are provided of comparing these classifiers and a metrical classifier that operates on finding the minimal Euclidean distance between different points and sets in the multidimensional feature space. A comparison is also carried out with the "K-weighted neighbors" method that is close to the nonparametric Bayesian classifier.

TI  - An estimate of the percentage of non-predatory dead variability in coastal zooplankton of the southern Humboldt Current System
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-predatory dead variability in zooplankton remains poorly quantified worldwide. Here, we make the first estimation of the percentage of dead organisms in coastal zooplankton communities in the Humboldt Current System (HCS) under in situ conditions. The study was conducted in four coastal sites of the southern HCS (between 36 and 37 degrees S) over a period of one year. Percentages of dead organisms were based on the classification as live or dead of 158,220 holoplankton and 17,591 meroplankton individuals using neutral red staining technique. The percentage of dead organisms in total-zooplankton was between 4.3% in Coronel Bay (summer) and 76.9% in Llico (autumn). The percentage of dead total-holoplankton varied from 4.2% (Itata River Mouth; autumn) to 77.6% (Llico; autumn), while the percentage of dead total-meroplankton ranged from 1.5% to 56.8% in Coronel Bay and Coliumo Bay, respectively. The most abundant taxa analyzed were the copepods Acartia sp., Paracalanus sp., Calanoides sp., Cladocera, Polychaeta, and the eggs of anchoveta Engraulis ringers. Among these taxa, there was a high degree of interspecific variability in the estimation of the dead organisms. The Pearson correlation shows significant relationships between maximum temperature, and minimum salinity, with the percentage of dead individuals of Acartia sp. and Paracalanus sp. Environmental factors explaining those relationships were: the El Nino 2015-2016 event, and freshwater river runoff. The use of vital staining to estimate non-predatory death for total-zooplankton and selected sentinel species is a promising tool to establish baselines to evaluate natural perturbations (e.g. ENSO), and anthropogenic alterations in coastal pelagic ecosystems.

TI  - Soft Computing in Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This review paper discusses recent developments in soft computing techniques and applications specific to remote sensing, especially in the last two decades. Even though, the applications have been spread across in many areas of remote sensing, utilization of these techniques has been found to be strongly biased towards remote sensing data classification because of their ability to handle mixed pixels and also varied spatial (ranging 1-250 m) and spectral resolutions (from 1 to 100 of spectral bands). Success with conventional methods for these problems has been only moderate. This has attracted more research in the soft computing data classification. In particular, the soft computing methods outperform conventional methods when they are applied to complex data handling especially for multi-source and very high dimensional data classification with one or more combination of classifiers. Fairly recent soft computing concepts like deep learning, analytical hierarchical processes and feature extraction from hyperspectral imagery and applications of optimization techniques like particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms in handling remote sensing problems have been covered to encourage research community for further exploration in such important topics.

TI  - A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.

TI  - Hybrid-Pol Based Three-Component Scattering Model for Analysis of RISAT Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present an unsupervised model-based decomposition technique for the analysis of hybrid-pol datasets. The proposed approach develops a hybrid-pol version of full-pol three-component scattering model by deriving all decomposition parameters in terms of the hybrid-pol Stokes parameters. By using these decomposition parameters, the contribution of three basic scattering mechanisms, namely surface-scattering from Bragg surface region, dihedral-scattering from urban region and volume-scattering from forest region, are estimated. The decomposition parameters take surface dielectric properties under consideration that makes the proposed method suitable to provide more realistic representation of the Earth's surface. To estimate the efficacy of the proposed technique, the hybrid-pol data acquired overMumbai city using ISRO's RISAT-1 satellite is used. For comparative analysis, the proposed technique is compared with the conventional decomposition techniques, such as m - delta, m - (alpha) over dot, and modified m - chi.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforming the architecture of a granular neural network (GNN) with varying input information further improves its operational transparency in the classification of land use/land cover of remote sensing data. Recently, an evolving GNN (eGNN) has been originated with an advancement to the GNN that has the ability to explore and accommodate input information more effectively and results in the performance improvement of classification systems. For each input, the shape and the size of granules are adjusted with randomly selected weight parameters, and accordingly, the network architecture of the eGNN is determined. In this direction, the present paper aims to improve the performance of eGNN by deterministically initializing its weight parameters and reforming the network architecture through encoding the domain knowledge using a rough-set-theoretic method. We also propose to use a back error propagation learning algorithm for the eGNN. The resultant network called a progressive GNN(PGNN) becomes more dynamic in the learning process and thus minimizes the learning time with improved accuracy. To justify the claim, we developed a PGNN-based classification model for land cover classification of both multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images. Superiority of the model to similar other methods has been validated with performance measurement metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, kappa coefficient, dispersion score, and computational time.

TI  - Changing Landscape of Marine National Park and Sanctuary, Gulf of Kachchh: Ecological Assessment of Mangroves and Coral Reefs
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the ecological changes in mangroves and coral reefs of Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNP&S), Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, India during 1972-2014. Landsat 1 Multi Spectral Scanner data were used for 1972 to map the mangroves and coral reefs whereas Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager data were used to map the coral reef extent only, in MNP&S in 2014. Published literature sources were used to record the area of mangroves and coral reefs of MNP&S for various years between 1972 and 2014, and the changes were analyzed. For the year 1972, total mangrove area mapped is 175.36 sq. km and the total reef area mapped comes out to be 402.14 sq. km. The total area of reef in MNP&S computed for 2014 is 443.49 sq. km. Our analysis shows that MNP&S witnessed severe loss of mangroves till 1992, with annual rate of mangrove degradation being 2.89%. Exploitation by local communities and careless release/spillage of oil and brine by nearby industries were found to be two major anthropogenic factors responsible for degradation of mangroves over a period of four decades. Major reasons found for degradation of reefs in MNP&S were mining and deposition of sediments. The area estimates for coral reefs reported in this paper for 2014 are the latest figures available for coral reefs in this region. It is recommended that monitoring of coastal habitats in MNP&S should be done regularly to understand the changes in the ecology of the area.

TI  - Spaceborne PolSAR Tomography for Forest Height Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with polarization diversity and multibaseline acquisition has the capability to resolve the structural information of the target. Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging using SAR tomography is an advance and recent technology that focuses on backscattered echoes not only in the 2-D plane defined by the azimuth and range coordinates, but also in cross-range direction. Forests act as a semitransparent media for radar wavelengths, and thus allow us to gather the vertical distribution of this volumetric scatterer. This paper investigated the potential of polarimetric SAR tomography (PolTomSAR) to retrieve the scatterer distribution of forest area using C-band Radarsat-2 spaceborne SAR dataset. Teak patch of Haldwani forestwas chosen as the test site to validate the robustness of TomoSAR algorithms. Fourier, beamforming, Capon, Capon like, and polarimetric capon were implemented in this study and backscatter power variations with their corresponding vertical profile for a particular azimuth bin were derived and analyzed. It was observed that Fourier suffered from high sidelobes that were reduced by beamforming and Capon. Limitations of beamformer were highlighted and well resolved by Capon. However, both beamforming and Capon yielded lowbackscattering power at different height levels. The Capon-like algorithm substantially improved the backscatter intensity at different forest height levels. Polarimetric capon surpassed the Capon algorithm and was able to estimate better heights by incorporating various polarization channels. Height map was generated for fully polarimetric Capon and validated with the ground truth data.

TI  - Bistatic PolInSAR Inversion Modelling for Plant Height Retrieval in a Tropical Forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) based modeling approaches have been used by several researchers for forest height estimation using airborne and space-borne sensors. Temporal gaps between interferometric pairs due to repeat pass acquisition of SAR data induces volume decorrelation in the coherence values and this may cause error during inversion modelling for forest height estimation. Tandem-X CoSSC products were acquired by operating TerraSAR-X and Tandem-X both the sensors with maintained spatial baseline and zero temporal gap. The prime focus of the present study was to evaluate the performance of bistatic X-band PolInSAR pair for forest height retrieval. Two algorithms; three stage inversion (TSI) and coherence amplitude inversion (CAI) were implemented on the complex coherences obtained from PolInSAR processing. Both the inversion algorithms showed their potential for forest height retrieval through bistatic PolInSAR data. Relationship between field-measured and CAI based modelling showed correlation of 0.27 with RMSE 4.81 m. TSI based modelling showed better results in comparison to CAI based inversion with correlation 0.74 and RMSE of 3.79 m. This study investigated the potential of bistatic PolInSAR data over tropical forest area and it was found that space-borne bistatic SAR has great potential to preserve coherence values for forest height estimation.

TI  - Temporal Response of Scattering From Crops for Transmitted Ellipticity Variation in Simulated Compact-Pol SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the received compact polarimetry (CP) parameters are analyzed to infer ellipticity variations related to the transmission of a polarized electromagnetic wave. A generalized 2 x 2 CP covariance matrix is created as a function of the transmitting ellipticity and orientation angle. The Stokes parameters, backscattering coefficients, and the m-chi decomposition scattering powers are used to interpret the temporal behavior of crop growth stages with varying transmitted ellipticities. Time series RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 campaign are used to simulate the CP data. The results clearly show that the transmitted ellipticity variation influences the interaction of the radar signal with agricultural targets. It is noted that there is negligible change in the dominant odd-bounce scattering power for corn during its leaf development stage with the transmitted ellipticity varying by 10 degrees. In the case of wheat during tillering and inflorescence, the volume scattering power decreases by similar to 14% while the odd-bounce and even-bounce scattering powers increase by similar to 6% and similar to 8%, respectively, with the transmitted ellipticity varying by 10 degrees.

TI  - Impact of Multiple Scattering on Longwave Radiative Transfer Involving Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - General circulation models (GCMs) are extensively used to estimate the influence of clouds on the global energy budget and other aspects of climate. Because radiative transfer computations involved in GCMs are costly, it is typical to consider only absorption but not scattering by clouds in longwave (LW) spectral bands. In this study, the flux and heating rate biases due to neglecting the scattering of LW radiation by clouds are quantified by using advanced cloud optical property models, and satellite data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), CloudSat, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) merged products (CCCM). From the products, information about the atmosphere and clouds (microphysical and buck optical properties, and top and base heights) is used to simulate fluxes and heating rates. One-year global simulations for 2010 show that the LW scattering decreases top-of-atmosphere (TOA) upward flux and increases surface downward flux by 2.6 and 1.2 W/m(2), respectively, or approximately 10% and 5% of the TOA and surface LW cloud radiative effect, respectively. Regional TOA upward flux biases are as much as 5% of global averaged outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). LW scattering causes approximately 0.018 K/d cooling at the tropopause and about 0.028 K/d heating at the surface. Furthermore, over 40% of the total OLR bias for ice clouds is observed in 350-500 cm(-1). Overall, the radiative effects associated with neglecting LW scattering are comparable to the counterpart due to doubling atmospheric CO2 under clear-sky conditions.

TI  - The Sociology of Culture in the Soviet Union and Russia: The Missed Turn
T2  - CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article maps the development of the sociology of culture in the Soviet Union and Russia from pre-Soviet to post-Soviet times. The analysis highlights the effects of two groups of factors - one cultural, the other structural - the combination of which brought about various patterns at each stage of the discipline's development. Because of the political environment within which they worked, Soviet researchers of culture had to employ strategies of resistance to survive. The three most common were: finding niches in related, ideologically neutral disciplines; doing purely empirical work; or, in contrast, critiquing bourgeois social theories'. They also opted to work in the modes of reading rather than writing, oral discussions rather than publishing, and communication with like-minded colleagues rather than debates with opponents. Contemporary Russian sociology of culture displays this inheritance in being structured by the opposition between isolation and international integration, as well as the tension between an elitist vision of culture and the economically centered worldview which has been dominant since the 1990s.

TI  - Delineating Alteration Footprints from Field and ASTER SWIR Spectra, Geochemistry, and Gamma-Ray Spectrometry above Regolith-Covered Base Metal Deposits-An Example from Abra, Western Australia
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave infrared (SWIR) field and laboratory reflectance spectra were used to identify and characterize mineral assemblages in regolith within a study area around the Abra base metal deposit. The Abra deposit is situated at 300-m depth from surface and hosted by weathered sedimentary rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Edmund Group of the Capricorn Orogen of Western Australia. The deposit contains a chlorite-siderite (+/- white mica) alteration halo delineated from drill core, surrounded with host rocks that are modally poor in detrital and metamorphic chlorite and white mica. Mineral assemblages identified from the regolith SWIR data, which were verified through XRD analysis and preexisting geochemistry data, were used to identify three schematic SWIR mineral domains in the regolith. These domains are (1) poorly crystalline kaolinite in an extremely weathered transported regolith, (2) well-crystalline kaolinite and muscovite in regolith overlying unaltered bedrock, and (3) phengite +/- chlorite +/- well-crystalline kaolinite mineral footprint in regolith overlying the Abra deposit and nearby base metal prospects. Furthermore, we identified that the mineral footprint detected from regolith samples can be traced in a combined potassium gamma-ray spectrometry and ASTER AlOH group composition map. The combined use of mineralogical and geophysical remote sensing data, and the strategically planned ground validation through mineralogical and geochemical sampling, proved to be a powerful and cost-effective exploration method for regional mapping of mineral footprints potentially related to sedimentary rock-hosted base metal.

TI  - Identification of SNP markers associated with milk and fat yields in multibreed dairy cattle using two genetic group structures
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the correspondence between significant SNP for first-lactation 305-d milk and 305-d fat yields and associated genes from mixed models accounting for population structure using all additive relationships among animals and genetic groups constructed with either SNP genotypic information or with expected breed composition in the Thai multibreed dairy cattle population. The dataset contained 2410 MY and 912 FY from 2410 first-lactation cows with complete pedigree information genotyped with GeneSeek Genomic Profiler 9K. SNP genotypes located in autosomes and the X chromosome, with call rates larger than 90%, minor allele frequencies (MAF) larger than 0.01, and P-values for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium tests larger than 0.00001 were used in the research. Significant SNP for MY and FY were identified using two mixed models that differed only in their definition of genetic groups. Model 1 (Ml) defined genetic groups in terms of breed composition and model 2 (M2) in terms of SNP genotypic information, Fixed effects in M1 and M2 were contemporary group (herd-year-season), genetic group, heterosis, and calving age. Random effects were animal additive genetic and residual. Significant SNP markers were used to identify genes using R package Map2NCBI. Molecular function and biological processes of genes identified by significant SNP markers located inside or within 2500 bp of these genes were obtained via program PANTHER. Both models yielded identically high correlations between number of significant SNP and number of genes per chromosome for MY (r = 0.97) and FY (r = 0.99). Over 60% of genes associated with MY and FY were involved in binding and catalytic activities. Similarly, over 50% of genes associated with MY and FY participated in cellular and metabolic processes. Larger numbers of significant SNP and genes were identified with M2 for MY and with Ml for FY. However, considering both traits, Ml identified more significant SNP and genes than M2 for MY and FY in this Thai multibreed dairy population. Genes associated with MY and FY were primarily involved in binding and catalytic activities as well as in cellular and metabolic processes. Genes identified to be important for MY and FY in the Thai multibreed population differed substantially from those identified in Bos taunts breeds in temperate environments indicating the need to continue to conduct studies with high-density genotyping chips that identify sets of genes relevant to MY and FY in populations of different breed composition under a variety of environmental conditions.

TI  - Characterization of hemocytes from different body fluids of the eastern oyster <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalve hemocytes are involved in a variety of physiological and immunological functions. Circulating hemocytes in the hemolymph represent the main component of the internal self-defense system while hemocytes present in the extrapallial space (between the mantle and the shell) are actively involved in biomineralization and shell formation. This study focused on the characterization of hemocytes from different body fluids of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Hemocytes present in the hemolymph were compared to those contained in the extrapallial fluid. Hemocytes associated with the mucus layer covering pallial organs (mantle, gills, body wall) were also investigated because of their potential role as sentinel cells. Hemocytes were characterized using flow cytometry in conjunction with fluorescent epitope markers (clusters of differentiation, lectins) as well as functional assays (i.e. phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species-ROS). Compared with the hemolymph, there was a significantly greater percentage of granulocytes and agranulocytes among extrapallial and pallial hemocytes, respectively. Accounting for the different percentages of hemocyte sub-populations, significant differences in surface carbohydrate and clusters of differentiation signatures were also revealed between the different fluids. Most informative epitope markers included concanavalin A, peanut agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, CD11b and CD14. Functional assays revealed significant differences in phagocytic activity and ROS production between hemocytes from the extrapallial fluid and hemolymph; however, less robust differences were observed between hemolymph cells and hemocytes associated with the pallial mucus. Findings from this study suggest that there are markedly different hemocyte populations in the three body fluids. The role of peripheral cells, particularly those associated with the pallial mucus, requires further investigations.

TI  - Coupling a bio-accumulator organism and MALDI-TOF MS: an early warning detection system for microcystins in water bodies
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microcystins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria pose serious threats to human health and are a growing problem in drinking water supplies worldwide. Toxin detection and identification in water reservoirs when cyanobacterial density is still low is a key step to predict harmful algal blooms and to allow the safe use of the resource. For this purpose, developing sensitive and rapid methods of analysis is crucial. Adopting a strategy that couples the use of a filter-feeder organism (Unio elongatulus, Pfeiffer 1825 (Bivalvia: Unionidae)) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology, effective microcystin detection was achieved. The performances of MALDI-TOF MS, high-liquid-performance chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) test were compared. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exploitation of an efficient bio-accumulator organism, coupled with a rapid and sensitive analytical method, can be a very useful strategy in monitoring programs for early and prompt risk management.

AB  - The Khanh Hoa coal mine is a surface coal mine in the Thai Nguyen province, which is one of the largest deposits of coal in the Vietnam. Numerous reasons such as improper mining techniques and policy, as well as unauthorized mining caused surface and subsurface coal fire in this area. Coal fire is a dangerous phenomenon which affects the environment seriously by releasing toxic fumes which causes forest fires, and subsidence of infrastructure surface. This article presents study on the application of LANDSAT multi-temporal thermal infrared images, which help to detect coal fire. The results obtained in this study can be used to monitor fire zones so as to give warnings and solutions to prevent coal fire.

We observe a constant increase in carcinomas, risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, especially in transplant recipients where skin cancer mortality is important. Among epidemiological developments in melanoma are increased mortality despite screening, occupational exposure to UV, second melanoma and higher risk after carcinoma. New classifications that should be considered are AJCC8 for melanoma and carcinoma. In a near future artificial intelligence could change skin cancer screening practices through deep learning. For the sentinel lymph node, there is no interest in systematic lymphadenectomy that does not improve survival. Radiation therapy is essential for the prognosis of Merkel's carcinoma, and Mohs' surgery can be of interest. In metastatic melanoma, results on immunotherapy and targeted treatments include duration, dose, combinations, and the study of resistance mechanisms. The great novelty is immunotherapy or targeted therapy as an adjuvant treatment, giving an improvement in survival without relapse.

TI  - Assessing the Reliability of Performing Citywide Chronic Disease Surveillance Using Emergency Department Data from Sentinel Hospitals
T2  - POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the inequalities in the distribution of disease burden, geographically detailed methods of disease surveillance are needed to identify local hot spots of chronic disease. However, few data sources include the patient-level addresses needed to perform these studies. Given that individual hospitals would have access to this geographically granular data, this study assessed the reliability of estimating chronic disease prevalence using emergency department surveillance at specific hospitals. Neighborhood-level diabetes, hypertension, and asthma prevalence were estimated using emergency claims data from each individual hospital in New York City from 2009-2012. Estimates were compared to prevalence obtained from a traditional health survey. A multivariable analysis also was performed to identify which individual hospitals were more accurate at estimating citywide disease prevalence. Among 52 hospitals, variation was found in the accuracy of disease prevalence estimates using emergency department surveillance. Estimates at some hospitals, such as NYU Langone Medical Center, had strong correlations for all diseases studied (diabetes: 0.81, hypertension: 0.84, and asthma: 0.84). Hospitals with patient populations geographically distributed throughout New York City had better accuracy in estimating citywide disease prevalence. For diabetes and hypertension, hospitals with racial/ethnic patient distributions similar to Census estimates and higher fidelity of diagnosis coding also had more accurate prevalence estimates. This study demonstrated how citywide chronic disease surveillance can be performed using emergency data from specific sentinel hospitals. The findings may provide an alternative means of mapping chronic disease burden by using existing data, which may be critical in regions without resources for geographically detailed health surveillance.

TI  - The Australian Geoscience Data Cube - Foundations and lessons learned
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.

T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Promising geothermal areas were identified according to the relationship between geothermal emergencies and the affected surroundings in Tengchong County, China. It is expected that the study will guide further preliminary investigations performed over large areas with limited information. Publicly available datasets that were used in this analysis included earthquake epicenters, distribution of faults, Bouguer gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies and Landsat7 ETM + images were used to generate five impact factor maps; b-value, distance to faults, distance to major grabens, magnetic anomaly, and land surface temperature, respectively. Predictor maps were produced separately from the impact factor maps using modified certainty factor, index overlay of certainty factor, and weight of certainty factor methods. The findings revealed that the modified certainty factor method showed a more accurate prediction, and the index overlay of certainty factor method can be applied in a simple and straightforward manner, and the weight of certainty factor has the advantage of objective and realistic applications. Based on the suitability maps, potential geothermal regions were discovered in Nujiang basin where have not been explored and exploited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - High Resolution Mapping of Cropping Cycles by Fusion of Landsat and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple cropping, a common practice of intensive agriculture that grows crops multiple times in the agricultural land in one growing season, is an effective way to fulfill the food demand given limited cropland areas. Deriving cropping cycles from satellite data provides the spatial distribution of cropping intensities that allows for monitoring of the multiple cropping activities over large areas. Although efforts have been made to map cropping cycles at 500 m or coarser resolution, producing cropping cycle maps at high resolution remain challenging because data from single satellite sensor do not provide sufficient spatiotemporal observations. In this paper, we generate dense time series of satellite data at 30 m resolution by fusion of Landsat and MODIS data, and derive the cropping cycles from the fused time series data. The method achieves overall accuracies of 92.5% and 89.2%, respectively, for two typical regions of multiple cropping in China using samples identified based on satellite time series data, and an overall accuracy of 81.2% for four subregions using all samples identified based on multi-temporal high resolution images. The mapped crop cycles show to be reasonable geographically and agree with the national census data. The fusion approach provides a feasible way to map cropping cycles at 30 m resolution and enables improved depiction of the spatial distribution of multiple cropping.

TI  - GPS and BeiDou Differential Code Bias Estimation Using Fengyun-3C Satellite Onboard GNSS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential code biases (DCBs) are important parameters in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) applications such as positioning as well as ionosphere remote sensing. In comparison to the conventional approach, which utilizes ground-based observations and parameterizes global ionosphere maps together with DCBs, a method is presented for GPS and BeiDou system (BDS) satellite DCB estimation using onboard observations from the Chinese Fengyun-3C (FY3C) satellite. One month worth of GPS and BDS data during March 2015 was exploited and the GPS C1C-C2W and BDS C2I-C7I DCBs were explored. To improve DCB estimation precision, the dual frequency carrier phase measurements leveled by code measurements were used to form basic observation equation. Code multipath errors of the FY3C onboard GPS/BDS observations were assessed and modeled as grid maps, and their impact on DCB estimation was analyzed. By correcting code multipath errors, the stability of DCB estimates was improved by 5.0%, 3.1%, 16.2% and 13.6% for GPS, and BDS geosynchronous orbit satellites (GEOs), inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit satellites (IGSOs) and medium Earth orbit satellites (MEOs), respectively. The monthly stability of FY3C-based DCBs was at the order of 0.1 ns for GPS satellites, 0.2 ns for BDS GEOs and 0.1 ns for BDS IGSOs and MEOs. By comparison to the ground-based DCB products issued by other institutions, FY3C-based DCBs showed stability degradation for BDS C02 and C05 satellites, while, for other satellites, the stability reached a similar or even superior level. The estimated FY3C receiver DCB stability was at the order of 0.2 ns for both GPS and BDS. In addition to the DCB estimates, the obtained vertical total electron content above the FY3C satellite orbit was also investigated and its realism was examined in physical and numerical aspects.

TI  - Recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and the impacts of dams
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world's third largest delta and one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots, the Mekong Delta provides both ecological and food security for its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the delta has been threatened by climate change and human activities, particularly the proliferation of hydropower development across the Mekong Basin since the 1990s. However, compared to the well-studied Holocene Mekong Delta, our understanding of the recent 50-year evolution of the Mekong Delta is not sufficient to address these threats. In this study, we used 43-year Landsat images from 1973 to 2015 to investigate the entirety of the Mekong Delta's shoreline, land area and geomorphological changes. We compiled a new and comprehensive GIS database of the dams and irrigations of the Mekong Basin. The goal was to improve our knowledge of the recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and to link the potential impacts of dams and other factors. Our results show that the Mekong Delta is experiencing a significant decrease in the shoreline progradation rate. Currently, 66% of the entire delta shoreline is under erosion. The erosion segments are mainly located on the eastern side of the Ca Mau Peninsula and northwestern side of the delta in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT). Most parts of the shorelines in the estuarine area are still growing, although river sediment continues to decrease. Geomorphological asymmetries, discontinuous shoreline shifts, and sandy beach-ridge sets can be observed in multitemporal images. The entire Mekong Delta experienced a shift from growing to shrinking around 2005 with the gradual increase of the total accumulated installed capacity of the dams over the entire river basin. In the near future, the realization of planned dams, extension of irrigation, groundwater withdrawal, uncontrolled riverbed mining, delta subsidence, sea level rise, and other factors will accelerate the ongoing delta erosion.

TI  - Antarctic snow melt detection based on the synergy of SSM/I and QuikSCAT
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave radiometer SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) data and scatterometer QuikSCAT (Quick Scatterometer) data have been widely used for near-surface snow melt detection based on their sensitivity to liquid water present in snow. The SSM/I data have high reliability and the QuikSCAT data have high spatial resolution. In order to improve the accuracy of Antarctic near-surface snow melt detection, we propose a new method based on the synergy of SSM/I and QuikSCAT data, i.e. the snow melt physical model incorporates the complementary advantages of both datasets. Based on comparisons with temperature data from three automatic weather stations, the proposed algorithm improved the accuracy of snow melt detection. The algorithm could also be applied to other regions, which would provide further evidence to support its use and additional data to document changes in the Antarctic due to global climate change.

TI  - MODIS land cover uncertainty in regional climate simulations
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS land cover datasets are used extensively across the climate modeling community, but inherent uncertainties and associated propagating impacts are rarely discussed. This paper modeled uncertainties embedded within the annual MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) products and propagated these uncertainties through the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). First, land cover uncertainties were modeled using pixel-based trajectory analyses from a time series of MCD12Q1 for Urumqi, China. Second, alternative land cover maps were produced based on these categorical uncertainties and passed into RAMS. Finally, simulations from RAMS were analyzed temporally and spatially to reveal impacts. Our study found that MCD12Q1 struggles to discriminate between grasslands and croplands or grasslands and barren in this study area. Such categorical uncertainties have significant impacts on regional climate model outputs. All climate variables examined demonstrated impact across the various regions, with latent heat flux affected most with a magnitude of 4.32 W/m(2) in domain average. Impacted areas were spatially connected to locations of greater land cover uncertainty. Both biophysical characteristics and soil moisture settings in regard to land cover types contribute to the variations among simulations. These results indicate that formal land cover uncertainty analysis should be included in MCD12Q1-fed climate modeling as a routine procedure.

TI  - Tasseled cap triangle (TCT)-leaf area index (LAI) model of rice fields based on PROSAIL model and its application
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The tasseled cap triangle (TCT)-leaf area index (LAI) isoline is a model that reflects the distribution of LAI isoline in the spectral space constituted by reflectance of red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and the LAI retrieval model developed on the basis of this is more accurate than the commonly used statistical relationship models. This study used ground-based measurements of the rice field, validated the applicability of PROSAIL model in simulating canopy reflectance of rice field, and calibrated the input parameters of the model. The ranges of values of PROSAIL input parameters for simulating rice canopy reflectance were determined. Based on this, the TCT-LAI isoline model of rice field was established, and a look-up table (LUT) required in remote sensing retrieval of LAI was developed. Then, the LUT was used for Landsat 8 and WorldView 3 data to retrieve LAI of rice field, respectively. The results showed that the LAI retrieved using the LUT developed from TCT-LAI isoline model had a good linear relationship with the measured LAI R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 0.47. Compared with the LAI retrieved from Landsat 8, LAI values retrieved from WorldView 3 varied with wider range, and data distribution was more scattered. Resampling the Landsat 8 and WorldView 3 reflectance data to 1 km to retrieve LAI, the result of MODIS LAI product was significantly underestimated compared to that of retrieved LAI.

TI  - Estimating Global Ecosystem Isohydry/Anisohydry Using Active and Passive Microwave Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of isohydry/anisohydry describes the degree to which plants regulate their water status, operating from isohydric with strict regulation to anisohydric with less regulation. Though some species level measures of isohydry/anisohydry exist at a few locations, ecosystem-scale information is still largely unavailable. In this study, we use diurnal observations from active (Ku-Band backscatter from QuikSCAT) and passive (X-band vegetation optical depth (VOD) from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS Aqua) microwave satellite data to estimate global ecosystem isohydry/anisohydry. Here diurnal observations from both satellites approximate predawn and midday plant canopy water contents, which are used to estimate isohydry/anisohydry. The two independent estimates from radar backscatter and VOD show reasonable agreement at low and middle latitudes but diverge at high latitudes. Grasslands, croplands, wetlands, and open shrublands are more anisohydric, whereas evergreen broadleaf and deciduous broadleaf forests are more isohydric. The direct validation with upscaled in situ species isohydry/anisohydry estimates indicates that the VOD-based estimates have much better agreement than the backscatter-based estimates. The indirect validation with prior knowledge suggests that both estimates are generally consistent in that vegetation water status of anisohydric ecosystems more closely tracks environmental fluctuations of water availability and demand than their isohydric counterparts. However, uncertainties still exist in the isohydry/anisohydry estimate, primarily arising from the remote sensing data and, to a lesser extent, from the methodology. The comprehensive assessment in this study can help us better understand the robustness, limitation, and uncertainties of the satellite-derived isohydry/anisohydry estimates. The ecosystem isohydry/anisohydry has the potential to reveal new insights into spatiotemporal ecosystem response to droughts.

TI  - Monitoring spatiotemporal variations in nutrients in a large drinking water reservoir and their relationships with hydrological and meteorological conditions based on Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient enrichment is a major cause of water eutrophication, and variations in nutrient enrichment are influenced by environmental changes and anthropogenic activities. Accurately estimating nutrient concentrations and understanding their relationships with environmental factors are vital to develop nutrient management strategies to mitigate eutrophication. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data is used to estimate nutrient concentrations and analyze their responses to hydrological and meteorological conditions. Two well-accepted empirical models are developed and validated to estimate the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (C-TN and C-TP) in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir using Landsat 8 OLI data from 2013 to 2016. Spatially, C-TN decreased from the transition zone to the riverine zone and the lacustrine zone. On the other hand, C-TP decreased from the riverine zone to the transition zone and the lacustrine zone. Temporally, C-TN displayed elevated values during the late fall and winter and had lower values during the summer and early fall, whereas C-TP was higher during the spring and lower during the winter. Among the environmental factors, the rainfall and the inflow rate have strong positive correlations with the nutrient concentrations. TN is more sensitive to meteorological factors (wind speed, temperature, sunshine duration), and the spatial driving forces vary among the different sections of the reservoir. However, TP is more easily influenced by human activities, such as fishery and agricultural activities. Current results would improve our understanding of the drivers of nutrients spatiotemporal variability and the approach in this study can be applicable to other similar reservoir to develop related strategies to mitigate eutrophication.

TI  - Investigation of Water Temperature Variations and Sensitivities in a Large Floodplain Lake System (Poyang Lake, China) Using a Hydrodynamic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although changes in water temperature influence the rates of many ecosystem processes in lakes, knowledge of the water temperature regime for large floodplain lake systems subjected to multiple stressors has received little attention. The coupled models can serve to derive more knowledge on the water temperature impact on lake ecosystems. For this purpose, we used a physically-based hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport model to examine the spatial and temporal behavior and primary causal factors of water temperature within the floodplain of Poyang Lake that is representative of shallow and large lakes in China. Model performance is assessed through comparison with field observations and remote sensing data. The daily water temperature variations within Poyang Lake were reproduced reasonably well by the hydrodynamic model, with the root mean square errors of 1.5-1.9 degrees C. The modeling results indicate that the water temperature exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variability. The mean seasonal water temperatures vary substantially from 29.1 degrees C in summer to 7.7 degrees C in winter, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Although the degree of spatial variability differed considerably between seasons, the water temperature generally decreases from the shallow floodplains to the main flow channels of the lake. As expected, the lake water temperature is primarily affected by the air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and the inflow temperature, whereas other factors such as cloud cover, relative humidity, precipitation, evaporation and lake topography may play a complementary role in influencing temperature. The current work presents a first attempt to use a coupled model approach, which is therefore a useful tool to investigate the water temperature behavior and its major causal factors for a large floodplain lake system. It would have implications for improving the understanding of Poyang Lake water temperature and supporting planning and management of the lake, its water quality and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Estimating Azimuth Offset With Double-Difference Interferometric Phase: The Effect of Azimuth FM Rate Error in Focusing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating azimuth offset with double-difference interferometric (DDI) phase, which is called multiple-aperture interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) or spectral diversity, is increasingly used in recent years to measure azimuth deformation or to accurately coregister a pair of InSAR images. We analyze the effect of frequency modulation (FM) rate error in focusing on the DDI phase with an emphasis on the azimuth direction. We first comprehensively analyze the errors in various focusing results caused by the FM rate error. We then derive the DDI phase error considering different acquisition modes including stripmap, ScanSAR, and TOPS modes. For stripmap mode, typical DDI phase error is a range ramp, while for burst modes including ScanSAR and TOPS modes it is an azimuth ramp within a burst. The correction methods for the DDI phase error are suggested for different acquisition modes.

TI  - Fractional Snow-Cover Mapping Based on MODIS and UAV Data over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products have relatively low accuracy over the Tibetan Plateau because of its complex terrain and shallow, fragmented snow cover. In this study, fractional snow-cover (FSC) mapping algorithms were developed using a linear regression model (LR), a linear spectral mixture analysis model (LSMA) and a back-propagation artificial neural network model (BP-ANN) based on MODIS data (version 006) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. The accuracies of the three models were validated against Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) snow-cover maps (Landsat 8 FSC) and compared with the MODIS global FSC product (MOD10A1 FSC, version 005) for the purpose of finding the optimal algorithm for FSC extraction for the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that (1) the overall retrieval results of the LR and BP-ANN models based on MODIS and UAV data were relatively similar to the OLI snow-cover maps; the accuracy and stability were greatly improved, with even some reduction in errors; compared to the Landsat 8 FSC, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.8222 and 0.8445 respectively and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) were 0.2304 and 0.2201, respectively. (2) The accuracy and stability of the fully constrained LSMA model using the pixel purity index (PPI) endmember extraction method based only on MODIS data suffered the worst performance of the three models; r was only 0.7921 and the RMSE was as large as 0.3485. There were some serious omission phenomena in the study area, specifically for the largest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.2755) and positive mean error (PME = 0.3411). (3) The accuracy of the MOD10A1 FSC product was much lower than that of the LR and BP-ANN models, although its accuracy slightly better that of the LSMA based on comprehensive evaluation of six accuracy indices. (4) The optimal model was the BP-ANN model with combined inputs of surface reflectivity data (R1-R7), elevation (DEM) and temperature (LST), which can easily incorporate auxiliary information (DEM and LST) on the basis of (R1-R7) during the relationship training period and can effectively improve the accuracy of snow area monitoringit is the ideal algorithm for retrieving FSC for the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Performance Assessment of Tailored Split-Window Coefficients for the Retrieval of Lake Surface Water Temperature from AVHRR Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is defined as an essential climate variable (ECV) within the global climate observing system (GCOS), current satellite-based retrieval techniques do not fulfill the GCOS accuracy requirements. The split-window (SW) retrieval method is well-established, and the split-window coefficients (SWC) are the key elements of its accuracy. Performances of SW depends on the degree of SWC customization with respect to its application, where accuracy increases when SWC is tailored for specific situations. In the literature, different SWC customization approaches have been investigated, however, no direct comparisons have been conducted among them. This paper presents the results of a sensitivity analysis to address this gap. We show that the performance of SWC is most sensitive to customizations for specific time-windows (Sensitivity Index SI of 0.85) or spatial extents (SI 0.27). Surprisingly, the study highlights that the use of separated SWC for daytime and night-time situations has limited impact (SI 0.10). The final validation with AVHRR satellite data showed that the subtle differences among different SWC customizations were not traceable to the final uncertainty of the LSWT product. Nevertheless, this study provides a basis to critically evaluate current assumptions regarding SWC generation by directly comparing the performance of multiple customization approaches for the first time.

TI  - An Improved Remote Sensing Evaporation Model and Its Application to Estimate the Surface Evaporation of Sichuan Province
T2  - NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation (ET) which consists of plant transpiration and soil evaporation is an important component of water vapor transmission and transfer. It is also an important descriptive parameter of surface drought information. In recent decades, with the rapid development of economic situation, global warming and population growing, evaporation has greatly changed. Based on linear two-source model of evaporation fraction (EF) of Nishida and other scholars, we establish the correcting mixed type linear dual-source remote sensing model. The model is used to estimate the actual evaporation of Sichuan Province, which use the meteorological data of stations of Sichuan Province and MODIS data products. The actual evaporation by estimating needs to be verified through the practical evaporation products of MODIS. The results show that this model can monitor the drought in Sichuan Province, and it not only has a theoretical basis, also has a good application prospect to drought monitoring.

TI  - Unsupervised detection of contextual anomaly in remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive amounts of remotely sensed data are being generated at an unprecedented rate, offering new opportunities for data-driven scientific discovery in the Earth sciences and related domains. However, due to the sheer volume of remotely sensed data and the lack of effective data analytics tools, most data remain in the dark, with little to no quality assurance and limited access to high-level analytical tools. Anomaly detection, which aims to find scenarios that differ from the norm, is of particular importance when analyzing remotely sensed data. However, most previous work has focused on identifying individual anomalies, and required prior knowledge of the ground truth for supervised learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that requires no prior knowledge and is capable of detecting anomalous events, which we define as groups of outlier objects differing contextually from their spatial and temporal neighbors. Such contextual anomalies can be useful in discovering both hidden quality issues in the data and real natural events of significance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via Web-based tools developed for visualizing and analyzing such contextual anomalies, using two types of data. The techniques and tools developed in this project are generally usable for a diverse set of satellite products and will be made publicly available with the support of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

TI  - Space Observation of Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure at Ocean Surface
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed and validated a statistical model to estimate the partial pressure (or fugacity) of carbon dioxide at the sea surface from space-based observations of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and salinity. More than a quarter million in situ measurements coincident with satellite data were compiled. A portion of the data was randomly selected to train and validate the model. We have produced and made accessible nine years (2002-2011) of the partial pressure at 0.5 degrees and daily resolutions over the global oceans. The outputs are found to be sensitive to variability from intraseasonal to interannual time scales and from the equatorial to high-latitude oceans. They can capture known phenomena, such as, annual spring blooms at high latitudes, interannual episodes of El Nino, and westward propagation of tropical instability waves. The feasibility of using a single algorithm to map the partial pressure over global oceans for all seasons is demonstrated. The result is important for characterizing the sources and sinks of atmospheric greenhouse gas and ocean biogeochemistry. We discuss the significance of the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer in the consistent measurement of sea surface temperature, which is the main driver of ocean carbon dioxide change, in cold and warm waters, under clear and cloudy sky. The continuous and consistent coverage of the partial pressure over global ocean using space-based data is discussed.

TI  - Seasonal and Diurnal Characteristics of Land Surface Temperature and Major Explanatory Factors in Harris County, Texas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of biophysical and meteorological factors on land surface temperature (LST) have been well studied in previous research. However, less attention has been paid to examine how building materials influence the magnitude of LST within an urban environment. This study investigates the interaction of biophysical and building wall materials to influence LST in Harris County, Texas, USA using multiple stepwise linear regression analyses and neighborhood analysis. Working at 1 km grid resolution, LST data is related to impervious surface fraction, albedo, distance to water bodies, and seven major wall types. Ten years of aggregated MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daily LST products were used to calculate the mean LST in January and August for daytime and nighttime conditions. Harris County 2010 parcel level building property data were used to create composition characteristics of the building wall types. Our results demonstrate that both biophysical and building wall characteristics significantly influence the spatiotemporal variations of LST. However, biophysical factors are the dominant explaining factors compared to building wall materials. Impervious surface fraction is the most significant variable to explain the variation of LST, and has positive effects on LST. In contrast, high albedo materials and the presence of open water bodies significantly affect LST and are good candidate variables to mitigate the heat island effect. Furthermore, the building wall variables all increase LST for both daytime and nighttime, but different wall materials have various effects on LST. Brick/veneer and frame/concrete block are the two dominant wall types in Harris County and tend to generate higher LST. These results demonstrate how building materials, in combination with biophysical factors, can be used to mitigate neighborhood-scale LST. This methodology works reasonably well for Houston, but is likely to be more effective in higher density urban settings.

TI  - Estimating the fluctuation of Lake Hulun, China, during 1975-2015 from satellite altimetry data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake level, area, and volume changes can describe the fluctuation of water bodies. In this study, ICESat/Hydroweb and Landsat data recorded with irregularly time intervals from 1975 to 2015 were used to examine changes in lake level and area which were combined to indirectly estimate water volume variations of Lake Hulun. The time series of lake level, area, and volume variations of Lake Hulun exhibited a fluctuating trend from 1975 to 1984 and the mean value were about 542.57 m, 2065.76 km(2), and -0.045 km(3), respectively and an increasing trends showed during 1984-2000. Lake Hulun revealed the fastest decrease in lake level (-0.42 m/a), volume (-0.83 km(3)/a) from 2000 to 2009, and the fastest shrinking in surface area (-33.88 km(2)/a) during 2000-2012. There was a seasonal variation of water level and lake volume variations during 20092012 and the mean value were 539.98 m and -5.72 km(3), respectively. From 2012 to 2015, a faster increasing trends were shown in water level, area, and volume variations with a rate of 0.73 m/a (the amount of change was 2.92 m), 81.95 km(3)/a (the amount of change was 327.8 km(2)), and 0.42 km(3)/a (the amount of change was1.67 km(3)), respectively. The lake level and area showed strong correlations for Lake Hulun (R-2 = 0.93). The water volume changes were in very good agreement for lake level changes (R-2 > 0.99) and surface area variations (R-2 = 0.92). Combining with lake level and area changes, the sum of lake volume variation of Lake Hulun was obtained and it showed a positive water budgets of 0.24 km(3) during past 40 years. River and groundwater discharge, the pan evaporation, the net pan evaporation, and the water diversion project were reasons for the lake level, area, and volume variations in Lake Hulun. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data can be used as a source of information for monitoring comprehensively the fluctuation of large water bodies.

TI  - Matching Multi-Source Optical Satellite Imagery Exploiting a Multi-Stage Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geometric distortions and intensity differences always exist in multi-source optical satellite imagery, seriously reducing the similarity between images, making it difficult to obtain adequate, accurate, stable, and well-distributed matches for image registration. With the goal of solving these problems, an effective image matching method is presented in this study for multi-source optical satellite imagery. The proposed method includes three steps: feature extraction, initial matching, and matching propagation. Firstly, a uniform robust scale invariant feature transform (UR-SIFT) detector was used to extract adequate and well-distributed feature points. Secondly, initial matching was conducted based on the Euclidean distance to obtain a few correct matches and the initial projective transformation between the image pair. Finally, two matching strategies were used to propagate matches and produce more reliable matching results. By using the geometric relationship between the image pair, geometric correspondence matching found more matches than the initial UR-SIFT feature points. Further probability relaxation matching propagated some new matches around the initial UR-SIFT feature points. Comprehensive experiments on Chinese ZY3 and GaoFen (GF) satellite images revealed that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of the number of correct matches, correct matching rate, spatial distribution, and matching accuracy, compared to the standard UR-SIFT and triangulation-based propagation method.

TI  - Axillary tumour burden in women with a fine-needle aspiration/core biopsy-proven positive node on ultrasonography compared to women with a positive sentinel node
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe sensitivity of axillary ultrasonography (AUS) has increased in recent years, enabling detection of even low-volume axillary nodal metastases. The aim here was to evaluate the axillary tumour burden in women with a fine-needle aspiration/core biopsy-proven positive node on AUS and in those with a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB).MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included all patients with early breast cancer who had AUS and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) between 2011 and 2014.ResultsA total of 332 patients who had ALND were eligible for the study, 191 (57<bold></bold>5 per cent) in the AUS-positive group and 141 (42<bold></bold>5 per cent) in the SNB-positive group. Patients in the AUS-positive group were older at diagnosis (P=0<bold></bold>018), more likely to have larger tumours (P=0<bold></bold>002), higher tumour grade (P=0<bold></bold>005), positive human epidermal growth factor 2 status (P=0<bold></bold>015), and negative oestrogen receptor status (P<0<bold></bold>001). The AUS-positive group also had a larger number of lymph nodes with macrometastases (P<0<bold></bold>001) and were more likely to have extranodal invasion (P<0<bold></bold>001). In the AUS-positive group, 40<bold></bold>3 per cent of patients (77 of 191) had only one or two nodes with macrometastases identified at histology after ALND. Tumour size no larger than 20mm, invasive ductal or lobular histology and breast-conserving surgery were associated with the presence of two or fewer macrometastases at ALND. Only tumour size and tumour histology remained significant in multiple logistic regression analysis.ConclusionPatients with AUS-detected metastases had a higher axillary tumour burden than those with SNB-detected metastases. Around 40 per cent of patients with AUS-detected nodal disease had one or two nodes with macrometastases and were thus overtreated by ALND.Axillary ultrasound can detect low-volume metastases

TI  - Toward understanding atmospheric physics impacting the relationship between columnar aerosol optical depth and near-surface <i>PM<sub>2.5</sub></i> mass concentrations in Nevada and California, USA, during 2013
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the relationship between columnar aerosol optical depth (tau(ext)) and surface particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5)is desired to estimate surface aerosol concentrations over broad spatial and temporal scales using satellite remote sensing. However, remote sensing studies incur challenges when surface aerosol pollution (i.e. PM2.5) is not correlated with columnar conditions (i.e., tau(ext)) PM2.5 data fusion models that rely on satellite data and statistical relationships of tau(ext) and PM2.5 may not be able to capture the physical conditions impacting the relationships that cause columnar and surface aerosols to not be correlated in the western U.S. Therefore, an extensive examination of the atmospheric conditions is required to improve surface estimates of PM2.5 that rely on columnar aerosol measurements. This investigation uses datasets from both routine monitoring networks and models of meteorological variables and aerosol physical parameters to understand the atmospheric conditions under which surface aerosol pollution can be explained by column measurements in California and Nevada during 2013. A novel quadrant method, that utilizes statistical analysis, was developed to investigate the relationship between 't,, and PM2,5. The results from this investigation show that tau(ext), and PM2.5 had a positive association (tau(ext), and PM2.5 increase together) when local sources of pollution or wildfires dominated aerosol pollution in the presence of a deep and well-mixed planetary boundary layer (PBL). Moreover, tau(ext) and PM2.5 had no association (where the variables are not related) when stable conditions, long-range transport, or entrainment of air from above the PBL were observed. It was found that seasonal categorization of the relationship between tau(ext) and PM2.5, an approach commonly used in statistical models to estimate surface concentrations with satellite remote sensing, may not be enough to account for the atmospheric conditions that drive the relationships between Text and PM2,5. For all stations, winter showed the maximum average PM2,5 concentrations (14.1 mu g m(-3), sigma = 11.6 mu g m(-3)) meanwhile, tau(ext) reached minimum values (0.06 mu g m(-3) sigma = 0.04) during the same season. Conversely, spring presented the minimum average PM2.5 concentrations (9.4 mu g m(-3), sigma = 6.9 mu g m(-3)) and the average values of tau(ext), during spring had the second highest values (0.11, sigma = 0.06) averaged for all stations.

TI  - Telomere length and procedural justice predict stress reactivity responses to unfair outcomes in African Americans
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This experiment demonstrates that chromosomal telomere length (TL) moderates response to injustice among African Americans. Based on worldview verification theory an emerging psychosocial framework for understanding stress we predicted that acute stress responses would be most pronounced when individual-level expectancies for justice were discordant with justice experiences. Healthy African Americans (N = 118; 30% male; M age = 31.63 years) provided dried blood spot samples that were assayed for TL, and completed a social evaluative stressor task during which high versus low levels of distributive (outcome) and procedural (decision process) justice were simultaneously manipulated. African Americans with longer telomeres appeared more resilient (in emotional and neuroendocrine response higher DHEAs:cortisol) to receiving an unfair outcome when a fair decision process was used, whereas African Americans with shorter telomeres appeared more resilient when an unfair decision process was used. TL may indicate personal histories of adversity and associated stress-related expectancies that influence responses to injustice.

T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The corn leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong), is the most important leafhopper pest of maize, Zea mays, in the Americas. A survey of the diversity of its egg parasitoids was carried out in northwestern Argentina. During summer from 2004 to 2007, the samples were collected, using sentinel eggs of D. maidis on corn leaves, exposed in 48 cornfields. Sixteen species belonging to four families of Chalcidoidea (Hymenoptera) were identified. Among the parasitoid groups, Trichogrammatidae was the most represented family with eight species, followed by Mymaridae with six species. The mymarid Anagrus incarnatus Haliday and the trichogrammatid Pseudoligosita longifrangiata (Viggiani) were the most abundant and frequent parasitoids. The mean percentage of parasitism of D. maidis eggs was 16.4% and varied greatly among the sites, ranging from 0 to 56.7%; generally, it was higher in Yungas and lower in Monte province sites. The species richness was higher in the localities within the Yungas, with 13 parasitoid species, of which two species were dominant, comprising 83.6% of the collected individuals. Monte was the province that showed the highest diversity index (H' = 1.62). In addition, we present information on the distribution, known host associations of each parasitoid species and an identification key to all species of egg parasitoids of D. maidis in Argentina.

TI  - 5-HTTLPR Moderates the Association Between Interdependence and Brain Responses to Mortality Threats
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
M3  - Article
AB  - While behavioral research suggests an association between cultural worldview and decreased anxiety of death, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. Using functional MRI, we investigated whether and how the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), which has been associated with mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, moderates the associations between a cultural trait (i.e., interdependence) and self-report of death anxiety/depression and between interdependence and brain responses to mortality threats. Long/long and short/short allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR were scanned using fMRI while they performed a one-back task on death-related, death-unrelated negative, and neutral words. Participants' interdependence and death anxiety/depression were assessed using questionnaires after scanning. We found that participants who assessed themselves with greater interdependence reported lower death anxiety/depression and showed decreased neural response to death-related words in emotion-related brain regions including the anterior cingulate, putamen, and thalamus. However, these results were evident in long/long allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR but not in short/short allele carriers who even showed positive associations between interdependence and neural activities in the anterior cingulate, putamen and thalamus in response to death-related words. Our findings suggest candidate mechanisms for explaining the complex relationship between genotype, cultural traits, and mental/neural responses to mortality threats. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - An Improved Optimal Segmentation Threshold Algorithm and Its Application in the Built-up Quick Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For purpose of improving the accuracy of the built-up quick mapping, this paper proposed an improved optimal segmentation threshold algorithm, namely the improved double-window flexible pace search (IDFPS) approach, by redesigning the valuation criteria and the sampling method based on the double-window flexible pace search (DFPS) approach. Moreover, the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), the Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), the Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI) and the Urban Index (UI) inversed from Landsat 5 TM images were used for quick mapping by the IDFPS approach and the DFPS approach in different geographical areas. Results from the experiments exemplified by Chongqing (a mountain city) and Chengdu (a plain city) showed that the IDFPS approach was comprehensively superior to the DFPS approach. The IDFPS approach had more than 4.30% higher overall accuracy and 0.12 higher Kappa coefficients than the DFPS approach when both were implemented simultaneously at both the above-mentioned study areas. Besides, a new discovery in this paper was found that the UI had a better performance with higher overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, lower omission error and commission error than the NDBI, IBI and EBBI because of the strong relationship between the UI and the density of built-up land. This new method has an important reference value for built-up quick mapping and some other applied researches.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Video satellite imagery is a new technique for earth dynamic observation and has a wide range of uses in environmental fields. Despite its capability of dynamic targets' detection, it sustains a serious restriction of the image quality due to the degradation and compression in its imaging process. Hence, the super-resolution (SR) reconstruction on these compressed low-spatial-resolution images is of significance to afterward ground objects recognition and detection tasks. Based on the recent proposed state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) SR methods, we proposed an SR method which could get more precise reconstructed high-spatial-resolution images. Trained with Gaofen-2 satellite images, a robust CNN model specified in satellite image SR is obtained. Experimentally, the reconstruction results on Jilin-1 mission satellite images validate the effectiveness of our method.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of the nature and strategies of the Inka expansion in the peripheral areas of the empire, NW Argentina among them, has long been a subject of interest for researchers. In recent years, new perspectives have started to focus on an alternative view of the Inka expansion in this area. Among these, the processes of symbolic appropriation, manipulation or re-negotiation of the regional landscapes by the Inkas have been highlighted by some authors, by paying attention to the symbiotic relationship between settlement, architecture and natural features in the landscape. Within that framework, this paper will analyse the distribution of archaeological sites from the Inka period in the Hualfin and Quimivil valleys, located in the province of Catamarca (Argentina). The results of our analysis suggest that the layout of the Inka settlements and roads in that region was influenced by two main factors: distribution along natural corridors and maximization of the visual presence of the Cerros de Aconquija, a prominent mountain range where an Inka ceremonial site was built. Considering the relevant role of certain landscape features in the Inka worldview, this is interpreted as part of a symbolic appropriation of the surrounding landscape.

AB  - The Fengyun-4 satellite (FY-4) is a part of the new generation of the Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites program. The key indicators of the satellite include image navigation and registration (INR), which represent the absolute and relative spatial correspondence between the remote sensing image and the ground target. The most complicated factor affecting INR accuracy involves instrument deformation caused by changes in thermal and mechanical environments in orbit. In the letter, the distorted optical path of the 2-D scanning mechanism of instrument is modeled, and the compensation algorithm represented by two angles and seven equivalent parameters is discussed. In the modeling, more detail deformation is considered, the redundancy is reduced, and the stability of parameter identification is improved compared with another method typically used in American and European satellites. Furthermore, the study presents the processing of the equivalent parameter identification by sensing the image of crossing stars.

AB  - Very high-resolution (approximate to 1 km) precipitation datasets are needed in various applications, especially in the hydrological, environmental, agricultural, and biological fields, although they also have major roles in the climate sciences. Nevertheless, various studies have concurred that the spatial distribution of precipitation is influenced by land surface characteristics through non-stationary relationships, and that this characteristic is generally not considered fully by either global or local models using fixed combinations of variables (e.g. the normalized difference vegetation index and/or digital elevation models). This study introduced a new spatial downscaling algorithm, a divide-and-conquer method (called Cubist), to downscale Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation data over China from 2000 to 2015. In this endeavour, we considered the non-stationary relationships between precipitation and land surface characteristics at various scales and derived the following conclusions: (1) The relationships and related variables explaining the spatial distribution of precipitation varied with spatial scale. (2) The Cubist algorithm achieved greater accuracy than Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) models, and it was found to compensate for the disadvantages of MLR overestimation and underestimation at low and high values, respectively. (3) In downscaling, the monthly Version 7 TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) datasets over China, the entire study area was separated into subregions driven by spatial datasets according to geographic similarities, which were similar to Chinese rainfall zones.

TI  - Relationship Between Field-Based Plant Species Richness and Satellite-Derived Biophysical Proxies in the Western Ghats, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing offers fast and reliable technique to map the variation in plant diversity and distribution at different scales. Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R-2 = 0.07); while fPAR showed (R-2 = 0.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.

TI  - MODIS Sea Ice Thickness and Open Water-Sea Ice Charts over the Barents and Kara Seas for Development and Validation of Sea Ice Products from Microwave Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed algorithms and procedures for calculating daily sea ice thickness ( SIT) and open water- sea ice ( OWSI) charts, based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS), ice surface temperature ( IST) ( night- time only), and reflectance ( R) swath data, respectively. The resolution of the SIT chart is 1 km and that of the OWSI chart is 250 m. The charts are targeted to be used in development and validation of sea ice products from microwave sensor data. We improve the original MODIS cloud masks for the IST and R data, with a focus on identifying larger cloud- free areas in the data. The SIT estimation from the MODIS IST swath data follows previous studies. The daily SIT chart is composed from available swath charts by assigning daily median SIT to a pixel. The OWSI classification is simply conducted by a fixed threshold for the MODIS band 1 R. This was based on manually selected R data for various ice types in late winter, early melt, and advanced melt conditions. The composition procedures for the daily SIT and OWSI charts somewhat compensates for errors due to the undetected clouds. The SIT and OWSI charts were compared against manual ice charts by Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Russia and by Norwegian Meteorological Institute, respectively, and on average, a good relationship between the charts was found. Pixel- wise comparison of the SIT and OWSI charts showed very good agreement in open water vs. sea ice classification, which gives further confidence on the reliability of our algorithms. We also demonstrate usage of the MODIS OWSI and SIT charts for validation of sea ice concentration charts based on the SENTINEL- 1 SAR and AMSR2 radiometer data and two different algorithms.

TI  - Unmanned aircraft system advances health mapping of fragile polar vegetation
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Plants like mosses can be sensitive stress markers of subtle shifts in Arctic and Antarctic environmental conditions, including climate change. Traditional ground-based monitoring of fragile polar vegetation is, however, invasive, labour intensive and physically demanding. High-resolution multispectral satellite observations are an alternative, but even their recent highest achievable spatial resolution is still inadequate, resulting in a significant underestimation of plant health due to spectral mixing and associated reflectance impurities.2. To resolve these obstacles, we have developed a new method that uses low-altitude unmanned aircraft system (UAS) hyperspectral images of sub-decimeter spatial resolution. Machine-learning support vector regressions (SVR) were employed to infer Antarctic moss vigour from quantitative remote sensing maps of plant canopy chlorophyll content and leaf density. The same maps were derived for comparison purposes from the WorldView-2 high spatial resolution (2.2m) multispectral satellite data.3. We found SVR algorithms to be highly efficient in estimating plant health indicators with acceptable root mean square errors (RMSE). The systematic RMSEs for chlorophyll content and leaf density were 3.5-6.0 and 1.3-2.0 times smaller, respectively, than the unsystematic errors. However, application of correctly trained SVR machines on space-borne multispectral images considerably underestimated moss chlorophyll content, while stress indicators retrieved from UAS data were found to be comparable with independent field measurements, providing statistically significant regression coefficients of determination (median r(2)=.50, p(t test)=.0072).4. This study demonstrates the superior performance of a cost-efficient UAS mapping platform, which can be deployed even under the continuous cloud cover that often obscures optical high-altitude airborne and satellite observations. Antarctic moss vigour maps of appropriate resolution could provide timely and spatially explicit warnings of environmental stress events, including those triggered by climate change. Since our polar vegetation health assessment method is based on physical principles of quantitative spectroscopy, it could be adapted to other short-stature and fragmented plant communities (e.g. tundra grasslands), including alpine and desert regions. It therefore shows potential to become an operational component of any ecological monitoring sensor network.

TI  - Variability of Evaporation and Precipitation over the Ocean from Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - HOAPS-3 and PMWC satellite archives for 1988-2008 are used to estimate moisture-exchange components between the ocean and atmosphere (evaporation, precipitation, and the difference between them or effective evaporation). Moisture-exchange components for the entire World Ocean and for the North Atlantic Ocean within 30A degrees-60A degrees N are calculated. A strong overestimation of the global values of effective evaporation by HOAPS data (mainly caused by a decrease in precipitation) is shown. In the interannual variability of effective evaporation, there is clearly an overestimated positive trend, which contradicts the real increase in the Global Sea Level. Large systematic errors in moisture-exchange components are revealed for the North Atlantic water area. According to HOAPS data, there is a significant underestimation of evaporation and effective evaporation. According to PMWC data, the amount of precipitation is significantly overestimated and evaporation is underestimated. As a consequence, effective evaporation becomes negative, which is impossible. Low accuracy in the estimation of moisture-exchange components and the need to improve old estimates and develop new evaporation and precipitation databases based on satellite data are noted.

TI  - Dynamics of habitat suitability for waterfowls from 1990 to 2015 in the ecological function zone of Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - As a wetland of international importance, the ecological function zone of the Sanjiang Plain (EFZSP) plays an important role in maintaining waterfowl habitat. With the increasing disturbance of human beings, land use and climate changes, habitat suitability for waterfowls (HSW) has drawn greater attention of ecologists. In this study, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and HJ-1B images in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015 were used to obtain land cover classification by object-based image analysis, and the entropy and analytic hierarchy process methods were adopted to determine the factors and their weights, the factors selected in this study included water condition (lake and river density), disturbance factor (residence and road density), shelter condition (land cover type and slope), and food abundance (NDVI). Finally, the evaluation results of habitat suitability of year 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 were achieved based on the habitat suitability index (HSI) system, and the spatio-temporal dynamics and driving forces causing the changes were analyzed. The results showed that the excellent level of HSW mainly distributed in abundant water areas, especially along the riparian zone of the Heilongjiang River, Naoli River, Ussuri River, Muling River and Xingkai Lake. Its area decreased by 3.2% from 1990 to 2015 because of wetland reclamation. The good level of HSW concentrated in Raohe County over the past 25 years, the condition of Hulin County and Fuyuan County were improved to a good level from 2010 to 2015 due to the substantial increase of paddy field areas. The fair level of HSW distributed dispersedly, and the areas first increased from 1990 to 2000 and then decreased during 2000-2010 and 2010-2015 periods. The areas of poor level increased by 6.7% from 1990 to 2000 and decreased by 3.1% from 2000 to 2015. The change of HSW level in this study area was dominated by land cover change, and both of the increasing population and economy and the drying and worming climate resulted in the decline of the HSW level, whereas the establishment of nature reserves is crucial to protect habitat for waterfowls.

TI  - Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization: Technical Procedures and Clinical Applications
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Regarding radioguided surgery, the concept of radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) is based on both preoperative interventional imaging and intraoperative radioguided detection of a clinically occult neoplastic lesion.Methods This methodology consists in the direct administration into the lesion of Tc-99m-macroaggregated human albumin formed by relatively large particles retained at the injection site, which direct radioguided excisional biopsy.Results This modality has expanded from the classic application of ROLL for nonpalpable breast lesions to other tumors, such as solitary pulmonary nodules or recurrences from differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In 2011, in order to improve the classification of different radioguided surgical procedures, ROLL applications were included in the more complete concept of GOSTT (Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumor Targeting). This concept was introduced to include the entire range of basic and advanced radioguided procedures necessary to supply a road map for the surgeon.Conclusions The terms ROLL and GOSTT have further developed by incorporating novel modalities such as hybrid tracers for simultaneous fluorescence and radioactive signal detection and innovative navigation systems based on mixed-reality protocols.

TI  - Evaluation of Image Classification Algorithms on Hyperion and ASTER Data for Land Cover Classification
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is one of the widely adopted applications of satellite data. With the advent of new technologies and sensor improvements, many classification algorithms are being developed. However, there are rarely studies on comparison of these classifiers using identical classification scheme and training data over different sensors and their products. In this article, we tested the effect of improved spectral and spatial resolution on classification performance of ASTER data (15 m), Hyperion data (30 m) and their fused product (15 m). For this purpose, we have used five supervised classification algorithms -three spatial classifiers, namely, Maximum Likelihood (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and two spectral classifiers, namely, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID). The performance of image classification algorithms was assessed using overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient. MLC and SVM performed the best on all the three datasets. OA and kappa values for almost all the classifiers were comparable for higher spatial resolution ASTER and fused product and were higher by nearly 10% than that for higher spectral resolution Hyperion data.

TI  - Outcomes Following Possible Undiagnosed Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Contemporary Analysis
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Existing literature suggests that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and " sentinel" aSAH symptoms prompting healthcare evaluations prior to aSAH diagnosis are at increased risk of unfavorable neurologic outcomes and death. Accordingly, these encounters have been presumed to be unrecognized opportunities to diagnose aSAH and the worse outcomes representative of the added risks of delayed diagnoses. We sought to reinvestigate this paradigm among a contemporary cohort of patients with aSAH.Methods: A case-control cohort was retrospectively assembled among patients diagnosed with aSAH between January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2013 within an integrated healthcare delivery system. Patients with a discrete clinical evaluation for headache or neck pain within 14 days prior to formal aSAH diagnosis were identified as cases, and the remaining patients served as controls. Modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days and 1 year were determined by structured chart review. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, presence of intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage at diagnosis, and aneurysm size was used to compare adjusted outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed using varying definitions of favorable neurologic outcomes, a restricted control subgroup of patients with normal mental status at hospital admission, inclusion of additional cases that were diagnosed outside of the integrated health system, and exclusion of patients without evidence of subarachnoid blood on initial noncontrast cranial computed tomography (CT) at the diagnostic encounter (i. e. " CT-negative" SAH).Results: A total of 450 patients with aSAH were identified, 46 (10%) of whom had clinical evaluations for possible aSAH-related symptoms in the 14 days preceding formal diagnosis (cases). In contrast to prior reports, no differences were observed among cases compared to control patients in adjusted odds of death or unfavorable neurologic status at 90 days (0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-1.15; 0.59, 95% CI = 0.22-1.60, respectively) or at 1 year (0.58, 95% CI = 0.19-1.73; 0.52, 95% CI = 0.18-1.51, respectively). Likewise, neither restricting the analysis to a control subgroup of patients with normal mental status at hospital admission, varying the dichotomous definition of unfavorable neurologic outcome, inclusion of cases diagnosed outside the integrated health system, or exclusion of patients with CT-negative SAH resulted in significant adjusted outcome differences.Conclusion: In a contemporary cohort of patients with aSAH, we observed no statistically significant increase in the adjusted odds of death or unfavorable neurologic outcomes among patients with clinical evaluations for possible aSAH-related symptoms in the 14 days preceding formal diagnosis of aSAH. While these findings cannot exclude a smaller risk difference than previously reported, they can help refine decision analyses and testing threshold determinations for patients with possible aSAH.

TI  - The Lived Experience of African-American Informal Caregivers of Family Members with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.
T2  - Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the lived experience of African-American informal caregivers of family members with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in a home environment. Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, a purposive sample of 16 African-American informal caregivers completed an in-depth interview that lasted from 30 to 60 minutes. Four themes emerged: (a) a sense of obligation, (b) an arduous journey, (c) sentinel events, and (d) faith in God. Findings indicated that caregivers needed to be well-informed concerning the demands of caregiving and needed more assistance with the task of delivering care. Informal caregivers lacked support, knowledge, and guidance. Implications for the discipline of nursing include emphasis on family assessment, teaching, awareness of resources, and collaboration with healthcare teams.

TI  - A critical evaluation of quality of life in clinical trials of breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters have been reported in phase III trials with breast cancer patients (BCPs) who received radiation therapy (RT). We also examine the frequency and correlates of significant HRQOL gains. A systematic review was conducted. When HRQOL was a study endpoint, we extracted data on the instruments used for HRQOL analysis, assessing if there was formal statistical comparison between study groups and the results of such comparisons as reported by the authors of the studies. In result, 182 trials were included. HRQOL was considered as endpoint in 38 (20.8%) of the studies and it was used as primary endpoint in 10.9% of them. Of 22 trials that had a positive primary endpoint, 18 had a significant benefit in HRQOL, in favor of the experimental arm. Of 13 trials that had a negative primary endpoint, there were no differences in HRQOL among the study groups. With respect to HRQOL assessment, statistical methods and definition of timing of evaluation were described in 32 (84.2%) and 36 (94.7%) trials, respectively. In conclusion, HRQOL has been infrequently investigated in trials in BCP who received RT. Statistical methods and timing of evaluation were infrequently described with sufficient detail to be informative.

TI  - Home Enteral Nutrition: Updates, Trends, and Challenges
T2  - NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - The true prevalence of home enteral nutrition (HEN) utilization is unclear and requires further study. HEN therapy has remained virtually unchanged for several decades. However, new trends in HEN are evolving; enteral nutrition is undergoing changes ranging from enteral feeding devices, ingredients used, practice innovations, and challenges with reimbursement. A 2006 Joint Commission call to action that reported 2 sentinel events related to misconnections set things into motion for the transition of enteral device connectors to become specific for enteral nutrition use, which will affect patients who receive HEN. Nutrition support clinicians are realizing that people fed enterally may also enjoy incorporating blended foods into their diets and may benefit from different nutrients and components (ie, phytonutrients, fiber, and prebiotics) present in natural foods, thereby resulting in the renaissance of food-based blenderized tube feedings. This article reviews HEN therapy data or the lack thereof, current practices, risks and benefits, future trends, and challenges with access devices, enteral feedings, and reimbursement. It also highlights areas where more research is needed, and it urges clinicians to get involved in legislative action or committees to facilitate improved processes and reimbursement for HEN.

TI  - Detecting and Mapping Root-Knot Nematode Infection in Coffee Crop Using Remote Sensing Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nematodes are a serious issue for coffee cultivation in Brazil. Because root infection by nematodes induces spectral variation in leaves and defines a unique spatial configuration in the cultivation field, the aim of this study was to use biophysical parameters and remote sensing data to discriminate and map healthy, moderately infected, and severely infected coffee plants. An experimental area in southern Minas Gerais State, in which the occurrence of nematodes was certified, was selected, and biophysical and spectral measurements of the leaves were made. Hyperspectral data were also used in a band simulation of the RapidEye sensor to identify the most sensitive spectral ranges for pathogen discrimination in coffee plants. These bands, plus a normalized difference vegetation index image, were used for a multispectral classification of healthy and nematode-infected areas. None of the biophysical parameters efficiently discriminated the leaves of healthy and infected plants, but the band simulation indicated that red, red edge, and near infrared spectral ranges were complementary to the discrimination of healthy coffee plants and the two levels of infection. The multispectral classification defined the spatial distribution of healthy, moderately infected, and severely infected coffee plants, with an overall accuracy of 78% and Kappa coefficient of 0.71. Consideringthe degree of uncertainty and high cost involved in conventional detection of soil parasites, thelevels of accuracy achieved were adequate.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the assessment of the concentration of water nutrients, such as Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus, and suspended sediments in the northern Arabian Sea using MODIS Aqua and Terra data. The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.

TI  - Long-term landscape impact of petroleum exploration, Melville Island, Canadian High Arctic
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial land use such as petroleum exploration and infrastructure development has important and lasting impacts on Arctic landscapes. Detailed, site-level investigations have noted impacts that include vehicle tracks, surface and vegetation alteration, soil compaction, and degradation of ice wedge features. We investigated the long-term impact of an extended period of hydrocarbon exploration on Melville Island in the Canadian High Arctic using available remotely sensed data supplemented with field observations over a similar to 370 km(2) area. Aerial photographs from 1959, 1972, and 1977 and recent satellite imagery (2011 and 2013) were used to determine the effects of industrial activity over periods corresponding to pre-activity, mid-activity, and post-activity. We show that vehicle tracks, site disturbance, and vegetative impacts are still evident after 40 years in this area. Permafrost has degraded at sites with concentrated activity (drill sites, airstrips) and changes to vegetation are clearly discernable. The results demonstrate the utility of this approach for assessment of land use impacts on High Arctic landscapes and provide a means to determine locations for more detailed site-specific field studies. These results may contribute to strategies for environmental monitoring in remote areas where access is impractical or resource intensive.

TI  - Extracting smallholder cropped area in Tigray, Ethiopia with wall-to-wall sub-meter WorldView and moderate resolution Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high resolution (VHR) satellite data is experiencing rapid annual growth, producing petabytes of remotely sensed data per year. The WorldView constellation, operated by DigitalGlobe, images over 1.2 billion km(2) annually at <2 m spatial resolution. Due to computation, data cost, and methodological concerns, VHR satellite data has mainly been used to produce needed geospatial information for site-specific phenomena. This project produced a VHR spatiotemporally explicit wall-to-wall cropland area map for the rainfed residential cropland mosaic of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia, which is comprised mostly of smallholder farms. Moderate resolution satellite data do not have adequate spatial resolution to capture the total area occupied by smallholder farms, i.e., farms with agricultural fields of <= 45 x 45 m in dimension. In order to accurately map smallholder cropped area over a large region, hundreds of VHR images spanning two or more years are needed. Sub-meter WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 segmentation results were combined with median phenology amplitude from Landsat 8 data to map cropped area. Over 2700 VHR WorldView-1, -2 data were obtained from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) via the NextView license agreement and were processed from raw imagery to produce a smallholder crop map in similar to 1 week using a semi-automated method with the large computing capacity of the Advanced Data Analytics Platform. We estimated cropped area in Tigray to be 46% with a commission error of 5% +/- 10% and omission error of 15% +/- 12%. This methodology is extensible to other regions with similar vegetation texture and can easily be expanded to run on much larger regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The capabilities of several multispectral satellite data types to identify the status of peatlands affected by peat extraction and abandoned deposits are examined to assess potential fire dangers and rewetting effectiveness. The available level of detail of describing land/vegetation cover for monitoring abandoned peat extraction sites using Spot-5 HRG, Spot-6 HRG, and Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite images has been demonstrated using the example of peatlands in the Meschera National Park (Vladimir oblast). The results reflect the pros and cons of using different data types to analyze the status of abandoned peat-extraction lands for purposes of peatland inventory, land-cover monitoring, and the prioritization of sites subject to rewetting and mire restoration, as well as for an evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures.

TI  - Estimating Land Surface Temperature from Feng Yun-3C/MERSI Data Using a New Land Surface Emissivity Scheme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for a wide number of applications, including hydrology, meteorology and surface energy balance. In this study, we first proposed a new land surface emissivity (LSE) scheme, including a lookup table-based method to determine the vegetated surface emissivity and an empirical method to derive the bare soil emissivity from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) broadband emissivity (BBE) product. Then, the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data and the Feng Yun-3C/Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (FY-3C/MERSI) precipitable water vapor product were used to correct the atmospheric effects. After resolving the land surface emissivity and atmospheric effects, the LST was derived in a straightforward manner from the FY-3C/MERSI data by the radiative transfer equation algorithm and the generalized single-channel algorithm. The mean difference between the derived LSE and field-measured LSE over seven stations is approximately 0.002. Validation of the LST retrieved with the LSE determined by the new scheme can achieve an acceptable accuracy. The absolute biases are less than 1 K and the STDs (RMSEs) are less than 1.95 K (2.2 K) for both the 1000 m and 250 m spatial resolutions. The LST accuracy is superior to that retrieved with the LSE determined by the commonly used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method. Thus, the new emissivity scheme can be used to improve the accuracy of the LSE and further the LST for sensors with broad spectral ranges such as FY-3C/MERSI.

TI  - Role of Fracturing in the Organization of the Karst Features of Azrou Plateau (Middle Atlas, Morroco) Studied by Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst formation geometry can be controlled by fractures and faults, and by other lithologies. Here we show the organization of kastic collapse features related to structures and to extensive basaltic lava flows in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. A lineament map of major faults and fractures has been created for the Middle Atlas using Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images. This shows a dominant NE-SW regional direction and less prominent NNW-SSE and ENE-WSE directions. All these directions coincide with the alignments of karstic depressions that have formed in the Liassic limestones. The basaltic flows covering these formations on the Middle Atlas limestone plateau, have allowed the generation of cryptokarst, geometrically organized a long these major lineament directions. Karst landforms probabaly existed before the eruption of the lavas, but there were partly invaded by intrusions and volcanism. The extensive basaltic flows allowed for increased infiltration, and subsurface water flow, increasing the rate of kast formation after eruptions. Some basins show evidence of increased subsidence after lava emplacement (Aguelmam Sidi Ali Lake) and some maar-like craters also have subsided after eruption, by karts formation. We lay out the structural and lithological controls on Karstic formation in an intraplate volcanic field based on limestones and evaporites.

TI  - A New Fully Gap-Free Time Series of Land Surface Temperature from MODIS LST Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature time series with high spatial and temporal resolutions are important for several applications. The new MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) collection 6 provides numerous improvements compared to collection 5. However, being remotely sensed data in the thermal range, LST shows gaps in cloud-covered areas. We present a novel method to fully reconstruct MODIS daily LST products for central Europe at 1 km resolution and globally, at 3 arc-min. We combined temporal and spatial interpolation, using emissivity and elevation as covariates for the spatial interpolation. The reconstructed MODIS LST for central Europe was calibrated to air temperature data through linear models that yielded R-2 values around 0.8 and RMSE of 0.5 K. This new method proves to scale well for both local and global reconstruction. We show examples for the identification of extreme events to demonstrate the ability of these new LST products to capture and represent spatial and temporal details. A time series of global monthly average, minimum and maximum LST data and long-term averages is freely available for download.

TI  - Derivation and Error Analysis of the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid at 2 arc min Resolution Version 3 (EMAG2v3)
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid at 2 arc min resolution version 3, EMAG2v3, combines marine and airborne trackline observations, satellite data, and magnetic observatory data to map the location, intensity, and extent of lithospheric magnetic anomalies. EMAG2v3 includes over 50 million new data points added to NCEI's Geophysical Database System (GEODAS) in recent years. The new grid relies only on observed data, and does not utilize a priori geologic structure or ocean-age information. Comparing this grid to other global magnetic anomaly compilations (e.g., EMAG2 and WDMAM), we can see that the inclusion of a priori ocean-age patterns forces an artificial linear pattern to the grid; the data-only approach allows for greater complexity in representing the evolution along oceanic spreading ridges and continental margins. EMAG2v3 also makes use of the satellite-derived lithospheric field model MF7 in order to accurately represent anomalies with wavelengths greater than 300 km and to create smooth grid merging boundaries. The heterogeneous distribution of errors in the observations used in compiling the EMAG2v3 was explored, and is reported in the final distributed grid. This grid is delivered at both 4 km continuous altitude above WGS84, as well as at sea level for all oceanic and coastal regions.

TI  - Landscape degradation at different spatial scales caused by aridification
T2  - MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape responses to degradation caused by aridification bring the landscape system into a new equilibrium state. The system transformation may entail irreversible changes to its constituting parameters. This paper analyses the impact of aridification on landscape degradation processes in the sand-covered landscapes of the Hungarian Danube-Tisza Interfluve region at the regional, landscape, and local site scales. Changes in groundwater level (well data), lake surface area (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) and vegetation cover (Enhanced Vegetation Index) were analysed over time periods of 12-60 years. Significant regional variation in decreasing groundwater levels is observed and limits the regional applicability of this indicator. Applying the lake surface area parameter from remote sensing data demonstrated greater utility, identifying several local lakes in the landscapes which have dried out. Analysis of the vegetation response indicated minor changes over the 2000-2014 time period and did not indicate a landscape system change. Landscape degradation as a result of changes in groundwater, vegetation, land cover and land use is clearly identified exclusively in local lake areas, but at the landscape scale, changes in the water balance are found in phases of system stability and transformation. Thresholds are identified to support policy and management towards landscape degradation neutrality.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th Symposium on Radiocarbon and Archaeology
CL  - Edinburgh, SCOTLAND
AB  - An accurate radiocarbon (C-14) dating of mortars requires adjusting the sample preparation procedure to each specific mortar composition. In order to follow the influence of mortar components and the preparation procedure on dating results, a mortar intercomparison study (MODIS) was undertaken by 10 organizations (institutes and laboratories) in the analyses of four different types of mortars (see in this issue Hajdas et al. 2017 and Hayen et al. 2017). This paper presents the preparation protocol DoM v.1 applied by the Pozna team, together with dating results on a set of mortar samples used for the of intercomparison. This procedure involved petrographic observations, SEM-EDS analyses, different mechanical-chemical preparation, a test of leaching reaction for available fractions, and finally C-14 dating of chosen samples. The applied preparation allows one to obtain dry-sieved grain fractions and different fractions from suspension: grain fractions from suspension collected in different times of leaching, repeated suspension (different portions), as well as suspension collected at different times of sedimentation. The obtained results show the great importance of good sampling and the influence of sample preparation on C-14 dating results.

TI  - Recent forest cover changes (2002-2015) in the Southern Carpathians: A case study of the Iezer Mountains, Romania
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores the dynamics of the forest cover change in the lezer Mountains, part of Southern Carpathians, in the context of the forest ownership recovery and deforestation processes, combined with the effects of biotic and abiotic disturbances. The aim of the study is to map and evaluate the typology and the spatial extension of changes in the montane forest cover between 700 and 2462 m a.s.l., sampling all the representative Carpathian ecosystems, from the European beech zone up to the spruce-fir zone and the subalpine-alpine pastures. The methodology uses a change detection analysis of satellite imagery with Landsat ETM +/OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data. The workflow started with a complete calibration of multispectral data from 2002, before the massive forest restitution to private owners, after the Law 247/2005 empowerment, and 2015, the intensification of deforestation process. For the data classification, a Maximum Likelihood supervised classification algorithm was utilized. The forest change map was developed after combining the classifications in a unitary formula using image difference. The principal outcome of the research identifies the type of forest cover change using a quantitative formula. This information can be integrated in the future decision-making strategies for forest stand management and sustainable development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The differentiated Bushveld complex is studied by remote-space and gravimagnetic methods. The syncline of Western Bushveld is recognized in the southwestern part of the complex, which is characterized by a radial and ring structure of the higher order. The structures, which control the localization of Pt mineralization, are revealed and the possible use of the Landsat 7 ETM+ multizonal space survey is shown for recognizing the rocks of the Basal, Critical, Main, and Upper zones of the norite complex of Western Bushveld.

TI  - Improving Mean Minimum and Maximum Month-to-Month Air Temperature Surfaces Using Satellite-Derived Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Month-to-month air temperature (T-air) surfaces are increasingly demanded to feed quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology or climate change studies. Geostatistical interpolation techniques provide such continuous and objective surfaces of climate variables, while the use of remote sensing data may improve the estimates, especially when temporal resolution is detailed enough. The main goal of this study is to propose an empirical methodology for improving the month-to-month T-air mapping (minimum and maximum) using satellite land surface temperatures (LST) besides of meteorological data and geographic information. The methodology consists on multiple regression analysis combined with the spatial interpolation of residual errors using the inverse distance weighting. A leave-one-out cross-validation procedure has been included in order to compare predicted with observed values. Different operational daytime and nighttime LST products corresponding to the four months more characteristic of the seasonal dynamics of a Mediterranean climate have been considered for a thirteen-year period. The results can be considered operational given the feasibility of the models employed (linear dependence on predictors that are nowadays easily available), the robustness of the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure and the improvement in accuracy achieved when compared to classical T-air modeling results. Unlike what is considered by most studies, it is shown that nighttime LST provides a good proxy not only for minimum T-air, but also for maximum T-air. The improvement achieved by the inclusion of remote sensing LST products was higher for minimum T-air (up to 0.35 K on December), especially over forests and rugged lands. Results are really encouraging, as there are generally few meteorological stations in zones with these characteristics, clearly showing the usefulness of remote sensing to improve information about areas that are difficult to access or simply with a poor availability of conventional meteorological data.

TI  - Simple Approaches to Oil Spill Detection Using Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP)-Ocean Application Tools and Texture Analysis: A Comparative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective and efficient monitoring of oil spills that originate from ships, offshore platforms and any accidents are of immense importance from the viewpoint of public safety and environmental protection. Detection of spilled oil is also essential to estimate the potential spread and drift from the source to the nearby coastal areas. In this regard, utilization of SAR data for the detection and monitoring of oil spills has received considerable attention in recent times, due to their wide area coverage, day-night and all-weather capabilities. In this paper, two oil spills incidents along the coast of Mumbai, India are investigated; (1) The 2010 oil spill that occurred after the MV MSC Chitra and MV Khalijia-3 collided and (2) the oil spill caused due to sinking of MV RAK carrier in 2011. Two simple and relatively quick approaches for oil spill detection have been applied to VV polarized Radarsat-2 imagery of the incidents and a comparison is made of the results obtained. The first approach utilizes the oil spill detection tool of Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the second explores texture analysis using Grey Level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The results of the study show that texture analysis proves to be an efficient method for oil spill detection as compared to the SNAP oil spill detection tool. Nevertheless, both the proposed methodologies are useful for detection of oil spills and for subsequent utilization of the results, timely and cost effectively, for the calibration and validation of numerical models that predict oil spill dispersion trajectories.

TI  - Indian Remote Sensing Sensor System: Current and Future Perspective
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Over last four decades, a vibrant Remote Sensing programme has seen the development of space-based and airborne remote sensing sensor systems for various science and application studies. The Indian Space Programme, is applications driven with major objective towards national development. A series of earth observation systems have been launched in both polar and geo synchronous orbits starting from Bhaskara, the first experimental Earth Observation satellite in 1979 to Cartosat-2S successfully launched in 2017. A large number of active and passive sensors are observing in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing valuable data at different spatial resolutions for land ocean and atmospheric applications, as per application requirements. Satellite Observations during natural and human-induced hazards have become crucial for protecting the global environment, reducing disaster losses, and achieving sustainable development. Today, India has the world's largest constellation of remote sensing satellites in operation which is being extensively used for resource management and integrated planning for national development. The paper discusses the evolution and functioning of both Optical and Microwave Earth Observations Remote Sensing Sensors developed in India.

TI  - Inspection of Perirectal Lymph Nodes by One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification Predicts Lateral Lymph Node Metastasis in Advanced Rectal Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) is performed for advanced rectal cancers in Japan; however, it can cause sexual and urinary dysfunction. The incidence of lateral LN metastasis is estimated at 7-13.9%; therefore, excessive rectal surgery with LLND should be avoided, especially for prophylactic purposes. To identify the patients who require LLND, we examined metastases in perirectal LNs by using a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay to predict lateral LN metastases.Twenty-five patients who underwent surgery with bilateral LN dissection due to T3-T4 rectal cancers were prospectively included in this study. Twenty-two patients (88.0%) received preoperative chemotherapy. Among 1052 LNs from 25 patients (median 40 per case), 135 perirectal LNs (median 6 per patient) were divided into three pieces and analyzed by OSNA, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA, and pathological examination after surgery. These results were compared with the pathological diagnosis of lateral LNs.Lateral LN metastases were present in 4 of 25 patients (16.0%). All of these patients were positive by OSNA for perirectal LN metastases. The OSNA assay had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value of 57%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% for predicting lateral LN metastases.The findings from this prospective study suggest that the OSNA assay of perirectal LNs may be useful for determining when LLND is necessary because of its high NPV, even in patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy.

TI  - Environmental Screening of <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, <i>Mycobacterium</i> spp., and <i>Pseudocapillaria tomentosa</i> in Zebrafish Systems
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Health monitoring systems are developed and used in zebrafish research facilities because pathogens of Danio rerio such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Mycobacterium spp., and Pseudocapillaria tomentosa have the potential to impair animal welfare and research. The fish are typically analyzed post mortem to detect microbes. The use of sentinels is a suggested way to improve the sensitivity of the surveillance and to reduce the number of animals to sample. The setting of a pre-filtration sentinel tank out of a recirculating system is described. The technique is developed to prevent water pollution and to represent the fish population by a careful selection of age, gender, and strains. In order to use the minimum number of animals, techniques to screen the environment are also detailed. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on surface sump swabs is used to significantly improve the detection of some prevalent and pathogenic mycobacterial species such as Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium haemophilum, and Mycobacterium chelonae. Another environmental method consists of processing the sludge at the bottom of a holding tank or sump to look for P. tomentosa eggs. This is a cheap and fast technique that can be applied in quarantine where a breeding device is submerged into the holding tank of imported animals. Finally, PCR is applied to the sludge sample and A. hydrophila is detected at the sump's bottom and surface. Generally, these environmental screening techniques applied to these specific pathogens have led to an increased sensitivity compared to the testing of pre-filtration sentinels.

TI  - Evaluating the Quality of Rural Intensive Case Management Services using Administrative Data: an Exploratory Study
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) for people with severe mental illness is an effective approach that is increasingly implemented in rural areas. Low-cost methods of evaluating fidelity to program models are needed to assure services are delivered as intended. In 2007, the Veterans Health Administration implemented an ACT-like Mental Health Intensive Case Management (ACT/ICM) program for SMI veterans in rural areas. This study demonstrates the use of administrative data, reflecting patient characteristics and intensity of service delivery, to characterize services delivered by these programs, to compare them to general mental health programs at the same VA medical centers, and to each other. A total of 298,509 veterans received mental health services at VA medical centers that also operated a rural ACT/ICM program in FY 2012. Altogether 854 (0.29%) received ACT/ICM services for 1 year or more (long term participants) and 259 (.09%) received them for less than 1 year (new entrants). Logistic regression showed ACT/ICM patients were distinguished by diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression; larger numbers of psychiatric or substance abuse visits; and use of 3 or more classes of psychotropic medication. The model had a high c statistic of 0.91. Propensity scores allowed clear identification of programs most and least conforming to the profile of a "typical" rural ACT/ICM program. Low cost administrative data can be used to identify programs successfully conforming to an empirically derived rural model of ACT/ICM. Further validation of this approach is needed.

TI  - Impact of sea level rise and coastal slope on shoreline change along the Indian coast
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Densely populated coastal zones of India are highly exposed to natural environment. These are impacted by episodic natural events, continuous coastal process, gradually rising sea levels and coexisting human interventions. The present study is an attempt to assess the implication of the sea level rise and coastal slope in the coastal erosion for entire mainland of India. In this regard, two methods were employed to estimate the shoreline change rate (SCR): (1) satellite-derived SCR using the Landsat TM and ETM+ acquired during 1989-2001 and (2) SCR derived by Bruun Rule using the parameters coastal slope and sea level trend derived from satellite altimetry. Satellite-derived SCR has been compared with the shoreline change estimated based on Bruun Rule, revealing a better agreement with each other in terms of trend. Peaks of shoreline retreat calculated using Bruun model and satellite-observed SCR offset by 25-50 km. Offset in these peaks was observed due to net drift towards north in the east coast and south in the west coast of India, revealing the applicability of the Bruun Rule along the Indian coast. The present study demonstrates that coastal slope is an additional parameter responsible for the movement of shoreline along with sea level change. The results of satellite-derived SCR reveal the highest percentage of erosion along West Bengal coast with 70% followed by Kerala (65%), Gujarat (60%) and Odisha (50%). The coastlines of remaining states recorded less than 50% of coasts under erosion. Results of this study are proving critical inputs for the coastal management.

TI  - Landscape properties affect biodiversity response to retention approaches in forestry
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Retention forestry, in which trees and tree patches are set aside at harvest to promote biodiversity, has been proven to have positive effects on biodiversity at the stand-level across different taxa. However, the effectiveness of retention approaches with regard to landscape composition remains unexplored.2. We linked the effect sizes from two meta-analyses (31 case studies and 1050 comparisons from boreal and temperate regions), which quantified the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation as a result of retention practices, with the stand property of retention level (the percentage of trees retained after logging) and with Landsat-retrieved landscape data on forest cover and spatial configurations at three spatial scales (1, 3, and 5 km radii).3. We found that, in addition to the fundamental importance of tree retention as a local-scale implementation for conservation, landscape properties were important in models to predict biodiversity responses. The effect sizes for species richness decreased with increasing patch contiguity within the landscapes at all spatial scales. Similar results were observed for abundance responses at the largest spatial scale. These results suggest that biodiversity responses to tree retention may be weaker in less fragmented landscapes, which is in agreement with theoretical and empirical findings from agricultural landscapes (the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis').4. The benefits of retention levels within a stand (percentage of trees retained) varied amongst species with different habitat requirements (forest-dependent, open habitat, and generalist species). Whilst this stand-level property was often an important determinant of biodiversity responses, models that included landscape properties as explanatory variables always performed better than those that were only based on the retention levels for all species groups. Thus, within-stand habitat conditions and landscape configurations likely have synergetic influences on biodiversity responses.5. Synthesis and applications. In addition to the importance of stand-level properties, such as the action of retention harvesting itself and the number of trees retained, conditions in the surrounding landscape can simultaneously affect biodiversity in stands that are managed under retention forestry. Our study suggests that retention patches are particularly important in moderately fragmented landscapes. Retention practices could be less important in previously unlogged and less fragmented landscapes, where setting aside large reserves is a conservation priority. For highly fragmented landscapes, different actions of forest restoration, which are not limited to set-aside actions during logging, would be important. Our study emphasizes that carefully planned conservation schemes with a large-scale perspective, as well as local-scale actions, such as retention forestry, are critical for effective forest management and conservation planning.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake is one of the most complex earthquakes recorded by modern observation techniques. A comprehensive understanding of this event has not yet been achieved, despite the analysis of observed data. To advance clarification of the mechanism of the earthquake, we revealed detailed surface displacement caused by the earthquake using Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and constructed fault models comprising rectangular planes with a uniform slip. Remarkably large and intricate surface displacements were detected in two distinct areas: (1) a southwestern part around the Hundalee fault and The Humps fault zone, and (2) a northeastern part around the Kekerengu fault and the little recognized Papatea fault. A gap where the displacement is relatively small exists between the two major zones of faulting. In the southwestern part, extremely complicated displacements are disclosed in detail and have been modeled as an intricate set of six faults that include previously unknown structures. In the northeastern part, the largest displacement of similar to 9 m was detected along the Kekerengu and Papatea faults. The modeled fault plane along the Kekerengu fault shows a large reverse and dextral slip and possibly released the largest seismic moment of all modeled fault segments. The constructed fault model also explains far-field displacement, indicating that the dominant slip direction was right lateral, consistent with the strain field in this region. The calculated change of Coulomb failure stress (Delta CFS) suggests that the static stress changes by the southwestern fault segments may have contributed to triggering the northeastern fault segments.

TI  - Combined Co- and Cross-Polarized SAR Measurements Under Extreme Wind Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During summer 2016, the European Space Agency (ESA) set up the Satellite Hurricane Observations Campaign, a campaign dedicated to hurricane observations with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in both vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations acquired in wide swath modes. Among the 70 Sentinel-1 passes scheduled by the ESA mission planning team, more than 20 observations over hurricane eyes were acquired and tropical cyclones were captured at different development stages. This enables us to detail the sensitivity difference of VH and VV normalized radar cross section (NRCS) to the response of intense ocean surface winds. As found, the sensitivity of the VH-NRCS computed at 3-km resolution is reported to be more than 3.5 times larger than in VV. Taking opportunity of SAR high resolution, we also show that the decrease in resolution (up to 25 km) does not dramatically change the sensitivity difference between VV and VH polarizations. For wind speeds larger than 25 m/s, a new geophysical model function (MS1A) to interpret cross-polarized signal is proposed. Both channels are then combined to get ocean surface wind vectors. SAR winds are further compared at 40-km resolution against L-band soil moisture active and passive mission (SMAP) radiometer winds with co-locations less than 30 min. Overall excellent consistency is found between SMAP and this new SAR winds. This paper opens perspectives for MetOp-SG SCA, the next-generation C-band scatterometer with co-and cross-polarization capability.

TI  - An Adjoint-Based Forecast Impact from Assimilating MISR Winds into the GEOS-5 Data Assimilation and Forecasting System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the benefit of assimilating cloud motion vector (CMV) wind observations obtained from the Multiangle Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MISR) within a Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), configuration of the Goddard Earth Observing System-5 (GEOS-5) model data assimilation system (DAS). Available in near-real time (NRT) and with a record dating back to 1999, MISR CMVs boast pole-to-pole coverage and geometric height assignment that is complementary to the suite of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) included in the MERRA-2 standard. Experiments spanning September-November of 2014 and March-May of 2015 estimated relative MISR CMV impact on the 24-h forecast error reduction with an adjoint-based forecast sensitivity method. MISR CMV were more consistently beneficial and provided twice as large a mean forecast benefit when larger uncertainties were assigned to the less accurate component of the CMV oriented along the MISR satellite ground track, as opposed to when equal uncertainties were assigned to the eastward and northward components as in previous studies. Assimilating only the cross-track component provided 60% of the benefit of both components. When optimally assimilated, MISR CMV proved broadly beneficial throughout the Earth, with the greatest benefit evident at high latitudes where there is a confluence of more frequent CMV coverage and gaps in coverage from other MERRA-2 wind observations. Globally, MISR represented 1.6% of the total forecast benefit, whereas regionally that percentage was as large as 3.7%.

TI  - Seasonal Snow Cover Change Detection Over the Indian Himalayas Using Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change over the Himalayan terrain in the form of seasonal snow precipitation is an inevitable phenomenon. Mapping of snow cover in this region is a critical task, since meltwater emanating from the snowfields and glaciers serves as a source to several major Asian river systems. In this regard, a snow cover mapping technique is proposed in this letter by exploiting the ratio of the seasonal variation of copolarized (hh-vv) correlation coefficient and the total scattering power. This ratio provides a very efficient index for snow characterization. The difference image is obtained by temporal (winter-summer) ratioing of this index. The snow cover map is obtained by thresholding the difference image using the standard method of Otsu. The proposed algorithm is validated using the temporal RADARSAT-2 (FQ-28) C-band full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data sets acquired over the Manali-Dhundi region of Himachal Pradesh, India. The results are explicitly validated with in situ observatory measurements and compared with the normalized difference snow index-based snow cover maps derived from the LANDSAT-8 optical satellite images.

TI  - Time-space variations in infrasound sources related to environmental dynamics around Lutzow-Holm Bay, east Antarctica
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Characteristic features of infrasound waves observed in the Antarctic reflect the physical interaction between the surface environment along the continental margin and the surrounding Southern Ocean. The temporal-spatial variability of the source locations for infrasound excitation during the eight-month period between January and August 2015 was investigated using recordings made by two infrasound arrays deployed along a section of the coast of Lutzow-Holm Bay (LHB), Antarctica. The infrasound arrays clearly detected temporal variations in frequency content and propagation direction during this period. A number of infrasound sources were identified, many located north of the arrays. Many of the events had a predominant frequency content of a few Hz, higher than microbaroms from the ocean. A comparison of the results with MODIS satellite images indicated that these infrasound sources were ice-quakes associated with the calving of glaciers, the breaking off of sea ice, and collisions between this sea ice and icebergs around the LHB. Continuous measurements of infrasound in the Antarctic may serve as a proxy for monitoring the regional surface environment in terms of climate change at high southern latitudes.

TI  - Local Immunotherapy of Cancer: Innovative Approaches to Harnessing Tumor-Specific Immune Responses
T2  - JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
M3  - Review
AB  - Modern cancer immunotherapies represent a major shift in paradigm with respect to how we understand innate and adaptive responses to malignancy. Successful tumors co-opt normal immunosurveillance mechanisms by potent interactions between the tumor and local draining lymph nodes. Tumor cells mediate a complex and dynamic immunoediting procedure that results in increased vascular efflux into the draining lymphatics, an immunosuppressive microenvironment rich in regulatory T-lymphocytes, dysfunctional antigen presentation, and downregulation of normal effector lymphocyte responses. Our current approach to reversing this process for antitumor effect involves mainly systemic administration of immunotherapeutic agents, many of which have become standard of care in the management of a variety of cancers. Despite this, we are still learning how best to administer these drugs alone and in combination to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse events. Increasing evidence suggests that comparable efficacy may be achieved by local administration of immunotherapies in the tumor or tumor-draining lymph nodes with substantially lower doses and better tolerability, even with combination therapy. Herein, we review the literature on intratumoral and intranodal immunotherapies in preclinical models and early-phase studies, with particular emphasis on approaches potentially suitable for translation to larger-scale clinical trials.

TI  - Development of an Adaptive Approach for Precision Agriculture Monitoring with Drone and Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For better agricultural productivity and food management, there is an urgent need for precision agriculture monitoring at larger scales. In recent years, drones have been employed for precision agriculture monitoring at smaller scales, and for past few decades, satellite data are being used for land cover classification and agriculture monitoring at larger scales. The monitoring of agriculture precisely over a large scale is a challenging task. In this paper, an approach has been proposed for precision agriculture monitoring, i.e., the classification of sparse and dense fields, which is carried out using freely available satellite data (Landsat 8) along with drone data. Repeated usage of drone has to be minimized and hence an adaptive classification approach is developed, which works with image statistics of the selected region. The proposed approach is successfully tested and validated on different spatial and temporal Landsat 8 data.

T2  - Data in Brief
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Pulicat Lake is one of the major wetlands in India. It is the second largest brackish water lagoon in India next to Chilika Lake in Orissa state. Pulicat Lake sits beside the Bay of Bengal so, the study on the mouth is vital. The investigations were carried out by using multi temporal satellite imageries of IRS P6, LISS III data for four years viz., 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Subsequent changes in the width of the lake at the southern side were measured. It is found that the lake mouth is not static but dynamic predominantly fluctuating year by year. Obviously, this poses threat to the lake biodiversity. Hence, it is high time to mitigate, manage, monitor and protect the existing width of the sea mouth to keep the lake biological, ecological, economically active. This paper noticed a considerable change in the mouth of the lake studied using satellite imageries and socio-economic settings (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Optical Detection of <i>Diatom</i> Bloom in the Coastal Waters of Bay of Bengal Using Oceansat-2 OCM
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton blooms are the indicators of marine ecosystem health status and their monitoring is a key component in the effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. It remained as a challenge in the coastal waters due to the presence of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter which interferes with the phytoplankton signal. Several methods and techniques were developed to detect, map and monitor the phytoplankton blooms in the coastal waters using in situ and satellite data. To address this issue ISRO took an initiative to monitor and identify the phytoplankton blooms in the North Indian Ocean to be specific in the coastal waters. As part of this program, the blooms are monitored using Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) data all along the East coast of India. This paper presents a case study in the bloom dominated coastal waters along Off Godavari delta covering Kakinada and Yanam in the East coast of India. In-situ measurements collected onboard during a bloom event are optical parameters like Remote Sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), Water leaving radiance L-w(lambda) from the Hyperpro-II under water radiometer, absorption due to phytoplankton, a(ph)(lambda), from the spectrophotometer, biological parameters of phytoplankton cell counts and HPLC pigments. From the in situ biological measurements, it is confirmed that the bloom was dominated by with diatom species of Skeletonema costatum with a high concentration of Fucoxanthin as the biomarker for diatoms from the HPLC pigment analysis. Based on these results obtained, optical detection of the bloom species using spectral discrimination of R-rs for different cell enumerations was considered and further spectral derivative analysis (first to fifth order) has been carried out to identify the peaks to detect the bloom forming species. The criteria considered as the minima in the second order derivative (d lambda R-2(rs)) for identifying the peak to discriminate the spectra of the bloom forming species. From the analysis, a unique peak at 483 nm which is identified in particular to S. costatum species in the coastal waters which are identified from the chlorophyll product derived from OCM-2. From the results observed, it can ensure that diatom blooms can be detected from OCM-2 using 490 nm spectral band.

TI  - Natural Reassortants of Potentially Zoonotic Avian Influenza Viruses H5N1 and H9N2 from Egypt Display Distinct Pathogenic Phenotypes in Experimentally Infected Chickens and Ferrets
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cocirculation of zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 and avian influenza virus (AIV) of subtype H9N2 among poultry in Egypt for at least 6 years should render that country a hypothetical hot spot for the emergence of reassortant, phenotypically altered viruses, yet no reassortants have been detected in Egypt. The present investigations proved that reassortants of the Egyptian H5N1 clade 2.2.1.2 virus and H9N2 virus of the G1-B lineage can be generated by coamplification in embryonated chicken eggs. Reassortants were restricted to the H5N1 subtype and acquired between two and all six of the internal segments of the H9N2 virus. Five selected plaque-purified reassortant clones expressed a broad phenotypic spectrum both in vitro and in vivo. Two groups of reassortants were characterized to have retarded growth characteristics in vitro compared to the H5N1 parent virus. One clone provoked reduced mortality in inoculated chickens, although the characteristics of a highly pathogenic phenotype were retained. Enhanced zoonotic properties were not predicted for any of these clones, and this prediction was confirmed by ferret inoculation experiments: neither the H5N1 parent virus nor two selected clones induced severe clinical symptoms or were transmitted to sentinel ferrets by contact. While the emergence of reassortants of Egyptian HPAIV of subtype H5N1 with internal gene segments of cocirculating H9N2 viruses is possible in principle, the spread of such viruses is expected to be governed by their fitness to outcompete the parental viruses in the field. The eventual spread of attenuated phenotypes, however, would negatively impact syndrome surveillance on poultry farms and might foster enzootic virus circulation.IMPORTANCE Despite almost 6 years of the continuous cocirculation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and avian influenza virus H9N2 in poultry in Egypt, no reassortants of the two subtypes have been reported. Here, the principal compatibility of the two subtypes is shown by forcing the reassortment between copassaged H5N1 und H9N2 viruses in embryonated chicken eggs. The resulting reassortant viruses displayed a wide range of pathogenicity including attenuated phenotypes in chickens, but did not show enhanced zoonotic propensities in the ferret model.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Joint Conference on Science and Technology (IJCST)
CL  - Bali, INDONESIA
AB  - Observation of water quality in Madura's waters to maintain healthy and sustainable aquatic ecosystem require an effective technique. Considering the size of Madura's waters, adequate spatial and temporal accuracies, the usage of satellite image data is the right technique. One of the significant parameters of water quality is chlorophyll-a (beside TSS and CDOM), so that observation of the concentration of the parameter in water area is important. In this study, we used in situ data, i.e., concentrations of chlorophyll-a and spectra (resampled base on Landsat 8 channel) recorded in Madura's waters to build a model algorithm, which connects reflectance and chlorophyll-a. Next, atmospherically corrected reflectance of Landsat 8 data was used to map the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a using the model algorithm which had been formulated. The research result shows that the average concentration of chlorophyll-a in satellite images and in situ is 1,197-1,171, so it is concluded that the waters of Madura Strait has high chlorophyll-a content because it is in the range of 1-1,5 mg/L.

TI  - An Autocorrelation-Based Radio Frequency Interference Detection and Removal Method in Azimuth-Frequency Domain for SAR Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the authors propose a novel radio frequency interference (RFI) detection and removal method for a synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The proposed method is exclusively sensitive to a pulse-like signal that is temporally transmitted in wide bandwidth. The bandwidth of the RFI is supposed to be similar or wider than the bandwidth of the SAR, while traditional RFI detectors assume that it is narrower and thus it can be removed in the range-frequency and azimuth-time domain using a bandpass filter. On the other hand, the proposed method employs a local autocorrelation-based detection scheme in the range-time and azimuth-frequency domain. The proposed method assumes the existence of another type of RFI, namely, intermittently transmitted wideband (ITWB) RFI. Once ITWB RFI superimposes on the SAR image, its short-pulse duration/wide bandwidth hinders the detection in the range-frequency and azimuth-time domain. Conversely, in the range-time and azimuth-frequency domain, ITWB RFI can be detected easily because its Doppler frequency profile does not fit with backscattered signals from the ground. In this paper, a basic methodology and the experimental results are presented.

TI  - Reconstruction of River Boundaries at Sub-Pixel Resolution: Estimation and Spatial Allocation of Water Fractions
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Boundary pixels of rivers are subject to a spectral mixture that limits the accuracy of river areas extraction using conventional hard classifiers. To address this problem, unmixing and super-resolution mapping (SRM) are conducted in two steps, respectively, for estimation and then spatial allocation of water fractions within the mixed pixels. Optimal band analysis for the normalized difference water index (OBA-NDWI) is proposed for identifying the pair of bands for which the NDWI values yield the highest correlation with water fractions. The OBA-NDWI then incorporates the optimal NDWI as predictor of water fractions through a regression model. Water fractions obtained from the OBA-NDWI method are benchmarked against the results of simplex projection unmixing (SPU) algorithm. The pixel swapping (PS) algorithm and interpolation-based algorithms are also applied on water fractions for SRM. In addition, a simple modified binary PS (MBPS) algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational time of the original PS method. Water fractions obtained from the proposed OBA-NDWI method are demonstrated to be in good agreement with those of SPU algorithm (R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 7% for eight-band WorldView-3 (WV-3) image and R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 9% for GeoEye image). The spectral bands of WV-3 provide a wealth of choices through the proposed OBA-NDWI to estimate water fractions. The interpolation-based and MBPS methods lead to sub-pixel maps comparable with those obtained using the PS algorithm, while they are computationally more effective. SRM algorithms improve user/producer accuracies of river areas by about 10% with respect to conventional hard classification.

TI  - Long-Term Follow-Up of Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients Evaluated via Sentinel Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. SNB after NAC was as accurate as SNB without NAC. Axillary recurrence-free survival rates were excellent regardless of whether NAC was performed before SNB.Background: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is used to accurately assess axillary lymph node status in patients with node-negative breast cancer. However, its use after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is controversial. We retrospectively assessed the usefulness of SNB after NAC by comparing axillary recurrence rates and other parameters in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SNB after NAC or without NAC. Patients and Methods: At our hospital, 1179 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer underwent SNB from April 2007 to December 2013. The clinicopathological and survival data of patients who underwent SNB after NAC (the NAC group) and those who underwent SNB without NAC (the control group) were compared. Patients with a metastatic sentinel node underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Results: The number of patients in the NAC and control groups was 183 (15.5%) and 996 (84.5%), respectively. At diagnosis, tumors were significantly larger in the NAC group (P < .0001). Sentinel nodes were identified in almost all patients in both groups (99.5% in the NAC group vs. 99.8% in the control group). They were nonmetastatic in 147 (80.8%) patients in the NAC group and 849 (85.5%) patients in the control group. At the median follow-up time of 51.1 months, 6 patients (0.6%) in the control group had axillary lymph node recurrence compared with no patients in the NAC group. Conclusion: SNB after NAC was as accurate as SNB without NAC in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. Axillary recurrence-free survival rates were excellent regardless of whether NAC was performed before SNB. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Hydrological model parameterization using NDVI values to account for the effects of land cover change on the rainfall-runoff response
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Classic rainfall-runoff models usually use historical data to estimate model parameters and mean values of parameters are considered for predictions. However, due to climate changes and human effects, model parameters change temporally. To overcome this problem, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from remotely sensed data was used in this study to investigate the effect of land cover variations on hydrological response of watersheds using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model. The study area consists of two sub-watersheds (Hervi and Lighvan) with varied land cover conditions. Obtained results show that the one-parameter model generates runoff forecasts with acceptable level of the considered criteria. Remote sensing data were employed to relate land cover properties of the watershed to the model parameter. While a power form of the regression equation could be best fitted to the parameter values using available images of Hervi sub-watershed, for the Lighvan sub-watershed the fitted equation shows somewhat lower correlation due to higher fluctuations of the model parameter. The average values of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion of the model were obtained as 0.87 and 0.55, respectively, for Hervi and Lighvan sub-watersheds. Applying this methodology, the model's parameters might be determined using temporal NDVI values.

TI  - Applicability of remote sensing oceanographic data in the detection of potential fishing grounds of <i>Rastrelliger kanagurta</i> in the archipelagic waters of Spermonde, Indonesia
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rastrelliger kanagurta is among the pelagic fish of commercial value caught in the archipelagic waters of Spermonde, Indonesia. The dynamic oceanographic pattern in this area influences the distribution of this pelagic fish. Understanding the relationship between the distribution of fish and environmental factors is important in exploring fisheries resources. This study used Rastrelliger kanagurta fishing-catch data during the high-catch season in the second quarter, which was from April to June (2008 and 2009), and satellite data of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS-Aqua. The study aimed to identify the relationship between fish distribution with chl-a and SST constructed using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), detect the potential fishing grounds, and determine the impact of climate change on fish distribution based on temperature projection of IPCC-AR5-RCPs. The distribution of Rastrelliger kanagurta was significantly associated (p < 0.0001) with the preferred range of chl-a at 0.30-0.40 mg/m(3) and SST at 30.00-31.00 degrees C. The potential fishing ground maps showed that areas with high potential catch were located near the coast to offshore (3-20 M), with acceptable level of map accuracy at 83.34%; with kappa value at 0.70. Increased temperature of 1.80 degrees C resulted in movement of potential fishing grounds to the southern part of Makassar Straits leading to the archipelagic waters of Spermonde. In contrast, increased temperature of 2.60 degrees C and 3.30 degrees C resulted in lesser potential fishing grounds area which shifted further to the south. The results of this study indicated applicability of remote sensing in contributing to optimal fishing effort and decision making for long-term management of Rastrelliger kanagurta resources.

TI  - Biological characterization of African swine fever virus genotype II strains from north-eastern Estonia in European wild boar
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its impact on animal health and pig industry, African swine fever (ASF) is regarded as one of the most important viral diseases of pigs. Following the ongoing epidemic in the Transcaucasian countries and the Russian Federation, African swine fever virus was introduced into the Estonian wild boar population in 2014. Epidemiological investigations suggested two different introductions into the southern and the north-eastern part of Estonia. Interestingly, outbreak characteristics varied considerably between the affected regions. While high mortality and mainly virus-positive animals were observed in the southern region, mortality was low in the north-eastern area. In the latter, clinically healthy, antibody-positive animals were found in the hunting bag and detection of virus was rare. Two hypotheses could explain the different behaviour in the north-east: (i) the frequency of antibody detections combined with the low mortality is the tail of an older, so far undetected epidemic wave coming from the east, or (ii) the virus in this region is attenuated and leads to a less severe clinical outcome. To explore the possibility of virus attenuation, a re-isolated ASFV strain from the north-eastern Ida-Viru region was biologically characterized in European wild boar. Oronasal inoculation led to an acute and severe disease course in all animals with typical pathomorphological lesions. However, one animal recovered completely and was subsequently commingled with three sentinels of the same age class to assess disease transmission. By the end of the trial at 96days post-initial inoculation, all animals were completely healthy and neither virus nor viral genomes were detected in the sentinels or the survivor. The survivor, however, showed high antibody levels. In conclusion, the ASFV strain from north-eastern Estonia was still highly virulent but nevertheless, one animal recovered completely. Under the experimental conditions, no transmission occurred from the survivor to susceptible sentinel pigs.

TI  - On the Relationship Between Wind, SST, and the Thermocline in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter investigates the relationship between wind, sea surface temperature (SST), and thermocline in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR, 5 degrees S-10 degrees S, 50 degrees E-80 degrees E) using a combination of satellite data and a reanalysis version of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model from 1993 to 2012. The asymmetry of this relationship during positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events and the impacts on the SST-thermocline depth (represented by the 20 degrees C isotherm depth, D20) relationship-are examined. On interannual timescales, an asymmetric relation between SST and zonal wind stress causes a strengthening of easterlies that enhances anticyclonic wind stress curl and local Ekman downwelling, which in turn deepens the D20 and increases the heat content during positive IOD (PIOD) events. In contrast, during negative IOD (NIOD) events, the winds reverse to be westerlies and cause a three times greater impact on remotely generated upwelling Rossby waves. Subsequently, these asymmetric relations cause an asymmetric D20-SST feedback in the SCTR such that a shoaling D20 is similar to 2.5 times more effective at lowering SST during NIOD events than a deepening D20 is at raising the SST during PIOD events. The changes to D20 are observed to extend into the year following IOD events, persisting into the end of the year following a PIOD event (due to stronger asymmetric reinforcing effects of warm SST anomalies on zonal wind anomalies) but only to May-June of the year following NIOD events.

TI  - The Impact of Different Support Vectors on GOSAT-2 CAI-2 L2 Cloud Discrimination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite-2 (GOSAT-2) will be launched in fiscal year 2018. GOSAT-2 will be equipped with two sensors: the Thermal and Near-infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation (TANSO)-Fourier Transform Spectrometer 2 (FTS-2) and the TANSO-Cloud and Aerosol Imager 2 (CAI-2). CAI-2 is a push-broom imaging sensor that has forward- and backward-looking bands to observe the optical properties of aerosols and clouds and to monitor the status of urban air pollution and transboundary air pollution over oceans, such as PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter). CAI-2 has important applications for cloud discrimination in each direction. The Cloud and Aerosol Unbiased Decision Intellectual Algorithm (CLAUDIA1), which applies sequential threshold tests to features is used for GOSAT CAI L2 cloud flag processing. If CLAUDIA1 is used with CAI-2, it is necessary to optimize the thresholds in accordance with CAI-2. However, CLAUDIA3 with support vector machines (SVM), a supervised pattern recognition method, was developed, and then we applied CLAUDIA3 for GOSAT-2 CAI-2 L2 cloud discrimination processing. Thus, CLAUDIA3 can automatically find the optimized boundary between clear and cloudy areas. Improvements in CLAUDIA3 using CAI (CLAUDIA3-CAI) continue to be made. In this study, we examined the impact of various support vectors (SV) on GOSAT-2 CAI-2 L2 cloud discrimination by analyzing (1) the impact of the choice of different time periods for the training data and (2) the impact of different generation procedures for SV on the cloud discrimination efficiency. To generate SV for CLAUDIA3-CAI from MODIS data, there are two times at which features are extracted, corresponding to CAI bands. One procedure is equivalent to generating SV using CAI data. Another procedure generates SV for MODIS cloud discrimination at the beginning, and then extracts decision function, thresholds, and SV corresponding to CAI bands. Our results indicated the following. (1) For the period from November to May, it is more effective to use SV generated from training data from February while for the period from June to October it is more effective to use training data from August; (2) In the preparation of SV, features obtained using MODIS bands are more effective than those obtained using the corresponding GOSAT CAI bands to automatically extract cloud training samples.

TI  - Cornell Realism, Explanation, and Natural Properties
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The claim that ordinary ethical discourse is typically true and that ethical facts are typically knowable (ethical conservativism) seems in tension with the claim that ordinary ethical discourse is about features of reality friendly to a scientific worldview (ethical naturalism). Cornell Realism attempts to dispel this tension by claiming that ordinary ethical discourse is, in fact, discourse about the same kinds of things that scientific discourse is about: natural properties. We offer two novel arguments in reply. First, we identify a key assumption that we find unlikely to be true. Second, we identify two features of typical natural properties that ethical properties lack. We conclude that Cornell Realism falls short of dispelling the tension between ethical conservativism and ethical naturalism.

T2  - Actas dermo-sifiliograficas
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Locoregional lymph node ultrasound is not typically included in guidelines as part of the staging process prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The objective of the present study was to make a clinical and economic analysis of lymph node ultrasound prior to SLNB.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 384 patients with clinical stage I-II primary melanoma who underwent locorregional lymph node ultrasound (with or without ultrasound-guided biopsy) prior to SLNB between 2004 and 2015. We evaluated the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the strategy.RESULTS: Use of locorregional lymph node ultrasound avoided SLNB in 23 patients (6%). Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 46% and specificity of 76% for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes that were not clinically palpable. False negatives were significantly more common in patients aged over 60 years and in tumors with a thickness of less than 2mm. The staging process using SLNB and ultrasound with ultrasound-guided biopsy produced an increase of 16.30 in the unit price. Our cost-effectiveness analysis identified the staging protocol with ultrasound and SLNB as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio than the alternative, consisting of SLNB alone (8,095.24 vs. 28,605.00).CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound with ultrasound-guided biopsy for the diagnostic staging of melanoma prior to SLNB is a useful and cost-effective tool. This procedure does not substitute SLNB, though it does allow to avoid SLNB in a not insignificant proportion of patients.

TI  - Evolving waterlogged identification system to assess spatiotemporal impact of the new Suez Canal corridor, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was designed to assess how accurately waterlogged areas can be detected from medium-resolution satellite images. The objective of this paper is to propose an automated extraction system to identify and map waterlogged areas around new Suez Canal in Egypt. Three Landsat-8 imagery (2014-2015) and topographical maps (1:50,000) had been used along with field observations. The applicability of different satellite-derived indices, including normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), water ratio index (WRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and automated water extraction index (AWEI) were investigated for the identification of waterlogged areas from Landsat-8 data. The results indicated that the MNDWI and NDWI are good indices. Evolving waterlogged identification system (EWIS) was proposed as a simple automated method to identify and extract the waterlogged areas. It was found superior to other indices and hence it was used to model the spatiotemporal changes in the waterlogged areas around the new Suez Canal. The results also showed that the waterlogged areas have been increased (positive change, +1, 453 ha) and lands have been decreased (negative change, -1,449 ha). Three-thousand, four-hundred and sixty-three (3463 ha) Hectare were identified as waterlogged areas after excluding the other water sources in the period from 06/08/2014 to 05/05/2015. In order to determine the dominant topographic factors in the study area, high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was created. Out of five terrain analysis (elevation, contour, relief, slope and curvature), two factors (elevation and contour) were considered as important. Finally, to figure out the relevance of this technique toward mapping of the waterlogged areas, a correlation matrix had been prepared. The results were acceptable for an understanding of waterlogged areas, which are significantly correlated with topographic factors. Based on different maps, it was observed that the factors like relief, slope and curvature have a disproportionate relationship, while elevation and contour have direct proportion with the spatial distribution of waterlogged areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the increase of water and energy requirements in arid zones, this work combine the presence of the coastal stratocumulus as a potential water resource and the behavior of solar radiation as an energy source. The aim is to know the relationships between attenuation of irradiance by fog typology (orographic or advective) and the yields of associated fog water. September 2013 was analyzed using GOES satellite images, data from the Standard Fog Collector (SFC) and the radiometer located at the Atacama UC Station, Oasis de Niebla Alto Patache (20 degrees 49 'S - 70 degrees 09'O - 800 ma.s.l.). Results show complementarity between the daily cycles of these resources and their productive hours of water and energy (night and day) respectively. This research motivates subsequent studies on fog water and solar energy as complementary resources in line with implementing technologies for water treatment, management and distribution, as well as solar panel dust cleaning.

TI  - Soil loss estimation using RUSLE model, GIS and remote sensing techniques: A case study from the Dembecha Watershed, Northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil loss is a major cause of land degradation worldwide, especially in large areas of arid and semi-arid regions. With advent of new software and technologies such as remote sensing (RS) and GIS, there is a necessity to integrate them to achieve important information in a faster manner. The aims of present study were to evaluate soil erodibility (K-factor) using standard plots under natural rainfall and prediction of soil loss by integrating RUSLE, GIS and RS in Fars Iran. The RUSLE factors were evaluated as following: the R-factor was calculated using modified Fournier index; K-factor was measured in the field using erosion plots and estimated by the USLE equation; the C-factor map was created using the NDVI; the LS-factor map was generated from digital elevation model with 10 m resolution, and the P-factor map was assumed as 1. Spatial distribution of annual soil loss in the Simakan watershed was obtained by multiplying these factors in GIS. The average of the measured K was 0.014 th MJ(-1) mm(-1) and 2.08 times less than the average of the estimated K (0.030 th MJ(-1) mm(-1)). The performance of RUSLE was highly influenced by the K, because the annual soil loss predicted using estimated K (11.0 th(-1) ya(-1)) was about twice as much as the measured K (5.7 th(-1) ya(-1)). The spatial distribution of soil loss classes predicted was: 73.64% very low, 14.79% low, 10.19% moderate and 1.25% severe. Areas of severe soil loss are situated in the northern portion of the study area, which needs suitable conservation practices.

TI  - Progressive fragmentation and loss of natural forests habitat in one of the global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of the degree of forest fragmentation and landscape transformation is crucial for landscape sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Within the Chilean hotspot the Nahuelbuta Mountain can be found, which is considered as a high biodiversity value area under an intense human pressure. However, there is no information on the degree of transformation of the landscape and the conservation status of its natural forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the landscape and the spatiotemporal changes in native forests in Nahuelbuta. Through the use of Landsat imagery acquired for 1986 and 2011, land-cover and use maps were generated. Results revealed a loss of 33% of native forest in 25 years, mainly associated with the conversion to forest plantations. Changes in spatial patterns of land-cover and uses revealed a profound transformation of the study landscape and an advanced fragmentation of native forests. We discuss how these changes threaten the persistence of different endemic species at high risk of extinction. If the current trend of spatial pattern changes continues, it is probable that these species might face an increase in their extinction risk.

TI  - Lower Incidence of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia among Young Women with Human Papillomavirus Vaccination in Miyagi, Japan
T2  - TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese national immunization programme for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) started in 2010. Vaccination rates increased up to 70% in women in the 1996-1999 birth. However, the proactive recommendation for HPV vaccine was suspended in 2013, following repeated media reports of adverse events. Vaccination rates plumped to less than 1% in women born since 2002. In this study, incidence of abnormal cytology and histology was examined in terms of HPV vaccination among 5,924 women aged 20 to 24 years in the fiscal year (FY) 2014 and 2015. The total rate of vaccination was 16.9% (1,002/5,924). In case of FY 2015, the rates of vaccination were 59.26%, 49.68%, 11.97%, 9.08%, and 4.58% in those aged 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 years old, respectively. The rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse were 0.20% (2/1,002) in women with HPV vaccination and 1.14% (56/4,922) in those without HPV vaccination, indicating a significant reduction of 82.46% with vaccination (P < 0.0001). The rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1+ were 0.80% (8/1,002) in women with vaccination and 2.28% (112/4,922) in those without vaccination. The reduction rate of CIN1+ was 64.91% (P = 0.0025). The rates of CIN2+ were 0.10% (1/1,002) with vaccination and 0.69% (34/4,922) without vaccination. The reduction rate of CIN2+ was 85.51% (P = 0.0261). Our data are the first to demonstrate a significant reduction of CIN2+ cases in an Asian population. Scientific discussion is needed to restart the proactive recommendation for HPV vaccine in Japan.

M3  - Article

CP  - Workshop on Non-Native Species in Urban Environments - Patterns, Processes, Impacts and Challenges
CL  - DST NRF Ctr Excellence Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - Urban trees have been increasingly appreciated for the many benefits they provide. As concentrated hubs of human-mediated movement, the urban landscape is, however, often the first point of contact for exotic pests including insects and plant pathogens. Consequently, urban trees can be important for accidentally introduced forest pests to become established and potentially invasive. Reductions in biodiversity and the potential for stressful conditions arising from anthropogenic disturbances can predispose these trees to pest attack, further increasing the likelihood of exotic forest pests becoming established and increasing in density. Once established in urban environments, dispersal of introduced pests can proceed to natural forest landscapes or planted forests. In addition to permanent long-term damage to natural ecosystems, the consequences of these invasions include costly attempts at eradication and post establishment management strategies. We discuss a range of ecological, economic and social impacts arising from these incursions and the importance of global biosecurity is highlighted as a crucially important barrier to pest invasions. Finally, we suggest that urban trees may be viewed as 'sentinel plantings'. In particular, botanical gardens and arboreta frequently house large collections of exotic plantings, providing a unique opportunity to help predict and prevent the invasion of new pests, and where introduced pests with the capacity to cause serious impacts in forest environments could potentially be detected during the initial stages of establishment. Such early detection offers the only realistic prospect of eradication, thereby reducing damaging ecological impacts and long term management costs.

TI  - Floods and food security: A method to estimate the effect of inundation on crops availability
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The inner connections between floods and food security are extremely relevant, especially in developing countries where food availability can be highly jeopardized by extreme events that damage the primary access to food, i.e. agriculture. A method for the evaluation of the effects of floods on food supply, consisting of the integration of remote sensing data, agricultural statistics and water footprint databases, is proposed and applied to two different case studies. Based on the existing literature related to extreme floods, the events in Bangladesh (2007) and in Pakistan (2010) have been selected as exemplary case studies. Results show that the use of remote sensing data combined with other sources of onsite information is particularly useful to assess the effects of flood events on food availability. The damages caused by floods on agricultural areas are estimated in terms of crop losses and then converted into lost calories and water footprint as complementary indicators. Method results are fully repeatable; whereas, for remote sensed data the sources of data are valid worldwide and the data regarding land use and crops characteristics are strongly site specific, which need to be carefully evaluated. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the water depth critical on the crops in Bangladesh, varying the assumed level by +/- 20%. The results show a difference in the energy content losses estimation of 12% underlying the importance of an accurate data choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach to Environmental Monitoring in a Reclaimed Mine Area
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining for resources extraction may lead to geological and associated environmental changes due to ground movements, collision with mining cavities, and deformation of aquifers. Geological changes may continue in a reclaimed mine area, and the deformed aquifers may entail a breakdown of substrates and an increase in ground water tables, which may cause surface area inundation. Consequently, a reclaimed mine area may experience surface area collapse, i.e., subsidence, and degradation of vegetation productivity. Thus, monitoring short-term landscape dynamics in a reclaimed mine area may provide important information on the long-term geological and environmental impacts of mining activities. We studied landscape dynamics in Kirchheller Heide, Germany, which experienced extensive soil movement due to longwall mining without stowing, using Landsat imageries between 2013 and 2016. A Random Forest image classification technique was applied to analyze land-use and landcover dynamics, and the growth of wetland areas was assessed using a Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). We also analyzed the changes in vegetation productivity using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We observed a 19.9% growth of wetland area within four years, with 87.2% growth in the coverage of two major waterbodies in the reclaimed mine area. NDVI values indicate that the productivity of 66.5% of vegetation of the Kirchheller Heide was degraded due to changes in ground water tables and surface flooding. Our results inform environmental management and mining reclamation authorities about the subsidence spots and priority mitigation areas from land surface and vegetation degradation in Kirchheller Heide.

TI  - Radiometric Correction of Simultaneously Acquired Landsat-7/Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A Imagery Using Pseudoinvariant Areas (PIA): Contributing to the Landsat Time Series Legacy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Pseudoinvariant Areas (PIA) makes it possible to carry out a reasonably robust and automatic radiometric correction for long time series of remote sensing imagery, as shown in previous studies for large data sets of Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ imagery. In addition, they can be employed to obtain more coherence among remote sensing data from different sensors. The present work validates the use of PIA for the radiometric correction of pairs of images acquired almost simultaneously (Landsat-7 (ETM+) or Landsat-8 (OLI) and Sentinel-2A (MSI)). Four pairs of images from a region in SW Spain, corresponding to four different dates, together with field spectroradiometry measurements collected at the time of satellite overpass were used to evaluate a PIA-based radiometric correction. The results show a high coherence between sensors (r(2) = 0.964) and excellent correlations to in-situ data for the MiraMon implementation (r(2) > 0.9). Other methodological alternatives, ATCOR3 (ETM+, OLI, MSI), SAC-QGIS (ETM+, OLI, MSI), 6S-LEDAPS (ETM+), 6S-LaSRC (OLI), and Sen2Cor-SNAP (MSI), were also evaluated. Almost all of them, except for SAC-QGIS, provided similar results to the proposed PIA-based approach. Moreover, as the PIA-based approach can be applied to almost any image (even to images lacking of extra atmospheric information), it can also be used to solve the robust integration of data from new platforms, such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2, to enrich global data acquired since 1972 in the Landsat program. It thus contributes to the program's continuity, a goal of great interest for the environmental, scientific, and technical community.

TI  - Four years of case-based surveillance of meningitis following the introduction of MenAfriVac in Moissala, Chad: lessons learned
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE Case-based surveillance of bacterial meningitis in sentinel districts has been recommended after the introduction of the conjugated vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA), MenAfriVac, in the African meningitis belt. Here we report data and lessons learnt from four years of surveillance in the district of Moissala, Chad.METHODS All suspected cases of meningitis were referred free of charge to the district hospital for lumbar puncture and treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested with Pastorex latex agglutination in Moissala, and inoculated trans-isolate media were used for culture and PCR at the national reference laboratory and/or at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.RESULTS From July 2012 to December 2016, 237 suspected cases of meningitis were notified, and a specimen was collected from 224. Eighty-three samples were positive for a bacterial pathogen by culture, PCR or Pastorex, including 58 cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae with only 28 of 49 pneumococcal meningitis confirmed by culture or PCR correctly identified by Pastorex. Four cases of NmA were detected by Pastorex, but none were confirmed by PCR.CONCLUSION Implementation of case-based surveillance for meningitis is feasible in Chad, but has required political and technical engagement. Given the high proportion of S.pneumoniae and its poor detection by Pastorex, continued use of PCR is warranted for surveillance outside of outbreaks, and efforts to accelerate the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are needed. Introduction of MenAfriVac in routine immunisation and future availability of a pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine will be key elements for the sustained reduction in meningitis outbreaks in the area.

TI  - Ancient Amazonian populations left lasting impacts on forest structure
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia contains a vast expanse of contiguous tropical forest and is influential in global carbon and hydrological cycles. Whether ancient Amazonia was highly disturbed or modestly impacted, and how ancient disturbances have shaped current forest ecosystem processes, is still under debate. Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs), which are anthropic soil types with enriched nutrient levels, are one of the primary lines of evidence for ancient human presence and landscape modifications in settings that mostly lack stone structures and which are today covered by vegetation. We assessed the potential of using moderate spatial resolution optical satellite imagery to predict ADEs across the Amazon Basin. Maximum entropy modeling was used to develop a predictive model using locations of ADEs across the basin and satellite-derived remotely sensed indices. Amazonian Dark Earth sites were predicted to be primarily along the main rivers and in eastern Amazonia. Amazonian Dark Earth sites, when compared with randomly selected forested sites located within 50 km of ADE sites, were less green canopies (lower normalized difference vegetation index) and had lower canopy water content. This difference was accentuated in two drought years, 2005 and 2010. This is contrary to our expectation that ADE sites would have nutrient-rich soils that support trees with greener canopies and forests on ADE soils being more resilient to drought. Biomass and tree height were lower on ADE sites in comparison with randomly selected adjacent sites. Our results suggested that ADE-related ancient human impact on the forest is measurable across the entirety of the 6 million km(2) of Amazon Basin using remotely sensed data.

TI  - Including refugees in disease elimination: challenges observed from a sleeping sickness programme in Uganda
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ensuring equity between forcibly-displaced and host area populations is a key challenge for global elimination programmes. We studied Uganda's response to the recent refugee influx from South Sudan to identify key governance and operational lessons for national sleeping sickness programmes working with displaced populations today. A refugee policy which favours integration of primary healthcare services for refugee and host populations and the availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect sleeping sickness at this health system level makes Uganda well-placed to include refugees in sleeping sickness surveillance.Methods: Using ethnographic observations of coordination meetings, review of programme data, interviews with sleeping sickness and refugee authorities and group discussions with health staff and refugees (2013-2016), we nevertheless identified some key challenges to equitably integrating refugees into government sleeping sickness surveillance.Results: Despite fears that refugees were at risk of disease and posed a threat to elimination, six months into the response, programme coordinators progressed to a sentinel surveillance strategy in districts hosting the highest concentrations of refugees. This meant that RDTs, the programme's primary surveillance tool, were removed from most refugee-serving facilities, exacerbating existing inequitable access to surveillance and leading refugees to claim that their access to sleeping sickness tests had been better in South Sudan. This was not intentionally done to exclude refugees from care, rather, four key governance challenges made it difficult for the programme to recognise and correct inequities affecting refugees: (a) perceived donor pressure to reduce the sleeping sickness programme's scope without clear international elimination guidance on surveillance quality; (b) a problematic history of programme relations with refugee-hosting districts which strained supervision of surveillance quality; (c) difficulties that government health workers faced to produce good quality surveillance in a crisis; and (d) reluctant engagement between the sleeping sickness programme and humanitarian structures.Conclusions: Despite progressive policy intentions, several entrenched governance norms and practices worked against integration of refugees into the national sleeping sickness surveillance system. Elimination programmes which marginalise forced migrants risk unwittingly contributing to disease spread and reinforce social inequities, so new norms urgently need to be established at local, national and international levels.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones using remote sensing, GIS, and AHP technique in Tehran-Karaj plain, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of groundwater resources in dry areas without enough data is a challenging task in many parts of the world, including Tehran-Karaj plain in Iran, which includes Tehran, the capital city of Iran and Karaj, one of Iran's biggest cities. Water demand due to increasing agricultural and industrial activities caused many problems in the field of water resources management. In this study, the potential of groundwater resources was evaluated using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for the first time. Digital Elevation Model from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was used to generate a slope map and drainage density map. Three Landsat-8 satellite images were utilized to provide lineament density and land cover/land use maps. Geological and soil type maps were provided from the Geological Survey and Mineral Explorations of Iran (GSI). Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data were used to prepare average annual precipitation map. Discharge values from 102 pumping wells in the time period of 2002-2014 were used to evaluate the results. Seven data layers were prepared, and the geodatabase was made in GIS. The layers and their classes were assigned weights using AHP method. Finally, the layers were overlaid based on their weights, and the potential map of groundwater resources was generated. The area was classified into five zones with very high, high, moderate, low, and very low potentials. The zones covered 5.95, 32.90, 22.70, 10.20, and 28.25% of the study area, respectively. The results showed good agreement with the field data obtained from discharge wells.

TI  - Online Global Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the estimation of land surface temperature (LST) for the globe from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 thermal infrared sensors, using different surface emissivity sources. A single channel algorithm is used for consistency among the estimated LST products, whereas the option of using emissivity from different sources provides flexibility for the algorithm's implementation to any area of interest. The Google Earth Engine (GEE), an advanced earth science data and analysis platform, allows the estimation of LST products for the globe, covering the time period from 1984 to present. To evaluate the method, the estimated LST products were compared against two reference datasets: (a) LST products derived from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), as higher-level products based on the temperature-emissivity separation approach; (b) Landsat LST data that have been independently produced, using different approaches. An overall RMSE (root mean square error) of 1.52 degrees C was observed and it was confirmed that the accuracy of the LST product is dependent on the emissivity; different emissivity sources provided different LST accuracies, depending on the surface cover. The LST products, for the full Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archives, are estimated on-the-fly and are available on-line via a web application.

TI  - Moving from Space-Based to Ground-Based Solutions in Remote Sensing for Archaeological Heritage: A Case Study from Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the results of a 2016 study examining high-resolution open-source satellite data from 2002-2013 for sites across Egypt that mapped looting and site encroachment. The author features a looted tripartite coffin (now returned to Egypt) to suggest how satellite imagery might narrow down or provide the general provenience of looted objects and their possible site origins. Mapping where looting has occurred, the intensity of the looting, and emerging future threats to sites are important, but there is no established method at present to work backwards from unprovenanced looted items. Through an assessment of when objects enter countries illegally, the time-period of the looted objects, and an analysis of satellite imagery looting data concerning their country of origin, it is possible to suggest a potential provenance for looted objects. This approach shows how satellite data can be integrated into traditional provenance research. This study presents a workflow for how other projects might utilize a similar approach in other countries.

AB  - Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories help protect populations from biological and chemical public health threats. We examined the role of LRN biological laboratories in enhancing capacity to detect and respond to public health infectious disease emergencies in South Korea. The model for responding to infectious disease emergencies leverages standardized laboratory testing procedures, a repository of standardized testing reagents, laboratory testing cooperation among hospital sentinel laboratories and reference laboratories, and maintenance of a trained workforce through traditional and on-demand training. Cooperation among all network stakeholders helps ensure that laboratory response is an integrated part of the national response. The added laboratory testing capacity provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LRN assets helps protect persons who reside in South Korea, US military personnel and civilians in South Korea, and those who reside in the continental United States.

TI  - Assessing groundwater accessibility in the Kharga Basin, Egypt: A remote sensing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used multi-map analysis of remote sensing and ancillary data to identify potentially accessible sites for groundwater resources in the Kharga Basin in the Western Desert of Egypt. This basin is dominated by Cretaceous sandstone formations and extends within the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer. It is dissected by N-S and E-W trending faults, possibly acting as conduits for upward migration of groundwater. Analysis of paleo-drainage using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data shows that the Kharga was a closed basin that might have been the site of a paleolake. Lake water recharged the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer during the wetter Holocene time. We generated the following layers for the multi-map analysis: (1) Fracture density map from the interpretation of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), SRTM DEM, and RADARSAT data. (2) Thermal Inertia (TI) map (for moisture content imaging) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. (3) Hydraulic conductivity map from mapping lithological units using the Landsat OLI and previously published data. (4) Aquifer thickness map from previously published data. We quantitatively ranked the Kharga Basin by considering that regions of high fracture density, high TI, thicker aquifer, and high hydraulic conductivity have higher potential for groundwater accessibility. Our analysis shows that part of the southern Kharga Basin is suitable for groundwater extraction. This region is where N-S and E-W trending faults intersect, has relatively high TI and it is underlain by thick aquifer. However, the suitability of this region for groundwater use will be reduced significantly when considering the changes in land suitability and economic depth to groundwater extraction in the next 50 years.

TI  - Benefits of the fire mitigation ecosystem service in The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) National Wildlife Refuge delivers multiple ecosystem services, including air quality and human health via fire mitigation. Our analysis estimates benefits of this service through its potential to reduce catastrophic wildfire related impacts on the health of nearby human populations. We used a combination of high-frequency satellite data, ground sensors, and air quality indices to determine periods of public exposure to dense emissions from a wildfire within the GDS. We examined emergency department (ED) visitation in seven Virginia counties during these periods, applied measures of cumulative Relative Risk to derive the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on ED visitation rates, and estimated economic losses using regional Cost of Illness values established within the US Environmental Protection Agency BenMAP framework. Our results estimated the value of one avoided catastrophic wildfire in the refuge to be $3.69 million (2015 USD), or $306 per hectare of burn. Reducing the frequency or severity of extensive, deep burning peatland wildfire events has additional benefits not included in this estimate, including avoided costs related to fire suppression during a burn, carbon dioxide emissions, impacts to wildlife, and negative outcomes associated with recreation and regional tourism. We suggest the societal value of the public health benefits alone provides a significant incentive for refuge mangers to implement strategies that will reduce the severity of catastrophic wildfires.

TI  - Evaluation of the SBAS InSAR Service of the European Space Agency's Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of remote sensing data to assess geohazards is being improved by web-based platforms and collaborative projects, such as the Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This paper presents the evaluation of a surface velocity map that is generated by this platform. The map was produced through an unsupervised Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) analysis applying the Parallel-SBAS (P-SBAS) algorithm to 25 ENVISAT satellite images from the South of Spain that were acquired between 2003 and 2008. This analysis was carried out using a service implemented in the GEP called SBAS InSAR. Thanks to the map that was generated by the SBAS InSAR service, we identified processes not documented so far; provided new monitoring data in places affected by known ground instabilities; defined the area affected by these instabilities; and, studied a case where GEP could have been able to help in the forecast of a slope movement reactivation. This amply demonstrates the reliability and usefulness of the GEP, and shows how web-based platforms may enhance the capacity to identify, monitor, and assess hazards that are associated to geological processes.

TI  - Empirical fragility and vulnerability curves for buildings exposed to slow-moving landslides at medium and large scales
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow-moving landslides yearly induce huge economic losses worldwide in terms of damage to facilities and interruption of human activities. Within the landslide risk management framework, the consequence analysis is a key step entailing procedures mainly based on identifying and quantifying the exposed elements, defining an intensity criterion and assessing the expected losses. This paper presents a two-scale (medium and large) procedure for vulnerability assessment of buildings located in areas affected by slow-moving landslides. Their intensity derives from Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) satellite data analysis, which in the last decade proved to be capable of providing cost-effective long-term displacement archives. The analyses carried out on two study areas of southern Italy (one per each of the addressed scales) lead to the generation, as an absolute novelty, of both empirical fragility and vulnerability curves for buildings in slow-moving landslide-affected areas. These curves, once further validated, can be valuably used as tools for consequence forecasting purposes and, more in general, for planning the most suitable slow-moving landslide risk mitigation strategies.

TI  - Comparison and Evaluation of the TES and ANEM Algorithms for Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Separation over the Area of Valencia, Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface temperature (LST) is a key magnitude for numerous studies, especially for climatology and assessment of energy fluxes between surface and atmosphere. Retrieval of accurate LST requires a good characterization of surface emissivity. Both quantities are coupled in a single radiance measurement; for this reason, for N spectral bands available in a remote sensor, there will always be N + 1 unknowns. To solve the indeterminacy, temperature-emissivity separation methods have been proposed, among which the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is one of the most widely used. The Adjusted Normalized Emissivity Method (ANEM) was proposed as a modification of the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM) algorithm by adjusting the initial emissivity guess using an estimation provided by the Vegetation Cover Method (VCM). In this work, both methods were applied to a set of five ASTER scenes over the area of Valencia, Spain, which were recalibrated and atmospherically corrected using local radiosoundings and ground measurements. These scenes were compared to the ASTER temperature and emissivity standard products (AST08 and AST05, respectively). The comparison to reference measurements showed a better agreement of ANEM LST in low spectral contrast surfaces, with biases of +0.4 K, +0.8 K for TES and +1.4 K for the AST08 product in a rice crop site. For sea surface temperature, bias was -0.1 K for ANEM, +0.3 K for TES and +1.3 K for the AST08 product. The larger differences of the AST08 product could be ascribed mainly to the atmospheric correction based on NCEP profiles in contrast to the local correction used in TES and ANEM and to a lesser extent the Maximum-Minimum Difference (MMD) empirical relationship used by TES. In terms of emissivity, ANEM obtained biases up to +/- 0.007 (positive over vegetation and negative over water), while TES biases were up to -0.015. The AST05 product showed differences up to -0.050, although for high contrast areas, such as sand surfaces, it showed better accuracy than both TES and ANEM. A comparison between TES and ANEM on four different classes within the scene showed a systematic difference between both algorithms, which was more pronounced for low spectral contrast surfaces. Therefore, ANEM improves the accuracy at low spectral contrast surfaces, while obtaining similar results to TES at higher spectral contrast surfaces, such as urban areas. The combination of both methods could provide a procedure benefiting from the strengths shown by each of them.

TI  - Randomized kernels for large scale Earth observation applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current remote sensing applications of bio-geophysical parameter estimation and image classification have to deal with an unprecedented big amount of heterogeneous and complex data sources. New satellite sensors involving a high number of improved time, space and wavelength resolutions give rise to challenging computational problems. Standard physical inversion techniques cannot cope efficiently with this new scenario. Dealing with land cover classification of the new image sources has also turned to be a complex problem requiring large amount of memory and processing time. In order to cope with these problems, statistical learning has greatly helped in the last years to develop statistical retrieval and classification models that can ingest large amounts of Earth observation data. Kernel methods constitute a family of powerful machine learning algorithms, which have found wide use in remote sensing and geosciences. However, kernel methods are still not widely adopted because of the high computational cost when dealing with large scale problems, such as the inversion of radiative transfer models or the classification of high spatial spectral -temporal resolution data. This paper introduces to the remote sensing community an efficient kernel method for fast statistical retrieval of atmospheric and biophysical parameters and image classification problems. We rely on a recently presented approximation to shift-invariant kernels using projections on random Fourier features. The method proposes an explicit mapping function defined through a set of projections randomly sampled from the Fourier domain. It is proved to approximate the implicit mapping of a kernel function. This allows to deal with large-scale data but taking advantage of kernel methods. The method is simple, computationally very efficient in both memory and processing costs, and easily parallelizable. We show that kernel regression and classification is now possible for datasets with millions of samples. Examples on atmospheric parameter retrieval from hyperspectral infrared sounders like IASI/Metop; large scale emulation and inversion of the familiar PROSAIL radiative transfer model on Sentinel-2 data; and the identification of clouds over landmarks in time series of MSG/Seviri images show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique.

TI  - Experiences from Large-Scale Forest Mapping of Sweden Using TanDEM-X Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper report experiences from the processing and mosaicking of 518 TanDEM-X image pairs covering the entirety of Sweden, with two single map products of above-ground biomass (AGB) and forest stem volume (VOL), both with 10 m resolution. The main objective was to explore the possibilities and overcome the challenges related to forest mapping extending a large number of adjacent satellite scenes. Hence, numerous examples are presented to illustrate challenges and possible solutions. To derive the forest maps, the observables backscatter, interferometric phase height and interferometric coherence, obtained from TanDEM-X, were evaluated using empirical robust linear regression models with reference data extracted from 2288 national forest inventory plots with a 10 m radius. The interferometric phase height was the single most important observable, to predict AGB and VOL. The mosaics were evaluated on different datasets with field-inventoried stands across Sweden. The root mean square error (RMSE) was about 21%-25% (27-30 tons/ha and 52-65 m(3)/ha) at the stand level. It was noted that the most influencing factors on the observables in this study were local temperature and geolocation errors that were challenging to robustly compensate against. Because of this variability at the scene-level, determinations of AGB and VOL for single stands are recommended to be used with care, as an equivalent accuracy is difficult to achieve for all different scenes, with varying acquisition conditions. Still, for the evaluated stands, the mosaics were of sufficient accuracy to be used for forest management at the stand level.

TI  - Near-real-time focusing of ENVISAT ASAR Stripmap and Sentinel-1 TOPS imagery exploiting OpenCL GPGPU technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a SAR image focuser application exploiting General-purpose Computing On Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), developed within the European Space Agency (ESA) funded SARIPA project. Instead of relying on distributed technologies, such as clustering or High-performance Computing (HPC), the SARIPA processor is designed to run on a single computer equipped with multiple GPUs. To exploit the computational power of the latter, while retaining a high level of hardware portability, SARIPA is written using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework rather than the more widespread Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This allows the application to exploit both GPUs and CPUs without requiring any code modification or duplication. A further level of optimization is achieved thanks to a software architecture, which mimics a distributed computing environment, although implemented on a single machine. SARIPA's performance is demonstrated on ENVISAT ASAR Stripmap imagery, for which a real-time performance of 8.5 s is achieved, and on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wideswath (IW) raw data products, for which a near-real time processing time of about 1 min is required. Such a performance has the potential of significantly reducing the storage requirements for wide-area monitoring applications, by avoiding the need of maintaining large permanent archives of Level 1 (focused) imagery, in favor of lighter Level 0 (raw) products, which can be focused on-the-fly within the user's application processing pipelines at almost no overhead.

TI  - Contemporary survival trends in penile cancer: Results from the National Cancer Database
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate contemporary survival trends in penile cancer.Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for men with penile cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2009. Patient, tumor, treatment, and facility characteristics were obtained. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model for all cases and stratified by stage.Results: A total of 8,122 cases of penile cancer were reported from 1998 to 2009 in the National Cancer Database. Complete staging, survival, and covariate data were available for 5,043 cases. The estimated crude 5-year OS for the entire cohort was 61.0%. For all patients, no significant differences in crude 5-year OS were detected between 2006 to 2009 and 2002 to 2005 compared to 1998 to 2001. On multivariable analysis, OS did not significantly differ across all eras. Regional lymph node dissection was associated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.777, P < 0.0001). In patients who underwent lymph node dissection, dissection of >= 8 nodes significantly improved survival (HR = 0.672; P = 0.0011). Additional modeling stratified by stage revealed that OS for stage II cancers increased significantly in 2006 to 2009 compared to 1998 to 2001 (HR = 0.714; P = 0.0034).Conclusions: Survival in penile cancer has remained unchanged as a whole and for each stage, except for stage II disease. An improved survival trend was detected in stage II penile cancer. Performing a lymph node dissection, especially extensive dissections, may benefit long-term survival. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An Analysis of Ku-Band Profiling Radar Observations of Boreal Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar sensors have the potential to retrieve vertical forest structure measurements thanks to their capability to penetrate into the foliage. However, studies are needed in order to understand better the interaction of radar beams with the canopy. The most commonly used radar technique for estimating forest parameters operates from spacecraft at different wavelength (X-, C-, and L-band). In order to assist in the interpretation of satellite data for forest applications, and as a possible complementary technique to Lidar (Light detection and ranging), the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute has developed the first helicopter-borne profiling radar system operating in Ku-band, called Tomoradar, which is able to provide a vertical canopy profile. The study focuses on the analyses of Ku-band profiling radar waveforms and the backscatter signal of boreal forest, supported by simultaneously acquired Lidar measurements, in order to detect ground and canopy profiles and quantify the ground echo ratio under different canopy coverage and the backscatter signal variation through the vegetation. The Tomoradar data was acquired simultaneously with a lightweight Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar system in October 2016 over a boreal forest located in Evo in southern Finland. Additionally, highly accurate Riegl VQ-480 Lidar data, acquired in 2014, was used as a ground reference for both lightweight systems. We analysed the co- and cross-polarized (HH and HV) Tomoradar backscatter signals of a 600 m long profile. It is found that the Ku-band Tomoradar penetrates the canopy to a similar extent as the Velodyne Lidar, i.e., the distribution of backscatter signals through the vegetation follows the vegetation density. Moreover, the ground backscatter signal strength and ground echo ratio depend strongly on the presence of gaps in the canopy. By comparing the elevation of the corresponding canopy and ground Tomoradar signal peaks with the Velodyne Lidar data, the Tomoradar ground elevation accuracy is on average -0.03 m and -0.20 m for the cross- and co-polarization, respectively, whereas the bias of the canopy elevation is, on average, -0.58 m and 1.35 m for the cross- and co-polarization, respectively. With respect to the ground height data derived from the Lidar measurements of 2014, the Tomoradar ground profile reveals, on average, higher accuracy (i.e., 0.00 m (sigma = 0.41 m) and 0.04 m (sigma = 0.37 m) for the co-and cross-polarizations, respectively) than the Velodyne system (-0.37 m with sigma = 0.25 m).

TI  - Expanding Pertussis Epidemiology in 6 Latin America Countries through the Latin American Pertussis Project
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Latin American Pertussis Project (LAPP), established in 2009, is a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Organization, Sabin Vaccine Institute, and the ministries of health of 6 countries in Latin America. The project goal is to expand understanding of pertussis epidemiology in Latin America to inform strategies for control and prevention. Here we describe LAPP structure and activities. After an initial surveillance evaluation, LAPP activities are tailored to individual country needs. LAPP activities align with Global Health Security Agenda priorities and have focused on expanding laboratory diagnostic capacity, implementing a laboratory quality control and quality assurance program, and providing epidemiologic support to strengthen reporting of pertussis surveillance data. Lessons learned include that ongoing mentoring is key to the successful adoption of new technologies and that sustainability of laboratory diagnostics requires a regional commitment to procure reagents and related supplies.

TI  - Hierarchical Bayesian models for small area estimation of county-level private forest landowner population
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS), administered by the USDA Forest Service, provides estimates of private forest ownership characteristics and owners' attitudes and behaviors at a national, regional, and state levels. Due to sample sizes prescribed for inference at the state level, there are insufficient data to support county-level estimates. However, county-level estimates of NWOS variables are desired because ownership programs and education initiatives often occur at the county level and such information could help tailor these efforts to better match county-specific needs and demographics. Here, we present and assess methods to estimate the number of private forest ownerships at the county level for two states, Montana and New Jersey. To assess model performance, true population parameters were derived from cadastral and remote sensing data. Two small area estimation (SAE) models, the Fay-Herriot (FH) and the FH with conditional autoregressive random effects (FHCAR), improved estimated county-level population mean squared error (MSE) over that achieved by direct estimates. The proposed SAE models use covariates to improve accuracy and precision of county-level estimates. Results show total forest area, and 2010 decennial census population density covariates explained a significant portion of variability in county-level population size. These and other results suggest that the proposed SAE methods yield a statistically robust approach to deliver reliable estimates of private ownership population size and could be extended to additional important NWOS variables at the county level.

TI  - A Comparison of MICROTOPS II and OMI Satellite Ozone Measurements in Novi Sad from 2007 to 2015
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present consecutive daily measurements of the total ozone column (TOC) using MICROTOPS II in Novi Sad, the Republic of Serbia (45.3 N, 19.8 E and the altitude of 84 m) from 2007 to 2015. The MICROTOPS II data set was compared to the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite data, since there was no nearby comparative long-time series available for the Dobson or Brewer instrument. The data quality control of the measured MICROTOPS II TOC data was carried out before the comparison with the satellite data. The MICROTOPS II was calibrated at the manufacturer's facilities and only TOC values drawn from the 305.5/312.5 nm wavelength combination were compared with the satellite data. The mean bias deviation between MICROTOPS II and OMI satellite data sets was obtained to be less than 2%, and the mean absolute deviation was in the range of 5%. The difference in the mean seasonal TOC values in summer and autumn was less than 0.5%, while in winter and spring this difference reached 2.8%. A possible calibration of MICROTOPS II instrument with the satellite data is presented, where the calibration coefficients for all channels were calculated for every satellite and MICROTPS II data pair during one year. Then, the average value of all the calculated coefficients was used for instrument calibration. The presented calibration improves the MICROTOPS II instrument stability and enables the usage of all the wavelength combinations.

The shifting of his creative focus from poetry and novels in his twenties to music in his thirties and thereafter did nothing to diminish his appetite for the quest. The songs were simply poems by another name. Often, they took on the character of a hymn or psalm.

TI  - A conservation assessment of Canada's boreal forest incorporating alternate climate change scenarios
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecologically based strategies for climate change adaptation can be constructively integrated into a terrestrial conservation assessment for Canada's boreal forest, one of Earth's largest remaining wilderness areas. Identifying solutions that minimize variability in projected vegetation productivity may represent a less risky conservation investment by reducing the amount of anticipated environmental change. In this study, we assessed hypothetical protected area networks designed for future vegetation variability under a range of different climate conditions to provide relevant recommendations of conservation requirements that support ongoing boreal conservation and land-use planning. We constructed a boreal conservation assessment using both a conventional (Marxan) and a new probabilistic site-selection approach (Marxan with probability) with projected 2080 vegetation variability probability (VVP) for least change (B1), business as usual (A1B) and most extreme change (A2) climate scenarios. We then assessed (1) reserve network performance (cost and area), (2) high conservation priority areas and (3) the influence and implications of VVP on reserve networks. We found that including VVP dramatically increased the relative cost and total area of reserve networks. Many low-cost sites with high VVP values were given higher conservation priority over fewer sites with low VVP values. Reserve networks designed for A1B and A2 climate scenarios contained more sites with very high VVP values. The ratio of sites with high and very high VVP values changes dramatically for reserve networks designed for current and least change (B1) climate scenarios when under more severe A1B and A2 conditions. We conclude that introducing additional complexity and realism into national or boreal-wide conservation assessments, that include, for example, elements of climate change, will increase the total area and cost of a reserve network. Moreover, reserve networks designed for current or least change (B1) climate scenarios will likely not achieve conservation targets when faced with more severe conditions, and will require additional sites. The adaptive strategies presented are well suited for a boreal conservation assessment and may improve long-term effectiveness of biodiversity conservation objectives.

TI  - NEWLY DISCOVERED FRIEZES AT THE PERUVIAN SITE OF TAUKACHI-KONKaN: A POSSIBLE GLIMPSE INTO INITIAL PERIOD COSMOLOGY
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Excavations conducted in 2015 and 2016 discovered a unique set of friezes at the Initial period (2100-1000 cal BC) site of Taukachi-Konkan in the coastal Peruvian valley of Casma. At this time, the Casma Valley was dominated by the Sechin Alto polity, a cultural development of unprecedented complexity characterized by large planned cities, monumental constructions, and strong interconnections among component settlements. Friezes are known from all major Sechin Alto polity sites where they typically adorn structure facades; however, the Taukachi-Konkan friezes are unusual because they cover all four interior walls of a sunken court with restricted access. Based on analysis of the context and content of these friezes, we suggest that the collective imagery depicts aspects of Sechin Alto polity cosmology, including possible iconography relating to their creation myth. Furthermore, motifs from the Taukachi-Konkan sunken court can be found at contemporary sites both within and outside the Casma Valley. This suggests that the worldview we reconstructed may have been widespread during the Initial period.

TI  - Land Use Classification: A Surface Energy Balance and Vegetation Index Application to Map and Monitor Irrigated Lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture consumes the largest share of available fresh water, and awareness of the spatial distribution and application rates is paramount to a functional and sustainable communal consumptive water use. This remote sensing study leverages surface energy balance fluxes and vegetation indices to classify and map the spatial distribution of irrigated and non-irrigated croplands. The purpose is to introduce a classification scheme applicable across a wide variation in regional climate and inter-growing seasonal precipitation. The rationale for climate and inter-growing seasonal adaptability is founded in the derivation and calibration of the scheme based on the wettest growing season. Therefore, the scheme becomes a more efficient classifier during normal and dry growing seasons. Using empirical distribution functions, two indices are derived from evapotranspiration fluxes and vegetation indices to contrast and classify irrigated croplands from non-irrigated. The synergy of the two indices increases the classification proficiency by adding another classifying layer which re-characterizes misclassified croplands by the base index. The scheme was applied to a region with wide climate variation and to multiple years of growing seasons. The results presented, in cross validation with groundtruth, show an accurate and consistent approach to classify irrigation with overall accuracy of 92.1%, applicable from humid to semi-arid climate, and from dry to normal and wet growing seasons.

TI  - Urban ventilation network model: A case study of the core zone of capital function in Beijing metropolitan area
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced extreme urban heat island effects and air pollution associated with rapid urbanization. Optimizing urban ventilation environment could relieve these environmental problems. In this study, an Urban Ventilation Network Model (UVNM) was developed to explore the impact of urban morphology and building height on the urban ventilation condition. The study calculated the ventilation resistance coefficient of building height according to fluid mechanics, and then determined the least cost path among the air inlets and outlets considering the direction and frequency of wind. Eventually, corridors at several different levels of ventilation were extracted by classifying the line densities of least cost paths, which were effectively verified through land surface temperature retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The new model is more scientific and convenient than traditional urban construction environmental assessment software in terms of data acquisition and hardware support The results suggest that urban design based on urban morphology and building height and considering the direction and frequency of wind would be effective for optimizing ventilation to regulate urban environmental problems.

TI  - Estimation of FPAR and FPAR profile for maize canopies using airborne LiDAR
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - FPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) and FPAR profile (vertical FPAR distribution) are important parameters for characterizing the vegetation growth status and studying global climate change. Few studies have been carried out to estimate FPAR and FPAR profile using waveform LiDAR data. This research explored the potential of airborne small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR in the estimation of FPAR and FPAR profile of the maize canopy in Huailai County of Hebei Province, China. First, the maize growing area was identified by a simple decision tree model. Second, raw waveform data were processed to extract LiDAR-derived energy ratio and energy ratio profile. Third, FPAR and FPAR profile were estimated from LiDAR-derived metrics. Finally, we analyzed the FPAR and FPAR profile estimation results and assessed the model validity using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. The comparative analyses found that the LiDAR-derived energy ratio profile and field-measured FPAR profile had the same trend and similar change rate for all maize layers. The accuracy assessments indicated that the FPAR and FPAR profile were estimated well by the LiDAR waveform data, with the high R-2 (0.90 for the whole canopy, and 0.95, 0.90, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.97 for layers 1-5) and low RMSEs (0.042 for the whole canopy, and 0.033, 0.035, 0.039, 0.043, and 0.044 for layers 1-5). The spatial distribution map of FPAR was produced to describe the maize growth status of the whole study area, and the map showed that the FPAR distributed relatively uniformly. This study suggested that airborne small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR was useful in accurately measuring FPAR and FPAR profile of the maize canopy and in effectively mapping the maize FPAR spatial distribution.

TI  - Health Diagnosis of Major Transportation Infrastructures in Shanghai Metropolis Using High-Resolution Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Persistent Scatterer Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (PSI) technology allows the detection of ground subsidence with millimeter accuracy, it is becoming one of the most powerful and economical means for health diagnosis of major transportation infrastructures. However, structures of different types may suffer from various levels of localized subsidence due to the different structural characteristics and subsidence mechanisms. Moreover, in the complex urban scenery, some segments of these infrastructures may be sheltered by surrounding buildings in SAR images, obscuring the desirable signals. Therefore, the subsidence characteristics on different types of structures should be discussed separately and the accuracy of persistent scatterers (PSs) should be optimized. In this study, the PSI-based subsidence mapping over the entire transportation network of Shanghai (more than 10,000 km) is illustrated, achieving the city-wide monitoring specifically along the elevated roads, ground highways and underground subways. The precise geolocation and structural characteristics of infrastructures were combined to effectively guide more accurate identification and separation of PSs along the structures. The experimental results from two neighboring TerraSAR-X stacks from 2013 to 2016 were integrated by joint estimating the measurements in the overlapping area, performing large-scale subsidence mapping and were validated by leveling data, showing highly consistent in terms of subsidence velocities and time-series displacements. Spatial-temporal subsidence patterns on each type of infrastructures are strongly dependent on the operational durations and structural characteristics, as well as the variation of the foundation soil layers.

TI  - Observational evidence for turbulent effects on total suspended matter within the Pearl River plume
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We observed the structure of the Pearl River plume and its turbulent characteristics, and investigated the turbulent effect on total suspended matter (TSM) within its "far-field" region, based on in situ and satellite data collected in June 2015. A significant northeastward plume was created under southern monsoonal conditions. The in situ data provided the width, depth, and velocity of the plume, as inferred by salinity. Weaker turbulence occurred at the front surface position than in the plume zone. Stronger turbulence induced greater turbidity in the bottom boundary layer; however, the surface mixed layer differed. By estimating the turbidity budget, we found the lateral fluxes term was the largest term in the plume, turbulent fluxes comprised the second largest term, and the settling terms comprised the smallest term. We quantified the turbulent mechanisms and found that stronger river discharge induced greater TSM turbidity. Tidal and buoyancy fluxes had minor regulatory effects on TSM. Our observations suggest that TSM in the "far field" region originated from the Pearl River and the coastal region.

TI  - A modified sentinel lymph node technique combined with endoluminal loco-regional resection for the treatment of rectal tumours: a 14-year experience
T2  - COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim After endoluminal loco-regional resection (ELRR) by transanal endoscopic microsurgey (TEM) the N parameter may remain undefined. Nucleotide-guided mesorectal excision (NGME) improves the lymph node harvest. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the long-term oncological results after ELRR with NGME.Method A total of 57 patients were enrolled over the period January 2001 to June 2015. All patients underwent ELRR by TEM. Prior to surgery, 99m-technetium-marked nanocolloid was injected into the peritumoural submucosa. After removal of the specimen, the residual defect was probed to detect any residual radioactivity and hot' mesorectal fat was excised. All patients were included in a 5-year follow-up programme.Results Significant radioactivity in the residual cavity was found in 28 out of 57 patients (49%). The mean number of lymph nodes harvest in irradiated and nonirradiated patients was 1.66 and 2.76, respectively. After 68.2months' follow-up overall survival was 91.2%, disease-related mortality 3.5% and disease-free survival 89.5%. Two patients developed pulmonary metastases: one ypT3N0 patient underwent lung lobectomy after chemotherapy and one pT2N0 patient was managed with lung radiotherapy. Both patients are currently alive and disease-free at 48months' follow-up. Two patients developed local recurrence 1year after ELRR, both treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision. Comparing the present series with previous patients who did not undergo NGME, an increased number of harvested lymph nodes were observed, with a statistically significant difference (P=0.0085).Conclusion NGME during ELRR improves the lymph node harvest and staging accuracy. The long-term results showed satisfactory local (3.5%) and distant (7%) recurrence rates.

TI  - Justification and Indifference: Diverse Permissive Attitudes Toward Witnessed Violence Against the Elderly and Disabled
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The violence against the elderly and disabled is widespread. This means that many people who witness acts of violence against elders and the disabled do not react. Instead, they are rather inclined to develop permissive attitudes. The presented article distinguishes two permissive attitudes toward witnessed violence against the elderly and disabled: justification and indifference. The rationale for such differentiation is justified with reference to differences concerning (a) the strength of their relationship, (b) their frequency distribution in the population, and (c) the disparate influence of the underlying predictors. A survey study carried out on a nationwide representative sample of 1,000 adult Poles was the empirical basis for answering research questions. The study showed that domestic violence against elders and the disabled is a noticeable phenomenon in the population of Poland. Around 50% of respondents claimed that they came in touch with physical, economic, or psychological violence against the elderly. More than 30% reported the same in the case of disabled persons. Based on this study, it was found that justification of and indifference to violence were actually unrelated phenomena. Moreover, justification was much less widespread in the population than indifference. It seems easier to accept excuses for passivity in the face of violence than to find justifications for violence. Both permissive attitudes turned out to have a disparate pattern of predictors: Justification turned out to be mainly a function of environmental exposure to violence, whereas indifference was mainly a matter of worldview based on materialism and the imperative of self-interest.

M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of mass wasting in glacier environments and its impacts on glacier dynamics is not fully understood. This is the first occurrence of a debris avalanche event onto a Himalayan glacier through satellite data analysis. The analysis of various factors indicates the slide was a climate-driven hill-slope event activated in 2009 masking the Miyar glacier surface up to similar to 1.5% including its both lateral moraines and medial moraines. Due to this addition the glacier had neither advance nor retreat from 2009 to 2014. Eventually the debris will contribute to the supraglacial and englacial debris of the glacier. This showcases the way of mass wasting an important contribution to the debris budget of the Himalayan glaciers.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in Croplands Due to Water Stress in the Krishna River Basin Using Temporal Satellite Imagery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based assessments of large river basins such as the Krishna, which supplies water to many states in India, are useful for operationally monitoring agriculture, especially basins that are affected by abiotic stress. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series products can be used to understand cropland changes at the basin level due to abiotic stresses, especially water scarcity. Spectral matching techniques were used to identify land use/land cover (LULC) areas for two crop years: 2013-2014, which was a normal year, and 2015-2016, which was a water stress year. Water stress-affected crop areas were categorized into three classessevere, moderate and mildbased on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and intensity of damage assessed through field sampling. Furthermore, ground survey data were used to assess the accuracy of MODIS-derived classification individual products. Water inflows into and outflows from the Krishna river basin during the study period were used as direct indicators of water scarcity/availability in the Krishna Basin. Furthermore, ground survey data were used to assess the accuracy of MODIS-derived LULC classification of individual year products. Rainfall data from the tropical rainfall monitoring mission (TRMM) was used to support the water stress analysis. The nine LULC classes derived using the MODIS temporal imagery provided overall accuracies of 82% for the cropping year 2013-2014 and 85% for the year 2015-2016. Kappa values are 0.78 for 2013-2014 and 0.82 for 2015-2016. MODIS-derived cropland areas were compared with national statistics for the cropping year 2013-2014 with a R-2 value of 0.87. Results show that both rainfed and irrigated areas in 2015-2016 saw significant changes that will have significant impacts on food security. It has been also observed that the farmers in the basin tend to use lower inputs and labour per ha during drought years. Among all, access to water is the major driver determining the crop choice and extent of input-use in the basin.

TI  - Sustainable Biodiversity Management in India: Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India's commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.

AB  - Subungual melanoma is a rare subtype of cutaneous melanoma that arises from the structures of the nail apparatus. It presents most commonly in older patients and at an advanced stage.A retrospective review of all patients with subungual melanoma in a single institution over a 15-year period was performed. In total, 54 patients were included (26 males, average age 62.9 years), of which 28 cases involved the upper limb. Median tumour thickness was 4.5 mm. Eighteen patients had lymph node metastasis at diagnosis, including 11 of 36 patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. Median survival was 4.6 years.Subungual melanoma has a poor prognosis that is strongly associated with presence of nodal disease at diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered to determine stage and prognosis. (C) 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing and Water-Balance Evapotranspiration Estimates for the Conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the hydrologic cycle, accounting for similar to 70% of precipitation in the conterminous U.S. (CONUS), but it has been a challenge to predict accurately across different spatio-temporal scales. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has led to significant advances in the frequency and spatial resolution of ET estimates, derived from energy balance principles with variables such as temperature used to estimate surface latent heat flux. Although remote sensing methods excel at depicting spatial and temporal variability, estimation of ET independently of other water budget components can lead to inconsistency with other budget terms. Methods that rely on ground-based data better constrain long-term ET, but are unable to provide the same temporal resolution. Here we combine long-term ET estimates from a water-balance approach with the SSEBop (operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance) remote sensing-based ET product for 2000-2015. We test the new combined method, the original SSEBop product, and another remote sensing ET product (MOD16) against monthly measurements from 119 flux towers. The new product showed advantages especially in non-irrigated areas where the new method showed a coefficient of determination R of 0.44, compared to 0.41 for SSEBop or 0.35 for MOD16. The resulting monthly data set will be a useful, unique contribution to ET estimation, due to its combination of remote sensing-based variability and ground-based long-term water balance constraints.

CP  - 15th International Symposium of Oceanography of the Bay of Biscay (ISOBAY)
CL  - Bilbao, SPAIN
AB  - Human activities have altered estuarine environments leading to increased presence of different pollutants including metals. Although the implementation of new environmental policies has caused a considerable decrease in trace metal concentrations in estuaries around the Bay of Biscay, some elements such as copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) are still present in relatively high concentrations. Oysters have been widely used in environmental biomonitoring programs as sentinel organisms. Oysters Crassostrea gigas from an uncontaminated estuary were exposed to sublethal, environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu (2000 ng Cu/L) and Ag (500 ng Ag/L) during 14 days in brackish water (S = 18). A battery of cell and tissue level (exposure) biomarkers at different levels of biological complexity was applied and integrated into the Integrative Biological Response (IBR) index including: metallothionein contents, intralysosomal metal accumulation, digestive gland atrophy and digestive gland tissue integrity. Condition Index (CI) was incorporated into the IBR index as a complementary parameter that reflects the general physiological condition of oysters (organism level). Results indicated an increase in intralysosomal metal accumulation after 7 and 14 days of exposure to Ag together with an increase in the digestive epithelium atrophy and lipofuscin content after 7 days of exposure to Ag. The responses detected with the aid of biomarkers integrated in the IBR index showed higher toxicity in oysters exposed to Ag, inducing the dear onset of detoxification processes which also occurred, to a lower extent, in Cu exposed oysters.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis of Chinese GF-3 SAR Quad-Polarization Measurements to Extract Winds in Each Polarization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) and ocean wind sensitivity for Chinese C-band Gaofen-3 (GF-3) quad-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements to facilitate further operational wind extraction from GF-3 data. Data from the GF-3 quad-polarization SAR and collocated winds from both NOAA/NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) atmospheric model and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys were used in the analysis. For NESZ, the co-polarization was slightly higher compared to the cross-polarization. Regarding co-polarization and cross-polarization, NESZ was close to RadarSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 A. Wind sensitivity was analyzed by evaluating the dependence on winds in terms of normalized radar cross-sections (NRCS) and polarization combinations. The closest geophysical model function (GMF) and the polarization ratio (PR) model to GF-3 data were determined by comparing data and the model results. The dependence of co-polarized NRCS on wind speed and azimuth angle was consistent with the proposed GMF models. The combination of CMOD5 and CMOD5.N was considered to be the closest GMF in co-polarization. The cross-polarized NRCS exhibited a strong linear relationship with moderate wind speeds higher than 4 m<bold>s</bold>-1, but a weak correlation with the azimuth angle. The proposed model was considered as the closest GMF in cross-polarization. For polarization combinations, PR and polarization difference (PD) were considered. PR increased only with the incidence angle, whereas PD increased with wind speed and varied with azimuth angle. There were three very close PR models and each can be considered as the closest. Preliminary results indicate that GF-3 quad-polarization data are valid and have the ability to extract winds in each polarization.

TI  - Construction of Multi-Year Time-Series Profiles of Suspended Particulate Inorganic Matter Concentrations Using Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-sedimentary numerical models have been widely employed to derive suspended particulate matter ( SPM) concentrations in coastal and estuarine waters. These hydro-sedimentary models are computationally and technically expensive in nature. Here we have used a computationally less-expensive, well-established methodology of self-organizing maps ( SOMs) along with a hidden Markov model ( HMM) to derive profiles of suspended particulate inorganic matter ( SPIM). The concept of the proposed work is to benefit from all available data sets through the use of fusion methods and machine learning approaches that are able to process a growing amount of available data. This approach is applied to two different data sets entitled " Hidden" and " Observable". The hidden data are composed of 15 months ( 27 September 2007 to 30 December 2008) of hourly SPIM profiles extracted from the Regional Ocean Modeling System ( ROMS). The observable data include forcing parameter variables such as significant wave heights ( Hs and Hs50 ( 50 days)) from the Wavewatch 3-HOMERE database and barotropic currents ( Ubar and Vbar) from the Iberian-Biscay-Irish ( IBI) reanalysis data. These observable data integrate hourly surface samples from 1 February 2002 to 31 December 2012. The time-series profiles of the SPIM have been derived from four different stations in the English Channel by considering 15 months of output hidden data from the ROMS as a statistical representation of the ocean for similar to 11 years. The derived SPIM profiles clearly show seasonal and tidal fluctuations in accordance with the parent numerical model output. The surface SPIM concentrations of the derived model have been validated with satellite remote sensing data. The time series of the modeled SPIM and satellite-derived SPIM show similar seasonal fluctuations. The ranges of concentrations for the four stations are also in good agreement with the corresponding satellite data. The high accuracy of the estimated 25 h average surface SPIM concentrations ( normalized root-mean-square error-NRMSE of less than 16%) is the first step in demonstrating the robustness of the method.

Subterranean mammals, such as bathyergid mole rats, are largely overlooked, despite their high-level exposure to soil-dwelling microbes. Initial assessment of bathyergid reservoir potential was determined using a broad-range 16S rRNA PCR approach, which revealed an 83% PCR-positivity for the 234 bathyergid lung samples evaluated. The presence of the Bacillus cereus complex, a ubiquitous bacterial assemblage, containing pathogenic and zoonotic species, was confirmed through nucleotide sequencing, prior to group- and species-specific PCR sequencing. The latter allowed for enhanced placement and prevalence estimations of Bacillus in four bathyergid species sampled across a range of transformed landscapes in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Two novel Bacillus strains (1 and 2) identified on the basis of the concatenated 16S rRNA-groEL-yeaC data set (2066 nucleotides in length), clustered with B. mycoides (ATCC 6462) and B. weihenstephanensis (WSBC 10204), within a well-supported monophyletic lineage. The levels of co-infection, evaluated with a groEL strain-specific assay, developed specifically for this purpose, were high (71%). The overall Bacillus presence of 17.95% (ranging from 0% for Georychus capensis to 45.35% for Bathyergus suillus) differed significantly between host species (chi(2) = 69.643; df = 3; P < 0.05), being significantly higher in bathyergids sampled near an urban informal settlement (chi(2) = 70.245; df = 3; P < 0.05). The results highlight the sentinel potential of soil-dwelling mammals for monitoring anthropogenically introduced, opportunistic pathogens and the threats they pose to vulnerable communities, particularly in the developing world.

TI  - Prognostic role of histological regression in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Histological regression in primary cutaneous melanoma occurs in 10-35% of cases. Although there is a large body of literature on histological regression and prognosis in melanoma patients, not clear data concerning this feature has been reported. In the current review, a comprehensive overview of the main aspects of regression will be provided. The clinical utility of regression as a prognostic factor has been challenged recently. Nowadays evidences reported that this feature is protective on SLN metastases. Despite its association with poor prognostic factors, it maintained a favourable prognostic role in many different survival studies.

TI  - Secular trends in incidence of acute gastroenteritis in general practice, France, 1991 to 2015.
T2  - Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We analysed 25 years of general practitioner (GP) visits for acute gastroenteritis (AG) surveillance in France, by the GP Sentinelles network. We searched for time trends of acute gastroenteritis incidence during winter periods. Data from emergency departments and drug reimbursement were additional data sources. A time-series analysis was performed using a generalised additive model for all data sources for the winter period. Virological data were incorporated and compared with the three data sources. The cumulative incidence of GP visits for winter AG exhibited an increasing trend from 1991 until 2008, when it reached 6,466 per 100,000 inhabitants. It decreased thereafter to 3,918 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. This decreasing trend was observed for all age groups and confirmed by the generalised additive model. For emergency department visits a decreasing trend was observed from 2004. Drug reimbursement data analyses demonstrated a decreasing trend from when data began in 2009. The incidence reported by GPs and emergency departments was lower following the emergence of norovirus GII.4 2012 (p<0.0001). Winter AG incidences seem to follow long-term rising and decreasing trends that are important to monitor through continuous surveillance to evaluate the impact of prevention strategies, such as future immunisation against acute viral gastroenteritis.

TI  - Analysis of Suspended Particulate Matter and Its Drivers in Sahelian Ponds and Lakes by Remote Sensing (Landsat and MODIS): Gourma Region, Mali
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sahelian region is characterized by significant variations in precipitation, impacting water quantity and quality. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.

TI  - Using WorldView Satellite Imagery to Map Yield in Avocado (<i>Persea americana</i>): A Case Study in Bundaberg, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate pre-harvest estimation of avocado (Persea americana cv. Haas) yield offers a range of benefits to industry and growers. Currently there is no commercial yield monitor available for avocado tree crops and the manual count method used for yield forecasting can be highly inaccurate. Remote sensing using satellite imagery offers a potential means to achieve accurate pre-harvest yield forecasting. This study evaluated the accuracies of high resolution WorldView (WV) 2 and 3 satellite imagery and targeted field sampling for the pre-harvest prediction of total fruit weight (kg<bold>tree</bold>-1) and average fruit size (g) and for mapping the spatial distribution of these yield parameters across the orchard block. WV 2 satellite imagery was acquired over two avocado orchards during 2014, and WV3 imagery was acquired in 2016 and 2017 over these same two orchards plus an additional three orchards. Sample trees representing high, medium and low vigour zones were selected from normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the WV images and sampled for total fruit weight (kg<bold>tree</bold>-1) and average fruit size (g) per tree. For each sample tree, spectral reflectance data was extracted from the eight band multispectral WV imagery and 18 vegetation indices (VIs) derived. Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear regression analysis was applied to each of the derived VIs to determine the index with the strongest relationship to the measured total fruit weight and average fruit size. For all trees measured over the three year period (2014, 2016, and 2017) a consistent positive relationship was identified between the VI using near infrared band one and the red edge band (RENDVI1) to both total fruit weight (kg<bold>tree</bold>-1) (R2 = 0.45, 0.28, and 0.29 respectively) and average fruit size (g) (R2 = 0.56, 0.37, and 0.29 respectively) across all orchard blocks. Separate analysis of each orchard block produced higher R values as well as identifying different optimal VIs for each orchard block and year. This suggests orchard location and growing season are influencing the relationship of spectral reflectance to total fruit weight and average fruit size. Classified maps of avocado yield (kg<bold>tree</bold>-1) and average fruit size per tree (g) were produced using the relationships developed for each orchard block. Using the relationships derived between the measured yield parameters and the optimal VIs, total fruit yield (kg) was calculated for each of the five sampled blocks for the 2016 and 2017 seasons and compared to actual yield at time of harvest and pre-season grower estimates. Prediction accuracies achieved for each block far exceeded those provided by the grower estimates.

TI  - Respecting the LDS/Mormon Minority on Campus: College Students' Attitudes Toward Latter-Day Saints
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints remain a minoritized and marginalized population in the United States at large, a pattern mirrored on the majority of college and university campuses across the United States. This study addresses how social identities, institutional contexts, and intergroup dynamics within the postsecondary education environment contribute to cultivating college students' attitudes toward LDS/Mormons and Mormonism. Using data collected from 13,584 college students attending 52 institutions across the country, the study employs multilevel modeling to examine these relationships. The analyses highlight the importance of productive interreligious contact in a supportive institutional context for shaping out-group attitudes. Affirming the interplay between social identity and intergroup contact, effects on out-group attitudes vary to some extent by religion/worldview. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - Retrieving Total Suspended Matter in Tropical Reservoirs Within a Cascade System With Widely Differing Optical Properties
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is an important indicator of water quality and has an adverse effect on light propagation in the water affecting the primary production. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been widely used to develop numerous semiempirical models all over the world. In this paper, many of these models perform satisfactorily either in a single water body or in many similar turbid water environments, however, their performance drops when data from oligo-to-eutrophic environments are used to monitor all reservoirs simultaneously. Most of them tend to overestimate TSMat low concentration. Two separate model calibrations were used to monitor the spatio-temporal variability of TSM in two oligo-to-eutrophic reservoirs, Nova Avanhandava (Nav) and Barra Bonita (BB), situated in the cascade system of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The exponential model using MODIS band 1 yielded the best accuracy for BB (RMSE = 3.66 mg/L) and MODIS band 1 based linear model showed the best performance for Nav (RMSE = 0.37 mg/L). The distribution of TSM in Nav showed comparatively low and homogenous concentrations for the entire reservoir but the magnitude doubled for a period between May and October. The same seasonal variability occurred in BB showing increased TSM trend in October compared to May, but the spatial variability was not homogeneous because of the runoff from Piracicaba River, which is the main contributor of TSM. Rainfall associated runoff and land use and land cover were the principal factors for TSM variability.

TI  - Mapping Land Cover and Estimating the Grassland Structure in a Priority Area of the Chihuahuan Desert
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A field characterization of the grassland vegetation structure, represented by the coverage of grass canopy (CGC) and the grass height, was carried out during three years (2009-2011) in a priority area for the conservation of grasslands of North America. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM5) images were selected and the information of reflectance was obtained based on the geographical location of each field-sampling site. Linear models, constructed with field and satellite data, with high coefficients of determination for CGC (R-2 = 0.81, R-2 = 0.81 and R-2 = 0.72) and grass height (R-2 = 0.82, R-2 = 0.79 and R-2 = 0.73) were obtained. The maps showed a good level of CGC (>25%) and grass height (>25 cm), except for the year 2009, which presented the lowest values of grass height in the area. According to the Kappa Index, a moderate concordance among the three CGC maps was presented (0.49-0.59). Conversely, weak and moderate concordances were found among the grass height maps (0.36-0.59). It was observed that areas with a high CGC do not necessarily correspond to areas with greater grass height values. Based on the data analyzed in this study, the grassland areas are highly dynamic, structurally heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of the variables does not show a definite pattern. From the information generated, it is possible to determine those areas that are the most important for monitoring to then establish effective strategies for the conservation of these grasslands and the protection of threatened migratory bird species.

TI  - Geomorphologic map of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Mutnaya River, Southeastern Kamchatka, Russia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kamchatka Peninsula-situated in the Pacific "Ring of Fire"-has 29 active and over 400 extinct volcanoes. Since it is situated in the northeastern extremity of Russia, in subarctic climate, the volcanic landforms are overprinted by the 446 glaciers. This research focuses on the 1(st)Mutnaya catchment which drains the southern slopes of two active volcanoes: Avachinsky and Koryaksky. Those volcanoes are a permanent threat for the cities of Petropavlovsk and Elizovo, which are the 2 of 3 cities of the peninsula. Hence, most of the studies carried out in the area dealt with the natural hazards and only few focus on landscape evolution. Thus, the purpose of this study was to elaborate a cartographic approach which integrates classic geomorphology with state of the art GIS and remote sensing techniques. As result, different landforms and related processes have been analysed and included in the first general geomorphologic map of the 1(st)Mutnaya catchment.

TI  - Using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Products to Constrain the Aerosol Type in the Atmospheric Correction Processor MAJA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative use of space-based optical imagery requires atmospheric correction to separate the contributions from the surface and the atmosphere. The MACCS (Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening)-ATCOR (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction) Joint Algorithm, called MAJA, is a numerical tool designed to perform cloud detection and atmospheric correction. For the correction of aerosols effects, MAJA makes an estimate of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) based on multi-temporal and multi-spectral criteria, but there is insufficient information to infer the aerosol type. The current operational version of MAJA uses an aerosol type which is constant with time, and this assumption impacts the quality of the atmospheric correction. In this study, we assess the potential of using an aerosol type derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational analysis. The performances, with and without the CAMS information, are evaluated. Firstly, in terms of the aerosol optical thickness retrievals, a comparison against sunphotometer measurements over several sites indicates an improvement over arid sites, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 28% (from 0.095 to 0.068), although there is a slight degradation over vegetated sites (RMSE increased by 13%, from 0.054 to 0.061). Secondly, a direct validation of the retrieved surface reflectances at the La Crau station (France) indicates a reduction of the relative bias by 2.5% on average over the spectral bands. Thirdly, based on the assumption that surface reflectances vary slowly with time, a noise criterion was set up, exhibiting no improvement over the spectral bands and the validation sites when using CAMS data, partly explained by a slight increase in the surface reflectances themselves. Finally, the new method presented in this study provides a better way of using the MAJA processor in an operational environment because the aerosol type used for the correction is automatically inferred from CAMS data, and is no longer a parameter to be defined in advance.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the development of ontology for satellite databases. First, I create a computational ontology for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Satellite Database (UCSSD for short), called the UCS Satellite Ontology (or UCSSO). Second, in developing UCSSO I show that The Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO) (Rovetto & Kelso 2016)-an existing space domain reference ontology-and related ontology work by the author (Rovetto 2015, 2016) can be used either (i) with a database-specific local ontology such as UCSSO, or (ii) in its stead. In case (i), local ontologies such as UCSSO can reuse SSAO terms, perform term mappings, or extend it. In case (ii), the authors orbital space ontology work, such as the SSAO, is usable by the UCSSD and organizations with other space object catalogs, as a reference ontology suite providing a common semantically-rich domain model. The SSAO, UCSSO, and the broader Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology project is online at https://purl.org/space-ontology and GitHub. This ontology effort aims, in part, to provide accurate formal representations of the domain for various applications. Ontology engineering has the potential to facilitate the sharing and integration of satellite data from federated databases and sensors for safer spaceflight.

TI  - Adjustment of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Red-Edge Band Reflectance to Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and Quantification of Red-Edge Band BRDF Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical wavelength satellite data have directional reflectance effects over non-Lambertian surfaces, described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) acquires data over a 20.6 degrees field of view that have been shown to have non-negligible BRDF effects in the visible, near-infrared, and short wave infrared bands. MSI red-edge BRDF effects have not been investigated. In this study, they are quantified by an examination of 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.7 million (April 2016) pairs of forward and back scatter reflectance observations extracted over approximately 20 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa. Non-negligible MSI red-edge BRDF effects up to 0.08 (reflectance units) across the 290 km wide MSI swath are documented. A recently published MODIS BRDF parameter c-factor approach to adjust MSI visible, near-infrared, and short wave infrared reflectance to nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) is adapted for application to the MSI red-edge bands. The red-edge band BRDF parameters needed to implement the algorithm are provided. The parameters are derived by a linear wavelength interpolation of fixed global MODIS red and NIR BRDF model parameters. The efficacy of the interpolation is investigated using POLDER red, red-edge, and NIR BRDF model parameters, and is shown to be appropriate for the c-factor NBAR generation approach. After adjustment to NBAR, red-edge MSI BRDF effects were reduced for the January data (acquired close to the solar principal where BRDF effects are maximal) and the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) for all the MSI red-edge bands.

TI  - Estimation of the Spatial and Habitat Distribution of Anseriformes in the Yamal-Nenets and Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Regions (Experience from the Use of Ultralight Aircrafts)
T2  - BIOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In Russia, the conservation of anseriformes is possible through the creation of temporary huntingfree zones during hunting season, especially in spring. A justification for creating such zones and outlining their boundaries (by analogy with the experience derived from the countries on North America) each season must be based on data on annual waterfowl monitoring. The present paper describes census experience drawn from the use of ultralight aviation for further delineating the key staging sites of waterfowl in western Siberia. To refine the duration of monitoring, observation data were combined with those derived from geese equipped with GSM-GPS transmitters. In the spring and autumn of 2012-2014, we covered over 50000 km of aerial surveys of 25 waterfowl species. A new method is advanced for assessing their numbers based on visual observations, flock photography, and modern statistics. We estimated the species densities in 16 habitat types delineated on the basis of Landsat imagery. In terms of this, a system is proposed for extrapolating the survey data on 25 waterfowl species onto model sites in western Siberia. Drops in the numbers of several mass game species were noted. Based on an evaluation of the habitat quality, ten waterfowl hunting-free zones were suggested and delineated. A GIS project was launched that incorporated the main migration routes, boundaries of the key sites, places of mass bird aggregations, and sites for the observation of rare, Red Data Book. A program of long-term monitoring and sustainable use of waterfowl in the study region is offered. Such an approach must also be applied to other regions of Russia.

T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the extensive archaeological surveys carried out in the last decades, little attention has been paid to one of the longest water supply systems of ancient times - the Byzantine water infrastructure which fed Constantinople from the mid-late fourth century AD. This work uses modern satellite terrain data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data to assess this system and provide an improved description of its route, total length and gradient profile. Forty-four validated GPS Control Points were correlated with ASTER GDEM V2 digital satellite data and archaeological information in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. We concluded that the total length of the water supply system was 426 km, and possibly even 565 km if the fifth-century aqueduct continued in parallel all the way to Constantinople rather than merging with the fourth-century aqueduct. The gradient of the channels varied across their length, being steepest near the spring sources, with a gradient mostly in the region of 5 m/km, and flattest at around 0.4 m/km in the most downstream section nearest the City. This reconstruction of the gradient profile provides valuable insight into the physical characteristics of the system, allowing future study of its hydraulic function.

TI  - Evaluation of the Variability of the Shoreline of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir and Lake Ilmen according to Space Sounding Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results of a study of the dynamics of the shorelines of Lake Ilmen and the Tsimlyansk Reservoir to indicate the location of the boundaries of the water protection zone. The study uses the method of processing information from Terra/MODIS, Landsat-7 and -8, and WorldView-1 space systems. The analysis of remote-sensing data reveal the off-season and yearly variability in the area of the surface and shoreline, which is characteristic of water bodies under flat relief conditions. On the basis of the results of the research, the issue of the necessity of allocating a water protection zone, taking into account the morphometric features of water bodies and the characteristics of their hydrological regime, followed by amendments to the Water Code of the Russian Federation, is posed.

TI  - Inventory of Close-to-Nature Forests Based on the Combination of Airborne LiDAR Data and Aerial Multispectral Images Using a Single-Tree Approach
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is concerned with the assessment of application possibilities for remote sensing data within a forest inventory in close-to-nature forests. A combination of discrete airborne laser scanning data and multispectral aerial images separately evaluated main tree and forest stand characteristics (i.e., the number of trees, mean height and diameter, tree species, tree height, tree diameter, and tree volume). We used eCognition software (Trimble GeoSpatial, Munich, Germany) for tree species classification and reFLex software (National Forest Centre, Zvolen, Slovakia) for individual tree detection as well as for forest inventory attribute estimations. The accuracy assessment was conducted at the ProSilva demo site Smolnicka Osada (Eastern Slovakia, Central Europe), which has been under selective management for more than 60 years. The remote sensing data were taken using a scanner (Leica ALS70-CM) and camera (Leica RCD30) from an average height of 1034 m, and the ground reference data contained the measured positions and dimensions of 1151 trees in 45 plots distributed across the region. This approach identified 73% of overstory and 28% of understory trees. Tree species classification within overstory trees resulted in an overall accuracy slightly greater than 65%. We also found that the mean difference between the remote-based results and ground data was -0.3% for tree height, 1.1% for tree diameter, and 1.9% for stem volume. At the stand level, the mean difference reached values of 0.4%, 17.9%, and -21.4% for mean height, mean diameter, and growing stock, respectively.

TI  - Combination of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and Single-Baseline Polarimetric Coherence Optimisation to Estimate Deformation Rates with Application to Tehran Basin
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports on the monitoring of land subsidence in a rural area located in the southwest of the Tehran basin, Iran, by combining a persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method with a single-baseline polarimetric coherence optimisation. Owing to vegetation coverage in this rural area, coherence level experiences a decline and the performance and coverage of conventional interferometry to estimate deformation rate reduces concomitantly. Since the launch of satellites with polarimetric information, the polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) technique, which is vector interferometry with different polarimetric channels, has been introduced to optimise the coherence level. One of the most common criteria to select PS pixels is coherence and maximising the coherence can lead to an increased number of selected PS pixels and enhanced PSI performance. The single-baseline polarimetric coherence optimisation method assumes equal polarisation states at the end of each baseline. In order to apply this technique in our study, two different multi-look windows for coherence calculation and also two TerraSAR-X data sets with different numbers of images are used to assess their effect on the polarimetric PSI. Combination of the single-baseline coherence optimisation method with PSI shows significant improvements (more than 50%) in terms of the number of selected PS pixels in the case study even using a data set with a small number of images. A 15 x 15 multi-look window selects a greater number of PS pixels compared to a 9 x 9 multi-look window, although this entails reducing spatial resolution. The most effective PSI approach in terms of the density of the selected PS turned out to be polarimetric PSI using a data set with a large number of images and a selection of a 15 x 15 multi-look window. Validation of the PSI methods using a large number of images with 9 x 9 and 15 x 15 multi-look windows via levelling measurements confirms the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained.

TI  - Landsat-8 TIRS Data for Assessing Urban Heat Island Effect and Its Impact on Human Health
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat waves are reaching our cities more frequently nowadays, leading to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Measured by the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), the effect is frequently called surface UHI (SUHI). In Estonia, the SUHI has been studied little and the LST method has not being used yet in studies of Estonian cities' microclimate. The analysis clearly reveals that the effect of UHI in Estonian settlements is larger than ever assumed. Satellite images showed that Tallinn suffers from quite strong UHI effect. Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor image from July 25, 2014 shows that for all settlements of densely populated Harju County, the temperature is higher than that in the surroundings by 3 degrees C-5 degrees C. To evaluate potential impact to the health of vulnerable groups of residents of Tallinn city, we applied an "exposure to risk-sensitivity-impact" method to evaluate the potential impact of the UHI effect on the health of vulnerable groups of residents of Tallinn city. Our analysis showed that the parts of Tallinn severely affected by heat are mostly the areas of apartment buildings with lower real estate prices. Thus, those areas have also a higher population density and more vulnerable people live there. Produced map of UHI impact can be successfully used for spatial planning measures for adaptation to climate change.

TI  - BG-SENTINEL™ TRAP EFFICACY AS A COMPONENT OF PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR PUSH-PULL CONTROL STRATEGY FOR DENGUE VECTOR MOSQUITOES
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of the BG-Sentinel (TM) (BGS) trap as a "pull'' component of a "push-pull'' system (PPS) for management of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, was evaluated using local households in Pu Tuey, Kanchanaburi, Thailand. The pull component was the concluding phase of a 3-part investigation using a PPS combination spatial repellent (SR) and BGS trap to capture adult vector mosquitoes. Two sentinel households were selected for evaluation of BGS trap efficacy based on the highest pretrial indoor resting densities of Ae. aegypti using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mechanical backpack collections. Potential Ae. aegypti resting sites around the selected houses were identified as possible competing sites that might influence the BGS trap capture efficiency. Results showed that BGS traps were productive in capturing Ae. aegypti females (93.4% of all Aedes collected) in the presence of competing man-made, artificial resting sites. The CDC backpack aspirator collections provided an indirect measure of local Aedes population, although technically not comparable for supporting productivity of BGS traps due to different collection days and households sampled. The predominant competing resting sites were water containers found within 3 m around the outside of sentinel households. The most productive BGS collections between houses differed by location. The most productive period of operation for Ae. aegypti BGS trapping was between 1330 and 1730 h. The BGS trap appears an effective "pull'' device in the PPS strategy in natural settings.

TI  - Applying Model Parameters as a Driving Force to a Deterministic Nonlinear System to Detect Land Cover Change
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new method for extracting features from time-series satellite data to detect land cover change. We propose to make use of the behavior of a deterministic nonlinear system driven by a time-dependent force. The driving force comprises a set of concatenated model parameters regressed from fitting a model to a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series. The goal is to create behavior in the nonlinear deterministic system, which appears predictable for the time series undergoing no change, while erratic for the time series undergoing land cover change. The differential equation used for the deterministic nonlinear system is that of a largeamplitude pendulum, where the displacement angle is observed over time. If there has been no change in the land cover, the mean driving force will approximate zero, and hence the pendulum will behave as if in free motion under the influence of gravity only. If, however, there has been a change in the land cover, this will for a brief initial period introduce a nonzero mean driving force, which does work on the pendulum, changing its energy and future evolution, which we demonstrate is observable. This we show is sufficient to introduce an observable change to the state of the pendulum, thus enabling change detection. We extend this method to a higher dimensional differential equation to improve the false alarm rate in our experiments. Numerical results show a change detection accuracy of nearly 96% when detecting new human settlements, with a corresponding false alarm rate of 0.2% (omission error rate of 4%). This compares very favorably with other published methods, which achieved less than 90% detection but with false alarm rates all above 9% (omission error rate of 66%).

TI  - Evaluating links between deformation, topography and surface temperature at volcanic domes: Results from a multi-sensor study at Volcan de Colima, Mexico
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dome building activity is common at many volcanoes and due to the gravitational instability, a dome represents one of the most hazardous volcanic phenomena. Shallow volcanic processes as well as rheological and structural changes of the dome affecting the fluid transport have been linked to transitions in eruptive activity. Also, hydrothermal alteration may affect the structural integrity of the dome, increasing the potential for collapse. However, mapping the deformation and details of fluid escape at the summit of steep sloped volcanoes and integrating these with other types of data is challenging due to difficult access and poor coverage. Here we present for the first time the near-vertical and near horizontal surface deformation field of a quiescent summit dome and the relationships with degassing and topographic patterns. Our results are derived from high resolution satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) time series based on a year of TerraSAR-X SpotLight acquisitions and Structure from Motion (SfM) processing of overflight infrared data at Volcan de Colima, Mexico. The identified deformation is dominated by localized heterogeneous subsidence of the summit dome exceeding rates of 15 cm/yr, and strongly decreasing over the year 2012, up to the renewal of explosive and extrusive activity in early 2013. We tentatively attribute the deformation to the degassing, cooling and contraction of the dome and shallow conduit material. We also find that the results strongly differ depending on the chosen InSAR time series method, which potentially overprints the true physical complexities of small scale, shallow deformation processes. The combined interpretation of the deformation and infrared data reveals a complex spatial relationship between the degassing pathways and the deformation. While we observe no deformation across the crater rim fumaroles, discontinuities in the deformation field are more commonly observed around the dome rim fumaroles and occasionally on the dome upper surface. We propose that the deformation pattern is also linked to processes controlling the fumarole formation and distribution (topography, permeability and volcanic activity), and the lack of direct relationships may be explained by how the influence of these processes varies across the volcanic summit. The presented work provides a new approach for safely monitoring the activity and stability of internal dome structures, as well as for constraining and validating models of dome degassing pathways and densification processes.

TI  - Discrimination between acute and chronic decline of Central European forests using map algebra of the growth condition and forest biomass fuzzy sets: A case study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest decline is either caused by damage or else by vulnerability due to unfavourable growth conditions or due to unnatural silvicultural systems. Here, we assess forest decline in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) using fuzzy functions, fuzzy sets and fuzzy rating of ecosystem properties over a 1 x 1 km grid. The model was divided into fuzzy functions of the abiotic predictors of growth conditions (F-pred including temperature, precipitation, acid deposition, soil data and relative site insolation) and forest biomass receptors (F-rec including remote sensing data, density and volume of aboveground biomass, and surface humus chemical data). Fuzzy functions were designed at the limits of unfavourable, undetermined or favourable effects on the forest ecosystem health status. Fuzzy sets were distinguished through similarity in a particular membership of the properties at the limits of the forest status margins. Fuzzy rating was obtained from the least difference of F-pred - F-rec. Unfavourable F-pred within unfavourable F-rec indicated chronic damage, favourable F-pred within unfavourable F-rec indicated acute damage, and unfavourable F-pred within favourable F-rec indicated vulnerability. The model in the 1 x 1 km grid was validated through spatial intersection with a point field of uniform forest stands. Favourable status was characterised by soil base saturation (BS) > 50%, BCC/Al > 1, C-org > 1%, MgO > 6 g/kg, and nitrogen deposition < 1200 mol (H+)/ha.year. Vulnerable forests had BShumus 46-60%, BCC/AI 9-20 and NDVI approximate to 0.42. Chronic forest damage occurs in areas with low temperatures, high nitrogen deposition, and low soil BS and C-org levels. In the Czech Republic, 10% of forests were considered non-damaged and 77% vulnerable, with damage considered acute in 7% of forests and chronic in 5%. The fuzzy model used suggests that improvement in forest health will depend on decreasing environmental load and restoration concordance between growth conditions and tree species composition.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Health and spread of natural forest is decreasing over time, especially in the developing nations. Without knowing information about actual status of forest cover and its dynamics it would not be easy to control rate of degradation and associated global warming. In this regard, the study attempts to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics in forest cover in Jharkhand state since its formation (i.e., year 2000) with the help of time-series tree cover information. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) based Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data for 15 years of time-period are analysed. Negative changes (i.e., decrease in the forest cover) were observed mainly in the Latehar, Lohardaga and West Singhbhum districts of Jharkhand, and positive changes were observed over majority of the forested regions of the state during the study period 2000-2014. Interestingly, negative changes were dominant (over similar to 1000 km(2)) during the initial period 2000-2008, and the later half revealed positive changes (over similar to 1400 km(2)). The forest cover report published by Forest Survey India during 2001 and 2015 has also revealed overall increase in the forest cover of Jharkhand.

AB  - A correlation analysis of the model calculations and experimental measurements of wind-speed sensitivity of a rough sea-surface microwave emission at a frequency of 37.5 GHz are presented. The field data used in the research were collected over 3 years in the summer and autumn periods at the oceanographic platform of the Marine Hydrophysical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). A hypothesis about a significant correlation between the model calculations and experimentally measured sea-surface emission ability caused by wind forcing was formulated and tested to reveal this correlation. An evaluation of the discrepancy between the model and experimental data has been performed by an analysis of residuals. Our studies have shown that among the selected models not a single one adequately describes the experimental data.

TI  - Fit to predict? Eco-informatics for predicting the catchability of a pelagic fish in near real time
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean is a dynamic environment inhabited by a diverse array of highly migratory species, many of which are under direct exploitation in targeted fisheries. The timescales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and ecological forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990-2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the California drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence-absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Swordfish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters (>1,500m) with surface temperatures in the 14-20 degrees C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20-40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon (<20% lunar illumination). We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence-absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotemporally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.

TI  - Spatio-temporal topsoil organic carbon mapping of a semi-arid Mediterranean region: The role of land use, soil texture, topographic indices and the influence of remote sensing data to modelling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - SOC is the most important indicator of soil fertility and monitoring its space-time changes is a prerequisite to establish strategies to reduce soil loss and preserve its quality. Here we modelled the topsoil (0-0.3m) SOC concentration of the cultivated area of Sicily in 1993 and 2008. Sicily is an extremely variable region with a high number of ecosystems, soils, and microclimates. We studied the role of time and land use in the modelling of SOC, and assessed the role of remote sensing (RS) covariates in the boosted regression trees modelling. The models obtained showed a high pseudo-R-2 (0.63-0.69) and low uncertainty (s.d. < 0.76 g C kg(-1) with RS, and < 1.25 g C kg(-1) without RS). These outputs allowed depicting a time variation of SOC at 1 arcsec. SOC estimation strongly depended on the soil texture, land use, rainfall and topographic indices related to erosion and deposition. RS indices captured one fifth of the total variance explained, slightly changed the ranking of variance explained by the non-RS predictors, and reduced the variability of the model replicates. During the study period, SOC decreased in the areas with relatively high initial SOC, and increased in the area with high temperature and low rainfall, dominated by arables. This was likely due to the compulsory application of some Good Agricultural and Environmental practices. These results confirm that the importance of texture and land use in short-term SOC variation is comparable to climate. The present results call for agronomic and policy intervention at the district level to maintain fertility and yield potential. In addition, the present results suggest that the application of RS covariates enhanced the modelling performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute gastroenteritis (AG) leads to considerable burden of disease, health care costs and socio-economic impact worldwide. We assessed the frequency of medical consultations and work absenteeism due to AG at primary care level, and physicians' case management using the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network "Sentinella".During the 1-year, longitudinal study in 2014, 172 physicians participating in "Sentinella" reported consultations due to AG including information on clinical presentation, stool diagnostics, treatment, and work absenteeism.An incidence of 2146 first consultations due to AG at primary care level per 100,000 inhabitants in Switzerland was calculated for 2014 based on reported 3.9 thousand cases. Physicians classified patients' general condition at first consultation with a median score of 7 (1 = poor, 10 = good). The majority (92%) of patients received dietary recommendations and/or medical prescriptions; antibiotics were prescribed in 8.5%. Stool testing was initiated in 12.3% of cases; more frequently in patients reporting recent travel. Among employees (15-64 years), 86.3% were on sick leave. Median duration of sick leave was 4 days.The burden of AG in primary care is high and comparable with that of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Switzerland. Work absenteeism is substantial, leading to considerable socio-economic impact. Mandatory infectious disease surveillance underestimates the burden of AG considering that stool testing is not conducted routinely. While a national strategy to reduce the burden of ILI exists, similar comprehensive prevention efforts should be considered for AG.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags were used to produce a global Open Land Cover (OLC) product with fractional data gaps available at osmlanduse.org. Data gaps in the global OLC map were filled for a case study in Heidelberg, Germany using free remote sensing data, which resulted in a land cover (LC) prototype with complete coverage in this area. Sixty tags in the OSM were used to allocate a Corine Land Cover (CLC) level 2 land use classification to 91.8% of the study area, and the remaining gaps were filled with remote sensing data. For this case study, complete are coverage OLC overall accuracy was estimated 87%, which performed better than the CLC product (81% overall accuracy) of 2012. Spatial thematic overlap for the two products was 84%. OLC was in large parts found to be more detailed than CLC, particularly when LC patterns were heterogeneous, and outperformed CLC in the classification of 12 of the 14 classes. Our OLC product represented data created in different periods; 53% of the area was 2011-2016, and 46% of the area was representative of 2016-2017.

TI  - Measuring canopy loss and climatic thresholds from an extreme drought along a fivefold precipitation gradient across Texas
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, trees are increasingly dying from extreme drought, a trend that is expected to increase with climate change. Loss of trees has significant ecological, biophysical, and biogeochemical consequences. In 2011, a record drought caused widespread tree mortality in Texas. Using remotely sensed imagery, we quantified canopy loss during and after the drought across the state at 30-m spatial resolution, from the eastern pine/hardwood forests to the western shrublands, a region that includes the boundaries of many species ranges. Canopy loss observations in similar to 200 multitemporal fine-scale orthophotos (1-m) were used to train coarser Landsat imagery (30-m) to create 30-m binary statewide canopy loss maps. We found that canopy loss occurred across all major ecoregions of Texas, with an average loss of 9.5%. The drought had the highest impact in post oak woodlands, pinyon-juniper shrublands and Ashe juniper woodlands. Focusing on a 100-km by similar to 1,000-km transect spanning the State's fivefold east-west precipitation gradient (similar to 1,500 to similar to 300 mm), we compared spatially explicit 2011 climatic anomalies to our canopy loss maps. Much of the canopy loss occurred in areas that passed specific climatic thresholds: warm season anomalies in mean temperature (+1.6 degrees C) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, +0.66 kPa), annual percent deviation in precipitation (-38%), and 2011 difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (-1,206 mm). Although similarly low precipitation occurred during the landmark 1950s drought, the VPD and temperature anomalies observed in 2011 were even greater. Furthermore, future climate data under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 trajectory project that average values will surpass the 2011 VPD anomaly during the 2070-2099 period and the temperature anomaly during the 2040-2099 period. Identifying vulnerable ecological systems to drought stress and climate thresholds associated with canopy loss will aid in predicting how forests will respond to a changing climate and how ecological landscapes will change in the near term.

TI  - Medical complexity and placement outcomes for children in foster care
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Medical complexity threatens placement stability and permanency outcomes for children in foster care (FC). This study aimed to characterize for US children in FC: 1) medical complexity, using number of diagnosed types of disability as a proxy; 2) demographic and removal characteristics based on level of complexity; and 3) whether increasing levels of complexity were associated with foster care placement outcomes.Methods: The analysis included children in FC, ages 0-21 whose disability status was clinically assessed and documented (rt = 538,695). Using data from the FY 2014 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, medical complexity was categorized (0-4 +) based on 5 disability types: emotional, hearing/vision, intellectual, physical, and other. Bivariate analyses (chi(2) tests, Kruskall-Wallis) compared the distribution of demographic and removal characteristics among complexity groups. Multiple logistic regression evaluated relationships between medical complexity and placement outcomes, including length of stay in FC, placement stability, and permanency.Results: Twenty-three percent of the sample had 1 disability type, 7% had 2, 3% had 3, 1% had 4 +, and 67% had no disability. Children with increasing complexity were more likely to be older, older on FC entry, male, Black, non-Hispanic, placed in a group home or institution, have abuse, neglect, and/or child disability/behavior as reason for removal, and have poor placement outcomes.Conclusion: Children in FC with greater medical complexity are at risk for undesirable placement outcomes. By recognizing and addressing the unique needs of this vulnerable population, pediatric providers and child welfare staff may identify strategies to improve placement outcomes.

TI  - Satellite-based water use dynamics using historical Landsat data (1984-2014) in the southwestern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) maps are useful for characterizing water use patterns and assessing crop performance. The relative impact of climate variability and water management decisions are better studied and quantified using historical data that are derived using a set of consistent datasets and methodology. Historical (1984-2014) Landsat-based ET maps were generated for major irrigation districts in California, i.e., Palo Verde and eight other sub-basins in parts of the middle and lower Central Valley. A total of 3396 Landsat images were processed using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model that integrates weather and remotely sensed images to estimate monthly and annual ET within the study sites over the 31 years. Model output evaluation and validation using gridded-flux data and water balance ET approaches indicated relatively good correspondence (R-2 up to 0.88, root mean square error as low as 14 mm/month) between SSEBop ET and validation datasets. In a pairwise comparison, annual variability of agro-hydrologic parameters of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (T-s), and runoff (Q) were found to be more variable than their corresponding climatic counterparts of atmospheric water demand (ETo), air temperature (T-a), and precipitation (P), revealing process differences between regional climatic drivers and localized agro-hydrologic responses. However, only To showed a consistent increase (up to 1.2 K) over study sites during the 31 years, whereas other climate variables such as ET, and P showed a generally neutral trend. This study demonstrates a useful application of "Big Data" science where large volumes of historical Landsat and weather datasets were used to quantify and understand the relative importance of water management and climate variability in crop water use dynamics in regards to the linkages among water management decisions, hydrologic processes and economic transactions. Irrigation district-wide ET estimates were used to compute historical crop water use volumes and monetary equivalents of water savings for the Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID). During the peak crop fallowing year in PVID, the water saved reached a maximum of similar to 107,200 acre-feet in 2011 with an estimated monetary payout value of $20.5 million. A significant decreasing trend in actual ET despite an increasing atmospheric demand in PVID highlights the role of management decisions in affecting local hydrologic processes. This study has importance for planning water resource allocation, managing water rights, sustaining agricultural production, and quantifying impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water resources. With increased computational efficiency, similar studies can be conducted in other parts of the world to help policy and decision makers understand and quantify various aspects of water resources management.

TI  - Evaluation of Australian surveillance for freedom from bovine tuberculosis
T2  - AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAustralia declared freedom from bovine tuberculosis (TB) in accordance with international guidelines in 1997 and has since maintained ongoing surveillance for this disease, primarily through abattoir surveillance of cattle carcases (meat inspection) for TB-like granulomas. The objectives of this study were to estimate the sensitivity of Australia's surveillance system and quantify the probability that Australia is free from bovine TB at the specified design prevalence.MethodsThe analysis included approximately 80 million records of individual cattle slaughtered and meat inspected at Australian abattoirs between 2005 and 2015 calendar years. Animals were identified and aggregated by property of birth within year. Herd- and population-level sensitivities and probability of freedom were estimated on an annual basis using a simulation model to account for uncertainty about the unit sensitivity of the meat inspection process.ResultsThe estimated median population sensitivity of Australia's TB surveillance system varied from a high of 80%, in years when traditional meat inspection was used, to as low as 50% after the introduction of visual-only meat inspection, for a design prevalence of 0.01% (19 herds) of Australian breeding cattle herds and 0.5% of animals within infected herds. The level of confidence in Australia's freedom from bovine TB was >95% after the first year of the analysis and >99.5% from 2007 through to the end of the analysis period in 2015. Reducing the animal-level or herd-level design prevalence, or the estimated sensitivity of meat inspection, reduced system sensitivity but confidence of disease freedom remained high.ConclusionThe results demonstrated a very high level of confidence that Australia's cattle herd is truly free from bovine TB. Meat inspection for granulomas in the head and thorax of slaughtered cattle underpins this result by providing surveillance data on an extremely large number of animals each year.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study examined spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) carried out using ground based measurements (Microtops-II) and satellite data (MODIS&MISR) over Dehradun, part of Northwest Himalayas during January-December 2015. During premonsoon the region experiences high mean AOD(500) (0.34 +/- 0.09 to 0.63 +/- 0.12) along with low mean Angstrom exponent (alpha) (0.46 +/- 0.09 to 0.66 +/- 0.10) attributing to the dominance of mineral dust aerosols while moderate mean AOD(500) and a during monsoon and postmonsoon season are (0.38 +/- 0.08 to 0.54 +/- 0.16) and (0.78 +/- 0.1 to 0.91 +/- 0.11), respectively, indicating mixed type aerosols. During winter season low mean AOD(500) (0.29 +/- 0.06 to 0.46 +/- 0.12) and high mean alpha (1.12 +/- 0.09 to 1.30 +/- 0.1) is observed due to domination of fine mode aerosols coming from anthropogenic activities and agricultural biomass burning. Aerosol transport pathways were analyzed and complimented with Hysplit air mass back trajectory. Comparison of satellite derived AOD agrees well with Microtops measurements (R = 0.80 and 0.71 for MODIS and MISR, respectively). MODIS data were used to generate spatial and seasonal distribution of AOD over northwest Himalayans and validated over selected stations in the region. The results show that AOD values are in agreement within an error of 11%-14% over entire region. The monthly and seasonal radiative forcing (ARF) was estimated over selected stations in the region. The annualmean atmospheric ARF over Dehradun was estimated to + 25.83 W m(-2), while + 30.83 W m(-2) over Patiala, and + 14.97 W m(-2) over Kullu. The ratio of Surface to TOA forcing is found to be similar to 2.4 to 3.7 indicating absorbing nature of aerosols predominantly existing over Northwest Himalayas.

TI  - Coseismic deformation field of the Jiuzhaigou <i>M<sub>s</sub></i>7.0 earthquake from Sentinel-1A InSAR data and fault slip inversion
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - We processed the Sentinel-1A/IW data with InSAR technology and generated the surface deformation fields caused by Jiuzhaigou M(s)7.0 earthquake occurred on August 8 2017. The result shows that the overall deformation field caused by this event follows the NW direction. Main deformation region is about 50 km X 50 km delimited by Tazang, Minjiang and Huya faults. The maximum displacement reaches about 14 cm, and the minimum value is about 22 cm in LOS. The displacement field indicates a left-lateral strike-slip movement of seismogenic fault. Based on ascending InSAR deformation field only, we carried out the slip distribution inversion by using a fault model with single fault plane and medium dip angle. The inversion results indicate an obvious slip concentrated area located in 1 similar to 15 km in depth. The maximum slip is about 0.86 m. The moment magnitude is M(w)6.5, consistent with previous results from seismic data inversion provided by USGS. We can see that the rupture of this event has filled the rupture gap of four earthquakes larger than M(W)6.0 occurred in 1973 and 1976. The coseismic Coulomb stress change shows that the rupture has produced two stress increasing zones in the depth of 10 km, similar to(3 similar to 5) X 10(5) Pa. This will increase the possibility of aftershocks in this area. A large stress decreasing zone delimited by Minjiang and Tazang fault indicates the releasing of accumulated stress before the rupture. Thus, the possibility to trigger further strong aftershocks in this region is relatively small.

TI  - Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Modeling Using the Synergy of Airborne LiDAR and Satellite Optical and SAR Data to Map Forest Above-Ground Biomass
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely, spatially complete, and reliable forest aboveground biomass (AGB) data are a prerequisite to support forest management and policy formulation. Traditionally, forest AGB is spatially estimated by integrating satellite images, in particular, optical data, with field plots from forest inventory programs. However, field data are limited in remote and unmanaged areas. In addition, optical reflectance usually saturates at high-density biomass level and is subject to cloud contaminations. Thus, this study aimed to developa deep learning based workflow for mapping forest AGB by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. A reference AGB map was derived from the wall-to-wall LiDAR data and field measurements. The LiDAR plots-stratified random samples of forest biomass extracted from the LiDAR simulated strips in the reference map-were adopted as a surrogate for traditional field plots. In addition to the deep learning model, i.e., stacked sparse autoencoder network (SSAE), five different prediction techniques including multiple stepwise linear regressions, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, back propagation neural networks, and random forest were individually used to establish the relationship between LiDAR-derived forest biomass and the satellite predictors. Optical variables (Landsat 8 OLI), SAR variables (Sentinel-1A), and their combined variables were individually input to the six prediction models. Results showed that the SSAE model had the best performance forthe forest biomass estimation. The combined optical and microwave dataset as explanatory variables improved the modeling performance compared to either the optical-only or microwave-only data, regardless of prediction algorithms. The best mapping accuracy was obtained by the SSAE model with inputs of optical and microwave integrated metrics that yielded R-2 of 0.812, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.753 Mg/ha, and relative RMSE (RMSEr) of 14.457%. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of combined Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1A information could result in accurate estimation of forest biomass by using the stratification-sampled and LiDAR-derived AGB as ground reference data. The modeling workflow has the potential to promote future forest growth monitoring and carbon stock assessment across large areas.

TI  - A study of the middle atmospheric thermal structure over western India: Satellite data and comparisons with models
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long term variations of the middle atmospheric thermal structure in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (20-90 km) have been studied over Ahmedabad (23.1 degrees N, 72.3 degrees E, 55 m amsl), India using SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) onboard TIMED (Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics and Dynamics) observations during year 2002 to year 2014. For the same period, three different atmospheric models show over-estimation of temperature (similar to 10 K) near the stratopause and in the upper mesosphere, and a signature of under-estimation is seen above mesopause when compared against SABER measured temperature profiles. Estimation of monthly temperature anomalies reveals a semiannual and ter-annual oscillation moving downward from the mesosphere to the stratosphere during January to December. Moreover, Lomb Scargle periodogram (LSP) and Wavelet transform techniques are employed to characterize the semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations to diagnose the wave dynamics in the stratosphere-mesosphere system. Results suggested that semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations are exist in stratosphere, whereas, semi-annual and annual oscillations are observed in mesosphere. In lower mesosphere, LSP analyses revealed conspicuous absence of annual oscillations in altitude range of 55-65 km, and semi-annual oscillations are not existing in 35-45 km. Four monthly oscillations are also reported in the altitude range of about 45-65 km. The temporal localization of oscillations using wavelet analysis shows strong annual oscillation during year 2004-2006 and 2009-2011. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determination of the Downwelling Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient of Lake Water with the Sentinel-3A OLCI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) on the Sentinel-3A satellite, which was launched by the European Space Agency in 2016, is a new-generation water color sensor with a spatial resolution of 300 m and 21 bands in the range of 400-1020 nm. The OLCI is important to the expansion of remote sensing monitoring of inland waters using water color satellite data. In this study, we developed a dual band ratio algorithm for the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) for the waters of Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China, based on data measured during seven surveys conducted between 2008 and 2017 in combination with Sentinel-3A-OLCI data. The results show that: (1) Compared to the available K-d(490) estimation algorithms, the dual band ratio (681 nm/560 nm and 754 nm/560 nm) algorithm developed in this study had a higher estimation accuracy (N = 26, coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.81, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.99 m(-1) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 19.55%) and validation accuracy (N = 14, R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 1.06 m(-1) and MAPE = 27.30%), making it more suitable for turbid inland waters; (2) A comparison of the OLCI K-d(490) product and a similar Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product reveals a high consistency between the OLCI and MODIS products in terms of the spatial distribution of K-d(490). However, the OLCI product has a smoother spatial distribution and finer textural characteristics than the MODIS product and contains notably higher-quality data; (3) The K-d(490) values for Lake Taihu exhibit notable spatial and temporal variations. K-d(490) is higher in seasons with relatively high wind speeds and in open waters that are prone to wind- and wave-induced sediment resuspension. Finally, the Sentinel-3A-OLCI has a higher spatial resolution and is equipped with a relatively wide dynamic range of spectral bands suitable for inland waters. The Sentinel-3B satellite will be launched soon and, together with the Sentinel-3A satellite, will form a two-satellite network with the ability to make observations twice every three days. This satellite network will have a wider range of application and play an important role in the monitoring of inland waters with complex optical properties.

TI  - The spatial distribution of hydrogen ions at topside ionosphere in local daytime
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using DEMETER and DMSP satellite data, the spatial distribution of hydrogen ion (H+) in local daytime has been compared and analyzed. At 840 km of DMSP height, the seasonal variations of H (+)density is basically symmetric, with similar density values near to the magnetic equator at northern hemisphere in December and at southern hemisphere in June. But at DEMETER satellite height, the peak H+ density shows obvious enhancement at northern hemisphere in December solstice, while with approximate small values at both hemispheres in June. This spatial distribution feature is totally different with other ions such as O+ and He+ at the topside ionosphere. And also it influences the transition height in topside ionosphere, with lower transition height over northern hemisphere in December season at 10 - 20 degrees N than those at equator and over southern hemisphere in June season. The solstitial asymmetry index (AI) of H+ at 670 km altitude gives the significant December season enhancement over northern hemisphere, which is typically reversed with electron density (Ne) and ion density (Ni) with large numbers over southern hemisphere in December season. Finally combining with the distribution of H atoms and neutral wind velocity in upper atmosphere, the forming mechanism and asymmetry feature of peak H+ density is discussed. It is illustrated that the upwelling movement at equatorial area and northward neutral wind play important roles in H+ peak drift in December season at DEMETER satellite altitude below the transition height where H+ is not the main composition in die local daytime in solar minimum years.

TI  - Investigating a reservoir bank slope displacement history with multi-frequency satellite SAR data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope instability arisen along with dam construction is a common problem of great concern in reservoir areas. Thus, displacement monitoring of active slopes is of great importance for the safety of dam operation. The unstable Guobu slope is located only about 1.5 km away from Laxiwa hydropower station in upstream Yellow River. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by C-band Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR), L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR-2), and X-band TerraSAR-X covering different evolution stages of Guobu slope were collected to investigate the displacement history so as to facilitate understanding of its deformation and failure mechanisms. The displacements occurred during the past decade were quantitatively identified for the first time by SAR pixel offset tracking analyses. The results show that before the reservoir impoundment, the maximum accumulative displacements on the slope were more than 7 m from 2003 to 2008, while the post-impoundment displacements also exceeded 7 m in just 1 year from September 2009 to September 2010. Furthermore, this slope is still in active deformation up to now. Nevertheless, the displacement rates seem decreased recently according to the interferometric results of TerraSAR-X data pairs from September 2015 to March 2016.

TI  - Generation of a high-accuracy regional DEM based on ALOS/PRISM imagery of East Antarctica
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A digital elevation model (DEM) is used to estimate ice-flow velocities for an ice sheet and glaciers via Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) processing. The accuracy of DInSAR-derived displacement estimates depends upon the accuracy of the DEM. Therefore, we used stereo optical images, obtained with a panchromatic remote-sensing instrument for stereo mapping (PRISM) sensor mounted onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), to produce a new DEM ("PRISM-DEM") of part of the coastal region of Lutzow-Holm Bay in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. We verified the accuracy of the PRISM-DEM by comparing ellipsoidal heights with those of existing DEMs and values obtained by satellite laser altimetry (ICESat/GLAS) and Global Navigation Satellite System surveying. The accuracy of the PRISM-DEM is estimated to be 2.80 m over ice sheet, 4.86 m over individual glaciers, and 6.63 m over rock outcrops. By comparison, the estimated accuracy of the ASTER-GDEM, widely used in polar regions, is 33.45 m over ice sheet, 14.61 m over glaciers, and 19.95 m over rock outcrops. For displacement measurements made along the radar line-of-sight by DInSAR, in conjunction with ALOS/PALSAR data, the accuracy of the PRISM-DEM and ASTER-GDEM correspond to estimation errors of < 6.3 mm and < 31.8 mm, respectively.

TI  - Dangerous woridview: A mediator of the relation between disgust sensitivity and social conservatism
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of research indicates that greater disgust sensitivity is associated with more socially conservative values. However, the mechanism by which disgust is linked to social conservatism has not been elucidated. The purpose of this research was to determine whether disgust alters social worldview, which in turn encourages the endorsement of social conservatism. Studies 1a/b and 2 provided correlational support for this model. Individuals higher in disgust sensitivity were more likely to endorse a dangerous worldview and socially conservative values. Furthermore, dangerous woridview mediated the relation between disgust sensitivity and social conservatism. Study 3 provided experimental evidence of the causal link between disgust and dangerous woridview. For those more sensitive to disgust, a disgust induction compared to a neutral condition resulted in greater endorsement of a dangerous worldview. These findings provide initial evidence of a route through which disgust influences social conservatism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bayesian Merging of MISR and MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Products Using Error Distributions From AERONET
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) routinely retrieved by spaceborne sensors (e.g., MODIS and MISR) is widely used in studies focused on atmospheric aerosol characterization, their variability/trends, and environmental/climate impacts. Despite significant advancement in the understanding of aerosol loading patterns, there exist global/regional differences among AOD products from various satellite sensors; owing to differences in retrieval algorithms, spatial/temporal resolution and sampling, and cloud-screening schemes. A merged AOD dataset combining multiple satellite retrievals is therefore desirable, which utilizes the strengths of individual products, and at the same time reduces biases relative to ground-based measurements (e.g., from aerosol robotic network (AERONET)). In view of this, a Level-2 "merged" AOD dataset based on MODIS and MISR retrievals is developed in this study using Bayesian principles, which takes into account the error distribution of AOD from AERONET data. The merged AOD dataset is demonstrated over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, in southern Asia, and is intercompared with existing satellite and AERONET data. The RMSE of the merged AOD data (0.08-0.13) is lower than the MISR and MODIS retrievals. Additionally, the merged AOD data have higher correlation with AERONET data (r within 0.89-0.93), compared to MISR (0.82-0.89) and MODIS (0.76-0.77) data. In terms of the expected error (EE), the accuracy of merged data is found to be higher, with larger percent of merged AOD within the EE envelope (74.7%-88.7%) compared to MISR (62.7%-84.9%) and MODIS (67.9%-69.8%) data. The merging methodology and resulting dataset are especially relevant in the scenario of fusing multisensor retrievals for producing long-term satellite-based climate data records.

TI  - MicroRNA regulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cell homeostasis and function in allergic inflammation
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exert powerful effects on immunity through coordinate regulation of multiple target genes in a wide variety of cells. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are tissue sentinel mediators of allergic inflammation. We established the physiological requirements for miRNAs in ILC2 homeostasis and immune function and compared the global miRNA repertoire of resting and activated ILC2s and T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cells. After exposure to the natural allergen papain, mice selectively lacking the miR-17 similar to 92 cluster in ILC2s displayed reduced lung inflammation. Moreover, miR-17 similar to 92-deficient ILC2s exhibited defective growth and cytokine expression in response to IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in vitro. The miR-17 similar to 92 cluster member miR-19a promoted IL-13 and IL-5 production and inhibited expression of several targets, including SOCS1 and A20, signaling inhibitors that limit IL-13 and IL-5 production. These findings establish miRNAs as important regulators of ILC2 biology, reveal overlapping but nonidentical miRNA-regulated gene expression networks in ILC2s and T(H)2 cells, and reinforce the therapeutic potential of targeting miR-19 to alleviate pathogenic allergic responses.

TI  - Predictors of false negative sentinel lymph node biopsy in trunk and extremity melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNodal recurrence following negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma is known as false-negative (FN) SLNB. Risk factors for FN SLNB among patients with trunk and extremity melanoma have not been well-defined.MethodsAfter retrospective review, SLNB procedures were classified FN, true positive (TP; positive SLNB), or true negative (TN; negative SLNB without recurrence). Factors associated with high false negative rate (FNR) and low negative predictive value (NPV) were identified by comparing FNs to TPs and TNs, respectively. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods.ResultsOf 1728 patients, 234 were TP and 37 were FN for overall FNR of 14% and NPV of 97.5%. Age 65 years was independently associated with high FNR (FNR 20% in this group). Breslow thickness >1mm and ulceration were independently associated with low NPV. Among patients with ulcerated tumors >4mm, NPV was 88%. Median time to recurrence for FNs was 13 months. Among patients with primary melanomas 2mm in depth, overall and distant disease-free survival were significantly shorter with FN SLNB than TP SLNB.ConclusionsOlder age is associated with increased FNR; patients with thick, ulcerated lesions should be considered for increased nodal surveillance after negative SLNB given low NPV in this group.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the measurements of precipitable water vapor (PWV) and total column ozone (TCO) from the MODIS satellite instruments (Aqua/Terra platforms), the connections between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the anomalies in PWV and TCO over European Russia (ER) in summer 2010 are analyzed. It is found that the PWV (TCO) anomalies over the northern ER in summer 2010 positively (negatively) correlated with the NAO, and the local correlations reached 0.68 (-0.55). The physical mechanisms of the correlations are discussed. A comparative analysis of the relationships between the NAO and the regional PWV and TCO anomalies over ER during the summer seasons of 2000-2015 is carried out.

TI  - Multispectral Misregistration of Sentinel-2A Images: Analysis and Implications for Potential Applications
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter aims at analyzing subpixel misregistration between multispectral images acquired by the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2A remote sensing satellite, and exploring its potential for moving target and cloud detection. By virtue of its hardware design, MSI's detectors exhibit a parallax angle that leads to subpixel shifts that are corrected with special preprocessing routines. However, these routines do not correct shifts for moving and/or high-altitude objects. In this letter, we apply a phase correlation approach to detect subpixel shifts between B2 (blue), B3 (green), and B4 (red) Sentinel-2A/MSI images. We show that shifts of more than 1.1 pixels can be observed for moving targets, such as airplanes and clouds, and can be used for cloud detection. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect clouds that are not identified in the built-in cloud mask provided within the Sentinel-2A Level-1C product.

TI  - Erectile Dysfunction Medications and Treatment for Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Pharmacoepidemiologic Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Erectile dysfunction (ED) can be a sentinel marker for future cardiovascular disease and has been described as providing a "window of curability" for men to receive targeted cardiovascular risk assessment.Aim: To determine whether the prescription of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) for ED leads to the detection and treatment of previously undiagnosed cardiometabolic risk factors.Methods: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study of residents of British Columbia, Canada using linked health care databases from 2004 to 2011. An individual-level time series analysis with switching replications was used to determine changes in drug use for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes in men 40 to 59 years old. The observation window for each patient was 720 days before and 360 days after the index date.Outcomes: The primary outcome was changes in prescriptions for antihypertensive, statin, and oral antidiabetic drugs, with secondary outcomes being laboratory tests for plasma cholesterol and glucose.Results: 5,858 men 40 to 59 years old newly prescribed a PDE5i were included in the analysis. We found a sudden increase in prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs (40 per 1,000; P < .001), statins (10 per 1,000; P = .001), and antidiabetic drugs (17 per 1,000; P = .002) in the 90 days after a new prescription for a PDE5i. For hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, most of this change was observed in men with relevant screening tests performed in the 30 days after their PDE5i prescription. Only 15% and 17% of men who did not have a screening test for cholesterol and glucose, respectively, in the year before their PDE5i prescription went on to have one in the subsequent 30 days.Clinical Implications: The paucity of screening tests observed in our study after PDE5i prescriptions suggests that physicians should be educated on the recommended screening guidelines for men newly diagnosed with ED.Strengths and Limitations: The number of men who were ordered a laboratory test or written a prescription but chose not to complete or fill it, respectively, is unknown.Conclusion: Treatment for ED with PDE5is can be a trigger or "gateway drug" for the early detection and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors provided physicians perform the requisite screening investigations.

TI  - Ice Detection for Satellite Ocean Color Data Processing in the Great Lakes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote-sensing data are essential for monitoring and quantifying water properties in the Great Lakes, providing useful monitoring and management tools for understanding water optical, biological, and ecological processes and phenomena. However, during the winter season, large parts of the Great Lakes are often covered by ice, which can cause significant uncertainties in satellite-measured water quality products. Although some developed radiance-based ice-detection algorithms for satellite ocean color data processing can eliminate most of the ice pixels in a region, there are still some significant errors due to misidentification of ice-contaminated pixels, particularly for the thin ice-covered regions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the ice-detection methods for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. In this paper, impacts of ice contamination on satellite-derived ocean color products in the Great Lakes are investigated, and a refined regional ice-detection algorithm which is based on the radiance spectra and normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 551 nm, nLw(551), is developed and assessed for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. Results show that this proposed ice-detection method can reasonably identify ice-contaminated pixels, including those in very thin ice-covered regions, and provide accurate satellite ocean color products for the winter season in the Great Lakes.

TI  - Intact rock bridge breakage and rock mass fragmentation upon failure: quantification using remote sensing techniques
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, two processes related to the onset and the evolution of large-scale rockfalls have been analysed by means of remote sensing techniques. First, the number of rock bridges as a proportion of pre-existing fractures has been estimated in a newly formed landslide scarp by analysing the spectral information of the rock mass in terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric point clouds. Second, the fragmentation of the rock mass after failure has been assessed by comparing the percentage of newly formed fractures in the scarp and in the deposit. For this purpose, an orthophoto of the landslide deposit was classified using an object-based method. The presented workflow gained new data on the intact rock breakage during and after failure, and consequently deepened knowledge about rock failure and fragmentation mechanisms.Resume Dans cette etude, deux processus lies au declenchement et a l'evolution de grands eboulements ont ete analyses au moyen de techniques de modelisation 3D. Dans un premier temps, le nombre de ponts rocheux est estime en proportion des fractures preexistantes dans un escarpement de glissement de terrain nouvellement forme en analysant l'information spectrale de la masse rocheuse dans des nuages de points generes par balayage laser terrestre et par drone photogrammetrique. La fragmentation de la masse rocheuse apres rupture est ensuite evaluee en comparant le pourcentage de fractures nouvellement formees dans l'escarpement et dans le depot. cette fin, une orthophotographie de l'eboulis est traitee par une classification orientee objet. La methode presentee a permis d'obtenir de nouvelles donnees sur la rupture de la roche intacte pendant et apres la fracturation, et par consequent d'approfondir les connaissances sur les mecanismes de fracture et de fragmentation des roches.Zusammenfassung Die vorgestellte Arbeit behandelt zwei Prozesse in Bezug auf die Entstehung und die Entwicklung gro ss flachiger Felsabsturze mit Hilfe von 3D Modellierungstechniken. Zuerst wurde die Anzahl von Felsbrucken, als ein Ma ss fur vorher vorhandene Risse, in einer neu gebildeten Rutschung eines Steilhangs durch Analyse der spektralen Information der Felsmasse in den Punktwolken aus Terrestrischem Laserscanning (TLS) und unbemannten Flugobjekten (UAV) geschatzt. Als zweites wurde die Aufteilung der Felsmasse nach dem Abbruch durch den Vergleich von neu geformten Rissen im Steilhang und in der Ablagerung bewertet. Dazu wurde ein Orthophoto der Ablagerung mit Hilfe einer objektbasierten Methode klassifiziert. Der beschriebene Prozess ergab neue Daten zu der intakten Felsbruchstelle wahrend und nach dem Abbruch und vertiefte so die Kenntnisse uber Felsabsturze und die Mechanismen der Bruchstrukturen.Resumen En este trabajo, se han analizado procesos relacionados con el inicio y la evolucion de caidas de rocas a gran escala mediante tecnicas de modelado 3D. En primer lugar, se ha estimado el numero segmentos de roca intacta como proporcion de fracturas preexistentes en una escarpa de deslizamiento de tierra recientemente formada mediante el analisis de la informacion espectral de la masa de roca en las nubes de puntos obtenidas con un escaner laser terrestre (TLS) y vehiculos aereos no tripulados (UAV). En segundo lugar, la fragmentacion de la masa de roca despues de un deslizamiento se ha evaluado comparando el porcentaje de fracturas recien formadas en la escarpa de deslizamiento y en el deposito. Para este proposito, una ortofotografia del deposito del deslizamiento se clasifico usando un metodo basado en objetos. El flujo de trabajo presentado obtuvo nuevos datos sobre la rotura de la roca intacta durante y despues del deslizamiento y, en consecuencia, profundiza el conocimiento sobre el deslizamiento de la roca y el mecanismo de fragmentacion.?? ???3D?????????????????????????, ???????????(TLS) ????

TI  - JOHN BRADBY BLAKE'S MULTIMEDIA DICTIONARY: FROM WORDLIST TO WORLDVIEW
T2  - Curtis's Botanical Magazine
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique illustrated and annotated Chinese-English Vocabulary' (hereafter Vocabulary') in the John Bradby Blake collection in the library of the Oak Spring Garden Foundation is described, along with the composition of individual entries and their arrangement. Analysis of the contents suggests that the Vocabulary was composed in a multi-layered process beginning with the illustration and main Chinese characters, which were then annotated by two other individuals, most likely John Bradby Blake himself and perhaps Whang at Tong. The layers of the Vocabulary document an attempt at cross-cultural exchange, with equivalences being proposed, explanations offered, and meanings contested. Situating the Vocabulary in the history of Chinese language learning and the more general history of bilingual wordlists reveals various types of precedents and related material, but it is unique in the history of Chinese-English lexicography and what it has to teach us about the worldview of its authors and mid-Qing intellectual knowledge exchange between British and Southern Chinese.

TI  - Effects of the I-PASS Nursing Handoff Bundle on communication quality and workflow
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective Handoff communication errors are a leading source of sentinel events. We sought to determine the impact of a handoff improvement programme for nurses.Methods We conducted a prospective pre-post intervention study on a paediatric intensive care unit in 2011-2012. The I-PASS Nursing Handoff Bundle intervention consisted of educational training, verbal handoff I-PASS mnemonic implementation, and visual materials to provide reinforcement and sustainability. We developed handoff direct observation and time motion workflow assessment tools to measure: (1) quality of the verbal handoff, including interruption frequency and presence of key handoff data elements; and (2) duration of handoff and other workflow activities.Results I-PASS implementation was associated with improvements in verbal handoff communications, including inclusion of illness severity assessment (37% preintervention vs 67% postintervention, p=0.001), patient summary (81% vs 95%, p=0.05), to do list (35% vs 100%, p<0.001) and an opportunity for the receiving nurse to ask questions (34% vs 73%, p<0.001). Overall, 13/21 (62%) of verbal handoff data elements were more likely to be present following implementation whereas no data elements were less likely present. Implementation was associated with a decrease in interruption frequency pre versus post intervention (67% vs 40% of handoffs with interruptions, p=0.005) without a change in the median handoff duration (18.8 min vs 19.9 min, p=0.48) or changes in time spent in direct or indirect patient care activities.Conclusions Implementation of the I-PASS Nursing Handoff Bundle was associated with widespread improvements in the verbal handoff process without a negative impact on nursing workflow. Implementation of I-PASS for nurses may therefore have the potential to significantly reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.

TI  - How is Europe positioned for a re-emergence of Schmallenberg virus?
T2  - VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Schmallenberg virus (SBV) caused a large scale epidemic in Europe from 2011 to 2013, infecting ruminants and causing foetal deformities after infection of pregnant animals. The main impact of the virus was financial loss due to restrictions on trade of animals, meat and semen. Although effective vaccines were produced, their uptake was never high. Along with the subsequent decline in new SBV infections and natural replacement of previously exposed livestock, this has resulted in a decrease in the number of protected animals. Recent surveillance has shown that a large population of naive animals is currently present in Europe and that the virus is circulating at a low level. These changes in animal status, in combination with favourable conditions for insect vectors, may open the door to the re-emergence of SBV and another large scale outbreak in Europe. This review details the potential and preparedness for SBV re-emergence in Europe, discusses possible co-ordinated sentinel monitoring programmes for ruminant seroconversion and the presence of SBV in the insect vectors, and provides an overview of the economic impact associated with diagnosis, control and the effects of non-vaccination.

TI  - Evaluating MODIS snow products for modelling snowmelt runoff: Case study of the Rio Grande headwaters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow-covered area (SCA) is a key variable in the Snowmelt-Runoff Model (SRM) and in other models for simulating discharge from snowmelt. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) or Operational Land Imager (OLI) provide remotely sensed data at an appropriate spatial resolution for mapping SCA in small headwater basins, but the temporal resolution of the data is low and may not always provide sufficient cloud-free dates. The coarser spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers better temporal resolution and in cloudy years, MODIS data offer the best alternative for mapping snow cover when finer spatial resolution data are unavailable. However, MODIS' coarse spatial resolution (500 m) can obscure fine spatial patterning in snow cover and some MODIS products are not sensitive to end-of-season snow cover. In this study, we aimed to test MODIS snow products for use in simulating snowmelt runoff from smaller headwater basins by a) comparing maps of TM and MODIS-based SCA and b) determining how SRM streamflow simulations are changed by the different estimates of seasonal snow depletion. We compared gridded MODIS snow products (Collection 5 MOD10A1 fractional and binary SCA; SCA derived from Collection 6 MOD10A1 Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) Snow Cover), and the MODIS Snow Covered Area and Grain size retrieval (MODSCAG) canopy-corrected fractional SCA (SCAMG), with reference SCA maps (SCAREF) generated 'from binary classification of TM imagery. SCAMG showed strong agreement with SCAREF; excluding true negatives (where both methods agreed no snow was present) the median percent difference between SCAREF and SCAMG ranged between 2.4% and 4.7%. We simulated runoff for each of the four study years using SRM populated with and calibrated for snow depletion curves derived from SCA(REF),. We then substituted in each of the MODIS-derived depletion curves. With efficiency coefficients ranging between 0.73 and 0.93, SRM simulation results from the SCAMG runs yielded the best results of all the MODIS products and only slightly underestimated discharge volume (between 7 and 11% of measured annual discharge). SRM simulations that used SCA derived from Collection 6 NDSI Snow Cover also yielded promising results, with efficiency coefficients ranging between 0.73 and 0.91.In conclusion, we recommend that when simulating snowmelt runoff from small basins ( < 4000 km(2)) with SRM, we recommend that users select either canopy-corrected MODSCAG or create their own site-specific products from the Collection 6 MOD10A1 NDSI.

TI  - Land Surface Phenology in the Tropics: The Role of Climate and Topography in a Snow-Free Mountain
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf phenology represents a major temporal component of ecosystem functioning, and understanding the drivers of seasonal variation in phenology is essential to understand plant responses to climate change. We assessed the patterns and drivers of land surface phenology, a proxy for leafing phenology, for the meridional Espinha double dagger o Range, a South American tropical mountain comprising a mosaic of savannas, dry woodlands, montane vegetation and moist forests. We used a 14-year time series of MODIS/NDVI satellite images, acquired between 2001 and 2015, and extracted phenological indicators using the TIMESAT algorithm. We obtained precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, land surface temperature from the MODIS MOD11A2 product, and cloud cover frequency from the MODIS MOD09GA product. We also calculated the topographic wetness index and simulated clear-sky radiation budgets based on the SRTM elevation model. The relationship between phenology and environmental drivers was assessed using general linear models. Temporal displacement in the start date of the annual growth season was more evident than variations in season length among vegetation types, indicating a possible temporal separation in the use of resources. Season length was inversely proportional to elevation, decreasing 1.58 days per 100 m. Green-up and senescence rates were faster where annual temperature amplitude was higher. We found that water and light availability, modulated by topography, are the most likely drivers of land surface phenology in the region, determining the start, end and length of the growing season. Temperature had an important role in determining the rates of leaf development and the strength of vegetation seasonality, suggesting that tropical vegetation is also sensitive to latitudinal temperature changes, regardless of the elevational gradient. Our work improves the current understanding of phenological strategies in the seasonal tropics and emphasizes the importance of topography in shaping light and water availability for leaf development in snow-free mountains.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of the Strong Sandstorm Migration in Northern and Northwestern China via Satellite Data
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storms (hereafter, "sandstorms") not only damage the ecological environment in northern and northwestern China but also influence the economic and social development of the affected regions and constitute a threat to human health. This study focuses on monitoring sandstorms and analyzing the sandstorm migration process in northern and northwestern China. These sandstorms are characterized by their high frequency occurrences, strong dust intensity, long durations and highly destructive effects. The dry climate conditions and low degree of vegetation coverage in this region increase the difficulty of sandstorm monitoring. This paper proposes a remote sensing monitoring method for sandstorms in northern and northwestern China based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the radiation characteristics of the research region and of the sandstorms. A strong sandstorm that occurred on April 23-25, 2014, is analyzed to illustrate the proposed monitoring method. Information on the sandstorm is validated and analyzed through visual interpretation and comparison with Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System (MICAPS) ground measurements. The spatial distribution of the sandstorm is highly consistent with the true-color MODIS data. The comparison of the results of the remote sensing monitoring of the sandstorm with the MICAPS measurements yields a high coincidence rate of 96.3%. Additionally, the migration process of the sandstorm can be clearly recognized in 6 MODIS images captured during the 3-day sandstorm. Based on the above results, we conclude that the proposed method can be used for dynamic remote sensing monitoring of sandstorms in northern and northwestern China.

TI  - Revising rates of asymptomatic Zika virus infection based on sentinel surveillance data from French Overseas Territories
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - French Polynesia and the French Territories of the Americas (FTAs) have experienced outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. These territories used similar sentinel syndromic surveillance to follow the epidemics. However, the surveillance system only takes into account consulting patients diagnosed with ZIKV disease, while non-consulting cases, as well as asymptomatic cases, are not taken into account. In the French territories under study, the ratio of consulting to non-consulting patients was found to likely be as low as 1/3 to 1/4, and rough estimates of the ZIKV asymptomatic infections indicated a lower rate than previously reported (i.e., not more than half).

TI  - Evaluation of Typical Spectral Vegetation Indices for Drought Monitoring in Cropland of the North China Plain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral vegetation index (SVI) is indispensable for comprehensively monitoring of agricultural drought based on remote sensing. Greenness sensitive (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index) and water sensitive SVIs (e.g., normalized difference infrared index) were mostly concerned in drought monitoring. Their sensitivity to drought conditions has been explored yet distinct results were found. This contradiction has not been fully understood in previous studies. In this study, the greenness and water sensitive SVIs were further evaluated in a cropland area of the North China Plain by using MODIS reflectance products from 2000 to 2015. Results indicate that fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) plays an important role in the sensitivity of SVIs to drought condition. During early months of the crop growth, when FVC is relatively low, greenness sensitive indices had closer correlation with in situ drought indices. On the contrary, water sensitive indices presented better correlation during the latermonths of the crop growth when FVC is high. This study further suggests that variations in vegetation water content are more dynamic than changes in vegetation greenness properties under the influence of drought. However, soil background effects will make greenness sensitive indices outperform water sensitive indices for mid and low density vegetation coverage.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of Very Slow Landslides in the Three Gorges Region through Small Baseline SAR Offset Tracking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-pixel offset tracking has been used in various applications, including measurements of glacier movement, earthquakes, landslides, etc., as a complementary method to time series InSAR. In this work, we explore the use of a small baseline subset (SBAS) Offset Tracking approach to monitor very slow landslides with centimetre-level annual displacement rate, and in challenging areas characterized by high humidity, dense vegetation cover, and steep slopes. This approach, herein referred to as SBAS Offset Tracking, is used to minimize temporal and spatial de-correlation in offset pairs, in order to achieve high density of reliable measurements. This approach is applied to a case study of the Tanjiahe landslide in the Three Gorges Region. Using the TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight (TSX-ST) data, with sufficient density of observations, we estimate the precision of the SBAS offset tracking approach to be 2-3 cm on average. The results demonstrated accord well with corresponding GPS measurements.

TI  - Impact of Rapid Urbanization on the City of Bhubaneswar, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urbanization of cities has been a cause of great concern world over. Increased urbanization has immensely altered the Land Use pattern of several Indian cities, thereby altering the physical properties of the land surface. The pronounced effect of urban heat island (UHI) apart from the acute stress on limited natural resources are consequences of this rapid urbanization. UHI effect manifests as unexpected rise in city temperatures when compared to their surrounding areas, thus making them unfriendly for habitation over time. The present work analyses the effect of UHI on Bhubaneswar, an Indian city undergoing rapid urbanization in recent times, utilizing land use and land cover (LULC) change data from Landsat over a 25 km radius about the city and MODIS land surface temperatures (LST) at 1 km(2) spatial resolution for a period of 15 years (2000-2014). From the study, significant changes in LULC through over-exploitation of natural resources and the related spatio-temporal variations in LST has been identified as one major factor responsible for changes in the UHI effect over Bhubaneswar. Owing to rapid urbanization (83% increase in 15 years), the city has undergone major changes in LULC aggregating to a massive similar to 89% decrease in dense vegetation and similar to 83% decrease in crop fields over this time period. Analyses of the changes in the urban energy balance and resulting UHI effect across many such Indian cities undergoing rapid urban growth is quite essential for mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization for a long-term sustainability.

TI  - Soil moisture assessment from MODIS data
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is important for its role in the soil surface energy balance, since it can control the availability of latent heat flux, the crop development and yield production. Assessing soil moisture, even with the recent wide-spread application of the dielectric devices is a time consuming and laborious endeavor. Thus, this study evaluates the capability of soil water content predicted from remote sensing to indicate the soil/canopy water content at short time and space scale, through comparisons with daily soil moisture data determined in situ, using dielectric devices. Daily aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the diurnal (daytime and nighttime) land surface temperature (DLST) difference are employed to retrieving daily volumetric soil moisture content (theta) at Sparta experimental field, during the growing season (May-October), of the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. The concept of apparent thermal inertia (ATI), based on the DLST data, is used for estimating the remotely sensed top soil moisture saturation index (SMSI). Daily soil moisture content (theta(SMSI)) is then obtained from ATI maximum-and minimum-value and the volumetric saturated and residual soil moisture content,theta(sat) and theta(res), respectively, and is compared with the experimental values of volumetric soil moisture content (SM) measured at various depths (10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm). Simple relationships are also calibrated between SM and DLST or ATI or NDVI during the years 2010, 2011 and 2014. These are tested for predicting theta (theta(DLST) or theta(ATI) or theta(NDVI), respectively) during the year 2012. First, theta(SMSI), as well as,theta(ATI) or theta(DLST) or theta(NDVI) predict. satisfactorily, as compared with the measured SM. Hence, they can offer a considerable guidance toward applying a rational and sustainable irrigated agriculture and other related fields. The predictions of theta are also especially tested, during the summer period (June-August) and the obtained results are equally satisfactory.

TI  - An NDVI-Based Statistical ET Downscaling Method
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new method for downscaling ETWatch 1-km actual evapotranspiration (ET) products to a spatial resolution of 30 m using Landsat8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The NDVI is employed as an indicator of land-surface vegetation, which displays periodic spatial patterns on the land surface. A 30-m-resolution ten-day ET dataset is then calculated primarily using the NDVI and the historical ratio of coarse NDVI and ET that considers different land cover types. Good agreement and correlations were obtained between the downscaled data and observations from three flux sites in two study areas. The mean bias (MB) per ten-day period ranges from 4.21 mm in Guantao to 1.55 mm in Huazhaizi, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) varies from 0.87 to 0.95. The downscaling results show good consistency with the original ETWatch 1-km data over both temporal and spatial scales for different land cover types, with R-2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.98. In addition, the downscaled results capture the progression of vegetation growth well. This study demonstrates the applicability of the new de-pixelation downscaling method in the management of water resources.

TI  - A 30-Year Assessment of Phytoplankton Blooms in Erhai Lake Using Landsat Imagery: 1987 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term information of phytoplankton bloom is critical for assessing the processes driving blooms in lakes. A three-decade survey of the phytoplankton blooms was completed for Erhai Lake from 1987 to 2016 with Landsat imagery. A modified three-band model using Landsat broad bands is developed by comparing reflectance data from Landsat imagery to two field datasets. The model is applied to the archived imagery (1987-2016) to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). Predicted ln(Chl-a) and observed ln(Chl-a) measurements are significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.13 g/L). Bloom maps are generated by identifying Landsat pixels that have Chl-a concentrations larger than 20 g/L as bloom area. Bloom extent and magnitude are estimated. Our study reveals that algal blooms first occurred in 1996 with a bloom area of 150 km(2). Bloom occurred frequently from 2002 to 2016, with extreme blooms in 2003, 2013 and 2016. Algal blooms were mostly distributed in the northern and southern part of the lake. The proposed method uses one model for all Landsat images for Erhai Lake and can predict past blooms and extend the record to early years when field data is not available. The bloom extent and magnitude produced in this study can be used as the basis for the understanding of the processes that control the bloom outbreak.

TI  - Liquid Water Path Retrieval Using the Lowest Frequency Channels of <i>Fengyun</i>-<i>3C</i> Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board Chinese Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellites provides measurements at 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz with both horizontal and vertical polarization channels. Brightness temperature measurements of those channels with their central frequencies higher than 19 GHz from satellite-based microwave imager radiometers had traditionally been used to retrieve cloud liquid water path (LWP) over ocean. The results show that the lowest frequency channels are the most appropriate for retrieving LWP when its values are large. Therefore, a modified LWP retrieval algorithm is developed for retrieving LWP of different magnitudes involving not only the high frequency channels but also the lowest frequency channels of FY-3 MWRI. The theoretical estimates of the LWP retrieval errors are between 0.11 and 0.06 mm for 10.65- and 18.7-GHz channels and between 0.02 and 0.04 mm for 36.5- and 89.0-GHz channels. It is also shown that the brightness temperature observations at 10.65 GHz can be utilized to better retrieve the LWP greater than 3 mm in the eyewall region of Super Typhoon Neoguri (2014). The spiral structure of clouds within and around Typhoon Neoguri can be well captured by combining the LWP retrievals from different frequency channels.

TI  - Quantification of Temporal Decorrelation in X-, C-, and L-Band Interferometry for the Permafrost Region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, serious decorrelation has restricted the inteferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques in monitoring ground deformation and thaw-melt hazards. Improved understanding, quantification and prediction of the coherence evolution with time are key prerequirements for choosing the optimal observation time and band in such interferometric applications. In this letter, considering the main processes of degradation and the freeze-thaw cycle, a temporal decorrelation model including both the long-term and seasonal coherence factors is proposed. Multitemporal L-band PALSAR, C-band ASAR, and X-band TerraSAR were collected to validate the model's applicability. Coherence matrices of several typical features were estimated for the parameter inversion. Root-mean-square errors ranging from 0.048 to 0.152 showed good fitting results between the model predictions and the estimated interferometric coherences. The temporal decorrelation characteristics of the permafrost region at the three frequencies were successfully revealed. This letter could also facilitate applications of InSAR techniques in similar areas in other parts of the world.

TI  - Use of a novel sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm reduces the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy in low-grade endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the capability of a novel sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm to reduce the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) in patients with low-grade (G1-2) endometrial cancer (LGEC).Methods. Patients with LGEC underwent evaluation according to a novel lymphatic assessment algorithm during hysterectomy with SLN biopsy at two academic gynecologic oncology programs. Side-specific PLND was only performed if ipsilateral SLN mapping failed and high-risk uterine features were identified on frozen section (FS). Side-specific and PLND rates were compared to theoretical PLND rates based on the NCCN EC SLN mapping algorithm.Results. Since 11/2015, 113 LGEC patients have been managed according to the algorithm. SLN mapping was bilateral (81%), unilateral (12%), or neither (6%). Nine patients (8.0%) had LN metastases identified. Of the 21 patients requiring intraoperative FS due to failed SLN mapping, high-risk uterine features were identified in eight (38%). These patients underwent either bilateral (2) or unilateral (6) PLND. Side-specific and overall PLND rates were 5.3% and 7.1%, respectively. If all patients with failed mapping had undergone PLND according to the NCCN algorithm, side-specific and overall PLND rates would have been higher, 12.4% and 18.6%, respectively (P = 0.01). All patients who failed to map and did not undergo side-specific PLND had low-risk uterine features on final pathology.Conclusions. Lymphatic assessment using SLN mapping followed by selective FS to determine need for PLND is feasible. When compared to the NCCN algorithm, this novel "Reflex Frozen Section" strategy eliminates PLND in patients at lowest risk for metastasis without compromising identification of metastatic nodal disease.

TI  - A Phytoplankton Class-Specific Marine Primary Productivity Model Using MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phytoplankton pigment absorption (a(ph))-based productivity model (AbPM) is commonly used to estimate marine net primary production (NPP). In the AbPM, a(ph) is used as the key predictor of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency. Previous studies have shown that the size of phytoplankton could affect the photosynthetic efficiency. Thus, a size-fractionated AbPM was proposed by considering how phytoplankton size influenced the global quantum yield of phytoplankton photosynthesis. The sea surface temperature (SST) was also used to further improve AbPM performance in coldwaters (SST<10 degrees C). With the proposed new model, monthly averaged global ocean NPP data for the period 2003-2012 were derived, and the distributions of the global NPP differed in both space and time from previous AbPM-based estimates. The accuracy of the new estimated model was validated using in situ NPP data, which were collected from different marine monitoring sites. Compared with the original AbPM, the new model not only had an excellent performance at each marine monitoring site, but also had an improved accuracy over the Southern Ocean. Although additional studies need to be conducted for confirmation, this size-fractionated model could be a reasonable and accurate method for the estimation of global ocean NPP.

TI  - Review of native vegetation condition assessment concepts, methods and future trends
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The main aim of this review paper is to evaluate and make recommendations on how current and emerging remote sensing (RS) technology might be best used to improve vegetation condition assessment and monitoring. This research reviews the vegetation attributes used in various approaches to vegetation condition assessment, the most efficient and rapid techniques to assess those attributes, and proposes applicable suggestions for future vegetation condition assessment using fusion and ensemble techniques. The attributes are those that have strong correlations with components of vegetation condition and are expected to produce trustable indications of change. Further to this, it aims to identify those vegetation attributes that can be best assessed using field survey and those that can be remotely measured world-wide. Vegetation has various structural, functional and compositional characteristics. To measure specific vegetation characteristics, the suitable type of RS sensor is required. Multi-spectral, hyperspectral, Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) are the main types of RS sensors, and each type has a range of applications. A variety of automated and repeatable methods are provided by RS technology to monitor the indicators of vegetation condition. However, dependency on site-based data remains. Further work is essential to find a rapid, cost effective and transferable RS method to map and monitor vegetation condition. Moreover, near future improvements in RS, such as Sentinel products, are expected to ease the process of vegetation condition assessment and enhance the outcomes.

TI  - Is mitotic rate still useful in the management of patients with thin melanoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundT1 melanoma substaging was recently modified by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Although sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity is the most important prognostic factor in melanoma, there is a lack of consensus on whether SLN biopsy should be performed in patients with thin melanoma (1 mm).ObjectiveThe main aim of this study was to investigate predictors of SLN positivity in patients with thin melanoma, with a special emphasis on mitotic rate. A secondary aim was to evaluate survival in this group of patients.Materials and MethodsRetrospective multicenter observational study with analysis of age, sex, tumour location, thickness, mitotic rate, regression and microscopic satellites. Predictive factors were identified using a classification and regression tree (CART) approach. Melanoma-specific survival according to SLN status was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves.ResultsWe analysed 203 patients with a melanoma 1 mm. Using the new AJCC staging criteria, the CART algorithm identified a 7.5% likelihood of SLN positivity in T1a patients. In the case of T1b melanoma, there was a 14.3% likelihood of SLN positivity in patients with a mitotic rate >1 mitosis/mm(2) and a 3.2% likelihood in those with 1 mitoses/mm(2). None of the patients with T1b disease who had 1 mitoses/mm(2) and regression had SLN positivity. In T1b patients, 5-year melanoma-specific survival was 98.7% in the SLN-negative group and 75% in the SLN-positive group (P = 0.05). When stratified by mitotic rate, survival was 100% for patients with a mitotic rate of 1 mitoses/mm(2) and 91.4% for those with >1 mitosis/mm(2) (P = 0.022). There were no deaths in the T1a subgroup.ConclusionsSentinel lymph node metastasis was less common in patients with T1b melanoma who had a mitotic rate of 1 mitoses/mm(2). Performance of SLN biopsy should be carefully considered in this subgroup of patients, particularly considering the good prognosis.

TI  - What potential do geographic information systems have for population-wide health monitoring in Germany? Perspectives and challenges for the health monitoring of the Robert Koch Institute
T2  - BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic information systems (GISs) are computer-based systems with which geographical data can be recorded, stored, managed, analyzed, visualized and provided. In recent years, they have become an integral part of public health research. They offer a broad range of analysis tools, which enable innovative solutions for health-related research questions. An analysis of nationwide studies that applied geographic information systems underlines the potential this instrument bears for health monitoring in Germany. Geographic information systems provide up-to-date mapping and visualization options to be used for national health monitoring at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Furthermore, objective information on the residential environment as an influencing factor on population health and on health behavior can be gathered and linked to RKI survey data at different geographic scales. Besides using physical information, such as climate, vegetation or land use, as well as information on the built environment, the instrument can link socioeconomic and sociodemographic data as well as information on health care and environmental stress to the survey data and integrate them into concepts for analyses. Therefore, geographic information systems expand the potential of the RKI to present nationwide, representative and meaningful health-monitoring results. In doing so, data protection regulations must always be followed. To conclude, the development of a national spatial data infrastructure and the identification of important data sources can prospectively improve access to high quality data sets that are relevant for the health monitoring.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In this introduction to the Special Issue on Physical Geography and Environmental Sustainability, the links between a variety of physical landscapes located throughout the world and long-term wellbeing are considered from a systems approach. Twelve papers were published as part of this call, with half from Asia, especially China. They represent a contribution across topographic landscapes, from mountainous to estuarine, and cover models as well as case studies encompassing landscape and environmental changes. Remotely sensed data, statistical analysis, and GIS were often incorporated in the work, and this particularly conveys the importance of spatial analysis on inputs by physical geographers in sustainability research. Furthermore, scale variations from the local to global are presented as part of a geographical contribution. The connectedness of environments to humans and the reverse (of humans adapting to environmental change) is evident in several of the papers where human impacts and adaptation are concerned. Finally, the last paper provides a comprehensive summary of the potential contribution that physical geographers can make to environmental sustainability from a multidisciplinary approach.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has both direct and indirect impacts on land use change, and analyzing spatio-temporal characteristics of land use change is essential for understanding these impacts. By comparing Landsat TM images, this paper examines the changes of land use structure and landscape patterns in Shanghai from 1990 to 2015. It finds that the city doubled in size, with the growth of isolated construction land being most significant among eight land use types. A land use change matrix was established and landscape indices were selected to evaluate the change of spatial structure in Shanghai. In order to identify the main driving forces of city expansion in Shanghai, this research ran partial least square regression models to assess the impact of 10 social-economic factors on land use change of Shanghai from 1990 to 2015. It then conducted bivariate correlation analysis to explore the drivers of change of various land use types: urban settlement, rural settlement and isolated construction land. Besides quantitative analysis, this paper analyzes the influence of policy-dimensional factors in land use change. It concludes with future potential research topics on land use change in a rapidly urbanizing context.

TI  - Utility of Ambulance Data for Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance: A Pilot in the West Midlands Region, United Kingdom
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Public Health England (PHE; United Kingdom) Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance Team (ReSST) currently operates four national syndromic surveillance systems, including an emergency department system. A system based on ambulance data might provide an additional measure of the "severe" end of the clinical disease spectrum. This report describes the findings and lessons learned from the development and preliminary assessment of a pilot syndromic surveillance system using ambulance data from the West Midlands (WM) region in England.Hypothesis/Problem: Is an Ambulance Data Syndromic Surveillance System (ADSSS) feasible and of utility in enhancing the existing suite of PHE syndromic surveillance systems?Methods: An ADSSS was designed, implemented, and a pilot conducted from September 1, 2015 through March 1, 2016. Surveillance cases were defined as calls to the West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) regarding patients who were assigned any of 11 specified chief presenting complaints (CPCs) during the pilot period. The WMAS collected anonymized data on cases and transferred the dataset daily to ReSST, which contained anonymized information on patients' demographics, partial postcode of patients' location, and CPC. The 11 CPCs covered a broad range of syndromes. The dataset was analyzed descriptively each week to determine trends and key epidemiological characteristics of patients, and an automated statistical algorithm was employed daily to detect higher than expected number of calls. A preliminary assessment was undertaken to assess the feasibility, utility (including quality of key indicators), and timeliness of the system for syndromic surveillance purposes. Lessons learned and challenges were identified and recorded during the design and implementation of the system.Results: The pilot ADSSS collected 207,331 records of individual ambulance calls (daily mean = 1,133; range = 923-1,350). The ADSSS was found to be timely in detecting seasonal changes in patterns of respiratory infections and increases in case numbers during seasonal events.Conclusions: Further validation is necessary; however, the findings from the assessment of the pilot ADSSS suggest that selected, but not all, ambulance indicators appear to have some utility for syndromic surveillance purposes in England. There are certain challenges that need to be addressed when designing and implementing similar systems.

Remotely sensed data can, in fact, provide a valuable source of broad scale information at each stage of the disaster management cycle, supporting scientists and authorities in the decision-making process. Geomatics-based procedures and techniques can be especially exploited in the emergency mapping domain for the extraction of reference (pre-event) and crisis (post-event) geographic data. The major challenges today concern the efficient selection (and integration) of the most fit-forpurpose mapping solution(s) and the development of automatic procedures to increase efficiency in data processing.This survey article provides a review of the current optical remote sensing sensors (both satellite and airborne) for rapid mapping applications. Advantages and disadvantages are evaluated in order to support the selection process of the most appropriate means to gather the required information (i.e., significant and value-added data). Since valuable information should be delivered in a very short time, the management of time is defined as a priority and several solutions are discussed to pursue efficiency in both data acquisition and processing. With this in mind, the most significant issues affecting time in each step of the work-flow and overall accuracy are analyzed and reported

TI  - Performance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. While the accuracy of the SLN procedure has been validated in patients with low risk EC, its relevance for high-risk EC remains debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of SLN mapping in patients with high-risk EC.Study Method.We reviewed all patients with high risk EC (grade 3 endometrioid, serous, carcinosarcoma, clear cell and undifferentiated) who underwent primary surgery with SLN mapping followed by pelvic +/- paraaortic lymphadenectomy, between November 2010 and November 2016.Results. Among 128 patients who underwent SLN mapping followed by a pelvic lymph node dissection, 41 (32%) had a positive pelvic lymph node. Overall, 48.8% of patients underwent paraaortic node sampling (62/128). Paraaortic lymph node metastasis was identified in 17.7% of patients in whom a para-aortic lymph node dissection was performed (11/62), and all had positive pelvic lymph nodes as well. Successful SLN mapping occurred in 115/128 (89,8%) patients, with a bilateral detection rate at 63.2% (81/128). Positive SLNs were identified in 30.4% of patients (39/128) including 7 isolated tumor cells (ITC), 4 micrometastasis and 28 macrometastasis. When the SLNs were detected bilaterally, only one false negative case occurred, providing a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 95.8% and 98.2% respectively.Conclusion. Accurate surgical staging is an important prognostic predictor of survival in patients with endometrial cancer. Given the high sensitivity and high negative predictive value found in our study, we believe that the use of SLN mapping appears to be an appropriate staging procedure in high-risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - Exploitation of C-Band Sentinel-1 Images for High-Resolution Wind Field Retrieval in Coastal Zones (Iroise Coast, France)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the favorite ools for earth observation applications, i.e., oceanography, land use mapping, climate change since this device can offer the data at a high spatial resolution and in most meteorological conditions. This is more significant when the data acquired by the Sentinel-1, a new C-band satellite, are exploited. For high-resolution wind field extraction, two different approaches are proposed. In the scatterometry-based approach, wind direction is first extracted by the local gradient method at different scales, i.e., 1-5-km wind resolutions. It is then applied to the empirical geophysical model functions, i.e., CMOD (C-band), for surface wind speed estimation. The advantage of this approach is to deliver accurate wind speed estimates in the range of 2-25 m/s from different SAR data. However, it requires wind direction as an input parameter. This can lead to errors in wind speed estimation due to uncertain wind directions. Therefore, for comparison, in the second approach, we propose the use of the model without wind direction input proposed by Komarov et al. In general, the obtained wind fields based on two proposed approaches are quite similar, and they have good agreement with in situ measurements from the meteorological stations along the Iroise coast.

TI  - Wheat Monitoring by Using Kernel Based Possibilistic <i>c</i>-Means Classifier: Bi-sensor Temporal Multi-spectral Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of mixed pixels in the satellite images has always been an area of concern. Adding to the challenge is an occurrence of non-linearity between the classes, which is generally overlooked. The study makes an attempt to solve the two frequently occurring problems by kernel based fuzzy approach. This research work deals with Possibilistic c-Means (PCM) classifier with local, global, spectral angle and hyper tangent kernels for wheat crop (Triticum aestivum) identification in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India. The multi-temporal vegetation index data of Formosat-2 have been used which covers the whole phenology of wheat crop. The additional sensor Landsat-8 OLI imagery has been filled the crucial gap of Formosat-2 temporal datasets. Nine types of proposed kernels based PCM classifier have been applied on three temporal datasets (four, five and six date combinations) to classify two classes early sown and late sown wheat crop. These test results have been concluded that at optimized weighted constant KMOD and polynomial kernel was found effective to separate wheat crop. The five and six date combination were sufficient to discriminate early sown and late sown wheat crop.

TI  - Modeling of extreme freshwater outflow from the north-eastern Japanese river basins to western Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the importance of accurate extreme discharge input in hydrological and oceanographic combined modeling by introducing two extreme typhoon events. We investigated the effects of extreme freshwater outflow events from river mouths on sea surface salinity distribution (SSS) in the coastal zone of the north-eastern Japan. Previous studies have used observed discharge at the river mouth, as well as seasonally averaged inter-annual, annual, monthly or daily simulated data. Here, we reproduced the hourly peak discharge during two typhoon events for a targeted set of nine rivers and compared their impact on SSS in the coastal zone based on observed, climatological and simulated freshwater outflows in conjunction with verification of the results using satellite remote-sensing data. We created a set of hourly simulated freshwater outflow data from nine first-class Japanese river basins flowing to the western Pacific Ocean for the two targeted typhoon events (Chataan and Roke) and used it with the integrated hydrological (CDRMV3.1.1) and oceanographic (JCOPE-T) model, to compare the case using climatological mean monthly discharges as freshwater input from rivers with the case using our hydrological model simulated discharges. By using the CDRMV model optimized with the SCE-UA method, we successfully reproduced hindcasts for peak discharges of extreme typhoon events at the river mouths and could consider multiple river basin locations. Modeled SSS results were verified by comparison with Chlorophyll-a distribution, observed by satellite remote sensing. The projection of SSS in the coastal zone became more realistic than without including extreme freshwater outflow. These results suggest that our hydrological models with optimized model parameters calibrated to the Typhoon Roke and Chataan cases can be successfully used to predict runoff values from other extreme precipitation events with similar physical characteristics. Proper simulation of extreme typhoon events provides more realistic coastal SSS and may allow a different scenario analysis with various precipitation inputs for developing a now casting analysis in the future.

T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and rapid estimation of biomass is important for the management of rangelands. The objective of this study was to find regression models to predict aerial biomass at a grassland site in the state of Durango, Mexico. For this purpose, samples of above ground biomass and normalized difference vegetation index values were obtained from two sources (NDVI-field radiometer and NDVI-MODIS) during the growing season of 2011 and 2013. Using 2011 data (n=180), the model Ln (Y) = beta(0) + beta X-1 +beta X-2(2) was found with the NDVI-field radiometer, R-2 = 0.54, and Y-Lambda 0.3 = beta(0) + beta X-1 + beta X-2(2) with NDVI-MODIS, R-2 = 0.81. Model validations were carried out comparing regression coefficients of 2011 and 2013 models, there was not significant difference with t (P>0.05). However, model with NDVI-MODIS had 77 outliers; therefore any prediction must be considered cautiously.

TI  - Tc-99m tilmanocept versus Tc-99m sulfur colloid in breast cancer sentinel lymph node identification: Results from a randomized, blinded clinical trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionNo prior trials have compared sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification outcomes between Tc-99m tilmanocept (TcTM) and Tc-99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) in breast cancer (BC).MethodsWe report on the secondary outcomes from a randomized, double-blinded, single surgeon clinical trial comparing post-injection site pain between TcTM and TcSC. Patients were randomized to receive a preoperative single, peritumoral intradermal injection of TcTM or TcSC. The number of total, hot, and blue nodes detected and removed were compared between groups.ResultsFifty-two (27-TcSC and 25-TcTM) patients were enrolled and underwent definitive surgical treatment. At least one hot SLN was detected in all patients. Three (5.8%) patients had a disease positive-SLN. The total number of SLNs removed was 61 (mean 2.26 (standard deviation (SD) 0.90)) in the TcSC group and 54 (mean 2.16 (SD 0.90)) in the TcTM group, P=0.69. The total number of hot nodes in the TcSC group was 1.96 (SD 0.76) compared to 2.04 (SD 0.73) in the TcTM group, P=0.71.ConclusionsThe number of identified SLNs did not differ significantly between TcTM and TcSC. Given that no significant technical advantages exist between the two agents, surgeons should choose a radiopharmaceutical based on cost and side effect profile.

TI  - Using drone-mounted cameras for on-site body documentation: 3D mapping and active survey
T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in unmanned aerial technology have substantially lowered the cost associated with aerial imagery. As a result, forensic practitioners are today presented with easy low-cost access to aerial photographs at remote locations. The present paper aims to explore boundaries in which the low-end drone technology can operate as professional crime scene equipment, and to test the prospects of aerial 3D modeling in the forensic context. The study was based on recent forensic cases of falls from height admitted for postmortem examinations. Three mock outdoor forensic scenes featuring a dummy, skeletal remains and artificial blood were constructed at an abandoned quarry and subsequently documented using a commercial DJI Phantom 2 drone equipped with a GoPro HERO 4 digital camera. In two of the experiments, the purpose was to conduct aerial and ground-view photography and to process the acquired images with a photogrammetry protocol (using Agisoft PhotoScan (R) 1.2.6) in order to generate 3D textured models. The third experiment tested the employment of drone-based video recordings in mapping scattered body parts. The results show that drone-based aerial photography is capable of producing high-quality images, which are appropriate for building accurate large-scale 3D models of a forensic scene. If, however, high-resolution top-down three-dimensional scene documentation featuring details on a corpse or other physical evidence is required, we recommend building a multi-resolution model by processing aerial and ground-view imagery separately. The video survey showed that using an overview recording for seeking out scattered body parts was efficient. In contrast, the less easy-to-spot evidence, such as bloodstains, was detected only after having been marked properly with crime scene equipment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison in waterborne Cu, Ni and Pb bioaccumulation kinetics between different gammarid species and populations: Natural variability and influence of metal exposure history
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Kinetic parameters (uptake from solution and elimination rate constants) of Cu, Ni and Pb bioaccumulation were determined from two Gammarus pulex and three Gammarus fossrum wild populations collected from reference sites throughout France in order to assess the inter-species and the natural inter-population variability of metal bioaccumulation kinetics in that sentinel organism. For that, each population was independently exposed for seven days to either 2.5 mu g L-1 Cu (39.3 nM), 40 mu g L-1 Ni (681 nM) or 10 mu g L-1 Pb (48.3 nM) in laboratory controlled conditions, and then placed in unexposed microcosms for a 7-day depuration period. In the same way, the possible influence of metal exposure history on subsequent metal bioaccumulation kinetics was addressed by collecting wild gammarids from three populations inhabiting stations contaminated either by Cd, Pb or both Pb and Ni (named pre-exposed thereafter). In these pre-exposed organisms, assessment of any changes in metal bioaccumulation kinetics was achieved by comparison with the natural variability of kinetic parameters defined from reference populations. Results showed that in all studied populations (reference and pre-exposed) no significant Cu bioaccumulation was observed at the exposure concentration of 2.5 mu g L-1, Concerning the reference populations, no significant differences in Ni and Pb bioaccumulation kinetics between the two species (G. pulex and G. fossarum) was observed allowing us to consider all the five reference populations to determine the inter-population natural variability, which was found to be relatively low (kinetic parameters determined for each population remained within a factor of 2 of the minimum and maximum values). Organisms from the population exhibiting a Pb exposure history presented reduced Ni uptake and elimination rate constants, whereas no influence on Ni kinetic parameters was observed in organisms from the population exhibiting an exposure history to both Ni and Pb. Furthermore Pb bioaccumulation kinetics were unaffected whatever the condition of pre-exposure in natural environment. Finally, these results highlight the complexity of confounding factors, such as metal exposure history, that influence metal bioaccumulation processes and showed that pre-exposure to one metal can cause changes in the bioaccumulation kinetics of other metals. These results also address the question of the underlying mechanisms developed by organisms to cope with metal contamination.

TI  - Final transitions to place of death: patients and families wishes
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This four-country study ( Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain) examines prevalence and types of final transitions between care settings of cancer patients and the extent to which patient/family wishes are cited as a reason for the transition.Methods Data were collected from the EUROSENTI-MELC study over a 2-year period. General practitioners within existing Sentinel Networks registered weekly all deaths of patients within practices using a standardized questionnaire. This registration included place of care in the final 3 months and wishes for the final transition to place of death. All non-sudden deaths due to cancer (+18 years) were included in the analyses.Results We included 2048 non-sudden cancer deaths; 63% of patients had at least one transition between care settings in the final 3 months of life. 'Hospital death from home' (25-55%) and 'home death from hospital' (16-30%) were the most frequent types of final transitions in all countries. Patients' or families' wishes were mentioned as a reason for a final transition in 5-27% ( P<0.001) and 10-22% ( P = 0.002) across countries.Conclusions 'Hospital deaths from home' is the most prevalent final transition in three of four countries studied, in a significant minority of cases because of patient/family wishes.

TI  - Toward a leading indicator of catastrophic shifts in complex systems: Assessing changing conditions in nation states.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The 20th century was characterized by substantial change on a global scale. There were multiple wars and unrest, social and political transitions, technological innovation and widespread development that impacted every corner of the earth. In order to assess the sustainability implications of these changes, we conducted a study of three advanced nations particularly affected during this time: France, Germany and the United States (USA). All three nation states withstood these changes and yet continued to thrive, which speaks to their resilience. However, we were interested in determining whether any of these countries underwent a regime shift during this period and if they did, whether there was advanced warning that transition was imminent. This study seeks to evaluate systemic trends in each country by exploring key variables that describe its condition over time. We use Fisher Information to assess changing conditions in the nation states based on trends in social, economic and environmental variables and employ Bayes Theorem as an objective means of determining whether declines in Fisher information provide early warning signals of critical transitions. Results indicate that while the United States was relatively stable and France experienced a great deal of change during this period, only Germany appeared to undergo a regime shift. Further, each country exhibited decreasing Fisher information when approaching significant events (e.g., World Wars, Great Depression), and reflected unique mechanisms linked to dynamic changes in each nation state. This study highlights the potential of using trends in Fisher information as a sentinel for evaluating dynamic change and assessing resilience in coupled human and natural systems.

TI  - Validation of MODIS integrated water vapor product against reference GPS data at the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the water vapor product from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument, on-board Aqua and Terra satellites, is compared against GPS water vapor data from 21 stations in the Iberian Peninsula as reference. GPS water vapor data is obtained from ground-based receiver stations which measure the delay caused by water vapor in the GPS microwave signals. The study period extends from 2007 until 2012. Regression analysis in every GPS station show that MODIS overestimates low integrated water vapor (IWV) data and tends to underestimate high IWV data. R-2 shows a fair agreement, between 0.38 and 0.71. Inter quartile range (IQR) in every station is around 30-45%. The dependence on several parameters was also analyzed. IWV dependence showed that low IWV are highly overestimated by MODIS, with high IQR (low precision), sharply decreasing as IWV increases. Regarding dependence on solar zenith angle (SZA), performance of MODIS IWV data decreases between 50 and 90, while night-time MODIS data (infrared) are quite stable. The seasonal cycles of IWV and SZA cause a seasonal dependence on MODIS performance. In summer and winter, MODIS IWV tends to overestimate the reference IWV value, while in spring and autumn the tendency is to underestimate. Low IWV from coastal stations is highly overestimated (similar to 60%) and quite imprecise (IQR around 60%). On the contrary, high IWV data show very little dependence along seasons. Cloud-fraction (CF) dependence was also studied, showing that clouds display a negligible impact on IWV over/underestimation. However, IQR increases with CF, except in night-time satellite values, which are quite stable.

T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This aim of this study was to assess and compare arterial and venous circulation in women with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) before and after breast cancer surgery. Methods and Results: Fifty-two women took part in the study, divided into three groups: those undergoing ALND at levels I, II, and III (ALNDG), with mean age of 56.2910.85 years old; those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBG), with mean age of 57.7 +/- 7.07 years old; and controls without diagnosis of breast cancer (CG), with mean age of 53.92 +/- 8.85 years old. Maximum venous and arterial flow velocities in upper limbs were assessed before and after surgical treatment for breast cancer by means of Doppler ultrasonography (Nicolet Vascular Versalab SE (R)). Data normality was assessed by using the Shapiro-Wilk's test, with normally distributed variables being analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey's test or t-test. For variables with non-normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis' test and post hoc Dunn's test were used at p<0.05. There was significant difference in the maximum blood flow velocities, both venous (ALNDG) and arterial (SLNBG). Conclusion: The results suggest that ALND and SLNB can interfere with the upper limp blood circulation.

TI  - TCCON Philippines: First Measurement Results, Satellite Data and Model Comparisons in Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) is a global network dedicated to the precise and accurate measurements of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The TCCON station in Burgos, Ilocos Norte, Philippines was established with the primary purpose of validating the upcoming Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite-2 (GOSAT-2) mission and in general, to respond to the need for reliable ground-based validation data for satellite GHG observations in the region. Here, we present the first 4 months of data from the new TCCON site in Burgos, initial comparisons with satellite measurements of CO2 and model simulations of CO. A nearest sounding from Japan's GOSAT as well as target mode observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) showed very good consistency in the retrieved column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2, yielding TCCON - satellite differences of 0.86 +/- 1.06 ppm for GOSAT and 0.83 +/- 1.22 ppm for OCO-2. We also show measurements of enhanced CO, probably from East Asia. GEOS-Chem model simulations were used to study the observed CO variability. However, despite the model capturing the pattern of the CO variability, there is an obvious underestimation in the CO magnitude in the model. We conclude that more measurements and modeling are necessary to adequately sample the variability over different seasons and to determine the suitability of current inventories.

TI  - Practice variation in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for melanoma patients in different geographical regions in the Netherlands
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Due to the lack of solid evidence for treatment benefit of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) as part of loco-regional surgical treatment of non-distant metastatic melanoma, there might be variation in surgical treatment strategies in the Netherlands. The objective of the current study was to assess differences in the performance of SLNB, in geographical regions in the Netherlands, of non-distant metastatic melanoma patients (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I-III).Materials and methods: A total of 28 550 melanoma patients, diagnosed between 2005 and 2013, were included in this population based retrospective study. Data were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Treatment strategies in 8 regions of the Netherlands were compared according to stage, excluding patients with distant metastasis (AJCC stage IV).Results: Throughout the Netherlands, there was substantial practice variation across the regions. The performance of SLNB in patients with clinically unsuspected lymph nodes and Breslow thickness >1.0 mm was significantly different between the regions. In a post hoc analysis, we observed that patients aged over 60 years, female patients and patients with a melanoma located in head and neck have lower odds to receive a SLNB.Conclusion: There is considerable loco-regional practice variation which cannot completely be explained by the patient and tumor characteristics, in the surgical treatment of non-distant metastatic melanoma patients in the Netherlands. Although national guidelines recommend considering SLNB in all patients with a melanoma thicker than 1 mm, only half of the patients received a SLNB. Future research should assess whether this practice variation leads to unwanted variations in clinical outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remote Sensing in Human Health: A 10-Year Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A mixed methods bibliometric analysis was performed to ascertain the characteristic of scientific literature published in a 10-year period (2007-2016) regarding the application of remote sensing data in human health. A search was performed on the Scopus database, followed by manual revision using synthesis studies' techniques, requiring the authors to sort through more than 8000 medical concepts to create the query, and to manually select relevant papers from over 2000 documents. From the initial 2752 papers identified, 520 articles were selected for analysis, showing that the United States ranked first, with a total of 250 (48.1% of the total) documents, followed by France and the United Kingdom, with 67 (12.9% of the total) and 54 (10.4% of the total) documents, respectively. When considering authorship, the top three authors were Vounatsou P (22 articles), Utzinger J (19 articles), and Vignolles C (13 articles). Regarding disease-specific keywords, malaria, dengue, and schistosomiasis were the most frequent keywords, occurring 142, 34, and 24 times, respectively. For some infectious diseases and other highly pathogenic or emerging infectious diseases, remote sensing has become a very powerful instrument. Also, several studies relate different environmental factors retrieved by remote sensing data with other diseases, such as asthma exacerbations. Health-related remote sensing publications are increasing and this paper highlights the importance of these related technologies toward better information and, ideally, better provision of healthcare. On the other hand, this paper provides an overall picture of the state of the research regarding the application of remote sensing data in human health and identifies the most active stakeholders e.g., authors and institutions in the field, informing possible new collaboration research groups.

TI  - Bovine A20 gene overexpression during bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 infection blocks NF-κB pathway in MDBK cells
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Viruses have developed cellular strategies to ensure progeny survival. One of the most interesting is immune camouflage, where the virus triggers a controlled-intensity immune response that prevents total destruction of the infected cell, thus "winning time" for the virus. This study explored the regulatory contexts of the bovine A20 gene during bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-1 infection, using IL-8 as an immune-response sentinel molecule. Assessments were conducted through RT-qPCR, Western blotting, gene silencing/overexpression, luciferase assays, and the use of pharmacological inhibitors, among other approaches. The results demonstrated that a) BVDV-1 increased A20 levels in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, b) increased A20 led to decreased IL-8 expression, and c) the virus affected the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Collectively, these data identify bovine A20 as a strong regulator of immune marker expression. In conclusion, this is the first report on BVDV-1 modulating bovine IL-8 activation through the NF-kappa B/A20 pathway. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal Variability of Total Ozone in the Asian Region Inferred from Ground-Based and Satellite Measurement Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports investigation data on the temporal variability of total ozone content (TOC) in the Central Asian and Tibet Plateau mountain regions obtained by conventional methods, as well as by spectral, cross-wavelet, and composite analyses. The data of ground-based observation stations located at Huang He, Kunming, and Lake Issyk-Kul, along with the satellite data obtained at SBUV/SBUV2 (SBUV merged total and profile ozone data, Version 8.6) for 1980-2013 and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and TOU (Total Ozone Unit) for 2009-2013 have been used. The average relative deviation from the SBUV/SBUV2 data is less than 1% in Kunming and Issyk-Kul for the period of 1980-2013, while the Huang He Station is characterized by an excess of the satellite data over the ground-based information at an average deviation of 2%. According to the Fourier analysis results, the distribution of amplitudes and the periods of TOC oscillations within a range of over 14 months is similar for all series analyzed. Meanwhile, according to the cross-wavelet and composite analyses results, the phase relationships between the series may considerably differ, especially in the periods of 5-7 years. The phase of quasi-decennial oscillations in the Kunming Station is close to the 11-year oscillations of the solar cycle, while in the Huang He and Issyk-Kul stations the TOC variations go ahead of the solar cycle.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Phase of Total Ozone Quasi-Decennial Oscillations
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The SBUV/SBUV2 (65A degrees S-65A degrees N) and Bodeker Scientific (90A degrees S-90A degrees N) satellite databases have been used for composite and cross-wavelet analyses of the spatio-temporal variability of phase relations between a 11-year cycle of solar activity (SA) and quasi-decennial oscillations (QDOs) of total ozone content (TOC). For globally average TOC values, the QDO maxima coincide in phase with the solar-activity maxima, and amplitude variations of TOC correlate with those of the 11-year solar cycle. According to the analysis of amplitude and phase of QDOs for the zonal average TOC fields, a QDO amplitude is about 6-7 Dobson Units (DU) in the high northern and southern latitudes, and it does not exceed 2-3 DU in the tropic regions. The latitudinal TOC variations are distinguished by a delay of the quasi-decennial oscillation phase in the southern latitudes in comparison with the northern latitudes. The TOC maxima phase coincides with the SA maxima phase in the tropic regions; the TOC variations go ahead of the SA variations, on average, in moderate and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere; the TOC variations are behind the SA variations in the Southern Hemisphere. The phase delay between TOC QDO maxima in the northern and southern latitudes appears to increase in the course of time, and the TOC quasi-decennial variations in the Arctic and Antarctic subpolar regions occur approximately in an antiphase over the last two decades.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of breast cancer is based on the multimodal principle and surgery of regional lymph nodes is an inseparable part of this. Indication criteria are changing constantly folowing advances in other modalities. It is necessary to consider not only the diagnostic or therapeutic benefit but also to take into account adverse effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that axillary dissection (ALND) is burdened by a high frequency of chronic lymphoedema of the arm or chest wall; however, a considerable percentage of patients may also suffer from lymphoedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).AIM: This paper focuses on the pathophysiology of lymphoedema, its potential predictive factors, and its complications. Furthermore, it presents an overview of published studies comparing the incidences of lymphoedema after current axillary surgery for breast cancer together with current trends designed to radically reduce the number of these operations. It also briefly refers to the possibilities of implementing preventive or therapeutic operations for lymphoedema.CONCLUSIONS: Both ALND and SLNB are burdened by a clinically significant risk of lymphoedema. This risk is more serious after ALND. In the medium term, approximately 7-59% of operated patients suffer from lymphoedema. The incidence of lymphoedema after SLNB, considered a very gentle method, is also not negligible (0-14%). As the number of patients surviving breast cancer treatment continues to increase, monitoring the undesirable effects of axillary surgery over the long term will become more important. The results of published studies support research into treatment methods that have the potential to reduce the radicality of axillary surgery while preserving or improving total medical effectiveness.Key words: breast neoplasms - sentinel lymph node biopsy - axillary dissection - adverse effects - breast cancer lymphedemaThis work was supported by the grants MEYS - NPS I - LO1413 and MH CZ - DRO (MMCI, 00209- 805).The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical papers.Submitted: 7. 11. 2016Accepted: 5. 12. 2016.

TI  - Dengue vector control in Malaysia: Are we moving in the right direction?
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Dengue is a major public health problem across more than 123 countries. Vector control has been the hallmark of the dengue control programme in many countries in Southeast Asia since there are no anti-dengue drugs available, and the most recent dengue vaccine is partly efficacious. House-to-house larval surveys, source reduction, larviciding, fogging, ULV which have been carried out since the inception of the dengue control programme in the 1970s are no longer practicable and need to be augmented by more targeted but less ambitious outbreak responses that focus on a few tools that might justify expense of deployment. However, according to recent reports these tools have not really been evaluated for their effectiveness in dengue control. Novel techniques such the release of genetically modified mosquitoes (RIDL) and the use of the bacterium Wolbachia to control the populations of the Ae. aegypti are still under trial. In this review proactive methods to detect epidemics have been suggested. Tools based on adult mosquitoes is an important strategy for dengue vector surveillance and control. The outbreak response may be more efficient when timely vector control measures are implemented after the immediate detection of an infected mosquito.

TI  - Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing of Phytoplankton Pigment Absorption Properties in Cyanobacteria Bloom Waters: A Regional Example in the Western Basin of Lake Erie
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton pigments absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, protect the chloroplast from damage caused by excess light energy, and influence the color of the water. Some pigments act as bio-markers and are important for separation of phytoplankton functional types. Among many efforts that have been made to obtain information on phytoplankton pigments from bio-optical properties, Gaussian curves decomposed from phytoplankton absorption spectrum have been used to represent the light absorption of different pigments. We incorporated the Gaussian scheme into a semi-analytical model and obtained the Gaussian curves from remote sensing reflectance. In this study, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to explore the potential of obtaining the Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing. Results showed that the Gaussian curves can be retrieved with 35% or less mean unbiased absolute percentage differences from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-like sensors. Further, using Lake Erie as an example, the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations were obtained from the Gaussian curves and used as metrics for the spatial extent of an intense cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Erie in 2014. The seasonal variations of Gaussian absorption properties in 2011 were further obtained from MERIS imagery. This study shows that it is feasible to obtain Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data, and the obtained chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations from these Gaussian peak heights demonstrated potential application to monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs) and identification of phytoplankton groups from satellite ocean color remote sensing semi-analytically.

TI  - Detecting Forest Disturbance in Northeast China from GLASS LAI Time Series Data Using a Dynamic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale forest disturbance often leads to changes in forest cover and structure, which imposes a great uncertainty in the estimation of the forest carbon cycle and biomass and affects other applications. In northeastern China, the Daxinganling region has abundant forest resources, where the forest coverage is about 30%. The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI) time series data provide important information to monitor the possible change of forests. In this study, we developed a new method to detect forest disturbances using GLASS LAI data over the Daxinganling region of Northeast China. As a dynamic model, the season-trend model has a higher sensitivity toward a seasonal change in LAI. Based on the accumulation of multi-year GLASS LAI products from 1997 to 2002, the dynamic model of LAI time series for each pixel is established first. The time-stepping modeling (TSM) process was designed by using the season-trend method, and sequential tests for detecting disturbances from a time series of pixels. Significant changes in the model parameters were captured as disturbance signals. Then, the near-infrared and shortwave-infrared bands of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance are used as auxiliary information to distinguish the types of forest disturbances. Here, the algorithm led to the detection of two different types of disturbances: fire and other (e.g., insect, drought, deforestation). In this study, we took the forest region as the study area, used the 8-day composite GLASS LAI data at 1000-m spatial resolution to identify each pixel as a fire disturbance, other disturbance, or non-disturbance. Validation was performed using reference burned area data derived from Landsat 30 m imagery. Results were also compared with the MCD64 product. The validation results were based on confusion matrices showing the overall accuracy (OA) exceeded 92% for our method and the MCD64 product. Statistical tests identified that TSM's product accuracy is higher than that of MCD64. This study demonstrated that the TSM algorithm using a season-trend model provides a simple and automated approach to identify and map forest disturbance.

TI  - Improving Burst Alignment in TOPS Interferometry With Bivariate Enhanced Spectral Diversity
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS)mode synthetic aperture radar interferometry requires high accuracy of burst alignments. Geometrical burst alignment relying on precise orbits and digital topography is not always sufficient for Sentinel-1A TOPS-mode interferometry. Enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) method was proposed to estimate a constant azimuth shift between radar images that minimizes phase discontinuities across the bursts. In some cases, however, the ESD refinement fails to align the bursts in Sentinel-1 interferograms, possibly because of ionospheric propagation effects. Here, we show that in such cases, a bivariate shift (that depends on both azimuth and range) can efficiently remove phase discontinuities across the bursts. The bivariate shift can be derived from the double-differenced radar phase in the burst overlap regions.

TI  - Temporal Changes in Coupled Vegetation Phenology and Productivity are Biome-Specific in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has greatly stimulated vegetation growth through both extending the growing season and promoting photosynthesis in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Analyzing the combined dynamics of such trends can potentially improve our current understanding on changes in vegetation functioning and the complex relationship between anthropogenic and climatic drivers. This study aims to analyze the relationships (long-term trends and correlations) of length of vegetation growing season (LOS) and vegetation productivity assessed by the growing season NDVI integral (GSI) in the NH (>30 degrees N) to study any dependency of major biomes that are characterized by different imprint from anthropogenic influence. Spatial patterns of converging/diverging trends in LOS and GSI and temporal changes in the coupling between LOS and GSI are analyzed for major biomes at hemispheric and continental scales from the third generation Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset for a 32-year period (1982-2013). A quarter area of the NH is covered by converging trends (consistent significant trends in LOS and GSI), whereas diverging trends (opposing significant trends in LOS and GSI) cover about 6% of the region. Diverging trends are observed mainly in high latitudes and arid/semi-arid areas of non-forest biomes (shrublands, savannas, and grasslands), whereas forest biomes and croplands are primarily characterized by converging trends. The study shows spatially-distinct and biome-specific patterns between the continental land masses of Eurasia (EA) and North America (NA). Finally, areas of high positive correlation between LOS and GSI showed to increase during the period of analysis, with areas of significant positive trends in correlation being more widespread in NA as compared to EA. The temporal changes in the coupled vegetation phenology and productivity suggest complex relationships and interactions that are induced by both ongoing climate change and increasingly intensive human disturbances.

TI  - Comparison of Spatial Interpolation and Regression Analysis Models for an Estimation of Monthly Near Surface Air Temperature in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near surface air temperature (NSAT) is a primary descriptor of terrestrial environmental conditions. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to develop various methods for obtaining spatially continuous NSAT from gauge or station observations. This study compared three spatial interpolation (i.e., Kriging, Spline, and Inversion Distance Weighting (IDW)) and two regression analysis (i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) models for predicting monthly minimum, mean, and maximum NSAT in China, a domain with a large area, complex topography, and highly variable station density. This was conducted for a period of 12 months of 2010. The accuracy of the GWR model is better than the MLR model with an improvement of about 3 degrees C in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which indicates that the GWR model is more suitable for predicting monthly NSAT than the MLR model over a large scale. For three spatial interpolation models, the RMSEs of the predicted monthly NSAT are greater in the warmer months, and the mean RMSEs of the predicted monthly mean NSAT for 12 months in 2010 are 1.56 degrees C for the Kriging model, 1.74 degrees C for the IDW model, and 2.39 degrees C for the Spline model, respectively. The GWR model is better than the Kriging model in the warmer months, while the Kriging model is superior to the GWR model in the colder months. The total precision of the GWR model is slightly higher than the Kriging model. The assessment result indicated that the higher standard deviation and the lower mean of NSAT from sample data would be associated with a better performance of predicting monthly NSAT using spatial interpolation models.

TI  - MODIS-Based Estimation of Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux over North America Using Three Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) is a key component of the global terrestrial water, energy, and carbon exchanges. Accurate estimation of LE from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data remains a major challenge. In this study, we estimated the daily LE for different plant functional types (PFTs) across North America using three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN); support vector machines (SVM); and, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) driven by MODIS and Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorology data. These three predictive algorithms, which were trained and validated using observed LE over the period 2000-2007, all proved to be accurate. However, ANN outperformed the other two algorithms for the majority of the tested configurations for most PFTs and was the only method that arrived at 80% precision for LE estimation. We also applied three machine learning algorithms for MODIS data and MERRA meteorology to map the average annual terrestrial LE of North America during 2002-2004 using a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, which proved to be useful for estimating the long-term LE over North America.

TI  - No Consistent Evidence for Advancing or Delaying Trends in Spring Phenology on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change and has significant effects on the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth's "third pole," is a unique region for studying the long-term trends in vegetation phenology in response to climate change because of the sensitivity of its alpine ecosystems to climate and its low-level human disturbance. There has been a debate whether the trends in spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau have been continuously advancing over the last two to three decades. In this study, we examine the trends in the start of growing season (SOS) for alpine meadow and steppe using the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) 3g normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data set (1982-2014), the GIMMS NDVI data set (1982-2006), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data set (2001-2014), the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT-VEG) NDVI data set (1999-2013), and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) NDVI data set (1998-2007). Both logistic and polynomial fitting methods are used to retrieve the SOS dates from the NDVI data sets. Our results show that the trends in spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau depend on both the NDVI data set used and the method for retrieving the SOS date. There are large discrepancies in the SOS trends among the different NDVI data sets and between the two different retrieval methods. There is no consistent evidence that spring phenology ("green-up" dates) has been advancing or delaying over the Tibetan Plateau during the last two to three decades. Ground-based budburst data also indicate no consistent trends in spring phenology. The responses of SOS to environmental factors (air temperature, precipitation, soil temperature, and snow depth) also vary among NDVI data sets and phenology retrieval methods. The increases in winter and spring temperature had offsetting effects on spring phenology.

TI  - Metastatic Breast Carcinoma to the Superior Oblique in a Male.
T2  - Ophthalmology and therapy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We describe a case of breast cancer metastatic to the superior oblique, in a male. The patient was a 66-year-old Caucasian male with a history of stage IIIB rectal adenocarcinoma and stage IIA left breast carcinoma diagnosed 12years and 5years prior, respectively, who presented with headaches and intermittent diplopia. He underwent left total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy 6years prior, which showed ER/PR+, HER2/neu-, moderately-differentiated, infiltrating ductal carcinoma with 3/14 positive nodes. He completed adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and oral tamoxifen, and prior routine surveillance imaging had found no evidence of recurrent disease. MRI of the orbit revealed a 0.7*1.4*1.9cm mass in the superomedial right orbit in the region of the superior oblique. Transcaruncular orbitotomy with biopsy of the superior oblique revealed metastatic breast carcinoma. Unfortunately, he developed new metastases. Post-operatively, he continues to have good vision with minimal diplopia.

TI  - The Oxford space environment goniometer: A new experimental setup for making directional emissivity measurements under a simulated space environment
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of the light scattering behaviour of the regoliths of airless bodies via remote sensing techniques in the Solar System, across wavelengths from the visible to the far infrared, are essential in understanding their surface properties. A key parameter is knowledge of the angular behaviour of scattered light, usually represented mathematically by a phase function. The phase function is believed to be dependent on many factors including the following: surface composition, surface roughness across all length scales, and the wavelength of radiation. Although there have been many phase function measurements of regolith analog materials across visible wavelengths, there have been no equivalent measurements made in the thermal infrared (TIR). This may have been due to a lack of TIR instruments as part of planetary remote sensing payloads. However, since the launch of Diviner to the Moon in 2009, OSIRIS-Rex to the asteroid Bennu in 2016, and the planned launch of BepiColombo to Mercury in 2018, there is now a large quantity of TIR remote sensing data that need to be interpreted. It is therefore important to extend laboratory phase function measurements to the TIR. This paper describes the design, build, calibration, and initial measurements from a new laboratory instrument that is able to make phase function measurements of analog planetary regoliths across wavelengths from the visible to the TIR.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat-7 Reflectance Images via Compressed Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of remote sensing images with different spatial and temporal resolutions is needed for diverse Earth observation applications. A small number of spatiotemporal fusion methods that use sparse representation appear to be more promising than weighted-and unmixing-based methods in reflecting abruptly changing terrestrial content. However, none of the existing dictionary-based fusion methods consider the downsampling process explicitly, which is the degradation and sparse observation from high-resolution images to the corresponding low-resolution images. In this paper, the downsampling process is described explicitly under the framework of compressed sensing for reconstruction. With the coupled dictionary to constrain the similarity of sparse coefficients, a new dictionary-based spatiotemporal fusion method is built and named compressed sensing for spatiotemporal fusion, for the spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images. To deal with images with a high-resolution difference, typically Landsat-7 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), the proposed model is performed twice to shorten the gap between the small block size and the large resolution rate. In the experimental procedure, the near-infrared, red, and green bands of Landsat-7 and MODIS are fused with root mean square errors to check the prediction accuracy. It can be concluded from the experiment that the proposed methods can produce higher quality than five state-of-the-art methods, which prove the feasibility of incorporating the downsampling process in the spatiotemporal model under the framework of compressed sensing.

TI  - Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency of Different Surveillance Components for Proving Freedom and Early Detection of Disease: Bluetongue Serotype 8 in Cattle as Case Study for Belgium, France and the Netherlands
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quick detection and recovery of country's freedom status remain a constant challenge in animal health surveillance. The efficacy and cost efficiency of different surveillance components in proving the absence of infection or (early) detection of bluetongue serotype 8 in cattle populations within different countries (the Netherlands, France, Belgium) using surveillance data from years 2006 and 2007 were investigated using an adapted scenario tree model approach. First, surveillance components (sentinel, yearly cross-sectional and passive clinical reporting) within each country were evaluated in terms of efficacy for substantiating freedom of infection. Yearly cross-sectional survey and passive clinical reporting performed well within each country with sensitivity of detection values ranging around 0.99. The sentinel component had a sensitivity of detection around 0.7. Secondly, how effective the components were for (early) detection of bluetongue serotype 8 and whether syndromic surveillance on reproductive performance, milk production and mortality data available from the Netherlands and Belgium could be of added value were evaluated. Epidemic curves were used to estimate the timeliness of detection. Sensitivity analysis revealed that expected within-herd prevalence and number of herds processed were the most influential parameters for proving freedom and early detection. Looking at the assumed direct costs, although total costs were low for sentinel and passive clinical surveillance components, passive clinical surveillance together with syndromic surveillance (based on reproductive performance data) turned out most cost-efficient for the detection of bluetongue serotype 8. To conclude, for emerging or re-emerging vectorborne disease that behaves such as bluetongue serotype 8, it is recommended to use passive clinical and syndromic surveillance as early detection systems for maximum cost efficiency and sensitivity. Once an infection is detected and eradicated, cross-sectional screening for substantiating freedom of infection and sentinel for monitoring the disease evolution are recommended.

TI  - Effects of land use changes on soil water conservation in Hainan Island, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical areas, a large number of natural forests have been transformed into other plantations, which affected the water conservation function of terrestrial ecosystems. In order to clarify the effects of land use changes on soil water conservation function, we selected four typical land use types in the central mountainous region of Hainan Island, i.e., natural forests with stand age greater than 100 years (VF), secondary forests with stand age of 10 years (SF), arena plantations with stand age of 12 years (AF) and rubber plantations with stand age of 35 years (RF). The effects of land use change on soil water holding capacity and water conservation (presented by soil water index, SWI) were assessed. The results showed that, compared with VF, the soil water holding capacity index of other land types decreased in the top soil layer (0-10 cm). AF had the lowest soil water holding capacity in all soil layers. Soil water content and maximum water holding capacity were significantly related to canopy density, soil organic matter and soil bulk density, which indicated that canopy density, soil organic matter and compactness were important factors influencing soil water holding capacity. Compared to VF, soil water conservation of SF, AF and RF were reduced by 27.7%, 54.3% and 11.5%, respectively. The change of soil water conservation was inconsistent in different soil layers. Vegetation canopy density, soil organic matter and soil bulk density explained 83.3% of the variance of soil water conservation. It was suggested that land use conversion had significantly altered soil water holding capacity and water conservation function. RF could keep the soil water better than AF in the research area. Increasing soil organic matter and reducing soil compaction would be helpful to improve soil water holding capacity and water conservation function in land management.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of land use and cropping frequency in a tropical catchment of South India
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - India's rapid population and economic growth leads to fast changing land use and management practices that have a major impact on the environment. Therefore, this study assesses spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and cropping frequencies using moderate resolution spaceborne data (Landsat 7 and LISS III). Based on a hierarchical knowledge-based classification approach, multi-temporal satellite data from the years 2000/2001 and 2010/2011 have been used to derive land use and cropping frequency maps. The approach adopted in this study resulted in a satisfactory classification quality as indicated by overall accuracies > 90% for the individual classifications. A reduced land use pressure on mountainous areas was found, indicated by an increasing development of forests within the transition zones between cultivated land and steep slopes. Furthermore, an increase of tree plantations points to a shift from drought vulnerable plants to less risk prone perennial plants. We found a higher cropping frequency in 2010/11 related to both inter-annual precipitation differences over the course of the rainy season and long-term socio-economic changes. While low yield areas are left for natural succession or switched to tree plantations, the cultivation of high yield areas was intensified.

TI  - Magnetic Marking and Intraoperative Detection of Primary Draining Lymph Nodes in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Using Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles: Additional Diagnostic Value
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node dissection (sLND) using a magnetometer and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as a tracer was successfully applied in prostate cancer (PCa). Radioisotope-guided sLND combined with extended pelvic LND (ePLND) achieved better node removal, increasing the number of affected nodes or the detection of sentinel lymph nodes outside the established ePLND template. We determined the diagnostic value of additional magnetometer-guided sLND after intraprostatic SPION-injection in high-risk PCa. This retrospective study included 104 high-risk PCa patients (PSA >20 ng/mL and/or Gleason score 8 and/or cT2c) from a prospective cohort who underwent radical prostatectomy with magnetometer-guided sLND and ePLND. The diagnostic accuracy of sLND was assessed using ePLND as a reference standard. Lymph node metastases were found in 61 of 104 patients (58.7%). sLND had a 100% diagnostic rate, 96.6% sensitivity, 95.6% specificity, 96.6% positive predictive value, 95.6% negative predictive value, 3.4% false negative rate, and 4.4% false positive rate (detecting lymph node metastases outside the ePLND template). These findings demonstrate the high sensitivity and additional diagnostic value of magnetometer-guided sLND, exceeding that of ePLND through the individualized extension of PLND or the detection of sentinel lymph nodes/lymph node metastases outside the established node template in high-risk PCa.

TI  - The Effect of ENSO on the Variability of Chlorophyll-a and Sea Surface Temperature in the Maluku Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Maluku Sea features strong Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) bloom and sea surface temperature (SST) cooling during the Southeast Monsoon season. Using high-resolution Chl-a and SST satellite observations over a long time window, this study aims to investigate the effect of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the seasonal variability of Chl-a and SST in the Maluku Sea. During the El Nino and La Nina, the maximum Chl-a concentration (greater than 0.5 mg/m(3)) and minimum SST (less than 27.5 degrees C) are observed in August. This finding is in line with prior investigation. Moreover, we reveal that the ENSO does not alter the seasonal variability of Chl-a and SST in the region, but the magnitudes of summertime Chl-a bloom and SST cooling are enhanced (reduced) by about 0.1 mg/m(3) and 0.5 degrees C during the El Nino (La Nina). This is caused by an increase (decrease) in the sea level pressure gradients, which possibly enhanced (reduced) wind-driven mixing in the Maluku Sea.

TI  - Optimisation of machining parameters during ball end milling of hardened steel with various surface inclinations
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a method for the reduction of forces and the improvement of efficiency during finish ball end milling of hardened 55NiCrMoV6 steel. The primary objective of this work concentrates on the optimal selection of milling parameters (cutting speed - v(c), surface inclination angle a), which enables the simultaneous minimisation of cutting force values and increased process efficiency. The research includes the measurement of cutting forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) during milling tests with variable input parameters and calculation of process efficiency accounting for cutting parameters and surface inclination. The paper then focuses on the multi-criteria optimisation of the ball end milling process in terms of cutting forces and efficiency. This procedure is carried out with the application of the response surface method, based on the minimisation of a total utility function. The work shows that surface inclination angle has a significant influence on the cutting force values. Minimal cutting forces and relative high efficiency can be achieved with cutting speed v(c) = 375 m/min and surface inclination angle alpha = 15 degrees. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Annual Seasonality Extraction Using the Cubic Spline Function and Decadal Trend in Temporal Daytime MODIS LST Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining climate-related satellite data that strongly relate to seasonal phenomena requires appropriate methods for detecting the seasonality to accommodate different temporal resolutions, high signal variability and consecutive missing values in the data series. Detection of satellite-based Land Surface Temperature (LST) seasonality is essential and challenging due to missing data and noise in time series data, particularly in tropical regions with heavy cloud cover and rainy seasons. We used a semi-parametric approach, involving the cubic spline function with the annual periodic boundary condition and weighted least square (WLS) regression, to extract annual LST seasonal pattern without attempting to estimate the missing values. The time series from daytime Aqua eight-day MODIS LST located on Phuket Island, southern Thailand, was selected for seasonal extraction modelling across three different land cover types. The spline-based technique with appropriate number and placement of knots produces an acceptable seasonal pattern of surface temperature time series that reflects the actual local season and weather. Finally, the approach was applied to the morning and afternoon MODIS LST datasets (MOD11A2 and MYD11A2) to demonstrate its application on seasonally-adjusted long-term LST time series. The surface temperature trend in both space and time was examined to reveal the overall 10-year period trend of LST in the study area. The result of decadal trend analysis shows that various Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) types have increasing, but variable surface temperature trends.

TI  - Long-term habitat loss in a lightly-disturbed population of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, <i>Sousa chinensis</i>
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and estuarine waters are important ecosystems with high primary and secondary productivity, but they are prone to the impacts of habitat loss caused by anthropogenic activities. For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. >A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. >Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6km(2) of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40years, 60km(2) within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. >The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns. >Habitat protection actions for dolphins in the northern Beibu Gulf should include both core and linking habitats, including enacting protected areas in core habitats, mitigating anthropogenic impacts in likely habitats, restoring both coastal waters and surrounding landscape quality, effective treatment of industrial sewage discharge, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments for the planning of coastal development projects.

TI  - Estimated incidence and number of outpatient visits for seasonal influenza in 2015-2016 in Beijing, China
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on morbidity burden of seasonal influenza in China is limited. A multiplier model was used to estimate the incidence and number of outpatient visits for seasonal influenza by age group for the 2015-2016 season in Beijing, the capital of China, based on reported numbers of influenza-like illness consultations and proportions of positive cases from influenza surveillance systems in Beijing, general consultation rates and other parameters from previous studies, surveys and surveillance systems. An estimated total of 1 190 200 (95% confidence interval (CI) 830 400-1 549 900) cases of influenza virus infections occurred in Beijing, 2015-2016 season, with an attack rate of 55% (95% CI 39-72%). These infections resulted in an estimated 468 280 (95% CI 70 700-606 800) outpatient visits, with an attack rate of 22% (95% CI 03-28%). The attack rate of influenza virus infections was highest among children aged 0-4 years (319% (95% CI 219-419%)), followed by children aged 5-14 years (187% (95% CI 129-245%)). Our study demonstrated a substantial influenza-related morbidity in Beijing, China, especially among the preschool- and school-aged children. This suggests that development or modification of seasonal influenza targeted vaccination strategies need to recognize that incidence is highest in children.

TI  - A Backscattering-Suppression-Based Variational Level-Set Method for Segmentation of SAR Oil Slick Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust and accurate segmentation of oil slick regions from synthetic aperture radar satellite images plays a fundamental role for detecting and monitoring of oil spills. However, uneven intensity, high noise, and blurry boundary, which always exist in oil spill images, make the automatic segmentation of such images very difficult. In this paper, a two-stage method is developed for the segmentation of oil spill images. The first stage of our method is to obtain the enhanced image by suppressing the backscattering from an oil spill image. Once the enhanced image is obtained, then in the second stage, a variational segmentation model is presented for dealing with the enhanced image. The data term of the energy functional is constructed for the enhanced image in a piecewise constant way. In addition, a Cahn-Hilliard-type regularization term is introduced into the energy functional. The variational model is numerically solved by alternating minimization. Numerical experiments on 65 oil spill images from ENVISAT show that the proposed method can obtain an overall accuracy of 94% for dark spot segmentation and create limited false alarms and outperforms the two representative state-of-the-art methods in terms of the efficiency and accuracy.

TI  - Simulating Impacts of Real-World Wind Farms on Land Surface Temperature Using the WRF Model: Validation with Observations
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study simulates the impacts of real-world wind farms on land surface temperature (LST) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model driven by realistic initial and boundary conditions. The simulated wind farm impacts are compared with the observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the first Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP) field campaign. Simulations are performed over west-central Texas for the month of July throughout 7 years (2003-04 and 2010-14). Two groups of experiments are conducted: 1) direct validations of the simulated LST changes between the preturbine period (2003-04) and postturbine period (2010-14) validated against the MODIS observations; and 2) a model sensitivity test of LST to the wind turbine parameterization by examining LST differences with and without the wind turbines for the postturbine period. Overall, the WRF Model is moderately successful at reproducing the observed spatiotemporal variations of the background LST but has difficulties in reproducing such variations for the turbine-induced LST change signals at pixel levels. However, the model is still able to reproduce coherent and consistent responses of the observed LST changes at regional scales. The simulated wind farm-induced LST warming signals agree well with the satellite observations in terms of their spatial coupling with the wind farm layout. Moreover, the simulated areal mean warming signal (0.20 degrees-0.26 degrees C) is about a tenth of a degree smaller than that from MODIS (0.33 degrees C). However, these results suggest that the current wind turbine parameterization tends to induce a cooling effect behind the wind farm region at nighttime, which has not been confirmed by previous field campaigns and satellite observations.

TI  - Pathogenicity and transmissibility of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 isolated from a domestic goose in Southern China
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the first outbreak of H5N6 reported in Laos at 2013, there has been a dramatic increase in H5N6 strains isolated from waterfowl in China, particularly Southern China. However, pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus in different birds remain largely unknown. In this study, a novel H5N6 virus, termed QY01, that belonged to group C in 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an apparently healthy domestic goose in Guangdong province, southern China in 2016. In order to simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of birds, we evaluated its pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens, domestic geese and pigeons. To investigate the replication and shedding of QY01 in poultry, chickens, geese and pigeons were inoculated intranasally with 10(6) EID50 of virus. In addition, to measure intra-species transmission of QY01, three sentinel birds were housed with each group. The results demonstrated that QY01 exhibited a highly pathogenic phenotype, and was transmissible among in chickens and geese. However, the virus did not appear to be pathogenic in pigeons, indicating that this novel H5N6 virus exhibited different host ranges and tissue tropisms, and may pose a substantial risk for the chicken and goose industry. Therefore, continued surveillance for H5N6 AIV5 is necessary, and increased attention should be paid to cross-species transmission between waterfowl and terrestrial birds.

TI  - Reconstruction of Long-Term Temporally Continuous NDVI and Surface Reflectance From AVHRR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancedvery high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data provide the longest available time series of global satellite observations and have been extensively used. The Land Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) project has generated daily surface reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products from AVHRR. However, residual cloud and aerosol contamination in the LTDR AVHRR surface reflectance and NDVI products significantly limits their applications and results in temporal and spatial inconsistencies in subsequent downstream products. Based on the LTDR AVHRR surface reflectance, a temporally continuous vegetation indices-based land-surface reflectance reconstruction (VIRR) method was refined in this study to generate Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) AVHRR NDVI and surface reflectance products from 1982 to 2015. The daily LTDR AVHRR surface reflectance data were first aggregated into eight-day intervals. The aggregated surface reflectance data were used to calculate NDVI, and a robust smoothing algorithm was used to reconstruct continuous and smooth NDVI upper envelopes, which were used to identify cloud-contaminated surface reflectance values. Then the surface reflectance time series was reconstructed from cloud-free surface reflectance values by incorporating the upper envelopes of the NDVI time series as constraints. The results show that the refined VIRR method successfully removes NDVI and surface reflectance values contaminated by clouds and can reconstruct temporally continuous NDVI and land-surface reflectance time series. Comparison of the GLASS AVHRR NDVI product with the third-generation Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS3g) and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI products indicates that these NDVI products exhibit similar spatial patterns, but the GIMMS3g NDVI values were clearly higher than the GLASS AVHRR and MODIS NDVI values in tropical forest regions and the 50 degrees N-60 degrees N latitude band, particularly in July. Comparisons with the MODIS NDVI values over the BELMANIP (Benchmark Land Multisite Analysis and Intercomparisonof Products) sites demonstrate that the GLASS AVHRR NDVI product provides better performance (RMSE = 0.1007 and Bias = 0.0518) than the GIMMS3g NDVI product (RMSE = 0.1288 and Bias = 0.0852). The temporal profiles of all these NDVI products exhibited consistent seasonal variations, but the temporal smoothness of the GLASS AVHRR NDVI product was superior to that of the GIMMS3g and MODIS NDVI products. The GLASS AVHRR and GIMMS3g NDVI products show consistent trends in most situations, but the trends of the GLASS AVHRR NDVI product were slightly more pronounced than those of the GIMMS3g NDVI product for each biome type. Comparison of the GLASS AVHRR surface reflectance product with MODIS surface reflectance product indicates the GLASS AVHRR and MODIS surface reflectance showed similar seasonal and interannual variations and the GLASS AVHRR surface reflectance was in good agreement with the MODIS surface reflectance, especially in the red band.

TI  - On-Orbit Radiometric Calibration for a Space-Borne Multi-Camera Mosaic Imaging Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the core and foundational technology, on-orbit radiometric calibration of a space-borne sensor is of great importance for quantitative remote sensing applications. As for the space-borne multi-camera mosaic imaging sensor, however, the currently available on-orbit radiometric calibration method cannot carry out the integrated processing of on-orbit absolute radiometric calibration and relative radiometric correction simultaneously between cameras, influencing the accuracy of quantitative applications. Therefore, taking the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) wide-field-of-view (WFV) sensor as an example in this research, an innovative on-orbit radiometric calibration method is proposed to overcome this bottleneck. Firstly, according to the principle of the cross-calibration approach, we retrieve valid MODIS and GF-1 WFV image pairs over the Dunhuang radiometric calibration sites (DRCS) in China by using a set of criteria and extract the radiometric control points (RCPs) connecting in both images. Secondly, the DEM-aided block adjustment of the rational function model is applied to eliminate the geometrical misalignment of GF-1 WFV images at the same orbit. Then, the average digital numbers of spectral and spatial homogeneous surfaces are calculated and chosen as the radiometric tie points (RTPs) extracted from the overlapping region of the adjacent WFV cameras. Thirdly, the radiometric block adjustment (RBA) algorithm is introduced into on-orbit radiometric calibration of the space-borne multi-camera mosaic imaging sensor. Finally, the radiometric calibration coefficients are solved by the least square method. The validation results indicate that our proposed method can acquire high absolute radiometric calibration accuracy and achieve relative radiometric correction between cameras. Compared with the results using the cross-calibration method to calibrate each WFV camera independently, the advantages of RBA are presented. In addition, the uncertainties caused by RCPs' distribution are discussed, which is beneficial to further optimize the calibration program.

TI  - Optimized Broadband Extinction Method for Retrieving 500 nm AOD with Long-Term Direct Solar Radiation: Model Test and Application
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A traditional broadband extinction method is improved by introducing the cloud-screening module and aerosol modal adjustment module, and the new approach is known as optimized broadband extinction method (OBEM). Based on OBEM, it could retrieve 500 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) database with the use of direct solar radiation. Comparison of the monthly average AOD from OBEM and Chinese Sun Hazemeter Network (CSHNET) for 2006-2010 over Beijing site shows that the retrievals and observations display a high degree of consistency. The correlation equation is Y = 1.00X -0.01 with a correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.83 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.08. The largest relative error for the yearly average value is only 3.85%. So it is clear that the OBEM could serve as an effective tool to retrieve highly accurate historical 500 nm AOD data and implement homogenization with the current observational 500 nm AOD monitored by satellites and sun-photometers. The yearly average AOD of Beijing in 1993-2010 is 0.58 +/- 0.03, and the seasonal AODs in MAM (March-April-May) and JJA (June-July-August) are obviously higher than SON (September-October-November) and DJF (December-January-February), with values of 0.70 +/- 0.14 and 0.64 +/- 0.16, respectively. The long-term 500 nm AOD reveal significant periodic inter-annual characteristics with a slight downward trend, and the irradiance also decreased due to the extinction of increasing total-cloud amount.

TI  - Mapping Net Stocked Plantation Area for Small-Scale Forests in New Zealand Using Integrated RapidEye and LiDAR Sensors
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In New Zealand, approximately 70% of plantation forests are large-scale (over 1000 ha) with accurate resource description. In contrast, the remaining 30% of plantation forests are small-scale (less than 1000 ha). It is forecasted that these small-scale forests will supply nearly 40% of the national wood production in the next decade. However, in-depth description of these forests, especially those under 100 ha, is very limited. This research evaluates the use of remote sensing datasets to map and estimate the net stocked plantation area for small-scale forests. We compared a factorial combination of two classification approaches (Nearest Neighbour (NN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART)) and two remote sensing datasets (RapidEye, RapidEye plus LiDAR) for their ability to accurately classify planted forest area. CART with a combination of RapidEye and LiDAR metrics outperformed the other three combinations producing the highest accuracy for mapping forest plantations (user's accuracy = 90% and producer's accuracy = 88%). This method was further examined by comparing the mapped plantations with manually digitised plantations based on aerial photography. The mapping approach overestimated the plantation area by 3%. It was also found that forest patches exceeding 10 ha achieved higher conformance with the digitised areas. Overall, the mapping approach in this research provided a proof of concept for deriving forest area and mapping boundaries using remote sensing data, and is especially relevant for small-scale forests where limited information is currently available.

TI  - A Novel Ozone Profile Shape Retrieval Using Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP-ILM)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying ozone profile shapes from nadir-viewing satellite sensors is a critical yet challenging task for accurate reconstruction of vertical distributions of ozone relevant to climate change and air quality. Motivated by the need to develop a methodology to fast, reliably, and efficiently exploit ozone distributions and inspired by the success of machine learning, this paper introduces a novel algorithm for estimating ozone profile shapes from satellite ultraviolet absorption spectra. The Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP-ILM) algorithm successfully characterizes ozone profile shapes using machine learning approaches. Its implementation mainly consists of a clustering process based on a semi-supervised agglomerative algorithm, a classification process based on full-physics radiative transfer simulations and a neural network (NN), and a profile scaling process based on a NN ensemble. The classification model has been trained with synthetic data generated by a forward model in conjunction with "smart sampling," while the scaling model corresponding to each cluster requires total ozone information. The main innovation of FP-ILM is that, unlike conventional inversion methods, the ozone profile retrieval is formulated as a classification problem, leading to a noteworthy speed-up and accuracy when dealing with applications of satellite data. An outstanding retrieval performance with errors of less than 10% over 100-1 hPa has been obtained for synthetic measurements. Furthermore, the ozone profiles retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 data using FP-ILM and the optimal estimation method reach an encouraging agreement (the differences are less than 6 Dobson Units or within 5%-20%).

TI  - A Bayesian Data Fusion Approach to Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides rich sources of data for the monitoring of land surface dynamics. However, single-sensor systems are constrained from providing spatially high-resolution images with high revisit frequency due to the inherent sensor design limitation. To obtain images high in both spatial and temporal resolutions, a number of image fusion algorithms, such as spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM), have been recently developed. To capitalize on information available in a fusion process, we propose a Bayesian data fusion approach that incorporates the temporal correlation information in the image time series and casts the fusion problem as an estimation problem in which the fused image is obtained by the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimator. The proposed approach provides a formal framework for the fusion of remotely sensed images with a rigorous statistical basis; it imposes no requirements on the number of input image pairs; and it is suitable for heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is empirically tested with both simulated and real-life acquired Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms STARFM and ESTARFM, especially for heterogeneous landscapes. It produces surface reflectances highly correlated with those of the reference Landsat images. It gives spatio-temporal fusion of remotely sensed images a solid theoretical and empirical foundation that may be extended to solve more complicated image fusion problems.

TI  - Sebaceous carcinoma of the breast: a case report.
T2  - Surgical case reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sebaceous carcinoma of the breast is a distinct variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. It is rare and only several cases have been reported.CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old woman noted bloody discharge from her left nipple and palpated a lump in her left breast. Ultrasonography revealed a 19-mm mass in the left breast. Fine-needle aspiration suggested invasive ductal carcinoma. Partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. On histological examination, the tumor revealed solid growth of small, round uniform cells with clear cytoplasm, partially intermingled with vacuolated cells indicative of sebaceous differentiation. The tumor cells contained abundant Sudan Black B-positive lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, and they were immunohistochemically positive for adipophilin. They were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor; positive for cytokeratin 7 and Ber-EP4; and partially positive for epithelial membrane antigen. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sebaceous carcinoma of the breast.CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed a rare case of sebaceous carcinoma of the breast.

TI  - Satellite-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation using fine-mode aerosol optical thickness over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) presents various difficulties. This is because the association between AOT and surface PM2.5 can be affected by many factors, such as the contribution of fine mode AOT (FM-AOT) and the weather conditions. In this study, we compared the total AOT and FM-AOT for surface PM2.5 estimation using ground-based measurements collected in Xingtai, China from May to June 2016. The correlation between PM2.5 and FM-AOT was higher (r = 0.74) than that between PM2.5 and total AOT (r = 0.49). Based on FM-AOT, we developed a ground-level PM2.5 retrieval method that incorporated a Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) AOT, look-up table-spectral deconvolution algorithm (LUT-SDA) fine mode fraction (FMF), and the PM2.5 remote sensing method. Due to the strong diurnal variations displayed by the particle density of PM2.5, we proposed a pseudo-density for PM2.5 retrieval based on real-time visibility data. We applied the proposed method to determine retrieval surface PM2.5 concentrations over Beijing from December 2013 to June 2015 on cloud-free days. Compared with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, the LUT-SDA FMF was more easily available than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FMF. The derived PM2.5 results were compared with the ground-based monitoring values (30 stations), yielding an R-2 of 0.64 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 18.9 mu g/m(3) (N = 921). This validation demonstrated that the developed method performed well and produced reliable results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Large-scale block adjustment without use of ground control points based on the compensation of geometric calibration for ZY-3 images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of large-scale block adjustment (BA) without ground control points (GCPs) has long been a concern among photogrammetric researchers, which is of effective guiding significance for global mapping. However, significant problems with the accuracy and efficiency of this method remain to be solved. In this study, we analyzed the effects of geometric errors on BA, and then developed a step-wise BA method to conduct integrated processing of large-scale ZY-3 satellite images without GCPs. We first pre-processed the BA data, by adopting a geometric calibration (GC) method based on the viewing angle model to compensate for systematic errors, such that the BA input images were of good initial geometric quality. The second step was integrated BA without GCPs, in which a series of technical methods were used to solve bottleneck problems and ensure accuracy and efficiency. The BA model, based on virtual control points (VCPs), was constructed to address the rank deficiency problem caused by lack of absolute constraints. We then developed a parallel matching strategy to improve the efficiency of tie points (TPs) matching, and adopted a three-array data structure based on sparsity to relieve the storage and calculation burden of the high-order modified equation. Finally, we used the conjugate gradient method to improve the speed of solving the high-order equations. To evaluate the feasibility of the presented large-scale BA method, we conducted three experiments on real data collected by the ZY-3 satellite. The experimental results indicate that the presented method can effectively improve the geometric accuracies of ZY-3 satellite images. This study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale mapping without GCPs. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Improving Land Use/Land Cover Classification by Integrating Pixel Unmixing and Decision Tree Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision tree classification is one of the most efficient methods for obtaining land use/land cover (LULC) information from remotely sensed imageries. However, traditional decision tree classification methods cannot effectively eliminate the influence of mixed pixels. This study aimed to integrate pixel unmixing and decision tree to improve LULC classification by removing mixed pixel influence. The abundance and minimum noise fraction (MNF) results that were obtained from mixed pixel decomposition were added to decision tree multi-features using a three-dimensional (3D) Terrain model, which was created using an image fusion digital elevation model (DEM), to select training samples (ROIs), and improve ROI separability. A Landsat-8 OLI image of the Yunlong Reservoir Basin in Kunming was used to test this proposed method. Study results showed that the Kappa coefficient and the overall accuracy of integrated pixel unmixing and decision tree method increased by 0.093% and 10%, respectively, as compared with the original decision tree method. This proposed method could effectively eliminate the influence of mixed pixels and improve the accuracy in complex LULC classifications.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in Chinese patients with large operable breast cancer (≥4 cm): A decade's experience from a single institution
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with large operable breast cancer is still controversial. Our aim is to find whether or not performing SLNB is feasible and safety in Chinese patients with large operable breast cancer.Methods: We reviewed the data of patients in our center from 2003 to 2015, a series of 267 patients with large operable breast cancer (>= 4 cm) who underwent SLNB were examined. All selected patients recieved preoperative axillary evaluation.Results: The successful rate for localizing SLNs was 96.3% (257 of 267). 31.1% (78 of 257) patients were found to have positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). The median follow-up was 52 months. 2.2% (4 of 179) SLN-negative patients developed axillary recurrence (AR) as first event. The 5-year axillary recurrence free survival in SLN-negative patients was 96.9% (95% CI, 93.8%-100%). Patients with suspicious nodes on ultrasonography (US) (P = 0.16) and undergoing breast conserving therapy (BCT) (P = 0.057) had a higher trend to be associated with AR. The 5-year recurrence free survival (RFS) was 86.1% (95% CI, 80.8%-93.0%) in SLN-negative patients and 76.3% (95% CI, 68.1%-90.1%) in SLN-positive patients (P = 0.246).Conclusions: SLNB is feasible and safety in patients with large operable breast cancer who underwent preoperative axillary evaluation.

TI  - Geo-Parcel Based Crop Identification by Integrating High Spatial-Temporal Resolution Imagery from Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geo-parcel based crop identification plays an important role in precision agriculture. It meets the needs of refined farmland management. This study presents an improved identification procedure for geo-parcel based crop identification by combining fine-resolution images and multi-source medium-resolution images. GF-2 images with fine spatial resolution of 0.8 m provided agricultural farming plot boundaries, and GF-1 (16 m) and Landsat 8 OLI data were used to transform the geo-parcel based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series. In this study, we propose a piecewise EVI time-series smoothing method to fit irregular time profiles, especially for crop rotation situations. Global EVI time-series were divided into several temporal segments, from which phenological metrics could be derived. This method was applied to Lixian, where crop rotation was the common practice of growing different types of crops, in the same plot, in sequenced seasons. After collection of phenological features and multi-temporal spectral information, Random Forest (RF) was performed to classify crop types, and the overall accuracy was 93.27%. Moreover, an analysis of feature significance showed that phenological features were of greater importance for distinguishing agricultural land cover compared to temporal spectral information. The identification results indicated that the integration of high spatial-temporal resolution imagery is promising for geo-parcel based crop identification and that the newly proposed smoothing method is effective.

TI  - Impact of land use/cover changes on carbon storage in a river valley in arid areas of Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil carbon pools could become a CO2 source or sink, depending on the directions of land use/cover changes. A slight change of soil carbon will inevitably affect the atmospheric CO2 concentration and consequently the climate. Based on the data from 127 soil sample sites, 48 vegetation survey plots, and Landsat TM images, we analyzed the land use/cover changes, estimated soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and vegetation carbon storage of grassland, and discussed the impact of grassland changes on carbon storage during 2000 to 2013 in the Ili River Valley of Northwest China. The results indicate that the areal extents of forestland, shrubland, moderate-coverage grassland (MCG), and the waterbody (including glaciers) decreased while the areal extents of high-coverage grassland (HCG), low-coverage grassland (LCG), residential and industrial land, and cultivated land increased. The grassland SOC density in 0-100 cm depth varied with the coverage in a descending order of HCG> MCG> LCG. The regional grassland SOC storage in the depth of 0-100 cm in 2013 increased by 0.25x10(11) kg compared with that in 2000. The regional vegetation carbon storage (S-rvc) of grassland was 5.27x10(9) kg in 2013 and decreased by 15.7% compared to that in 2000. The vegetation carbon reserves of the under-ground parts of vegetation (S-ruvb) in 2013 was 0.68x10(9) kg and increased by approximately 19.01% compared to that in 2000. This research can improve our understanding about the impact of land use/cover changes on the carbon storage in arid areas of Northwest China.

TI  - Experimental approach for identifying building surface materials based on hyperspectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of hazardous building materials poses legal and financial challenges for those in the construction, real estate, and property management fields. Building surface materials have different spectral responses in the electromagnetic energy spectrum. Remote sensors can receive the energy reflection and transmission from such materials. In this study we investigated the spectral characteristics of building materials in wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 2500 nm. We explored a new method for identifying color steel, clay, glazed tile, and asphalt concrete using hyperspectral remote sensing based on building material spectrum characteristics. We discussed methods for extracting information about the construction materials from hyperspectral remote sensing images. We described a practical applied model, based on spectrum measurements, for the analysis of common building materials, and tested the model using hyperspectral remote sensing data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor and Chinese airborne hyperspectral data from the pushbroom hyperspectral imager (PHI) spectrometer, covering an urban area. Our results show that building surface materials can be identified from hyperspectral remote sensing images with a reasonable quality, based on the spectral sensitivity of different building materials. For example, concrete and asphalt are more sensitive than other materials. We concluded that the proposed method based on hyperspectral remote sensing images and spectral recognition techniques is an efficient way to extract information about building materials.

TI  - Assessment of GF-3 Polarimetric SAR Data for Physical Scattering Mechanism Analysis and Terrain Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 10 August 2016 China launched the GF-3, its first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, which was put into operation at the end of January, 2017. GF-3 polarimetric SAR has many advantages such as high resolution and multi-polarization imaging capabilities. Polarimetric SAR can fully characterize the backscatter property of targets, and thus it is of great interest to explore the physical scattering mechanisms of terrain types, which is very important in interpreting polarimetric SAR imagery and for its further usages in Earth observations. In this paper, focusing on target scattering characterization and feature extraction, we generalize the Delta alpha(B)/alpha(B) method, which was proposed under the reflection symmetric assumption, for the general backscatter process to account for both the reflection symmetry and asymmetry cases. Then, we evaluate the performances of physical scattering mechanism analysis methods for GF-3 polarimetric SAR imagery. Radarsat-2 data acquired over the same area is used for cross validation. Results show that GF-3 polarimetric SAR data has great potential for target characterization, especially for ocean area observation.

TI  - Air Pollution and Hospitalization for Bronchiolitis among Young Children
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rational: Several studies have found higher risks for childhood respiratory illness, associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM) less than 10 mm in diameter (PM10) and PM2.5 and gaseous pollution.Objectives: We analyzed the association between air pollution and hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis, an obstructive pulmonary disorder, commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus infant infection.Methods: Data were obtained from a local tertiary medical center providing services for a population of 700,000 comprising two ethnic groups: predominantly urban Jews and rural Bedouin Arabs. The latter group includes 30% residing in unrecognized villages in a temporary dwelling. We included all infants (0-2 yr) hospitalized with bronchiolitis between 2003 and 2013. Daily PM estimates were obtained from a satellite-based model incorporating daily remote sensing data and assigned to the family residence locality. Other air pollutants and meteorological parameters were obtained from a local monitoring site. We used case-crossover models with adjustment for temperature.Results: We identified 4,069 bronchiolitis hospitalizations (3,889 children), with 55.3% being Bedouin Arabs, of whom 16.8% resided in temporary dwellings. An increase in interquartile range of average weekly air pollutants was associated with an increased odds of bronchiolitis (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]): PM10 (1.06 [1.02-1.09]), PM2.5 (1.04 [1.02-1.06]) and nitrogen dioxide (1.36 [1.12-1.65]). Higher effect-estimates for PM were observed among Bedouin Arabs residing in temporary dwellings (1.14 [1.01-1.30] and 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) compared with Jewish individuals (1.05 [0.99-1.11] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]) and other Bedouin Arabs (1.05 [1.01-1.10] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]), and among males (1.11 [1.06-1.16] and 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) compared with females (0.99 [0.94-1.05] and 1.01 [0.97-1.04]).Conclusions: High PM levels were positively associated with bronchiolitis. The stronger associations among Bedouin Arabs may be related to higher pollution infiltration and exposure in residents of temporary dwellings.

TI  - Azimuthal Ocean Wave Emerged in SAR Image Spectra Under Specific Condition
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Velocity bunching causes nonlinear modulations in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of oceanic scenes. SAR images for the azimuth waves exhibit destructive wavy patterns because of azimuthal distortion caused by velocity bunching. Meanwhile, velocity bunching creates constructive wavy patterns for long waves in certain cases. This paper aims to provide a simple indication for practical interpretation of plausible wavy patterns. A numerical simulation had been performed to address how velocity bunching forms a clear wave-like pattern caused by orbital motions of a long single swell under a certain condition. More specifically, when the azimuth shifts caused by the orbital motions of the azimuth wave concentrate in the wave trough or crest, the bunching causes a strong single peak in the SAR images. This paper explains the mechanism of displaying plausible wavy patterns from the viewpoint of the ocean wave spectra and this specific condition. First, the simulation was validated for irregular waves generated from ocean wave spectra matching actual buoy data from which SAR images were simultaneously obtained. The SAR image spectra showed longer waves than those of the ocean wave spectra estimated via buoy data. The simulated spectra exhibited a similar trend to the actual SAR image, thus validating the numerical simulation. Next, an additional numerical simulation was conducted for irregular waves under the specific condition. The simulated results suggest that if a significant wave height and wavelength match the specific condition, the long waves in SAR image spectra can be similar to the original ocean wave spectra.

TI  - A thirst for development: mapping water stress using night-time stable lights as predictors of province-level water stress in China
T2  - AREA
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the rapid development within China, the inequality of available water resources has been increasingly of interest. Current methods for assessing water stress are inadequate for province-scale rapid monitoring. A more responsive indicator at a finer scale is needed to understand the distribution of water stress in China. This paper selected Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line-scan System night-time stable lights as a proxy for water stress at the province level in China from 2004 to 2012, as night-time lights are closely linked with population density, electricity consumption and other social, economic and environmental indicators associated with water stress. The linear regression results showed the intensity of night-time lights can serve as a predictive tool to assess water stress across provinces with an R-2 from 0.797 to 0.854. The model worked especially well in some regions, such as East China, North China and South West China. Nonetheless, confounding factors interfered with the predictive relationship, including population density, level of economic development, natural resource endowment and industrial structures, etc. The model was not greatly improved by building a multi-variable linear regression including agricultural and industrial indicators. A straightforward predictor of water stress using remotely sensed data was developed.

TI  - Change Detection Using High Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Active Learning and Markov Random Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection has been widely used in remote sensing, such as for disaster assessment and urban expansion detection. Although it is convenient to use unsupervised methods to detect changes from multi-temporal images, the results could be further improved. In supervised methods, heavy data labelling tasks are needed, and the sample annotation process with real categories is tedious and costly. To relieve the burden of labelling and to obtain satisfactory results, we propose an interactive change detection framework based on active learning and Markov random field (MRF). More specifically, a limited number of representative objects are found in an unsupervised way at the beginning. Then, the very limited samples are labelled as change or no change to train a simple binary classification model, i.e., a Gaussian process model. By using this model, we then select and label the most informative samples by the easiest sample selection strategy to update the former weak classification model until the detection results do not change notably. Finally, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) change detection is efficiently computed via the min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. The time consuming and laborious manual labelling process can be reduced substantially, and a desirable detection result can be obtained. The experiments on several WorldView-2 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - New Scheme for Validating Remote-Sensing Land Surface Temperature Products with Station Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous land-surface temperature (LST) observations from ground-based stations are an important reference dataset for validating remote-sensing LST products. However, a lack of evaluations of the representativeness of station observations limits the reliability of validation results. In this study, a new practical validation scheme is presented for validating remote-sensing LST products that includes a key step: assessing the spatial representativeness of ground-based LST measurements. Three indicators, namely, the dominant land-cover type (DLCT), relative bias (RB), and average structure scale (ASS), are established to quantify the representative levels of station observations based on the land-cover type (LCT) and LST reference maps with high spatial resolution. We validated MODIS LSTs using station observations from the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in China. The spatial representative evaluation steps show that the representativeness of observations greatly differs among stations and varies with different vegetation growth and other factors. Large differences in the validation results occur when using different representative level observations, which indicates a large potential for large error during the traditional T-based validation scheme. Comparisons show that the new validation scheme greatly improves the reliability of LST product validation through high-level representative observations.

T2  - ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus deficiency adversely affects crop productivity. The mechanism of tolerance in plants is not well understood. The current study successfully annotated a set of highly significant (Log(2) RPKM >= 3) nine novel sequences up-regulated in P deficient condition identified from a low P tolerant rice genotype. Sequence annotation identified two transcripts (Os01g37260 and Os02g11060) carrying known domains, F-box and WD, respectively. Multiple Expectation maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) revealed presence of conserved domains like D[LP][HY][CL]D[CM][DT]C[AP][DQ][IQ]C, [EH][DN] HN[HS][ER][FY][EP]I[HN]H which might play a role in phosphorus deficiency tolerance. Analysis of the upstream regions indicated presence of stress responsive elements like E Box, ABRE, and MYBCORE suggesting regulation of the novel transcripts by DNA binding. Protein localization prediction tool suggests that these novel proteins might be targeted to nucleus, chloroplast and cell wall. Transcripts Os02g03640 and Os02g10250 revealed potential target sites for microRNA binding suggesting role of novel miRNAs in low phosphorus response. Our analysis suggests that an F-box protein, Os01g37260 (OSFBx14) might be a promising candidate gene playing a role in multiple abiotic stresses including P deficiency.

TI  - Effects of the Wind and Ice Conditions on the Upwelling along the Western Kamchatka Coast (Sea of Okhotsk) Based on the Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of the upwelling along the western coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula (northeastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk) has been studied based on an analysis of the multisensor satellite data. The intensity of upwelling is estimated on the basis of wind-forced offshore Ekman transport (upwelling index). The wind data for studying the seasonal variation of upwelling were collected in 1999-2009 using a Quik-SCAT/SeaWinds scatterometer. The upwelling events along the western Kamchatka coast were observed in December at the beginning of the winter monsoon period. During the period of strong winter monsoon northern winds from January to the middle of March, the drifting ice prevents the upwelling of the deep water at the western Kamchatka shelf edge under the mean conditions. The oceanographic data show that upwelling in the western coastal zone of Kamchatka was also observed during the transitional periods from winter to the summer monsoon (April). In summer, upwelling events are rarely observed in this region. The main cause of the summer upwelling is the propagation of the atmospheric cyclones over the Kamchatka Peninsula.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of surface suspended sediment concentration in the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of surface suspended sediment concentration (SSSC) in estuary is essential to address several important issues: erosion, water pollution, human health risks, etc. In this study, an empirical cubic retrieval model was developed for the retrieval of SSSC from Yellow River Estuary. Based on sediments and seawater collected from the Yellow River and southeastern Laizhou Bay, SSSC conditions were reproduced in the laboratory at increasing concentrations within a range common to field observations. Continuous spectrum measurements of the various SSSCs ranging from 1 to 5700 mg/l were carried out using an AvaField-3 spectrometer. The results indicated the good correlation between water SSSC and spectral reflectance (R (rs)) was obtained in the spectral range of 726-900 nm. At SSSC greater than 2700 mg/L, the 740-900 nm spectral range was less susceptible to the effects of spectral reflectance saturation and more suitable for retrieval of high sediment concentrations. The best correlations were obtained for the reflectance ratio of 820 nm to 490 nm. Informed by the correlation between R (rs) and SSSC, a retrieval model was developed (R (2) = 0.992). The novel cubic model, which used the ratio of a near-infrared (NIR) band (740-900 nm) to a visible band (400-600 nm) as factors, provided robust quantification of high SSSC water samples. Two high SSSC centers, with an order of 10(3) mg/l, were found in the inversion results around the abandoned Diaokou River mouth, the present Yellow River mouth to the abandoned Qingshuigou River mouth. There was little sediment exchange between the two high SSSC centers due to the directions of the residual currents and vertical mixing.

TI  - Introduction and Spread of an Exotic Plant, <i>Spartina alterniflora,</i> Along Coastal Marshes of China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora was introduced to China more than 30 years ago, and its arrival corresponded with negative effects on native ecosystems. To elucidate the spatial distribution pattern and spread of S. alterniflora in China, we obtained 400 Landsat image scenes that covered China's coastal areas since S. alterniflora introduction, and surveyed 40 field sites between 2014 and 2015. A supervised classification method was used to generate the S. alterniflora distribution map along coastal marshes. The results showed that the total distribution of S. alterniflora along China's coastal areas was 55,181 ha, and ranged between the latitudes19A degrees 46'N to 40A degrees 47'N. Spartina alterniflora rapidly spread from 1990 to 2003, with an annual expansion rate of 20.4%. However, its area decreased by 12.7% from 2003 to 2005;then the distribution stabilized, and the annual average diffusion rate from 2005 to 2014 was just 4.0%.Overall, S.alterniflora expansion from 1990 to 2014 can be described as a polynomial function. The distribution of S.alterniflora in all provinces except Guangdong Province showed a polynomial increase. At the current expansion rate, S. alterniflora in China could eventually become a dominant plant in most coastal marsh communities in China.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture in Cornfields Using a Modified MODIS-Based Index and Considering Corn Growth Stages
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating soil moisture incornfields, based on regression models using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and field measurements. Soil moisture is related to the perpendicular drought index (PDI) and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). Thus, we propose a modified MODIS-based index (MMI) combining PDI and VSWI, to build regression models incorporating MMI and in situ soil moisture measurements. In the MMI, PDI is used to estimate soil moisture in areas with bare soil or sparse vegetation cover, and VSWI is used for estimation of soil moisture in areas with other cover types. Considering the dependence of soil moisture estimation on corn growth stages, we incorporated five growth stages-seeding, seedling, growing, maturing, and harvesting stages in the regression models for soil moisture estimation. These models were built for each stage using five years of soil moisture data obtained through field measurements combined with daily MMI at 1-km spatial resolution. Our results show that the MMI is strongly correlated to in situ soil moisture at each corn growth stage, and furthermore, these correlations are dependent on vegetation cover and growth stage. The correlation coefficients between field-measured and model-estimated soil moisture were 0.73, 0.67, 0.66, 0.74, and 0.63 for each growth stage, respectively. The estimated soil moisture was more accurate than SMOS-BEC soil moisture Level 3 products. These findings show that our model is a feasible method for estimating surface soil moisture accurately at the 1-km scale for cornfields in the study area.

TI  - Auto-calibration of GF-1 WFV images using flat terrain
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Four wide field view (WFV) cameras with 16-m multispectral medium-resolution and a combined swath of 800 km are onboard the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite, which can increase the revisit frequency to less than 4 days and enable large-scale land monitoring. The detection and elimination of WFV camera distortions is key for subsequent applications. Due to the wide swath of WFV images, geometric calibration using either conventional methods based on the ground control field (GCF) or GCF independent methods is problematic. This is predominantly because current GCF5 in China fail to cover the whole WFV image and most GCF independent methods are used for close-range photogrammetry or computer vision fields. This study proposes an auto-calibration method using flat terrain to detect nonlinear distortions of GF-1 WFV images. First, a classic geometric calibration model is built for the GF1 WFV camera, and at least two images with an overlap area that cover flat terrain are collected, then the elevation residuals between the real elevation and that calculated by forward intersection are used to solve nonlinear distortion parameters in WFV images. Experiments demonstrate that the orientation accuracy of the proposed method evaluated by GCF CPs is within 0.6 pixel, and residual errors manifest as random errors. Validation using Google Earth CPs further proves the effectiveness of auto-calibration, and the whole scene is undistorted compared to not using calibration parameters. The orientation accuracy of the proposed method and the GCF method is compared. The maximum difference is approximately 0.3 pixel, and the factors behind this discrepancy are analyzed. Generally, this method can effectively compensate for distortions in the GF-1 WFV camera. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - A remote sensing method for estimating regional reservoir area and evaporative loss
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation from the water surface of a reservoir can significantly affect its function of ensuring the availability and temporal stability of water supply. Current estimations of reservoir evaporative loss are dependent on water area derived from a reservoir storage-area curve. Such curves are unavailable if the reservoir is located in a data-sparse region or questionable if long-term sedimentation has changed the original elevation-area relationship. We propose a remote sensing framework to estimate reservoir evaporative loss at the regional scale. This framework uses a multispectral water index to extract reservoir area from Landsat imagery and estimate monthly evaporation volume based on pan-derived evaporative rates. The optimal index threshold is determined based on local observations and extended to unobserved locations and periods. Built on the cloud computing capacity of the Google Earth Engine, this framework can efficiently analyze satellite images at large spatiotemporal scales, where such analysis is infeasible with a single computer. Our study involves 200 major reservoirs in Texas, captured in 17,811 Landsat images over a 32-year period. The results show that these reservoirs contribute to an annual evaporative loss of 8.0 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 20% of their total active storage or 53% of total annual water use in Texas. At five coastal basins, reservoir evaporative losses exceed the minimum freshwater inflows required to sustain ecosystem health and fishery productivity of the receiving estuaries. Reservoir evaporative loss can be significant enough to counterbalance the positive effects of impounding water and to offset the contribution of water conservation and reuse practices. Our results also reveal the spatially variable performance of the multispectral water index and indicate the limitation of using scene-level cloud cover to screen satellite images. This study demonstrates the advantage of combining satellite remote sensing and cloud computing to support regional water resources assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved Atmospheric Modelling of the Oasis-Desert System in Central Asia Using WRF with Actual Satellite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the use of outdated terrestrial datasets, regional climate models (RCMs) have a limited ability to accurately simulate weather and climate conditions over heterogeneous oasis-desert systems, especially near large mountains. Using actual terrestrial datasets from satellite products for RCMs is the only possible solution to the limitation; however, it is impractical for long-period simulations due to the limited satellite products available before 2000 and the extremely time- and labor-consuming processes involved. In this study, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with observed estimates of land use (LU), albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and green Vegetation Fraction (VF) datasets from satellite products to examine which terrestrial datasets have a great impact on simulating water and heat conditions over heterogeneous oasis-desert systems in the northern Tianshan Mountains. Five simulations were conducted for 1-31 July in both 2010 and 2012. The decrease in the root mean squared error and increase in the coefficient of determination for the 2 m temperature (T2), humidity (RH), latent heat flux (LE), and wind speed (WS) suggest that these datasets improve the performance of WRF in both years; in particular, oasis effects are more realistically simulated. Using actual satellite-derived fractional vegetation coverage data has a much greater effect on the simulation of T2, RH, and LE than the other parameters, resulting in mean error correction values of 62%, 87%, and 92%, respectively. LU data is the primary parameter because it strongly influences other secondary land surface parameters, such as LAI and albedo. We conclude that actual LU and VF data should be used in the WRF for both weather and climate simulations.

TI  - Updating Landsat-based forest cover maps with MODIS images using multiscale spectral-spatial-temporal superresolution mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the high deforestation rates of global forest covers during the past decades, there is an ever-increasing need to monitor forest covers at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat series images have been used commonly for satellite-derived forest cover mapping. However, the spatial resolution of MODIS images and the temporal resolution of Landsat images are too coarse to observe forest cover at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, a novel multiscale spectral-spatial-temporal superresolution mapping (MSSTSRM) approach is proposed to update Landsat-based forest maps by integrating current MODIS images with the previous forest maps generated from Landsat image. Both the 240 m MODIS bands and 480 m MODIS bands were used as inputs of the spectral energy function of the MSSTSRM model. The principle of maximal spatial dependence was used as the spatial energy function to make the updated forest map spatially smooth. The temporal energy function was based on a multiscale spatial-temporal dependence model, and considers the land cover changes between the previous and current time. The novel MSSTSRM model was able to update Landsat-based forest maps more accurately, in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation, than traditional pixel-based classification and the latest sub pixel based super-resolution mapping methods The results demonstrate the great efficiency and potential of MSSTSRM for updating fine temporal resolution Landsat-based forest maps using MODIS images.

TI  - SWAT-Based Hydrological Data Assimilation System (SWAT-HDAS): Description and Case Application to River Basin-Scale Hydrological Predictions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the development and application of a physically based hydrological data assimilation system (HDAS) using the gridded and parallelized Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWATGP) distributed hydrological model. This SWAT-HDAS software integrates remotely sensed data, including the leaf area index (LAI), snow cover fraction, snow water equivalent, soil moisture, and ground-based observational data (e.g., from discharge and ground sensor networks), with SWATGP and the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF) to accurately characterize watershed hydrological states and fluxes. SWAT-HDAS employs high-performance computational technologies to address the computational challenges of high-resolution and/or large-area modeling. Multiple observational system simulation experiments (OSSEs), including soil moisture assimilation experiments, snow water equivalent assimilation experiments, and streamflow assimilation experiments, were designed to validate the assimilation efficiency of various types of observations within SWAT-HDAS using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. Both the temporal and spatial correlations in the trend/pattern and the magnitudes of improvement between the simulated and "true" states (i.e., for soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and discharge) were satisfactory using the integrated assimilation, which suggests the reliability of SWAT-HDAS for regional hydrology studies. The streamflow assimilation experiment also showed that the observation location dramatically influences the assimilation efficiency. The quantity and quality of observations have effects of varying degrees on the streamflow predictions. SWAT-HDAS is a promising tool for hydrological studies and applications under climate and environmental change scenarios.

TI  - Spatial and decadal variations in satellite-based terrestrial evapotranspiration and drought over Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China during 1982-2009
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in exchange of water budget and carbon cycles over the Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China (IMARC). However, the spatial and decadal variations in terrestrial ET and drought over the IMARC in the past was calculated by only using sparse meteorological point-based data which remain quite uncertain. In this study, by combining satellite and meteorology datasets, a satellite-based semi-empirical Penman ET (SEMI-PM) algorithm is used to estimate regional ET and evaporative wet index (EWI) calculated by the ratio of ET and potential ET (PET) over the IMARC. Validation result shows that the square of the correlation coefficients (R-2) for the four sites varies from 0.45 to 0.84 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is < 0.78 mm. We found that the ET has decreased on an average of 4.8 mm per decade (p = 0.10) over the entire IMARC during 1982-2009 and the EWI has decreased on an average of 1.1% per decade (p = 0.08) during the study period. Importantly, the patterns of monthly EWI anomalies have a good spatial and temporal correlation with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) anomalies from 1982 to 2009, indicating EWI can be used to monitor regional surface drought with high spatial resolution. In high-latitude ecosystems of northeast region of the IMARC, both air temperature (T-a) and incident solar radiation (R-s) are the most important parameters in determining ET. However, in semiarid and arid areas of the central and southwest regions of the IMARC, both relative humidity (RH) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are the most important factors controlling annual variation of ET.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth retrieval from visibility in China during 1973-2014
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Visibility is a widely-used indicator to quantify aerosol loadings. However, there are still some uncertainties in retrieving Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from surface visibility data. In this study, a new method, KM-Elterman method, was developed to retrieve AOD based on visibility from 1973 to 2014 and MODIS (Aqua) AOD product from 2002 to 2014. The analysis indicated that KM-Elterman method performed better than previous algorithms, such as Qiu, Elterman, and M-Elterman algorithms. The correlation between inferred AOD and MODIS measurements from 2002 to 2010 reached at 0.942 and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is about 0.077 for annual inferred AOD. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method was used to investigate the consistency of spatio-temporal variations between inferred AOD and MODIS measurements from July 2002 to December 2014. The correlation between Principal Components (PCs) is well above 0.72. The spatial patterns of inferred AOD agreed well with that of MODIS datasets. Long-term AOD trends over China during 1973-2014 were analyzed using the inferred AOD and our results pointed out that rapidly increasing trends of AOD were observed before 1980 in North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), central China, Sichuan Basin (SB), and Pearl River Delta (PRD). Slight decreasing trends were found in southwest China. The inferred AOD can be used to explore aerosol effects on climate change and Earth's radiative budget. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Unsupervised Method of Change Detection in Multi-Temporal PolSAR Data Using a Test Statistic and an Improved K&I Algorithm
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, multi-temporal imagery from spaceborne sensors has provided a fast and practical means for surveying and assessing changes in terrain surfaces. Owing to the all-weather imaging capability, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has become a key tool for change detection. Change detection methods include both unsupervised and supervised methods. Supervised change detection, which needs some human intervention, is generally ineffective and impractical. Due to this limitation, unsupervised methods are widely used in change detection. The traditional unsupervised methods only use a part of the polarization information, and the required thresholding algorithms are independent of the multi-temporal data, which results in the change detection map being ineffective and inaccurate. To solve these problems, a novel method of change detection using a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio test and the improved Kittler and Illingworth (K&I) minimum-error thresholding algorithm is introduced in this paper. The test statistic is used to generate the comparison image (CI) of the multi-temporal PolSAR images, and improved K&I using a generalized Gaussian model simulates the distribution of the CI. As a result of these advantages, we can obtain the change detection map using an optimum threshold. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the use of multi-temporal PolSAR images acquired by RADARSAT-2 over Wuhan, China. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and highly accurate.

TI  - Wildlife Plague Surveillance Near the China-Kazakhstan Border: 2012-2015
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. This pathogen can be transmitted by fleas and has an enzootic cycle, circulating among small mammals, and occasionally epizootic cycles, infecting other species. In China, infected wild rodents are primarily reservoirs of Y.Pestis and are related to human infection (Int. J. Infect. Dis., 33, 2015 and 67; BMC Microbiol., 9, 2009 and 205). Because shepherd dogs prey on and eat rodents (e.g. marmots and mice), they are valuable sentinel animals for plague serosurveillance in endemic disease foci, although their infections are usually asymptomatic (Vet. Microbiol., 172, 2014 and 339).

TI  - Comparison of surface energy budgets and feedbacks to microclimate among different land use types in an agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The biophysical effect of land use conversion plays a significant role in regulating climate change. Owing to albedo and evapotranspiration (ET) change, the effect of energy budget difference on land surface temperature (LST) is important but unclear among contrasting land use types, especially in temperate semi-arid regions. Based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, we compared the differences in albedo, ET, and LST between cropland and grassland (CR-GR), and between planted forest and grassland (PF-GR) in the Horqin Sandy Land of Inner Mongolia, an agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China. Our main objective was to explore the magnitude and direction of albedo and ET change during the growing season and, subsequently, to estimate the biophysical effects on LST as a result of land use and land cover change. Our results indicate no significant difference in mean monthly albedo for CR-GR and PF-GR Cropland lost more water through ET and significantly decreased daytime LST compared with grassland from July to September, but no significant differences in ET and LST were observed for PF-GR in any month. The biophysical climate effects were more pronounced for CR-GR compared with PF-GR. The response of LST to the changes in energy budget confirmed that ET was the critical driving factor relative to albedo. Compared with grassland, cropland and planted forest tended to cool the land surface by 5.15 degrees C and 1.51 degrees C during the growing season, respectively, because of the biophysical effects. Our findings suggest the significance of local-scale biophysical effect on climate variation after land use conversion in semi-arid regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Linking wind erosion to ecosystem services in drylands: a landscape ecological approach
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is a widespread environmental problem in the world's arid landscapes, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services in these regions.We investigated how wind erosion and key ecosystem services changed concurrently and what major biophysical and socioeconomic factors were responsible for these changes in a dryland area of China.Based on remote sensing data, field measurements, and modeling, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of both wind erosion and four key ecosystem services (soil conservation, crop production, meat production, and carbon storage) in the Mu Us Sandy Land in northern China during 2000-2013. Linear regression was used to explore possible relationships between wind erosion and ecosystem services.From 2000 to 2013, wind erosion decreased by as much as 60% and the four ecosystem services all increased substantially. These trends were attributable to vegetation recovery due mainly to government-aided ecological restoration projects and, to a lesser degree, slightly increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed during the second half of the study period. The maximum soil loss dropped an order of magnitude when vegetation cover increased from 10% to 30%, halved again when vegetation increased from 30 to 40%, and showed little change when vegetation increased beyond 60%.Our study indicates that vegetation cover has nonlinear and threshold effects on wind erosion through constraining the maximum soil loss, which further affects dryland ecosystem services. These findings have important implications for ecological restoration and ecosystem management in dryland landscapes in China and beyond.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Downscaling Sentinel-2 Imagery for Land Use and Land Cover Classification by Spectral-Spatial Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification is vital for environmental and ecological applications. Sentinel-2 is a new generation land monitoring satellite with the advantages of novel spectral capabilities, wide coverage and fine spatial and temporal resolutions. The effects of different spatial resolution unification schemes and methods on LULC classification have been scarcely investigated for Sentinel-2. This paper bridged this gap by comparing the differences between upscaling and downscaling as well as different downscaling algorithms from the point of view of LULC classification accuracy. The studied downscaling algorithms include nearest neighbor resampling and five popular pansharpening methods, namely, Gram-Schmidt (GS), nearest neighbor diffusion (NNDiffusion), PANSHARP algorithm proposed by Y. Zhang, wavelet transformation fusion (WTF) and high-pass filter fusion (HPF). Two spatial features, textural metrics derived from Grey-Level-Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and extended attribute profiles (EAPs), are investigated to make up for the shortcoming of pixel-based spectral classification. Random forest (RF) is adopted as the classifier. The experiment was conducted in Xitiaoxi watershed, China. The results demonstrated that downscaling obviously outperforms upscaling in terms of classification accuracy. For downscaling, image sharpening has no obvious advantages than spatial interpolation. Different image sharpening algorithms have distinct effects. Two multiresolution analysis (MRA)-based methods, i.e., WTF and HFP, achieve the best performance. GS achieved a similar accuracy with NNDiffusion and PANSHARP. Compared to image sharpening, the introduction of spatial features, both GLCM and EAPs can greatly improve the classification accuracy for Sentinel-2 imagery. Their effects on overall accuracy are similar but differ significantly to specific classes. In general, using the spectral bands downscaled by nearest neighbor interpolation can meet the requirements of regional LULC applications, and the GLCM and EAPs spatial features can be used to obtain more precise classification maps.

TI  - Monitoring and assessing "ghost cities" in Northeast China from the view of nighttime light remote sensing data
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has proceeded at an unprecedented speed in China during the last 20 years, resulting in extensive natural landscapes being transformed into impervious surface. The "ghost city" phenomenon has emerged due to the unreasonable urban expansion which far exceeds the actual demand of human habitat. Previously, few research studies have provided objective and sufficient knowledge with regard to identify "ghost cities" and their spatial distribution. In this paper, we proposed an effective and feasible framework to monitor and evaluate "ghost cities" utilizing nighttime light imagery obtained from day-night band (DNB) of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We established a "ghost city" index (GCI) to quantify the intensity of the phenomenon in the northeast of China, and analyzed the spatial pattern of "ghost cities" for different GCI classes. Our results indicate that the intensity of "ghost city" phenomenon decrease from regions adjacent to the border to interior areas, whilst regions with extremely high GCI are mostly districts and county cities. Tests of typical regions show that non-lit built-up area for high GCI regions is spatially clustered and low population regions have a high tendency to suffer from the "ghost city" phenomenon. Therefore, our findings provide a spatial-explicit insight into the "ghost city" phenomenon, and consequently can be beneficial to assist sustainable urban planning.

TI  - Guided Image Filtering-Based Pan-Sharpening Method: A Case Study of GaoFen-2 Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-2 (GF-2) is a civilian optical satellite self-developed by China equipped with both multispectral and panchromatic sensors, and is the first satellite in China with a resolution below 1 m. Because the pan-sharpening methods on GF-2 imagery have not been a focus of previous works, we propose a novel pan-sharpening method based on guided image filtering and compare the performance to state-of-the-art methods on GF-2 images. Guided image filtering was introduced to decompose and transfer the details and structures from the original panchromatic and multispectral bands. Thereafter, an adaptive model that considers the local spectral relationship was designed to properly inject spatial information back into the original spectral bands. Four pairs of GF-2 images acquired from urban, water body, cropland, and forest areas were selected for the experiments. Both quantitative and visual inspections were used for the assessment. The experimental results demonstrated that for GF-2 imagery acquired over different scenes, the proposed approach consistently achieves high spectral fidelity and enhances spatial details, thereby benefitting the potential classification procedures.

TI  - Optical and Radiative Properties of Aerosols during a Severe Haze Episode over the North China Plain in December 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical and radiative properties of aerosols during a severe haze episode from 15 to 22 December 2016 over Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and Jiaozuo in the North China Plain were analyzed based on the ground-based and satellite data, meteorological observations, and atmospheric environmental monitoring data. The aerosol optical depth at 500 nm was < 0.30 and increased to > 1.4 as the haze pollution developed. The ngstrom exponent was > 0.80 for most of the study period. The daily single-scattering albedo was > 0.85 over all of the North China Plain on the most polluted days and was > 0.97 on some particular days. The volumes of fine and coarse mode particles during the haze event were approximately 0.05-0.21 and 0.01-0.43 mu m(3), respectively-that is, larger than those in the time without haze. The daily absorption aerosol optical depth was about 0.01-0.11 in Beijing, 0.01-0.13 in Shijiazhuang, and 0.01-0.04 in Jiaozuo, and the average absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent varied between 0.6 and 2.0. The aerosol radiative forcing at the bottom of the atmosphere varied from -23 to -227,-34 to -199, and -29 to -191 W m(-2) for the whole haze period, while the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere varied from -4 to -98, -10 to -51, and -21 to -143 W m(-2) in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and Jiaozuo, respectively. Satellite observations showed that smoke, polluted dust, and polluted continental components of aerosols may aggravate air pollution during haze episodes. The analysis of the potential source contribution function and concentration-weighted trajectory showed that the contribution from local emissions and pollutants transport from upstream areas were 190-450 and 100-410 mu g m(-3), respectively.

TI  - Uncertainty of Remote Sensing Data in Monitoring Vegetation Phenology: A Comparison of MODIS C5 and C6 Vegetation Index Products on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is considered a sensitive indicator of climate change, which controls carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles within terrestrial ecosystems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an important moderate resolution remote sensing data for monitoring vegetation phenology. However, Terra MODIS Collection 5 (C5) vegetation index products were identified to be affected by sensor degradation, which has been addressed in the recently released MODIS Collection 6 (C6) vegetation index products. In order to compare the difference between MODIS C5 and C6 NDVI in monitoring vegetation phenology, the start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) of the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were extracted using four common methods. Then, the C5 and C6 NDVI-derived SOS (SOSC5 and SOSC6) and EOS (EOSC5 and EOSC6) were compared with ground-observed phenology data. Results showed that the multi-year average growing season NDVIs of C6 were lower than those of C5 in most areas, while the inter-annual variation patterns of regional average SOSC5 and SOSC6 (EOSC5 and EOSC6) were consistent. However, large spatial differences in phenological trends were found between C5 and C6 NDVI products. From C5 to C6, pixels with a SOS (EOS) trend shifting from significant to insignificant or from insignificant to significant accounted for at least 14.58% (9.07%) of the total pixels. SOSC5 was more consistent than SOSC6 with the ground-observed green-up dates. C5 NDVI may be more appropriate for monitoring SOS than C6 NDVI in the study region, but more ground-observed phenology records are needed to confirm it due to only four observational sites in this study. However, large differences and poor correlations existed between EOSC5 (EOSC6) and the ground-observed beginning of leaf coloring. To further evaluate the uncertainty of MODIS C5 and C6 NDVI in monitoring vegetation phenology, higher resolution near-surface remote sensing data and corresponding validation methods should be applied.

TI  - Influence of Forest-Canopy Morphology and Relief on Spectral Characteristics of Taiga Forests
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the results of a statistical analysis reflecting tendencies (trends) of the relationship between spectral characteristics of taiga forests, indicators of the morphological structure of forest canopy and illumination of the territory. The study was carried out on the example of the model forest territory of the Priangarskiy taiga region of Eastern Siberia (Krasnoyarsk krai) using historical data (forest inventory 1992, Landsat 5 TM 16.06.1989) and the digital elevation model. This article describes a method for determining the quantitative indicator of morphological structure of forest canopy based on taxation data, and the authors propose to subdivide the morphological structure into high complexity, medium complexity, and relatively simple. As a result of the research, dependences of average values of spectral brightness in near and short-wave infrared channels of a Landsat 5 TM image for dark-coniferous, light-coniferous and deciduous forests from the degree of complexity of the forest-canopy structure are received. A high level of variance and maximum brightness average values are marked in green moss (hilocominosa) dark-coniferous and various-grass (larioherbosa) dark-coniferous forests and light-coniferous forests with a complex structure of canopy. The parvifoliate forests are characterized by high values of brightness in stands with a relatively simple structure of the canopy and by a small variance in brightness of any degree of the structure of the canopy complexity. The increase in brightness for the lit slopes in comparison with shaded ones in all stands with a difficult morphological canopy structure is revealed. However, the brightness values of the lit and shaded slopes do not differ for stands with a medium complexity of the structure. It is noted that, in addition to the indicator of the forest-canopy structure, the possible impact on increasing the variance of spectral brightness for the taxation plot has a variability of the slope ratio of "microslopes" inside the forest plot if it exceeds 60%.

TI  - Retrieving K-Band Instantaneous Microwave Land Surface Emissivity Based on Passive Microwave Brightness Temperature and Atmospheric Precipitable Water Vapor Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm has been developed for retrieving instantaneous K-band microwave land surface emissivity using only brightness temperature and atmospheric precipitable water vapor content (PWV) data. The radiative transfer model is simplified to a new microwave emissivity retrieval model using two assumptions: 1) emissivities at 18.7 and 23.8 GHz with horizontal polarization are approximately equal, and 2) simple parameterizations exist between atmospheric transmittance and PWV and between atmospheric effective radiating temperature and PWV. The new technique does not need infrared land surface temperature as the input data, and it overcomes the limitation of previous algorithms under cloudy conditions. The estimated instantaneous emissivities are validated at single points and in the regional area. The results demonstrate that this simplified algorithm has the best root mean square error of 0.017, a bias of 0.004 in the single-point validation, and an R-2 of 0.66 and a RMSE of 0.021 in the regional validation. This simplified algorithm has the potential to obtain instantaneous microwave land surface emissivity under both cloud-free and cloudy conditions.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Spectral Band Adjustment Factors For GF-1/WFV Sensor Cross-Calibration
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by the components aging and the space environment changing, the radiation performance of the first satellite GaoFen series (GF-1) changes since it has been launched. The orbit calibration can track the performance changing during the sensor's lifetime. Cross calibration using the high radiometric calibration precision can improve the calibration frequency and accuracy. Spectral band adjustment factors (SBAF) are important factors in cross calibration. Terra/MODIS is selected as reference sensor, GF-1/WFV as target sensor, and the SBAF can be calculated based on the in situ measurement spectral data at Dunhuang radiometric calibration site, considering the observation angle, spectral response, atmospheric conditions and surface properties. Time series cross calibration coefficients can be obtained according to the SBAF. GF-1/WFV apparent radiances are obtained by the cross calibration coefficients, while Terra/MODIS apparent radiances are obtained by the digital number and calibration coefficients. The relative deviations of apparent radiances between the two sensor's are compared by analysis. It shows that SBAF in different bands has same trends; The SBAF above 0. 9 are 53. 1%, 75%, 81. 2%, 93. 8% for blue, green, red, near-infrared bands, respectively; Time series calibration coefficients and SBAF are negatively correlated and the relative deviations of apparent radiances are smaller while the SBAF are closer to 1.

AB  - This paper describes a new model of the seawater dielectric constant as a function of salinity and temperature at L-band. The model function is developed by fitting the accurate measurement data made at 1.413 GHz to a third-order polynomial. The purpose of this study is to provide an accurate model for earth-observing satellites to retrieve seawater salinities from remote sensing data. In this paper, the development of the model function is introduced along with an analysis of the goodness of fit. The model function is then compared with the model functions of Klein-Swift and Meissner-Wentz. Finally, the comparison is made between the retrieved salinity from the satellite data with the in situ data measured by Argo floats.

TI  - Spatial-temporal change in urban agricultural land use efficiency from the perspective of agricultural multi-functionality: A case study of the Xi'an metropolitan zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive expansion of urbanized areas has resulted in haphazard land utilization, immoderate consumption of superior agricultural land and water resources, significant fragmentation of agricultural landscape, and gradual deterioration of the agro-ecological environment. Combined, these factors cause poor land use efficiency. Under these circumstances, comprehensively assessing land use efficiency for urban agriculture is a key issue in land use research. Currently, evaluation methods for agricultural land use efficiency narrowly concentrate on aspects of economic input and output. However, urban agro-ecosystems can provide diverse economic, social, and ecological services and functions. In particular, the social and ecological services and functions originating from agricultural land, which have a higher value than economic services, play a significant role in ensuring regional social, ecological, and environmental security. However, recent research has rarely taken these benefits into consideration. Therefore, land use value has been greatly underestimated, which has resulted in mishandled and poor land use policies. In this study, we apply Landsat imagery and social and economic statistical data for the Xi'an metropolitan zone (XMZ) to investigate agricultural multi-functionality. We develop an evaluation framework for urban agricultural land use efficiency and identify agro-ecosystem services and functions as important outputs from agricultural land. The land use efficiency of urban agriculture is then evaluated using ecosystem services models, providing a mechanism for assessing spatial-temporal changes in land use efficiency in the XMZ from 1999 to 2015. Four important conclusions are reached from this analysis. First, the rapid urbanization and agricultural transformation from traditional cereal cultivation to modern urban agriculture has resulted in steadily increasing costs, outputs, and land use efficiency of urban agriculture. The total output value increased 41% and land use efficiency per hectare increased by 33.13% on average. Second, the spatial patterns of comprehensive output and land use efficiency were dominated by economic outputs from agricultural land. Areas near cities, which are dominated by orchard and arable land, provide more economic functions. These areas support and regulate services due to the transformation from extensive cereal production to intensive modern urban agriculture; therefore, they have higher output value and land use efficiency. In contrast, areas distant from cities, towns, and high traffic roads, namely, remote rural areas, provide more support and regulating services, but have relatively lower economic function due to inaccessibility to urban markets and slow agricultural transformation. Therefore, these areas have lower output value and land use efficiency. The spatial change in agricultural output and land use efficiency in urban areas is strongly dependent on the degree of urbanization and agricultural transformation. Third, the total output value and land use efficiency of urban agriculture measured with our approach are much higher than evaluations using traditional methods. However, the spatial patterns measured using the two approaches are in agreement. The evaluation framework integrates ecological services and economic and social functions into a comprehensive output from agricultural land. This approach is more methodical and accurate for evaluating the comprehensive efficiency of land use based on quantities and spatial scale because they are at the pixel scale.Finally, the evaluation results have important implications for enhancing current agricultural subsidies and even implementing ecological payment policies in China. Most importantly, they can be directly applied to agricultural transformation regulations, decision- making, and guidance for rational land utilization.

AB  - Exploring the spatial variability of urban thermal environment under the build. up area expansion is of great significance to better understanding of urban heat island (UHI) effect and improvement of urban ecological environment. Taking the built-up area of Xi'an as an example, the linear spectral mixing analysis method was used to extract the built-up area boundary using Landsat images of 2005, 2010 and 2016, and the space. time evolution of urban thermal environment was studied through the inversion of thermal infrared remote sensing image. In the mean. while, based on the footprint of UHI effect and the information capacity technology derived from multidimensional histogram of image, the influence scope and spatial differentiation characteristics of UHI effect in urbanization were quantitatively investigated. Build-up area had a rapid expansion process, and impervious surface area increased significantly in Xi'an from 2005 to 2016. Urban construction enhanced the intensity and level of UHI effect in the study area along with the continuous expansion of build-up area, high. temperature areas increased and continuously over. spread, gradually showing a flaky distribution characteristic. The spatial variability of the footprint of UHI effect in Xi'an was very prominent, and the influence range of UHI effect had progressively become small from 2005 to 2016. The information capacity could reflect the influence of urban expansion on the spatial heterogeneity of urban thermal environment, and the spatial heterogeneity of the urban heat island became more complicated with the increase of heat island intensity in Xi'an built-up area during the period of the study.

TI  - PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY OF PLANT METACOMMUNITY OF THE DNIEPER RIVER ARENA TERRACE WITHIN THE 'DNIEPER-ORILSKIY' NATURE RESERVE
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the features of the phylogenetic organization of the plant communities of the Dnieper River terrace within the 'Dnieper-Orilskiy' Nature Reserve and the patterns of its spatial variation involving remote sensing data of the Earth's surface. The research materials were collected in the period 2012-2016 from within the nature reserve. The research polygon is within the first terrace (arena) of the Dnieper valley. Sandy steppe, meadow, forest and marsh communities within the Protoch river floodplain and the Orlova ravine, as well as artificial pine plantations were the habitats present within the research polygon. The vegetation description was carried out on 10x10 m (100 m(2)) plots. A total of 94 geobotanical descriptions were made. Data on plant phylogeny was obtained by the Phylomatic service. Phylogenetic diversity of the communities was assessed by the Faith, Simpson and Shannon indices. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by means of a double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA). The vegetation cover within the investigated polygon was represented by 189 species. Abundance Phylogenetic Deviation (APD) for the investigated metacommunity was evaluated to -0.53, which is statistically significantly different from random alternatives (p = 0.001). The APD negative value indicates that phylogenetic organization of the investigated metacommunity is overdispersed. The permutation procedure allowed us to establish that the eigenvalues of the DPCoA-axes obtained as a result of the real phylogenetic tree were significantly higher than their own number for the random phylogenetic trees for the first seven axes. This indicates that the first seven axes are useful for additional information on the ordination structure of the metacommunity.

TI  - Assessment of Sea Water Inundation Along Daboo Creek Area in Indus Delta Region, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Indus Deltaic Region (IDR) in Pakistan is an erosion vulnerable coast due to the high deep water wave energy. Livelihood of millions of people depends on the fisheries and mangrove forests in IDR. IDR consists of many creeks where Daboo is a major creek located at southeast of the largest city of Pakistan, Karachi. Unfortunately, there has been no detailed study to analyze the damages of sea water intrusion at a large temporal and spatial scale. Therefore, this study is designed to estimate the effects of sea water inundation based on changing sea water surface salinity and sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity and SST data from two different surveys in Daboo creek during 1986 and 2010 are analyzed to estimate the damages and extent of sea water intrusion. Mean salinity has increased 33.33% whereas mean SST decreased 13.79% from 1987 to 2010. Spatio-temporal analysis of creek area using LANDSAT 5 Thematic mapper (TM) data for the years 1987 and 2010 shows significant amount of erosion at macro scale. Creek area has increased approximately 9.93% (260.86 m(2) per year) which is roughly equal to 60 extensive sized shrimp farms. Further Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analyses for years 2001 and 2014 using LANDSAT 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) has indicated 42.3% decrease in cultivated land. Wet mud flats have spread out at the inner mouth of creek with enormous increase of 123.3%. Significant sea water intrusion has increased the area of barren land by 37.9%. This also resulted in overall decrease of 6.7% in area covered by mangroves. Therefore, this study recorded a significant evidence of sea water intrusion in IDR that has caused serious damages to community living in the area, economical losses. Additionally, it has also changed the environment by reducing creek biological productivity as reported by earlier studies over other regions of the world.

TI  - Modeling the Impact of Urban Landscape Change on Urban Wetlands Using Similarity Weighted Instance-Based Machine Learning and Markov Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands play important roles in providing several ecosystem services that support the urban environment. As such, scientists have studied them to understand the urban processes that lead to their continued decline. However, little attention has been given to the drivers of land-use change that may affect this fragile ecosystem in the future. Understanding this could serve as a critical step towards urban wetland management and sustainability. In this study, we utilized an integrated approach that combined Similarity Weighted Instance-based Machine Learning and Markov chain, both embedded in the IDRISI Land Change Modeler to simulate change in the landscape of three watersheds in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. The purpose was to assess the possible future impacts of urban expansion-induced landscape change on wetlands within the study area, using a retrospective approach. To achieve this, classified SPOT satellite data covering the three watersheds were used to generate historical land cover maps of the study area between 1992 and 2010 to analyze changes to the landscape. In addition, the study identified several drivers of land change associated with the historical change process in the study area, and accounted for their role in the modeling process. On this basis, the study made the prediction of urban landscape transformation to the end date of 2014. The prediction result was verified with a more accurate map that was derived from independently classifying a 2014 SPOT image of the study area. Results from this study show that impervious surfaces, which were used as an index of urban expansion, may increase by approximately the same magnitude experienced historically, which may result in a small but significant loss of wetlands and other land cover classes within the study area.

TI  - Cloud radiative effect, cloud fraction and cloud type at two stations in Switzerland using hemispherical sky cameras
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study analyses the cloud radiative effect during the daytime depending on cloud fraction and cloud type at two stations in Switzerland over a time period of 3 to 5 years. Information on fractional cloud coverage and cloud type is retrieved from images taken by visible all-sky cameras. Cloud-base height (CBH) data are retrieved from a ceilometer and integrated water vapour (IWV) data from GPS measurements. The longwave cloud radiative effect (LCE) for low-level clouds and a cloud coverage of 8 ok-tas has a median value between 59 and 72 Wm(-2). For midand high-level clouds the LCE is significantly lower. It is shown that the fractional cloud coverage, the CBH and IWV all have an influence on the magnitude of the LCE. These observed dependences have also been modelled with the radiative transfer model MODTRAN5. The relative values of the shortwave cloud radiative effect (SCErel) for low-level clouds and a cloud coverage of 8 oktas are between 90 and -62 %. Also here the higher the cloud is, the less negative the SCErel values are. In cases in which the measured direct radiation value is below the threshold of 120 Wm(-2) (occulted sun) the SCErel decreases substantially, while cases in which the measured direct radiation value is larger than 120 Wm(-2) (visible sun) lead to a SCErel of around 0 %. In 14 and 10% of the cases in Davos and Payerne respectively a cloud enhancement has been observed with a maximum in the cloud class cirrocumulus-altocumulus at both stations. The calculated median total cloud radiative effect (TCE) values are negative for almost all cloud classes and cloud coverages.

TI  - Large-scale regional delineation of riparian vegetation in the arid and semi-arid Pilbara region, WA
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiscene Landsat 5 TM imagery, Principal Component Analysis, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used to produce the first region-scale map of riparian vegetation for the Pilbara (230,000km(2)), Western Australia. Riparian vegetation is an environmentally important habitat in the arid and desert climate of the Pilbara. These habitats are supported by infrequent flow events and in some locations by groundwater discharge. Our analysis suggests that riparian vegetation covers less than 4% of the Pilbara region, whereas almost 10.5% of this area is composed of groundwater dependent vegetation (GDV). GDV is often associated with open water (river pools), providing refugia for a variety of species. GDV has an extremely high ecological value and are often important Indigenous sites. This paper demonstrates how Landsat data calibrated to Top of Atmosphere reflectance can be used to delineate riparian vegetation across 16 Landsat scenes and two Universal Transverse Mercator spatial zones. The proposed method is able to delineate riparian vegetation and GDV, without the need for Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function correction. Results were validated using ground truth data from local and regional scale vegetation surveys.

AB  - To monitor the biological effects of marine pollution, choosing a native fish species and establishing suitable biomarkers are required. In this study, the full-length cDNA of cypla1 was cloned from Sebastiscus marmoratus (SM-CYP1A1). Then the dose-response and time-course induction of hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA by the crude oil water-soluble fraction (WSF) were determined. Subsequently, SM-CYP1A1 mRNA was applied to investigate the biological effect of petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in Quanzhou Bay, China. The transcription levels of hepatic CYP1A1 were significantly elevated in fish caged in the polluted sites for 2 weeks compared with those of the reference site, which were correlated with the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in the surface seawaters. The results suggest that S. marmoratus is a potential sentinel organism to monitor marine pollutants and the hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA can serve as a sensitive biomarker to organic xenobiotics in aquatic environments.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) data are important to monitor and assess environmental change. LULC classification using satellite images is a method widely used on a global and local scale. Especially, urban areas that have various LULC types are important components of the urban landscape and ecosystem. This study aims to classify urban LULC using WorldView-3 (WV-3) very high-spatial resolution satellite imagery and the object-based image analysis method. A decision rules set was applied to classify the WV-3 images in Kathu subdistrict, Phuket province, Thailand. The main steps were as follows: (1) the image was ortho-rectified with ground control points and using the digital elevation model, (2) multiscale image segmentation was applied to divide the image pixel level into image object level, (3) development of the decision ruleset for LULC classification using spectral bands, spectral indices, spatial and contextual information, and (4) accuracy assessment was computed using testing data, which sampled by statistical random sampling. The results show that seven LULC classes (water, vegetation, open space, road, residential, building, and bare soil) were successfully classified with overall classification accuracy of 94.14% and a kappa coefficient of 92.91%.

TI  - Spatial pattern evaluation of a calibrated national hydrological model - a remote-sensing-based diagnostic approach
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed hydrological models are traditionally evaluated against discharge stations, emphasizing the temporal and neglecting the spatial component of a model. The present study widens the traditional paradigm by highlighting spatial patterns of evapotranspiration (ET), a key variable at the land-atmosphere interface, obtained from two different approaches at the national scale of Denmark. The first approach is based on a national water resources model (DKmodel), using the MIKE-SHE model code, and the second approach utilizes a two-source energy balance model (TSEB) driven mainly by satellite remote sensing data. Ideally, the hydrological model simulation and remote-sensing-based approach should present similar spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of ET. However, the spatial comparison showed that the differences are significant and indicate insufficient spatial pattern performance of the hydrological model.The differences in spatial patterns can partly be explained by the fact that the hydrological model is configured to run in six domains that are calibrated independently from each other, as it is often the case for large-scale multi-basin calibrations. Furthermore, the model incorporates predefined temporal dynamics of leaf area index (LAI), root depth (RD) and crop coefficient (Kc) for each land cover type. This zonal approach of model parameterization ignores the spatiotemporal complexity of the natural system. To overcome this limitation, this study features a modified version of the DKmodel in which LAI, RD and Kc are empirically derived using remote sensing data and detailed soil property maps in order to generate a higher degree of spatiotemporal variability and spatial consistency between the six domains. The effects of these changes are analyzed by using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to evaluate spatial patterns. The EOF analysis shows that including remote-sensing-derived LAI, RD and Kc in the distributed hydrological model adds spatial features found in the spatial pattern of remote-sensing-based ET.

TI  - Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH): Five consecutive years' experience of Fars province, Iran
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveSubarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), caused by the rupture of intracranial aneurysms, is a devastating event with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) plays a critical role in the potential loss of life as its sufferers are usually of a young age. We aimed to investigate the incidence of aSAH along with the patients' characteristics over five consecutive years in Fars, a large province located in Southern Iran.MethodsIn this prospective study, anonymous data of all patients diagnosed with aSAH in Fars province were collected after patient admission and surgery. Data from the last national census in 2011 were used to calculate the incidence. The data were analysed using SPSS software version 18 using independent sample t test, chi square test and ANOVA. The significance level was set at 0.05.ResultsThe number of aSAH cases identified in Fars, Iran, each year varied between 78 (2011) and 98 (2015) for a total of 421 aSAH cases within the 5-year study period. The annual aSAH incidence estimates showed no differences and were 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58-1.72], 1.70 (95% CI: 1.68-1.72), 1.71 (95% CI: 1.63-1.78), 1.82 (95% CI: 1.74-1.9), and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.97-2.13) per 100,000 persons, respectively, for the five consecutive years from 21 March 2011 to 20 March 2016. Hypertension was the most common risk factor, and was found in 198 (48%) aSAH patients. Ninety-four (22.5%) patients had moderate hydrocephalus on admission. Middle cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery were the most common sites of aneurysms. On admission, 351 (83%) patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score > 7, 197 (47%) presented with Hunt and Hess score of 1, and 365 (87%) had a Fisher score of <= 3. Multiple aneurysms were found in 59 (14%) of the 421 cases and the most common risk factors in multiple aneurysms were hypertension in 30 (51%) and smoking in 26 (44%) cases. Survival data were available only on patients diagnosed in year 2015, and the six-month survival rate was 89.8%.ConclusionsThis study revealed that although the incidence of aSAH remained stable, the survival of aSAH patients who reached the hospital alive and were operated on, improved in Shiraz (the six-month survival rate was 89.8% in year 2015). The incidence and survival study on aSAH in other geographic areas of Iran as a multi-centre study is recommended. There is a need to inform primary healthcare workers regarding the possibility of aSAH in a patient with signs of the sentinel headache.

TI  - Short- and long-term evapotranspiration rates at ecological restoration sites along a large river receiving rare flow events
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many large rivers around the world no longer flow to their deltas, due to ever greater water withdrawals and diversions for human needs. However, the importance of riparian ecosystems is drawing increasing recognition, leading to the allocation of environmental flows to restore river processes. Accurate estimates of riparian plant evapotranspiration (ET) are needed to understand how the riverine system responds to these rare events and achieve the goals of environmental flows. In 2014, historic environmental flows were released into the Lower Colorado River at Morelos Dam (Mexico); this once perennial but now dry reach is the final stretch to the mighty Colorado River Delta. One of the primary goals was to supply native vegetation restoration sites along the reach with water to help seedlings establish and boost groundwater levels to foster the planted saplings. Patterns in ET before, during, and after the flows are useful for evaluating whether this goal was met and understanding the role that ET plays in this now ephemeral river system. Here, diurnal fluctuations in groundwater levels and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to compare estimates of ET specifically at 3 native vegetation restoration sites during 2014 planned flow events, and MODIS data were used to evaluate long-term (2002-2016) ET responses to restoration efforts at these sites. Overall, ET was generally 0-10mm d(-1) across sites, and although daily ET values from groundwater data were highly variable, weekly averaged estimates were highly correlated with MODIS-derived estimates at most sites. The influence of the 2014 flow events was not immediately apparent in the results, although the process of clearing vegetation and planting native vegetation at the restoration sites was clearly visible in the results.

A pilot program for EVD RDTs in high risk areas of Guinea was introduced in October 2015. This paper presents concordance data between EVD RDTs and PCR testing in the field as well as an assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, and quality assurance of the RDT program.Methods and findingsConcordance data were compiled from laboratory surveillance databases. The operational measures of the laboratory-based EVD RDT program were evaluated at all 34 sentinel sites in Guinea through: (1) a technical questionnaire filled by the lab technicians who performed the RDTs, (2) a checklist filled by the evaluator during the site visits, and (3) direct observation of the lab technicians performing the quality control test. Acceptability of the EVD RDT was good for technicians, patients, and families although many technicians (69.8%) expressed concern for their safety while performing the test. The feasibility of the program was good based on average technician knowledge scores (6.6 out of 8) but basic infrastructure, equipment, and supplies were lacking. There was much room for improvement in quality assurance of the program.ConclusionsThe implementation of new diagnostics in weak laboratory systems requires general training in quality assurance, biosafety and communication with patients in addition to specific training for the new test. Corresponding capacity building in terms of basic equipment and a long-term commitment to transfer supervision and quality improvement to national public health staff are necessary for successful implementation.

TI  - A Landsat-based model for retrieving total suspended solids concentration of estuaries and coasts in China
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving total suspended solids (TSS) concentration accurately is essential for sustainable management of estuaries and coasts, which plays a key role in the interaction between hydrosphere, pedosphere and atmosphere. Although many TSS retrieval models have been published, the general inversion method that is applicable to different field conditions is still under research. In order to obtain a TSS remote sensing model that is suitable for estimating TSS concentrations with wide range in estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, after reviewing a number of Landsatbased TSS retrieval models and improving a comparatively better one among them, this study developed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near-infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) based on 119 in situ samples collected in 2006-2013 from five regions of China. It was found that the QRLTSS model works well and shows a satisfactory performance. The QRLTSS model based on Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper), ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors explained about 72 % of the TSS concentration variation (TSS: 4.3-577.2 mg L-1, N = 84, P value < 0.001) and had an acceptable validation accuracy (TSS: 4.5-474 mg L-1, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 25 mg L-1, N = 35). In addition, a threshold method of red-band reflectance (OLI: 0.032, ETM+ and TM: 0.031) was proposed to solve the two-valued issue of the QRLTSS model and to retrieve TSS concentration from Landsat imagery. After a 6S model based atmospheric correction of Landsat OLI and ETM + imagery, the TSS concentrations of three regions (Moyangjiang River estuary, Pearl River estuary and Hanjiang River estuary) in Guangdong Province in China were mapped by the QRLTSS model. The results indicated that TSS concentrations in the three estuaries showed large variation ranging from 0.295 to 370.4 mg L-1. Meanwhile we found that TSS concentrations retrieved from Landsat imagery showed good validation accuracies with the synchronous water samples (TS S : 7-160 mg L-1, RMSE: 11.06 mg L-1, N = 22). The further validation from EO-1 Hyperion imagery also showed good performance (in situ synchronous measurement of TSS: 106-220.7 mgL(-1), RMSE: 26.66 mgL(-1), N = 13) of the QRLTSS model for the area of high TSS concentrations in the Lingding Bay of the Pearl River estuary. Evidently, the QRLTSS model is potentially applied to simulate high-dynamic TSS concentrations of other estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations on regional and global scales. Furthermore, the QRLTSS model can be optimized to establish a regional or unified TS S retrieval model of estuaries and coasts in the world for different satellite sensors with medium- and high-resolution similar to Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors or with similar red bands and near-infrared bands, such as ALI, HJ-1 A and B, LISS, CBERS, ASTER, ALOS, RapidEye, Kanopus-V, and GE.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance for West Nile virus using raptors in rehabilitation
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Wildlife rehabilitation centers routinely gather health-related data from diverse species. Their capability to signal the occurrence of emerging pathogens and improve traditional surveillance remains largely unexplored. This paper assessed the utility for syndromic surveillance of raptors admitted to The Raptor Center (TRC) to signal circulation of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Minnesota between 1990 and 2014. An exhaustive descriptive analysis using grouping time series structures and models of interrupted times series was conducted for indicator subsets.Results: A total of 13,080 raptors were monitored. The most representative species were red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, Cooper's hawks, American kestrels and bald eagles. Results indicated that temporal patterns of accessions at the TRC changed distinctively after the incursion of WNV in 2002. The frequency of hawks showing WNV-like signs increased almost 3 times during July and August, suggesting that monitoring of hawks admitted to TRC with WNV-like signs could serve as an indicator of WNV circulation. These findings were also supported by the results of laboratory diagnosis.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that monitoring of data routinely collected by wildlife rehabilitation centers has the potential to signal the spread of pathogens that may affect wild, domestic animals and humans, thus supporting the early detection of disease incursions in a region and monitoring of disease trends. Ultimately, data collected in rehabilitation centers may provide insights to efficiently allocate financial and human resources on disease prevention and surveillance.

TI  - The sentinel tree nursery as an early warning system for pathway risk assessment: Fungal pathogens associated with Chinese woody plants commonly shipped to Europe
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction of and invasion by alien plant pathogens represents the main cause of emerging infectious diseases affecting domesticated and wild plant species worldwide. The trade in living plants is the most common pathway of introduction. Many of the alien tree pathogens recently introduced into Europe were not previously included on any quarantine lists. To help determine the potential risk of pest introduction through trading of ornamental plants, a sentinel nursery was established in Beijing, China in 2008. The sentinel nursery planting included four of the most common ornamental woody species shipped to Europe including Ilex comuta var. fortunae, Zelkova schneideriana, Fraxinus chinensis and Buxus microphylla. Symptoms developing on these species within the sentinel nursery were detected in 2013 and consisted of necrotic spots on leaves, canker and stem necrosis, shoot blight and shoot necrosis. Fungi associated with the trees and their symptoms included Alternaria alternata detected from all hosts; Diaporthe liquidambaris and Diaporthe capsici from bark and leaf necrosis of Zelkova schneideriana; Botryosphaeria dothidea and Nothophoma quercina from stem cankers on Fraxinus chinensis and leaf necrosis on Ilex cornuta; and Pseudonectria foliicola from leaf necrosis on Buxus microphylla. Next generation sequencing analysis from asymptomatic tissues detected eighteen OTU's at species level among which some taxa had not been previously recorded in Europe. These results clearly demonstrate that looking at trees of internationally traded species in the region of origin can reveal the presence of potentially harmful organisms of major forestry, landscape or crop trees. Results of this study also provide an indication as to how some disease agents can be introduced using pathways other than the co-generic hosts. Hence, sentinel nurseries represent one potential mechanism to address the current lack of knowledge about pests in the countries from where live plants are shipped and the threats they represent to native flora and crops in importing countries.

TI  - Crater Lake Controls on Volcano Stability: Insights From White Island, New Zealand
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many volcanoes around the world host summit crater lakes but their influence on the overall stability of the edifice remains poorly understood. Here I use satellite radar data acquired by TerraSAR-X from early 2015 to July 2017 over White Island, New Zealand, to investigate the interaction of the crater lake and deformation of the surrounding edifice. An eruption in April 2016 was preceded by a period of uplift within the crater floor and drop in the lake level. Modeling of the uplift indicates a shallow source located at similar to 100 m depth in the vicinity of the crater lake, likely coinciding with the shallow hydrothermal system. In addition to the drop in the lake level, stress changes induced by the inflation suggest that the pressurization of the shallow hydrothermal system helped promote failure along the edge of the crater lake which collapsed during the eruption. After the eruption, and almost complete removal of the crater lake, large areas of the crater wall and lake edge began moving downslope at rates approaching 400 mm/yr. The coincidence between the rapid increase in the displacement rates and removal of the crater lake suggests that the lake provides a physical control on the stability of the surrounding edifice.

TI  - The Dominant Role of the East Siberian Sea in Driving the Oceanic Flow Through the Bering Strait-Conclusions From GRACE Ocean Mass Satellite Data and In Situ Mooring Observations Between 2002 and 2016
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is typically stated that the Pacific-to-Arctic oceanic flow through the Bering Strait (important for Arctic heat, freshwater, and nutrient budgets) is driven by local wind and a (poorly defined) far-field "pressure head" forcing, related to sea surface height differences between the Pacific and the Arctic. Using monthly, Arctic-wide, ocean bottom pressure satellite data and in situ mooring data from the Bering Strait from 2002 to 2016, we discover the spatial structure of this pressure head forcing, finding that the Bering Strait throughflow variability is dominantly driven from the Arctic, specifically by sea level change in the East Siberian Sea (ESS), in turn related to westward winds along the Arctic coasts. In the (comparatively calm) summer, this explains approximately two thirds of the Bering Strait variability. In winter, local wind variability dominates the total flow, but the pressure head term, while still correlated with the ESS-dominated sea level pattern, is now more strongly related to Bering Sea Shelf sea level variability.

TI  - Floating Algae Blooms in the East China Sea
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A floating algae bloom in the East China Sea was observed in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery in May 2017. Using satellite imagery from MODIS, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager, and Ocean Land Imager, and combined with numerical particle tracing experiments and laboratory experiments, we examined the history of this bloom as well as similar blooms in previous years and attempted to trace the bloom source and identify the algae type. Results suggest that one bloom origin is offshore Zhejiang coast where algae slicks have appeared in satellite imagery almost every February-March since 2012. Following the Kuroshio Current and Taiwan Warm Current, these "initial" algae slicks are first transported to the northeast to reach South Korea (Jeju Island) and Japan coastal waters (up to 135 degrees E) by early April 2017, and then transported to the northwest to enter the Yellow Sea by the end of April. The transport pathway covers an area known to be rich in Sargassum horneri, and spectral analysis suggests that most of the algae slicks may contain large amount of S. horneri. The bloom covers a water area of similar to 160,000 km(2) with pure algae coverage of similar to 530 km(2), which exceeds the size of most Ulva blooms that occur every May-July in the Yellow Sea. While blooms of smaller size also occurred in previous years and especially in 2015, the 2017 bloom is hypothesized to be a result of record-high water temperature, increased light availability, and continuous expansion of Porphyra aquaculture along the East China Sea coast.Plain Language Summary A massive floating algae bloom in the East China Sea was first captured in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery in mid-May 2017. Both its size and location are unprecedented. Several means have been used to identify the algae type and bloom origin, including the use of multisource satellite imagery, numerical particle tracing experiments, and laboratory experiments. While multiple origins are possible, the bloom could be tracked to Zhejiang coastal waters where the "initial" algae slicks back in February were transported to the northeast following the Kuroshio Current and Taiwan Warm Current to reach South Korea (Jeju Island) and Japan coastal waters by early April 2017, and then transported to the northwest to enter the Yellow Sea by end of April. Spectral analysis and historical field surveys suggested that the bloom may be dominated by Sargassum horneri, while expanded seaweed aquaculture and record-high water temperature and increased surface light may have contributed to the unprecedented bloom, which covered a water area of similar to 160,000 km(2) with pure algae coverage of similar to 530 km(2), both exceeding the maximum size of most Ulva blooms in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Identifying species from the air: UAVs and the very high resolution challenge for plant conservation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pacific Equatorial dry forest of Northern Peru is recognised for its unique endemic biodiversity. Although highly threatened the forest provides livelihoods and ecosystem services to local communities. As agro-industrial expansion and climatic variation transform the region, close ecosystem monitoring is essential for viable adaptation strategies. UAVs offer an affordable alternative to satellites in obtaining both colour and near infrared imagery to meet the specific requirements of spatial and temporal resolution of a monitoring system. Combining this with their capacity to produce three dimensional models of the environment provides an invaluable tool for species level monitoring. Here we demonstrate that object based image analysis of very high resolution UAV images can identify and quantify keystone tree species and their health across wide heterogeneous landscapes. The analysis exposes the state of the vegetation and serves as a baseline for monitoring and adaptive implementation of community based conservation and restoration in the area.

TI  - Comparison of different methods to retrieve optical-equivalent snow grain size in central Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical-equivalent snow grain size affects the reflectivity of snow surfaces and, thus, the local surface energy budget in particular in polar regions. Therefore, the specific surface area (SSA), from which the optical snow grain size is derived, was observed for a 2-month period in central Antarctica (Kohnen research station) during austral summer 2013/14. The data were retrieved on the basis of ground-based spectral surface albedo measurements collected by the COmpact RAdiation measurement System (CORAS) and airborne observations with the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem (SMART). The snow grain size and pollution amount (SGSP) algorithm, originally developed to analyze spaceborne reflectance measurements by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS), was modified in order to reduce the impact of the solar zenith angle on the retrieval results and to cover measurements in overcast conditions. Spectral ratios of surface albedo at 1280 and 1100 nm wavelength were used to reduce the retrieval uncertainty. The retrieval was applied to the ground-based and airborne observations and validated against optical in situ observations of SSA utilizing an IceCube device. The SSA retrieved from CORAS observations varied between 27 and 89m(2) kg(-1). Snowfall events caused distinct relative maxima of the SSA which were followed by a gradual decrease in SSA due to snow metamorphism and wind-induced transport of freshly fallen ice crystals. The ability of the modified algorithm to include measurements in overcast conditions improved the data coverage, in particular at times when precipitation events occurred and the SSA changed quickly. SSA retrieved from measurements with CORAS and MODIS agree with the in situ observations within the ranges given by the measurement uncertainties. However, SSA retrieved from the airborne SMART data slightly underestimated the ground-based results.

TI  - A Systematic Evaluation of Noah-MP in Simulating Land-Atmosphere Energy, Water, and Carbon Exchanges Over the Continental United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate simulation of energy, water, and carbon fluxes exchanging between the land surface and the atmosphere is beneficial for improving terrestrial ecohydrological and climate predictions. We systematically assessed the Noah land surface model (LSM) with mutiparameterization options (Noah-MP) in simulating these fluxes and associated variations in terrestrial water storage (TWS) and snow cover fraction (SCF) against various reference products over 18 United States Geological Survey two-digital hydrological unit code regions of the continental United States (CONUS). In general, Noah-MP captures better the observed seasonal and interregional variability of net radiation, SCF, and runoff than other variables. With a dynamic vegetation model, it overestimates gross primary productivity by 40% and evapotranspiration (ET) by 22% over the whole CONUS domain; however, with a prescribed climatology of leaf area index, it greatly improves ET simulation with relative bias dropping to 4%. It accurately simulates regional TWS dynamics in most regions except those with large lakes or severely affected by irrigation and/or impoundments. Incorporating the lake water storage variations into the modeled TWS variations largely reduces the TWS simulation bias more obviously over the Great Lakes with model efficiency increasing from 0.18 to 0.76. Noah-MP simulates runoff well in most regions except an obvious overestimation (underestimation) in the Rio Grande and Lower Colorado (New England). Compared with North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) LSMs, Noah-MP shows a better ability to simulate runoff and a comparable skill in simulating R-n but a worse skill in simulating ET over most regions. This study suggests that future model developments should focus on improving the representations of vegetation dynamics, lake water storage dynamics, and human activities including irrigation and impoundments.

TI  - Cerebral Embolic Protection During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Significantly Reduces Death and Stroke Compared With Unprotected Procedures
T2  - JACC-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of cerebral embolic protection on stroke-free survival in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).BACKGROUND Imaging data on cerebral embolic protection devices have demonstrated a significant reduction in number and volume of cerebral lesions.METHODS A total of 802 consecutive patients were enrolled. The Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device (Claret Medical Inc., Santa Rosa, California) was used in 34.9% (n = 280) of consecutive patients. In 65.1% (n = 522) of patients TAVR was performed in the identical setting except without cerebral embolic protection. Neurological follow-up was done within 7 days post-procedure. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or all-stroke according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria within 7 days. Propensity score matching was performed to account for possible confounders.RESULTS Both filters of the device were successfully positioned in 280 of 305 (91.8%) consecutive patients. With use of cerebral embolic protection rate of disabling and nondisabling stroke was significantly reduced from 4.6% to 1.4% (p = 0.03; odds ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.10 to 0.93) in the propensity-matched population (n = 560). The primary endpoint occurred significantly less frequently, with 2.1% (n = 6 of 280) in the protected group compared with 6.8% (n = 19 of 280) in the control group (p = 0.01; odds ratio: 0.30; 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.77). In multivariable analysis Society of Thoracic Surgeons score for mortality (p = 0.02) and TAVR without protection (p = 0.02) were independent predictors for the primary endpoint.CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing TAVR use of a cerebral embolic protection device demonstrated a significant higher rate of stroke-free survival compared with unprotected TAVR.

TI  - The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Diagnostic Codes Catalogue - metrics, diagnostics and methodologies to evaluate, understand and improve the representation of clouds and cloud feedbacks in climate models
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The CFMIP Diagnostic Codes Catalogue assembles cloud metrics, diagnostics and methodologies, together with programs to diagnose them from general circulation model (GCM) outputs written by various members of the CFMIP community. This aims to facilitate use of the diagnostics by the wider community studying climate and climate change. This paper describes the diagnostics and metrics which are currently in the catalogue, together with examples of their application to model evaluation studies and a summary of some of the insights these diagnostics have provided into the main shortcomings in current GCMs. Analysis of outputs from CFMIP and CMIP6 experiments will also be facilitated by the sharing of diagnostic codes via this catalogue.Any code which implements diagnostics relevant to analysing clouds - including cloud- circulation interactions and the contribution of clouds to estimates of climate sensitivity in models - and which is documented in peer-reviewed studies, can be included in the catalogue. We very much welcome additional contributions to further support community analysis of CMIP6 outputs.

TI  - Satellite Data Analysis and CubeSat Instrument Simulator Tool for Simultaneous Multi-spacecraft Measurements of Solar Energetic Particles
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTROPHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a Multi-satellite Data Analysis and Simulator Tool (MDAST), developed with the original goal to support the science requirements of a Martian 3-Unit CubeSat mission profile named Bleeping Interplanetary Radiation Determination Yo-yo (BIRDY). MDAST was firstly designed and tested by taking into account the positions, attitudes, instruments field of view and energetic particles flux measurements from four spacecrafts (ACE, MSL, STEREO A, and STEREO B). Secondly, the simulated positions, attitudes and instrument field of view from the BIRDY CubeSat have been adapted for input. And finally, this tool can be used for data analysis of the measurements from the four spacecrafts mentioned above so as to simulate the instrument trajectory and observation capabilities of the BIRDY CubeSat. The onset, peak and end time of a solar particle event is specifically defined and identified with this tool. It is not only useful for the BIRDY mission but also for analyzing data from the four satellites aforementioned and can be utilized for other space weather missions with further customization.

TI  - Potential of RISAT-1 SAR data in detecting palaeochannels in parts of the Thar Desert, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we have demonstrated the potential of RISAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect palaeochannels in parts of Thar Desert, India, which may be utilized as one of the guides of geoarchaeological exploration, besides forming groundwater prospective zones. Palaeochannels have been detected using RISAT-1 SAR MRS datasets in the southern parts of Jaisalmer and northeastern parts of Barmer districts, Rajasthan. These palaeochannels of length varying between 14 and 36 km and width varying between 20 and 65 m are present within parabolic sand dune complexes. Palaeochannels have been detected as distinct dark tone on RISAT-1 SAR data compared to feeble expression on corresponding LANDSAT-OLI FCC datasets. This is due to sand-filled valleys, acting as radar smooth surface and absorbing the radar energy with negligible backscatter and enhanced topography due to side-looking capability of RISAT-1 SAR. High-resolution Cartosat DEM has been utilized to prepare topographical profiles, supporting the geomorphological interpretation. Merging of RISAT-1 SAR and LANDSAT ETM datasets using PCA techniques led to enhancements of palaeochannels on merged FCC data products. Like polarization of RISAT-1, SAR data could further enhance and aid in detecting palaeochannels. The entire region was flooded in August 2006 and water had flown through these palaeochannels, which subsequently dried up and facilitated their easy detection; they are otherwise difficult to interpret using pre-flood images. Analysis of sequential post-flood images has been taken up for detailed study of the area, as there is scope to detect additional hitherto unknown palaeochannels.

TI  - The science behind archaeological signatures from space
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeology has traditionally focused on studying historic or prehistoric people and their cultures by analysis of their artefacts, inscriptions, monuments and other such material remains, especially those that have been documented from excavations. This focus is somewhat narrow, because it excludes many new methods that have emerged in the last few decades (described in detail by Prabhakar and Korisettar in this special section (page 1873)). One such novel method is to study large imprints on the landscape caused by human activity. These tell-tale features include soil marks, crop marks, drainage patterns, field boundaries and a host of man-made structures, whose study can provide additional cultural insights. In some cases, these features are difficult to detect by the naked eye at ground level, but are detectable by remote sensing techniques from aerial/space-based platforms in a non-destructive manner. For these reasons, it is now well recognized that examining archaeological landscapes using remote sensing can complement traditional investigations. An analysis of remote sensing data can play an important role in (1) understanding spatial relationships between cultural materials and activities, (2) formulating archaeological sampling schemes, (3) measuring distances and spatial distributions of structures and monuments, and (4) evolving schemes for their conservation.

TI  - National-scale inventory and management of heritage sites and monuments: advantages and challenges of using geospatial technology
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - India is a vibrant and culturally diverse country with more than 3600 heritage sites and monuments of national importance, of which only 36 are recognized as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. These heritage sites and monuments are precious and non-renewable resources which need to be conserved, protected and monitored. Conventional along with emerging geospatial techniques are required to prepare databases and action plans to manage them effectively and efficiently. This article discusses ISRO's efforts in the last decade in the field of archaeology using high-resolution remote sensing data in conjunction with GIS, GPS and other geospatial techniques in various applications like inventory and site management plans for a monument/site, cultural resources management plans for World Heritage Sites as well as in exploration archaeology and research for predictive location modelling in the identification of areas with high archaeological potential. Most of the projects have been executed in collaboration with major stake-holders involved in archaeology and in the process have institutionalized the use of geospatial technology to a large extent in operational and research activities.

TI  - From Invention to Innovation: Risk Analysis to Integrate One Health Technology in the Dairy Farm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Current Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) approaches mainly fit for food industry, while their application in primary food production is still rudimentary. The European food safety framework calls for science-based support to the primary producers' mandate for legal, scientific, and ethical responsibility in food supply. The multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary project ALERT pivots on the development of the technological invention (BEST platform) and application of its measurable (bio) markers-as well as scientific advances in risk analysis-at strategic points of the milk chain for time and cost-effective early identification of unwanted and/or unexpected events of both microbiological and toxicological nature. Health-oriented innovation is complex and subject to multiple variables. Through field activities in a dairy farm in central Italy, we explored individual components of the dairy farm system to overcome concrete challenges for the application of translational science in real life and (veterinary) public health. Based on an HACCP-like approach in animal production, the farm characterization focused on points of particular attention (POPAs) and critical control points to draw a farm management decision tree under the One Health view (environment, animal health, food safety). The analysis was based on the integrated use of checklists (environment; agricultural and zootechnical practices; animal health and welfare) and laboratory analyses of well water, feed and silage, individual fecal samples, and bulk milk. The understanding of complex systems is a condition to accomplish true innovation through new technologies. BEST is a detection and monitoring system in support of production security, quality and safety: a grid of its (bio) markers can find direct application in critical points for early identification of potential hazards or anomalies. The HACCP-like self-monitoring in primary production is feasible, as well as the biomonitoring of live food producing animals as sentinel population for One Health.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Ecosystem change and respective conservation needs were at top priority areas in the globe especially at biodiversity hotspot zones and places of endemism like Bale eco-region. In this aspect, this study had tried to assess historical landscape changes of afro-alpine forest ecosystem with its respective driving forces and effectiveness of different institutional arrangements to protect this ecosystem.Methods: The study utilized satellite imagery from Landsat series starting from 1986 to 2016, ground truth data from GPS-based field survey, focus group discussions, and reconnaissance field survey. Historical landscape maps were prepared with a mix of supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. Future landscape change simulation was undertaken by using cellular automata modeling on Dynamic Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO) software. Beyond areal change and transition of landscape elements, level of ecosystem fragmentation was assessed with FRAGSTAT software.Results: Results have shown that there is encroachment of human-induced land use patterns especially agriculture and grazing while closed canopy forest and woodland ecosystems have decreased in their extent. Simulation outputs for the coming three decades have also shown similar patterns with historical trends. Beyond changes in areal extent, landscape matrix analysis results indicated that there is increasing class and landscape level fragmentation both in its historical and future probable likelihoods. Effectiveness of different management strategies at different institutional arrangement were differ in their effectiveness that federal and regional government were not able to curve landscape change.Conclusions: In conclusion, increasing population pressure and weak policy implementation and legal enforcement has caused threats for alpine forest ecosystem in Bale eco-region. Except participatory forest management, management strategies at different institutional arrangements were failed to conserve forest. These calls reinnovated participatory forest management strategies that base community participation while simultaneously keeps livelihoods demands of local community.

T2  - Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women around the globe. It is also the world's first cause of female deaths from cancer. With the introduction of screening programs in most developed countries, more and more cases of this cancer are diagnosed at local or localized stages, enabling radical treatment to be successful. At the same time, systemic treatment of early breast cancer is one of the most complex issues in clinical oncology. Because of the many prognostic factors that need to be taken into account when considering eligibility for treatment such as age, reproductive status (before or after menopause), type of cancer and severity of the disease, it is impossible to establish clear standards of conduct for many clinical situations. The international biennial St Gallen conference, the world's most prominent breast cancer specialists, who are struggling to address major clinical problems in the treatment of early breast cancer. St Gallen's recommendations address all issues related to the treatment of early breast cancer (in particular surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatment) and are set by a group of 52 experts by voting. This method allows us to establish consensus on issues that can not be clearly identified in the results of randomized clinical trials. In this way, more than 200 clinical issues were answered. The most important changes in day-to-day practice are the duration of ajuvant hormone therapy (10 instead of 5 years), the possibility of using aromatase inhibitors (in combination with ovarian function suppresion) in premenopausal women with high risk of recurrence and the timing of sentinel node biopsy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. There are also recommendations, which patients should undergo genetic testing to assess the risk of recurrence of breast cancer.

TI  - Cloud property datasets retrieved from AVHRR, MODIS, AATSR and MERIS in the framework of the Cloud_cci project
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - New cloud property datasets based on measurements from the passive imaging satellite sensors AVHRR, MODIS, ATSR2, AATSR and MERIS are presented. Two retrieval systems were developed that include components for cloud detection and cloud typing followed by cloud property retrievals based on the optimal estimation (OE) technique. The OE-based retrievals are applied to simultaneously retrieve cloud-top pressure, cloud particle effective radius and cloud optical thickness using measurements at visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths, which ensures spectral consistency. The retrieved cloud properties are further processed to derive cloud-top height, cloud-top temperature, cloud liquid water path, cloud ice water path and spectral cloud albedo. The Cloud_cci products are pixel-based retrievals, daily composites of those on a global equal-angle latitude-longitude grid, and monthly cloud properties such as averages, standard deviations and histograms, also on a global grid. All products include rigorous propagation of the retrieval and sampling uncertainties. Grouping the orbital properties of the sensor families, six datasets have been defined, which are named AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, ATSR2-AATSR and MERIS+AATSR, each comprising a specific subset of all available sensors. The individual characteristics of the datasets are presented together with a summary of the retrieval systems and measurement records on which the dataset generation were based. Example validation results are given, based on comparisons to well-established reference observations, which demonstrate the good quality of the data. In particular the ensured spectral consistency and the rigorous uncertainty propagation through all processing levels can be considered as new features of the Cloud_cci datasets compared to existing datasets. In addition, the consistency among the individual datasets allows for a potential combination of them as well as facilitates studies on the impact of temporal sampling and spatial resolution on cloud climatologies.

TI  - Large-scale proteomics identifies MMP-7 as a sentinel of epithelial injury and of biliary atresia
T2  - SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biliary atresia is a progressive infantile cholangiopathy of complex pathogenesis. Although early diagnosis and surgery are the best predictors of treatment response, current diagnostic approaches are imprecise and time-consuming. We used large-scale, quantitative serum proteomics at the time of diagnosis of biliary atresia and other cholestatic syndromes (serving as disease controls) to identify biomarkers of disease. In a discovery cohort of 70 subjects, the lead biomarker was matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), which retained high distinguishing features for biliary atresia in two validation cohorts. Notably, the diagnostic performance reached 95% when MMP-7 was combined with gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), a marker of cholestasis. Using human tissue and an experimental model of biliary atresia, we found that MMP-7 is primarily expressed by cholangiocytes, released upon epithelial injury, and promotes the experimental disease phenotype. Thus, we propose that serum MMP-7 (alone or in combination with GGT) is a diagnostic biomarker for biliary atresia and may serve as a therapeutic target.

TI  - A study of 15-year aerosol optical thickness and direct shortwave aerosol radiative effect trends using MODIS, MISR, CALIOP and CERES
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - By combining Collection 6 Moderate Resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Version 22 Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aerosol products with Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) flux products, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT, at 0.55 mu m) and shortwave (SW) aerosol radiative effect (SWARE) trends are studied over ocean for the near-full Terra (2000-2015) and Aqua (2002-2015) data records. Despite differences in sampling methods, regional SWARE and AOT trends are highly correlated with one another. Over global oceans, weak SWARE (cloud-free SW flux) and AOT trends of 0.5-0.6 W m(-2) (0.5 to 0.6 W m(-2)) and 0.002 AOT decade 1 are found using Terra data. Near-zero AOT and SWARE trends are also found for using Aqua data, regardless of the angular distribution models (ADMs) used. Regionally, positive AOT and cloud-free SW flux (negative SWARE) trends are found over the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, while statistically significant negative trends are derived over the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern US coast. In addition, the global mean instantaneous SW aerosol direct forcing efficiencies are found to be similar to -60 W m(-2) AOT(-1), with corresponding SWARE values of similar to -7 W m(-2) from both Aqua and Terra data, again regardless of CERES ADMs used. Regionally, SW aerosol direct forcing efficiency values of similar to -40 W m(-2) AOT(-1) are found over the southwest coast of Africa where smoke aerosol particles dominate in summer. Larger (in magnitude) SW aerosol direct forcing efficiency values of -50 to -80 W m(-2) AOT(-1) are found over several other dust-and pollutant-aerosol-dominated regions. Lastly, the AOT and SWARE trends from this study are also intercompared with aerosol trends (such as active-based ones) from several previous studies. Findings suggest that a cohesive understanding of the changing aerosol skies can be achieved through the analysis of observations from both passive-and active-based analyses, as well as from both narrowband and broadband datasets.

TI  - Ecotoxico-Proteomics for Aquatic Environmental Monitoring: First in Situ Application of a New Proteomics-Based Multibiomarker Assay Using Caged Amphipods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a proof of principle, a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry-based methodology was applied to the simultaneous quantification of dozens of protein biomarkers in caged amphipods (Gammarus fossarum). We evaluated the suitability of the methodology to assess complex field contaminations through its application in the framework of a regional river monitoring network. Thanks to the high throughput acquisition of biomarker levels in G. fossarum exposed in four reference and 13 contaminated sites, we analyzed the individual responses of 38 peptides reporting for 25 proteins of interest in 170 organisms. Responses obtained in contaminated sites included inductions of vitellogenin-like proteins in male organisms, inductions of Na+K+/ATPases, and strong inhibitions of molt-related proteins such as chitinase and JHE-carboxylesterase. Proteins from detoxification and immunity processes were also found modulated in abundance. Summarizing, the results presented here show that the SRM strategy developed for multibiomarker measurement paves a very promising way to define multiple indicators of the health status of sentinel organisms for environmental hazard assessment.

T2  - Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore impact on marine habitats caused by coastal pollution, predictive models of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) distribution were generated using the Maxent modelling approach, based on dolphin occurrence data in Sanniang Bay and its adjacent waters in Guangxi Province during 2006-2007, the independent oceanographic parameters derived from Google Earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Landsat images, and the water environmental data from the marine investigation in 2012. Results indicated that the distance to the major river mouths was the strongest predictors, and water nutrition and persistent pollutants were the important factors for the dolphin distribution in both wet and dry seasons. Based on the results, habitat selection strategies of the dolphin were discussed: the dolphin tended to select estuaries with abundant prey and avoid highly polluted areas, which could be useful in designing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and formulating management strategies.

TI  - Numerical Simulations of Flare-productive Active Regions: δ-sunspots, Sheared Polarity Inversion Lines, Energy Storage, and Predictions
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar active regions (ARs) that produce strong flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are known to have a relatively high non-potentiality and are characterized by delta-sunspots and sheared magnetic structures. In this study, we conduct a series of flux emergence simulations from the convection zone to the corona and model four types of active regions that have been observationally suggested to cause strong flares, namely the spot-spot, spot-satellite, quadrupole, and inter-AR cases. As a result, we confirm that delta-spot formation is due to the complex geometry and interaction of emerging magnetic fields, and we find that the strong-field, high-gradient, highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) is created by the combined effect of the advection, stretching, and compression of magnetic fields. We show that free magnetic energy builds up in the form of a current sheet above the PIL. It is also revealed that photospheric magnetic parameters that predict flare eruptions reflect the stored free energy with high accuracy, while CME-predicting parameters indicate the magnetic relationship between flaring zones and entire ARs.

TI  - Naukan ethnobotany in post-Soviet times: lost edibles and new medicinals
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study focuses on health-related plant use among speakers of the critically endangered Naukan language (Inuit-Yupik-Unangan family) in the Russian Far East. The Naukan people were forced, in 1958, under Soviet consolidation, to move from their original settlement on Cape Dezhnev, leading to significant changes in spiritual worldview, subsistence, social structure, and language proficiency in the years that followed. Here, we focus on changes that elders report in their edible, medicinal, and spiritual uses of local plant species since their childhood.Methods: The authors worked from 2014 to 2016 in the villages of Lavrentiya, Lorino, and Uelen, in the Chukotskiy district of the Chukotka autonomous region, directly adjacent to the Bering Strait. We conducted structured interviews, using an oral history approach, along with participant observation and collection of voucher specimens from the local arctic tundra. Those with Naukan names and uses represent 42 species in 25 families.Results: Participants reported a decrease of 13% in the number of edible species that people currently harvest, from what they recall harvesting in their youth. On the other hand, the number of local species considered to be medicinal has actually increased by 225%. Current and past Naukan medicinal practices diverge in some notable ways from those of neighboring societies on the Alaskan side of the Bering Strait. Most of the spiritual significance of local plants species is remembered by only a few elders.Conclusions: Naukan elders explained the large increase in use of medicinal plants by noting that their original concept of medicine emphasized prevention and that illnesses were often assigned a spiritual rather than physical cause. Increased integration with ethnic Russians after moving from Naukan led to the adoption not only of new plant uses, but also of an entirely different, more naturalistic way of viewing illness and treatment.

TI  - Methods to Describe Referral Patterns in a Canadian Primary Care Electronic Medical Record Database: Modelling Multilevel Count Data.
T2  - Journal of innovation in health informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:  A referral from a family physician (FP) to a specialist is an inflection point in the patient journey, with potential implications for clinical outcomes and health policy. Primary care electronic medical record (EMR) databases offer opportunities to examine referral patterns. Until recently, software techniques were not available to model these kinds of multi-level count data.OBJECTIVE: To establish methodology for determining referral rates from FPs to medical specialists using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) EMR database.METHOD: Retrospective cohort study, mixed effects and multi-level negative binomial regression modelling with 87,258 eligible patients between 2007 and 2012. Mean referrals compared by patient sex, age, chronic conditions, FP visits, and urban/rural practice location. Proportion of variance in referral rates attributable to the patient and practice levels.RESULTS: On average, males had 0.26, and females 0.31 referrals in a 12-month period. Referrals were significantly higher for females, increased with age, FP visits, and number of chronic conditions (p<.0001). Overall, 14% of the variance in referrals could be attributed to the practice level, and 86% to patient level characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Both patient and practice characteristics influenced referral patterns. The methodologic insights gained from this study have relevance to future studies on many research questions that utilize count data, both within primary care and broader health services research. The utility of the CPCSSN database will continue to increase in tandem with data quality improvements, providing a valuable resource to study Canadian referral patterns over time.

TI  - A Framework for Estimating the 30 m Thermal-Infrared Broadband Emissivity From Landsat Surface Reflectance Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface thermal-infrared broadband emissivity (BBE) is a vital variable for estimating land surface radiation budgets (SRBs). We develop a framework for retrieving the 30 m BBE from Landsat surface reflectance data to estimate SRBs at finer scales and validate coarse resolution data. In the developed framework, the land surface is classified as bare soils and vegetated surfaces to allow different algorithms to be used for the BBE estimation. We propose a downscaling algorithm that uses the empirical relationship between the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) BBE and Landsat surface reflectance at 90 m to retrieve the 30 m BBE over bare soils. A look-up table (LUT)-based algorithm is proposed for vegetated surfaces. The BBE is interpolated from a LUT that is constructed from the 4SAIL radiative transfer model with inputs of the leaf BBE, the soil background BBE, and the leaf area index (LAI). Ground measurements that were collected at 11 relatively homogeneous sandy sites during three independent field campaigns are used to validate the proposed algorithm over bare soils. The average difference between the retrieved and field-measured BBEs is 0.012. We produce the land surface BBE of China in 2008 by using the developed framework and composited winter and summer seasonal BBE maps. The composited seasonal BBE maps are compared to the seasonal BBE maps derived from the ASTER emissivity product. The bias is within 0.005 over bare soils and ranges from 0.012 to 0.019 over vegetated surfaces. Combined with the validated results in this study and published references, the comparison results demonstrate the good performance of the developed framework. This study provides a new perspective on estimating BBEs from sensors with only a thermal-infrared channel.

TI  - Relationships Between Gravity Waves Observed at Earth's Surface and in the Stratosphere Over the Central and Eastern United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of tropospheric gravity waves (GWs) made by the new and extensive USArray Transportable Array (TA) barometric network located east of the Rockies, in the central and eastern United States and of stratospheric (30-40 km above sea level) GWs made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are compared over a 5 year time span from 2010 through 2014. GW detections in the period band from 2 to 6 h made at the Earth's surface during the thunderstorm season from May through August each year exhibit the same broad spatial and temporal patterns as observed at stratospheric altitudes. At both levels, the occurrence frequency of GWs is higher at night than during the day and is highest to the west of the Great Lakes. Statistically significant correlations between the variance of the pressure at the TA, which is a proxy for GWs at ground level, with 8.1 mu m brightness temperature measurements from AIRS and rain radar precipitation data, which are both proxies for convective activity, indicate that GWs observed at the TA are related to convective sources. There is little, if any, time lag between the two. Correlations between GWs in the stratosphere and at ground level are weaker, possibly due to the AIRS observational filter effect, but are still statistically significant at nighttime. We conclude that convective activity to the west of the Great Lakes is the dominant source of GWs both at ground level and within the stratosphere.Plain Language Summary Observations of tropospheric gravity waves made by the USArray Transportable Array (TA) barometric network located in the central and eastern United States and of stratospheric gravity waves made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder were compared over a 5 year time span from 2010 through 2014. Analysis of the TA data shows a gravity wave hot spot that is located on the Earth's surface west of the Great Lakes. Gravity wave occurrence rates on the ground exhibit the same broad spatial and temporal patterns as observed at stratospheric altitudes. Evidence suggests that convective activity is the dominant source of gravity waves both at the ground and in the stratosphere.

TI  - Effects of high spatial and temporal resolution Earth observations on simulated hydrometeorological variables in a cropland (southwestern France)
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural landscapes are often constituted by a patchwork of crop fields whose seasonal evolution is dependent on specific crop rotation patterns and phenologies. This temporal and spatial heterogeneity affects surface hydrometeorological processes and must be taken into account in simulations of land surface and distributed hydrological models. The Sentinel-2 mission allows for the monitoring of land cover and vegetation dynamics at unprecedented spatial resolutions and revisit frequencies (20 m and 5 days, respectively) that are fully compatible with such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Here, we evaluate the impact of Sentinel-2-like remote sensing data on the simulation of surface water and energy fluxes via the Interactions between the Surface Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model included in the EXternalized SURface (SURFEX) modeling platform. The study focuses on the effect of the leaf area index (LAI) spatial and temporal variability on these fluxes. We compare the use of the LAI climatology from ECOCLIMAP-II, used by default in SURFEX-ISBA, and time series of LAI derived from the high-resolution Formosat-2 satellite data (8 m). The study area is an agricultural zone in southwestern France covering 576 km(2) (24 km x 24 km). An innovative plot-scale approach is used, in which each computational unit has a homogeneous vegetation type. Evaluation of the simulations quality is done by comparing model outputs with in situ eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux (LE). Our results show that the use of LAI derived from high-resolution remote sensing significantly improves simulated evapotranspiration with respect to ECOCLIMAP-II, especially when the surface is covered with summer crops. The comparison with in situ measurements shows an improvement of roughly 0.3 in the correlation coefficient and a decrease of around 30% of the root mean square error (RMSE) in the simulated evapotranspiration. This finding is attributable to a better description of LAI evolution processes with Formosat-2 data, which further modify soil water content and drainage of soil reservoirs. Effects on annual drainage patterns remain small but significant, i.e., an increase roughly equivalent to 4% of annual precipitation levels with simulations using Formosat-2 data in comparison to the reference simulation values. This study illustrates the potential for the Sentinel-2 mission to better represent effects of crop management on water budgeting for large, anthropized river basins.

TI  - Distribution and Variability of Satellite-Derived Signals of Isolated Convection Initiation Events Over Central Eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combined measurements from the Chinese operational geostationary satellite Fengyun-2E (FY-2E) and ground-based weather radars to conduct a statistical survey of isolated convection initiation (CI) over central eastern China (CEC). The convective environment in CEC is modulated by the complex topography and monsoon climate. From May to August 2010, a total of 1,630 isolated CI signals were derived from FY-2E using a semiautomated method. The formation of these satellite-derived CI signals peaks in the early afternoon and occurs with high frequency in areas with remarkable terrain inhomogeneity (e.g., mountain, water, and mountain-water areas). The high signal frequency areas shift from northwest CEC (dry, high altitude) in early summer to southeast CEC (humid, low altitude) in midsummer along with an increasing monthly mean frequency. The satellite-derived CI signals tend to have longer lead times (the time difference between satellite-derived signal formation and radar-based CI) in the late morning and afternoon than in the early morning and night. During the early morning and night, the distinction between cloud top signatures and background terrestrial radiation becomes less apparent, resulting in delayed identification of the signals and thus short and even negative lead times. A decline in the lead time is observed from May to August, likely due to the increasing cloud growth rate and warm-rain processes. Results show increasing lead times with increasing landscape elevation, likely due to more warm-rain processes over the coastal sea and plain, along with a decreasing cloud growth rate from hill and mountain to the plateau.

TI  - Mapping three-dimensional surface deformation caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake using advanced satellite radar interferometry
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping three-dimensional (3D) surface deformation caused by an earthquake is very important for the environmental, cultural, economic and social sustainability of human beings. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems made it possible to measure precise 3D deformations by combining SAR interferometry (InSAR) and multiple aperture interferometry (MAI). In this paper, we retrieve the 3D surface deformation field of the 2010 Haiti earthquake which occurred on January 12, 2010 by a magnitude 7.0 Mw by using the advanced interferometric technique that integrates InSAR and MAI data. The surface deformation has been observed by previous researchers using the InSAR and GPS method, but 3D deformation has not been measured yet due to low interferometric coherence. The combination of InSAR and MAI were applied to the ALOS PALSAR ascending and descending pairs, and were validated with the GPS in-situ measurements. The archived measurement accuracy was as little as 1.85, 5.49 and 3.08 cm in the east, north and up directions, respectively. This result indicates that the InSAR/MAI-derived 3D deformations are well matched with the GPS deformations. The 3D deformations are expected to allow us to improve estimation of the area affected by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

TI  - The Prevalence of Oceanic Surface Modes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations have revolutionized oceanography, capturing diverse phenomena over much of the globe. However, it remains to understand how surface fields, like sea surface height, reflect the motion occurring at depth. The vertical structure of ocean eddies is often expressed in terms of "baroclinic modes," which are basis functions derived assuming a flat ocean bottom. Bathymetry alters the modes though, weakening the bottom velocities. Using analytical solutions, we demonstrate that with realistic bathymetry and/or bottom friction, the bottom velocities are nearly zero. The resulting " surface modes" should be ubiquitous in the ocean. This would explain the dominant mode of variability obtained from globally distributed current meter data and is consistent with energy spectra derived from sea surface height data. The results yield a simple way to infer subsurface velocities from satellite data and suggest that ocean analyses should be made in terms of surface modes and topographic waves.Plain Language Summary Observations of the sea surface from satellites have revolutionized oceanography. But it is important to understand how the surface fields, such as sea height and surface temperature, reflect the motion occurring at depth. Traditionally, oceanographers have represented the vertical structure of ocean currents using "modes." One of these, for example, does not vary with depth. The present work demonstrates how these modes change when realistic bottom topography is taken into account. The results suggest a simple way to predict subsurface velocities and have implications for our understanding of ocean dynamics.

TI  - Emission factors of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub> from Sumatran peatland fires in 2013 based on shipboard measurements
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We observed prominent CO enhancements with simultaneous enhancements of CO2 and CH4 around the Malay Peninsula in South-East Asia from mid-June to mid-August 2013 based on systematic shipboard observations. We identified 18 episodes of CO enhancement during the period, which were responsible for the largest positive anomaly of CO observed in the areas of off the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia and in the Straits of Malacca between 2007 and 2013 based on shipboard observations. Satellite data revealed that the CO enhancements resulted mainly from the emissions from large-scale biomass burning in north-central Sumatra. We characterized five biomass burning peaks with strong fire emission signatures based on the relationship between CO2 and CO. From these peaks, we estimated the average emission factors (EFs) for CO2, CO and CH4 from the fires in the study area. The estimated average EFs for CO2 and CO agreed well with those predicted by version 4.1s of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4.1s) using the recommended EF values, but the CH4 EF differed substantially, suggesting high uncertainty of the CH4 EF for peat in GFED4.1s. We estimated the typical EF values for peat fires based on the average EF values from the present study. The estimated typical EF values were 1663 +/- 54 g/kg for CO2, 205 +/- 23 g/kg for CO and 7.6 +/- 1.6 g/kg for CH4. Despite the lack of a clear difference for CO2 and CO, our estimated typical EF of CH4 was less than half of the GFED4.1srecommended EF and was comparable to previously reported EF values for Borneo peat. These results suggest a significant overestimation of the EF of CH4 for peat fires in GFED4.1s; using the present values would greatly decrease the estimated contribution of Equatorial Asia to global fire emissions of CH4, especially in drought years.

TI  - Improving geological mapping of the Farasan Islands using remote sensing and ground-truth data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - We integrated satellite imagery (Landsat-8) with ground-truth data to produce a detailed and complete geological map of the Farasan Islands, off the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at a scale of 1:100,000. This new map improves upon past efforts by expanding the mapped lithologies on the islands into four categories. We used different techniques to enhance this lithological differentiation, including band combination with ratio stretching and supervised classification techniques based on direct field validation. The former was used to distinguish differences in reflectance values across sets of bands to create a classification image from typical reflectance patterns. The geological feature boundaries were constrained by open-source high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) as well as field observations. The resulting map clearly distinguishes between different geomorphic and geologic features, including lineaments and lithologies. As the Farasan Islands are relatively remote and not easily accessible, with an area of 739 km(2), these imagery-analysis techniques were an effective tool for using remote sensing data to produce new and better mapping products of this important area.

TI  - Method to retrieve the nocturnal aerosol optical depth with a CCD laser aerosol detective system
T2  - OPTICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a crucial parameter in describing the atmospheric pollution and analyzing the influences of aerosol on the radiative equilibrium. Currently, no method can precisely and continuously measure the nocturnal AOD. In this study, a novel method was developed to retrieve the nocturnal AOD based on a remote sensing instrument called the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detective system (CCD-LADS). CCD-LADS consists of a CCD camera, a continuous laser, a fisheye lens, and related filters. The AOD can be calculated by integrating the aerosol extinction coefficient profile retrieved from CCD-LADS measurements. The retrieved AOD was validated with AERONET and MODIS data sets. The comparison shows good agreement. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Statistical intercomparison and validation of multisensory aerosol optical depth retrievals over three AERONET sites in Kenya, East Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, a number of space-borne sensors have been used to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD). The reliability of these datasets over East Africa (EA), however, is an important issue in the interpretation of regional aerosol variability. This study provides an intercomparison and validation of AOD retrievals from the MODIS-Terra (DT and DB), MISR and OMI sensors against ground-based measurements from the AERONET over three sites (CRPSM_Malindi, Nairobi, and ICIPE_Mbita) in Kenya, EA during the periods 2008-2013, 2005-2009 and 2006-2015, respectively. The analysis revealed that MISR performed better over the three sites with about 82.5% of paired AOD data falling within the error envelope (EE). MODIS-DT showed good agreement against AERONET with 59.05% of paired AOD falling within the sensor EE over terrestrial surfaces with relatively high vegetation cover. The comparison between MODIS-DB and AERONET revealed an overall lower performance with lower Gfraction (48.93%) and lower correlation r = 0.58; while AOD retrieved from OMI showed less correspondence with AERONET data with lower Gfraction (68.89%) and lowest correlation r = 0.31. The monthly evaluation of AODs retrieved from the sensors against AERONET AOD indicates that MODIS-DT has the best performance over the three sites with highest correlation (0.71-0.84), lowest RMSE and spread closer to the AERONET. Regarding seasonal analysis, MISR performed well during most seasons over Nairobi and Mbita; while MODIS-DT performed better than all other sensors during most seasons over Malindi. Furthermore, the best seasonal performance of most sensors relative to AERONET data occurred during June August (JJA) attributed to modulations induced by a precipitation-vegetation factor to AOD satellite retrieval algorithms. The study revealed the strength and weakness of each of the retrieval algorithm and forms the basis for further research on the validation of satellite retrieved aerosol products over EA.

TI  - Spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system combined with frequency ratio, generalized additive model, and support vector machine techniques
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility is an important prerequisite for the analysis of landslide hazards and risks inany area. This research uses three data mining techniques, such as an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system combined with frequency ratio (ANFIS-FR), a generalized additive model (GAM), and a support vector machine (SVM), for landslide susceptibility mapping in Hanyuan County,. China. In the first step, in accordance with a review of the previous literature, twelve conditioning factors, including slope aspect, altitude, slope angle, topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lithology, were selected. In the second step, a collinearity test and correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and landslides were applied. In the third step, we used three advanced methods, namely, ANFIS-FR, GAM, and SVM, for landslide susceptibility modeling. Subsequently, the results of their accuracy were validated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that all three models have good prediction capabilities, while the SVM model has the highest prediction rate of 0.875, followed by the ANFIS-FR and GAM models with prediction rates of 0.851 and 0.846, respectively. Thus, the landslide susceptibility maps produced in the study area can be applied for management of hazards and risks in landslide-prone Hanyuan County. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measuring effusion rates of obsidian lava flows by means of satellite thermal data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based thermal data are increasingly used for monitoring effusive eruptions, especially for calculating lava discharge rates and forecasting hazards related to basaltic lava flows. The application of this methodology to silicic, more viscous lava bodies (such as obsidian lava flows) is much less frequent, with only few examples documented in the last decades. The 2011-2012 eruption of Cordon Caulle volcano (Chile) produced a voluminous obsidian lava flow (similar to 0.6 km(3)) and offers an exceptional opportunity to analyze the relationship between heat and volumetric flux for such type of viscous lava bodies. Based on a retrospective analysis of MODIS infrared data (MIROVA system), we found that the energy radiated by the active lava flow is robustly correlated with the erupted lava volume, measured independently. We found that after a transient time of about 15 days, the coefficient of proportionality between radiant and volumetric flux becomes almost steady, and stabilizes around a value of similar to 5 x 10(6) J M-3. This coefficient (i.e. radiant density) is much lower than those found for basalts (similar to 1 x 10(8) J m(-3)) and likely reflects the appropriate spreading and cooling properties of the highly-insulated, viscous flows. The effusion rates trend inferred from MODIS data correlates well with the tremor amplitude and with the plume elevation recorded throughout the eruption, thus suggesting a link between the effusive and the coeval explosive activity. Modelling of the eruptive trend indicates that the Cordon Caulle eruption occurred in two stages, either incompletely draining a single magma reservoir or more probably tapping multiple interconnected magmatic compartments.

TI  - Aerosol trends as a potential driver of regional climate in the central United States: evidence from observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ surface observations show that downward surface solar radiation (SWdn) over the central and southeastern United States (US) has increased by 0.58-1.0 Wm(-2 )a(-1) over the 2000-2014 time frame, simultaneously with reductions in US aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 3.3-5.0 x 10(-3) a(-1). Establishing a link between these two trends, however, is challenging due to complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and radiation. Here we investigate the clear-sky aerosol-radiation effects of decreasing US aerosols on SWdn and other surface variables by applying a one-dimensional radiative transfer to 2000-2014 measurements of AOD at two Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites in the central and southeastern United States. Observations characterized as "clear-sky" may in fact include the effects of thin cirrus clouds, and we consider these effects by imposing satellite data from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) into the radiative transfer model. The model predicts that 2000-2014 trends in aerosols may have driven clear-sky SWdn trends of +1.35 Wm(-2) a(-1) at Goodwin Creek, MS, and +0.93 Wm(-2) a(-1) at Bondville, IL. While these results are consistent in sign with observed trends, a cross-validated multivariate regression analysis shows that AOD reproduces 20-26 % of the seasonal (June-September, HAS) variability in clear-sky direct and diffuse SWdn at Bondville, IL, but none of the HAS variability at Goodwin Creek, MS. Using in situ soil and surface flux measurements from the Amer-iflux network and Illinois Climate Network (ICN) together with assimilated meteorology from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), we find that sunnier summers tend to coincide with increased surface air temperature and soil moisture deficits in the central US. The 1990-2015 trends in the NLDAS SWdn over the central US are also of a similar magnitude to our modeled 2000-2014 clear-sky trends. Taken together, these results suggest that climate and regional hydrology in the central US are sensitive to the recent reductions in aerosol concentrations. Our work has implications for severely polluted regions outside the US, where improvements in air quality due to reductions in the aerosol burden could inadvertently pose an enhanced climate risk.

TI  - Reconstruction of historical aerosol optical depth time series over Romania during summertime
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based meteorological observations are used here as proxy data, as well as aerosol reanalysis estimates for training, to reconstruct aerosol optical depth (AOD) time series over Romania during a multidecadal period (1961-2015). The approach uses sunshine duration fraction (SDF) data computed for cloudless summer days (identified from 6-hourly cloud observations) and AOD data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis. MERRA-2 AOD data were validated first by comparing them to high-quality AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground observations at eight stations located in Central and Eastern Europe. The comparison of MERRA-2 AOD data with AERONET ground observations showed that the reanalysis estimates are reasonably accurate, but tend to underestimate AOD in the region of interest. Spaceborne AOD observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were also considered, but were found too biased and not complete enough for this task. A significant linear relationship between MERRA-2's AOD and SDF data at the 57 of the 86 available stations was found, allowing the use of both a linear and bivariate regression models to back-calculate the historical AOD time series from SDF observations. This reconstruction is restricted to clear summer days here because of the limited temporal resolution of the available cloud observations. The long-term trends of the computed AOD time series correctly delineate the expected dimming and brightening periods that have been widely reported over Europe. The proposed method is suitable over areas where very long and concomitant time series of daily sunshine and hourly cloud observations are available, but also has limitations that are discussed.

TI  - Soil erosion modeled with USLE, GIS, and remote sensing: a case study of Ikkour watershed in Middle Atlas (Morocco)
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ikkour watershed located in the Middle Atlas Mountain (Morocco) has been a subject of serious soil erosion problems. This study aimed to assess the soil erosion susceptibility in this mountainous watershed using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and spectral indices integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The USLE model required the integration of thematic factors' maps which are rainfall aggressiveness, length and steepness of the slope, vegetation cover, soil erodibility, and erosion control practices. These factors were calculated using remote sensing data and GIS. The USLE-based assessment showed that the estimated total annual potential soil loss was about 70.66 ton ha(-1) year(-1). This soil loss is favored by the steep slopes and degraded vegetation cover. The spectral index method, offering a qualitative evaluation of water erosion, showed different degrees of soil degradation in the study watershed according to FI, BI, CI, and NDVI. The results of this study displayed an agreement between the USLE model and spectral index approach, and indicated that the predicted soil erosion rate can be due to the most rugged land topography and an increase in agricultural areas. Indeed, these results can further assist the decision makers in implementation of suitable conservation program to reduce soil erosion.

TI  - Short-term peer-to-peer solar forecasting in a network of photovoltaic systems
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar forecasting is a necessary component of economical realitation of high penetration levels of photovoltaic (PV) systems. This paper presents a short term, intra-hour solar forecasting method. This "peer-to-peer" (P2P) forecasting method is based on the cross-correlation time lag between clear-sky index time series of pairs of PV systems that are influenced by the (assumed) same cloud sequentially, with the feature that the forecast horizon (FH) can be set at a fixed value. The P2P forecasting algorithm was evaluated for 11 central PV-systems (out of 202) over a half year period from the 1st of March through the 31st of August 2015 using the forecast skill (FS) metric. Positive FS means improvement over reference clear-sky index persistence forecasting. The P2P forecasting method was evaluated over a subset of days with either high, all or low irradiance variability. The average forecast skill (avgFS) concerning forecast horizons between 5 and 8 min. was 5.99%, -1.61% and -16.0% over these periods respectively, indicating the superior performance of the P2P method over persistence during the highly variable days, which are most interesting from the perspective of electricity grid management.

TI  - Snow model sensitivity analysis to understand spatial and temporal snow dynamics in a high-elevation catchment
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we addressed a sensitivity analysis of the snow module of the GEOtop2.0 model at point and catchment scale in a small high-elevation catchment in the Eastern Italian Alps (catchment size: 61km(2)). Simulated snow depth and snow water equivalent at the point scale were compared with measured data at four locations from 2009 to 2013. At the catchment scale, simulated snow-covered area (SCA) was compared with binary snow cover maps derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite imagery. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the effect of different model parameterizations on model performance at both scales and the effect of different thresholds of simulated snow depth on the agreement with MODIS data. Our results at point scale indicated that modifying only the snow correction factor resulted in substantial improvements of the snow model and effectively compensated inaccurate winter precipitation by enhancing snow accumulation. SCA inaccuracies at catchment scale during accumulation and melt period were affected little by different snow depth thresholds when using calibrated winter precipitation from point scale. However, inaccuracies were strongly controlled by topographic characteristics and model parameterizations driving snow albedo (snow ageing coefficient and extinction of snow albedo) during accumulation and melt period. Although highest accuracies (overall accuracy=1 in 86% of the catchment area) were observed during winter, lower accuracies (overall accuracy<0.7) occurred during the early accumulation and melt period (in 29% and 23%, respectively), mostly present in areas with grassland and forest, slopes of 20-40 degrees, areas exposed NW or areas with a topographic roughness index of -0.25 to 0m. These findings may give recommendations for defining more effective model parameterization strategies and guide future work, in which simulated and MODIS SCA may be combined to generate improved products for SCA monitoring in Alpine catchments.

TI  - Quantifying temporal variations in water resources of a vulnerable middle eastern transboundary aquifer system
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater resources in the arid Arabian Peninsula, especially transboundary aquifers shared by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq, are of critical environmental and geopolitical significance. Monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived gravity field solutions acquired over the expansive Saq transboundary aquifer system were analysed and spatiotemporally correlated with relevant land surface model outputs, remote sensing observations, and field data to quantify temporal variations in regional water resources and to identify the controlling factors affecting these resources. Our results show substantial GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater storage (GWS) depletion rates of -9.05 +/- 0.25mm/year (-4.84 +/- 0.13km(3)/year) and -6.52 +/- 0.29mm/year (-3.49 +/- 0.15km(3)/year), respectively. The rapid decline is attributed to both climatic and anthropogenic factors; observed TWS depletion is partially related to a decline in regional rainfall, while GWS depletions are highly correlated with increasing groundwater extraction for irrigation and observed water level declines in regional supply wells.

TI  - Evaluation of radiosonde, MODIS-NIR-Clear, and AERONET precipitable water vapor using IGS ground-based GPS measurements over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is one of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also the key parameter affecting the hydrological cycle, aerosol properties, aerosol-cloud interactions, the energy budget, and the climate. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in China using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-infrared (MODIS-NIR)-Clear PWV products from 2011 to 2013. We then compared the four PWV products (Global Positioning System PWV (GPS-PWV), radiosonde PWV (RS-PWV), MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV, and Aerosol Robotic Network sunphotometer PWV (AERONET-PWV)) at six typical sites in China from 2011 to 2013. The analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution showed that the PWV distribution in China has clear geographical differences, and its basic distribution characteristics gradually change from the coast in the southeast to inland in the northwest. Affected by the East Asian monsoon, the PWV over China showed clear seasonal distribution features, with highest values in the summer, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest values in winter. Intercomparison results showed that GPS-PWV and RS-PWV had a slightly higher correlation (R-2 = 0.975) at 0000 UTC than that at 1200 UTC (R-2 = 0.967). The mean values of Bias, SD, and RMSE between GPS-PWV and RS-PWV (GPS-RS) were 0.03 nun, 2.36 mm, and 2.60 mm at 0000 UTC, and -0.23 nun, 2.76 mm, and 2.95 nun at 1200 UTC, respectively. This showed that GPS-PWV was slightly lower than RS-PWV, and this difference was more obvious during the nighttime. The MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV product showed a similar correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.88) with GPS-PWV compared with RS-PWV. In addition, MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV was greater than GPS-PWV and RS-PWV. The MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV showed a larger deviation from GPS-PWV (MODIS-GPS Bias = 1.50 mm, RMSE = 5.76 mm) compared with RS PWV (MODIS-RS Bias = 0.75 mm, RMSE = 5.31 mm). The correlation coefficients between AERONET-PWV and the PWV from GPS, RS, and MODIS-NIR-Clear were 0.970, 0.963, and 0.923 (with RMSE of 2.53 mm, 3.67 nun, and 4.39 mm), respectively. In the Beijing area, the overall mean bias of the AERONET-PWV product with GPS-PWV, RS-PWV and MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV was -0.09 mm, -1.82 mm, and -1.54 mm, respectively, which shows that the AERONET-PWV product was lower than the other three PWV products.

TI  - A mathematical investigation of the air-ground temperature relationship in permafrost regions on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Air and soil temperatures are important factors that contribute to hydro-thermal processes and ecosystem dynamics in permafrost regions. However, there is little research regarding soil thermal dynamics during freeze thaw processes in permafrost regions with thermal orbits on the Tibetan Plateau. Thermal orbits can provide simplified illustrations of the relationships between air and ground temperatures. This paper presents a new quantitative analysis for thermal orbits by combining the characteristics of ellipse and linear regression theories. A sensibility analysis of thermal orbits was conducted with different air and ground temperatures and vegetation types on the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that the thermal orbit regression slopes and intercepts had variations in characteristics between air and ground temperatures at different depths. More specifically, both air and ground temperatures showed homologous variation with increasing depth. This type of analysis is important for a better understanding of permafrost thermal properties as they relate to soil moisture, climate change, and vegetation effects in permafrost regions on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Differences in nitrate and phosphorus export between wooded and grassed riparian zones from farmland to receiving waterways under varying rainfall conditions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural activities in catchments can cause excessive nutrient loads in waterways. Catchment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows may be intercepted and assimilated by riparian vegetation. While prior studies suggest that woody vegetation is preferable for reducing P loads, the question remains: is woody vegetation or grass cover more effective at reducing catchment N and P exports to waterways. To address this we investigated the relative importance of vegetation type, hydrologic and soil microbial processes on N and P losses from soil to a stream. The study involved the analysis of data from two soil microcosm experiments, and a field case study. We found P leaching loss from riparian zones depended significantly on vegetation type (woody vs. grass cover), with lower P exported from wooded riparian, zones, irrespective of the scale of rainfall. For N leaching losses, the scale of rainfall had an effect. During high rainfall, vegetation type had a major effect on N leaching loss, with lower N exported from grassed verses wooded riparian zones. However, under low rainfall conditions, soil type and soil C and N stores, potential indicators of soil microbial activity, rather than vegetation cover, affected N leaching. It is hypothesized that soil microbes were reducing N removal under these conditions. We reason that nitrifiers may have played an important role in soil N cycling, as increased soil ammonium had a strong positive effect on nitrate leaching loads, mediated through soil nitrate stores. Whereas, N immobilization, via incorporation into microbial biomass, and denitrification processes appeared to be limited by C availability, with increased C associated with reduced N leaching. Overall, this study identified that N leaching losses from riparian zones appeared to be affected by two different processes, vegetative uptake and soil microbial processes, the relative importance of which was driven by hydrological conditions.

TI  - Exploring the presence of pollutants at sea: Monitoring heavy metals and pesticides in loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) from the western Mediterranean
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine turtles are considered good sentinel species for environmental assessment because of their long lifespan, feeding ecology, habitat use and migratory nature. In the present study, we assessed presence of cadmium, lead and mercury, together with organic pollutants, both in fat and muscle tissue of 25 stranded loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Valencian Community coast (East Spain) (43.7 +/- 13.5 cm). Mean concentrations of Cd, Pb and Hg were 0.04 mu g/g w.w., 0.09 mu g/g w.w. and 0.03 mu g/g w.w. in fat and 0.05 mu g/g, 0.08 mu g/g and 0.04 mu g/g in muscle, respectively. These measures indicate a relatively low mean heavy metal concentration, which may be explained by juvenile size and developmental stage of the turtles analysed. A preliminary non targeted analysis (using time-of-flight (TOF) technology), made for the first time in marine turtles, allowed to detect 39 different pesticides, most of them previously undetected in this species. Most of the organic substances detected are used in agricultural activities, and the use of 15 of them (38.5%) is not approved in the European Union. Our sample did not show any trend on pollutant contents in relation to turtle size or stranding location, probably because of the high diversity of pollutants found. However, the potential for a positive latitudinal gradient should be explored in future studies due to riverine inputs and high agricultural and industrial activities in the area. Despite the high diversity of pollutants found here, comparative studies of pollutants in other matrices at sea are needed to ascertain whether the loggerhead turtle is a good sentinel of chemical pollution in the western Mediterranean.

TI  - Automatic and adaptive paddy rice mapping using Landsat images: Case study in Songnen Plain in Northeast China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal explicit information on paddy rice distribution is essential for ensuring food security and sustainable environmental management. Paddy rice mapping algorithm through the Combined Consideration of Vegetation phenology and Surface water variations (CCVS) has been efficiently applied based on the 8 day composites time series datasets. However, the great challenge for phenology-based algorithms introduced by unpromising data availability in middle/high spatial resolution imagery, such as frequent cloud cover and coarse temporal resolution, remained unsolved. This study addressed this challenge through developing an automatic and Adaptive paddy Rice Mapping Method (ARMM) based on the cloud frequency and spectral separability. The proposed ARMM method was tested on the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image (path/row 118/028) in the Songnen Plain in Northeast China in 2015. First, the whole study region was automatically and adaptively subdivided into undisturbed and disturbed regions through a per-pixel strategy based on Landsat image data availability during key phenological stage. Second, image objects were extracted from approximately cloud-free images in disturbed and undisturbed regions, respectively. Third, phenological metrics and other feature images from individual or multiple images were developed. Finally, a flexible automatic paddy rice mapping strategy was implemented. For undisturbed region, an object-oriented CCVS method was utilized to take the full advantages of phenology-based method. For disturbed region, Random Forest (RF) classifier was exploited using training data from CCVS-derived results in undisturbed region and feature images adaptively selected with full considerations of spectral separability and the spatiotemp oral coverage. The ARMM method was verified by 473 reference sites, with an overall accuracy of 95.77% and kappa index of 0.9107. This study provided an efficient strategy to accommodate the challenges of phenology-based approaches through transferring knowledge in parts of a satellite scene with finer time series to targets (other parts) with deficit data availability.

TI  - Land cover change during a period of extensive landscape restoration in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental change has been a topic of great interest over the last century due to its potential impact on ecosystem services that are fundamental for sustainable development and human well-being. Here, we assess and quantify the spatial and temporal variation in land cover in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China. With high-resolution (30 m) imagery from Landsat 4/5-TM and 8-OLI for the entire region, land cover maps of the region were created to explore local land cover changes in a spatially explicit way. The results suggest that land cover changes observed in NHAR from 1991 to 2015 reflect the main goals of a national policy implemented there to recover degraded landscapes. Forest, herbaceous vegetation and cultivated land increased by approximately 410,200 ha, 708,600 ha and 164,300 ha, respectively. The largest relative land cover change over the entire study period was the increase in forestland. Forest growth resulted mainly from the conversion of herbaceous vegetation (53.8%) and cultivated land (30.8%). Accurate information on the local patterns of land cover in NHAR may contribute to the future establishment of better landscape policies for ecosystem management and protection. Spatially explicit information on land cover change may also help decision makers to understand and respond appropriately to emerging environmental risks for the local population.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of fine particulate air pollutants over Indian mega cities
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the backdrop of the need for high spatio-temporal resolution data on PM2.5 mass concentrations for health and epidemiological studies over India, empirical relations between Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM2.5 mass concentrations are established over five Indian mega cities. These relations are sought to predict the surface PM2.5 mass concentrations from high resolution columnar AOD datasets. Current study utilizes multi-city public domain PM2.5 data (from US Consulate and Embassy's air monitoring program) and MODIS AOD, spanning for almost four years. PM2.5 is found to be positively correlated with AOD. Station-wise linear regression analysis has shown spatially varying regression coefficients. Similar analysis has been repeated by eliminating data from the elevated aerosol prone seasons, which has improved the correlation coefficient. The impact of the day to day variability in the local meteorological conditions on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship has been explored by performing a multiple regression analysis. A cross-validation approach for the multiple regression analysis considering three years of data as training dataset and one-year data as validation dataset yielded an R value of similar to 0.63. The study was concluded by discussing the factors which can improve the relationship. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling forest above-ground biomass dynamics using multi-source data and incorporated models: A case study over the qilian mountains
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a strategy for obtaining forest above-ground biomass (AGB) dynamics at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Our strategy rests on the assumption that combining estimates of both AGB and carbon fluxes results in a more accurate accounting for biomass than considering the terms separately, since the cumulative carbon flux should be consistent with AGB increments. Such a strategy was successfully applied to the Qilian Mountains, a cold arid region of northwest China.Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM) data and ASTER GDEM V2 products (GDEM), we first improved the efficiency of existing non-parametric methods for mapping regional forest AGB for 2009 by incorporating the Random Forest (RF) model with the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Validation using forest measurements from 159 plots and the leave-one-out (LOO) method indicated that the estimates were reasonable (R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 24.52 tones ha(-1)). We then obtained one seasonal cycle (2011) of GPP (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 5.02 gC m(-2) 8d(-1)) using the MODIS MOD_17 GPP (MOD_17) model that was calibrated to Eddy Covariance (EC) flux tower data (2010). After that, we calibrated the ecological process model (Biome-BioGeochemical Cycles (Biome-BGC)) against above GPP estimates (for 2010) for 30 representative forest plots over an ecological gradient in order to simulate AGB changes over time. Biome-BGC outputs of GPP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were validated against EC data (R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 1. 27 gC m(-2) d(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 1.17 gC M-2 d(-1) for NEE). The calibrated Biome-BGC was then applied to produce a longer time series for net primary productivity (NPP), which, after conversion into AGB increments according to site-calibrated coefficients, were compared to dendrochronological measurements (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 46.65 g m(-2) year(-1)), By combining these increments with the AGB map of 2009, we were able to model forest AGB dynamics. In the final step, we conducted a Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainties for inter annual forest AGB estimates based on errors in the above forest AGB map, NPP estimates, and the conversion of NPP to an AGB increment.

TI  - Evaluation of four long time-series global leaf area index products
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important vegetation biophysical variable, leaf area index (LAI) is a critical input parameter in many climate and ecological models. There exist four long time-series global LAI products since the 1980s, namely GLASS AVHRR, NCEI AVHRR, GIMMS3g and GLOBMAP. Currently, no inter-comparison studies exist to evaluate these LAI products and understand their differences for effective applications. In this study, the four long time series global LAI products were inter-compared to evaluate their temporal and spatial discrepancies. These LAI products were also compared with MODIS LAI product and LAI values derived from high-resolution reference maps at VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) sites. The results show that the GLASS AVHRR and GLOBMAP LAI products are spatially complete, but the NCEI AVHRR and GIMMS3g LAI products contain many missing pixels, especially in rainforest regions. These LAI products reasonably represent the global vegetation characteristics and their seasonal variability. A relatively large discrepancy among these LAI products was observed in tropical forest regions, where the GLASS AVHRR and NCEI AVHRR LAI values achieved good agreement with the MODIS LAI values, but were between 0.5 and 1.0 LAI units lower than the GLOBMAP LAI values and higher than the GIMMS3g LAI values (more than 0.5 LAI units). Over the last three decades, the GLASS AVHRR, NCEI AVHRR, GIMMS3g LAI products show increasing trends for all biome types except evergreen needleleaf forests and deciduous needleleaf forests, but the GLOBMAP LAI product shows positive trends only for the grasses/cereal crops and shrubs. A comparison of these LAI products against the LAI values derived from high-resolution reference maps demonstrated that the GLASS AVHRR LAI values provided the better performance (RMSE = 0.9014 and Bias = -0.1885) than the NCEI AVHRR LAI values (RMSE = 1.0459 and Bias = -0.5695), the GIMMS3g LAI values (RMSE = 1.0971 and Bias = -0.3904) and the GLOBMAP LAI values (RMSE = 1.6145 and Bias = -0.9414).

TI  - Assimilation of the leaf area index and vegetation temperature condition index for winter wheat yield estimation using Landsat imagery and the CERES-Wheat model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of regional winter wheat yield estimation in the Guanzhong Plain, China, the field measured leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture at the depth of 0-20 cm (theta) and both Landsat-retrieved LAI and theta were assimilated into the CERES-Wheat model with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The correlation between the assimilated LAI and the measured yield at each main wheat growth stage, including the green-up, jointing, heading-filling and milk stages, was compared with that between assimilated theta and yield. Then, five types of assimilation schemes were investigated to test the effects of assimilating different state variables at each wheat growth stage on wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the correlations between LAI and wheat yield at the jointing and heading-filling stages were higher than those between theta and wheat yield; moreover, the correlations between theta and wheat yield were higher at the green-up and milk stages. Among the five assimilation schemes, the accuracy of the yield estimation obtained by assimilating LAI at the jointing and heading-filling stages as well as by assimilating theta at the green-up and milk stages was the highest (R-2 = 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) = 548.97 kg ha(-1)), followed by the accuracy of the yield estimation obtained by assimilating LAI and theta simultaneously at each growth stage (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 610.67 kg ha(-1)). Conversely, the accuracy of the yield estimation obtained by assimilating LAI at the green-up and milk stages as well as by assimilating theta at the jointing and heading-filling stages was the lowest (R-2 = 0.41, RMSE = 928.95 kg ha(-1)). Thus, the assimilation of more yield-related state variables at each wheat growth stage in an agricultural data assimilation framework provides a reliable and promising method for improving wheat yield estimation.

TI  - Profile and concentric zonal analysis of relationships between land use/land cover and land surface temperature: Case study of Shenyang, China
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, relationships between land use/land cover (LULC) types and land surface temperature (LST) patterns in Shenyang, China were investigated using Landsat 8 image. Typical characteristics of LST in summer time and temperature variations over all LULC types were firstly examined. Afterwards, spatial distribution of LST in radial and circumferential directions was characterized based on profile and concentric zonal analysis, in which contributions of LULC types to LST were studied. In addition, models that can effectively predict LST distribution were developed based on multiple linear regression method (MLRM) and the partial least squares regression method (PLSRM). Results indicate that (1) LST of the study area mainly ranges from 32 degrees C to 41 degrees C, where building and road are main drivers leading to hot temperatures. (2) Temperature profiles vary greatly with LULC types, while urban expansion along central axis causes to horizontal arrangement of building and road, resulting in hot but small-fluctuated LST temperature in 0 and 180. (3) Mean and standard deviation of LST in concentric zones are 36.0 +/- 4.2 degrees C, and LST over all LULC types follows the following pattern: building > road >bare land > agricultural land > green land > water bodies. Due to large proportions of building and road, Buffer 3, 4 and 5 undergo the highest temperature. Although green land and water bodies show significant capability to mitigate UHI effects, cooling effects are unapparent when their sizes are small. (4) Both models developed on MLRM and PLSRM have high degree of accuracy, while the latter is more reasonable for different coefficients can respectively indicate negative and positive roles of LULC types in affecting surface temperature. In general, this study can assist urban planners and policy makers to understand relationships between local LULC types versus LST patterns, and can help them predict UHI patterns along rapid urban expansion, and then make rational urban planning decisions for UHI mitigation.

TI  - Quantifying agricultural drought in tallgrass prairie region in the US Southern Great Plains through analysis of a water-related vegetation index from MODIS images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe droughts in the Southern Great Plains (SGP: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas) in recent years have reduced the productivity of tallgrass prairie and resulted in substantial economic losses to the beef cattle industry in this region. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural drought in the SGP can help ranchers to develop and implement drought mitigation strategies. In this study, the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), calculated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, was used to assess agricultural drought in the tallgrass prairie region of the SGP during 2000-2013. The number of consecutive days with LSWI < 0 (DNLSWI) during the growing season was defined as the drought duration, which, was then used to identify and analyze frequency of summer drought and whole growing season drought (WGSD). The spatial pattern of DNLSWI was consistent with the east-to-west decreasing precipitation gradient across the SGP region. Summer drought duration as depicted by the DNLSWI in the western portion of the study area was around one and a half month. The occurrence of WGSD increased from one year in the east to up to six years in the west, demonstrating the susceptibility of the tallgrass prairie region to drought. In addition to the total amount of precipitation, its intra-annual distribution also played an important role in drought development. A comparison with other widely used national drought products, namely the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), and the United States Drought Monitor (USDM), shows that LSWI-based drought has good agreement with ESI and USDM. Quantitative analyses indicate that LSWI-based drought agreed better with ESI in severe drought conditions than in moderate or pre-drought conditions. Severe drought periods characterized by the USDM also had low LSWI values. The areas affected by drought derived from the LSWI-based drought index were significantly correlated with hay production. As an indicator of vegetation water stress at moderate spatial resolution (similar to 500 m), the LSWI has the potential to show drought conditions for an individual ranch and offer guidance for drought mitigation activities and livestock production.

TI  - Completion axillary lymph node dissection can be avoid in patients with invasive breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases.
T2  - Annali italiani di chirurgia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases in invasive breast cancer patients is still widely debated. Even if, in the absence of unequivocal guidelines, the axillary lynphadenectomy is not still performed in the routine clinical care of these patients.MATERIALS AND METHOD: We have retrospectively analyzed 897 patients with operable invasive breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes underwent conservative surgery or total mastectomy with SLN biopsy. Two groups of patients with SLN micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITC) were considered, the first one treated with completion axillary dissection, the second one not followed by further surgical axillary procedure. The incidence of axillary recurrences has BEEN evaluated in both groups and only in the first group of patients the involvement of the remaining lymph nodes was analyzed.RESULTS: Micrometastases were found in 67 (7.4%) patients and ITC in 8 (0,9%) patients. 14 (20.9%) patients with micrometastases and 1 (12.5%) patient with ITC underwent completion axillary dissection. 53 (79.1%) patients with micrometastases and 7 (87.5%) with ITC didn't receive further surgical axillary procedure. No axillary recurrences were found during a median follow up of 65.7±8.69 months in both groups of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and according to some recent randomized trials we can say that completion axillary dissection can be safely avoided when micrometastases are found in sentinel lymph nodes. It should be performed anyway, depending on the analysis of the biomedical profile of the tumor.KEY WORDS: Breast Carcinoma, Micrometastases Axillary Lymphonode Dissection, Sentinel Lymphonode.
AB  - Il significato prognostico delle micrometastasi nel linfonodo sentinella nelle pazienti affette da carcinoma della mammella e ancora ampiamente dibattuto. Anche se, in assenza di univoche linee guida, nella pratica clinica la linfadenectomia ascellare in queste pazienti non viene pio eseguita di routine. Abbiamo condotto uno studio retrospettivo su 897 pazienti affette da carcinoma invasivo della mammella con linfonodi ascellari negativi, sottoposte a chirurgia conservativa o a mastectomia totale con biopsia del linfonodo sentinella. Le pazienti in cui e stata diagnostica la presenza di micrometastasi del linfonodo sentinella sono state considerate in due diversi gruppi. In un primo gruppo, trattato con linfadenectomia ascellare totale e stata valutata lincidenza di metastasi a carico dei rimanenti linfonodi ascellari. Un secondo gruppo non ha ricevuto alcun trattamento aggiuntivo dellascella e le pazienti sono state seguite con controlli periodici clinico strumentali. In entrambi i gruppi e stata valutata lincidenza di eventuali recidive ascellari. Allesame istologico estemporaneo ed al successivo esame istologico definitivo del linfonodo sentinella, in 51 pazienti (6,83%) sono state evidenziate micrometastasi, in 8 pazienti (1,07%) erano presenti cellule tumorali isolate. Quindici di queste pazienti sono state sottoposte a linfadenectomia ascellare totale. Solo in 2 casi (13,33%) sono state ritrovate metastasi a carico dei rimanenti linfonodi ascellari. Quarantaquattro pazienti non hanno ricevuto alcun trattamento aggiuntivo dellascella. In queste pazienti nessuna recidiva ascellare e stata registrata durante un follow-up medio di 125,7±9,65 mesi (range 42- 102 mesi). Sulla base dei risultati ottenuti in questo studio ed in linea con alcuni recenti trials randomizzati si ci sentiamo di concludere che la linfadenectomia ascellare puo essere evitata nei casi con micrometastasi nel linfonodo sentinella. Una sua eventuale indicazione puo essere valutata caso per caso considerando come fattori di rischio per la recidiva ascellare alcune caratteristiche biomorfologiche del tumore primitivo.

TI  - A serosurvey of bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease in a convenience sample of sheep and cattle herds in Zimbabwe
T2  - ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A convenience sample of sheep and cattle herds around the cities of Harare, Kwekwe and Bulawayo, located in the Highveld region of Zimbabwe, was used to estimate the sero-prevalence and sero-incidence of bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) antibodies. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to identify serum antibodies against BTV and EHDV across three rainy seasons. The median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV antibodies in cattle was 62% (interquartile range [IQR]: 30-89) and 56% (IQR: 5-77), respectively. In sheep, the median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV was 41% (IQR: 19-63) and 0% (IQR: 0-21), respectively. Median sero-incidences of BTV and EHDV antibodies in cattle of 43% (IQR: 22-67) and 27% (IQR: 9-57) respectively were recorded. The median sero-incidence of BTV in sheep was 14% (IQR: 6-23). Based on these preliminary findings, animal health workers in Zimbabwe should continue to monitor the exposure rates of cattle and sheep to BTV and consider the possibility of strains emerging with increased pathogenicity. There are no previous published reports of antibodies against EHDV in Zimbabwe so the possibility of epizootic haemorrhagic disease existing in domestic livestock should now be considered by Zimbabwean animal health officials. Seroconversions to BTV and EHDV occurred predominantly at the end of each rainy season (March and April), which generally corresponds to high numbers of the Culicoides vectors. BTV isolations were made from three individual cows in two of the sentinel herds and all three were identified as serotype 3. This is the first time BTV serotype 3 has been recorded in Zimbabwe, although its presence in neighbouring South Africa is well documented.

However, systematic, compatible, and open access land use and land cover database at a high spatial resolution is not yet developed for Jordan. The overarching goal of this research is to build a decadal land cover database for Jordan at 30-m spatial resolution called the Jordan National Land Cover Database (JNLCD). This database encompasses four wall-to-wall land cover maps for the years 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2015s. A total of 44 Landsat pathfinder satellite scenes were used to develop this database along with multiple ancillaries and field observation data sources. An unsupervised classification method along with accurate ancillary data was used to build a representative land use/cover timeline. The thematic accuracies of JNLCD were assessed using ground reference points at randomly stratified pixels. The overall mapping accuracies achieved were between 90 and 94%. The results show that nearly 5.3% of the pixels changed from one cover type to another at least once while 94% of the pixels did not change between dates. The most remarkable land cover changes were from rainfed agriculture to urban and from rainfed to open rangelands, indicating a progressive decrease in land productivity and high variation in rainfall distribution, most pursuant in the recent decades. In 35 years, Jordan's land surface had been transformed into a human-induced landscape and lost a vast area of its pristine landscape of ecological and sustainable significance. The JNLCD product will help in designing proper monitoring and management regimes at local to national levels. This offers a baseline for substantial advancement of landscape-based research for development in the country.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of alpine grassland spring phenological and its response to environment factors northeastern of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during 2000-2016
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulnerable alpine grassland ecosystem is highly sensitive to climate change, and its response and feedback to climate change have been intensely studied by the scientific community. In this study, the alpine grassland ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was selected as the research subject, and MODIS time series data and field sampling data were used to analyze the characteristics of the beginning of the growing season (BGS) pattern and the spatio-temporal variation and responded to environmental factors. The results show that under the combined influence of elevation, land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture, the multi-year alpine grassland BGS pattern presents zonal horizontal characteristics with increasing delays from the southeast to the northwest and also exhibits non-zonal vertical characteristics in the western mountainous area. Alpine grassland BGS shows significant negative correlations with elevation and the 0-10 cm soil moisture content but a significant positive correlation with the mean spring LST. The relationships among BGS, elevation, and LST change when the elevation is over 4200 m, but the relationship between BGS and soil moisture continues to be a significant negative correlation. In the period 2000-2016, the BGS of the alpine grassland in the watershed generally advanced at the rate of 1.4 days/10 years and in local areas showed spatially heterogeneous trends. Spring soil moisture plays a key role in controlling spatio-temporal variations of BGS in the arid and semi-arid areas of the alpine zone relative to LST. Grassland degradation also affects the BGS spatio-temporal pattern and shows grassland degradation result of BGS in advance. The findings would provide a scientific reference for further understanding the mechanism of alpine vegetation phenology.

TI  - Application of stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) for copper prospectivity mapping in the Anarak region, central Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques are common in all fields of study because of their advantage for finding optimal results. Some of the MCDM techniques like analytic network process (ANP), factor relationship (FARE), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are so popular in mining exploration due to the obtaining of geochemical anomalies and mineral prospectivity maps. The aim of this study is to utilize the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method for prospecting copper in the Anarak region, central Iran. The SWARA method is a developed MCDM knowledge-based technique in accordance with ratio of the different criteria. Informative layers include geological, geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing data and have been integrated in this study. The data was classified according to the relation of copper occurrences/deposits in the Anarak region by the geographical information system (GIS). Following that, the every classified sub-criteria was weighted by the SWARA method and the weighted classified factors for determination of copper prospects were overlapped. Subsequently, the gained results illustrated the main copper prospects in the NW and NE parts of the region. Furthermore, the prospectivity map has a meaningful correlation with copper occurrences/deposits in the Anarak region. As a result, using the operating receiver characteristics (ORC) technique validates copper prospects derived via the SWARA method in the study region as high as 70% and validation result shows that the area under curve (ROC) is 0.79. Results derived via the SWARA were compared with the AHP method and the SWARA method is validated especially in NW part.

TI  - Characterisation of the artificial neural network CiPS for cirrus cloud remote sensing with MSG/SEVIRI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds remain one of the key uncertainties in atmospheric research. To better understand the properties and physical processes of cirrus clouds, accurate large-scale observations from satellites are required. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proved to be a useful tool for cirrus cloud remote sensing. Since physics is not modelled explicitly in ANNs, a thorough characterisation of the networks is necessary.In this paper the CiPS (Cirrus Properties from SE-VIRI) algorithm is characterised using the space-borne lidar CALIOP. CiPS is composed of a set of ANNs for the cirrus cloud detection, opacity identification and the corresponding cloud top height, ice optical thickness and ice water path retrieval from the imager SEVIRI aboard the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellites. First, the retrieval accuracy is characterised with respect to different land surface types. The retrieval works best over water and vegetated surfaces, whereas a surface covered by permanent snow and ice or barren reduces the cirrus detection ability and increases the retrieval errors for the ice optical thickness and ice water path if the cirrus cloud is thin (optical thickness less than approx. 0.3). Second, the retrieval accuracy is characterised with respect to the vertical arrangement of liquid, ice clouds and aerosol layers as derived from CALIOP lidar data. The CiPS retrievals show little interference from liquid water clouds and aerosol layers below an observed cirrus cloud. A liquid water cloud vertically close or adjacent to the cirrus clearly increases the average retrieval errors for the optical thickness and ice water path, respectively, only for thin cirrus clouds with an optical thickness below 0.3 or ice water path below 5.0 gm (-2). For the cloud top height retrieval, only aerosol layers affect the retrieval error, with an increased positive bias when the cirrus is at low altitudes. Third, the CiPS retrieval error is characterised with respect to the properties of the investigated cirrus cloud (ice optical thickness and cloud top height). On average CiPS can retrieve the cirrus cloud top height with a relative error around 8% and no bias and the ice optical thickness with a relative error around 50% and bias around +/- 10% for the most common combinations of cloud top height and ice optical thickness. Similarities with physically based retrieval methods are evident, which implies that even though the retrieval methods differ in the implementation of physics in the model, the retrievals behave similarly due to physical constraints. Finally, we also show that the ANN retrievals have a low sensitivity to radiometric noise in the SEVIRI observations. For optical thickness and ice water path the relative uncertainty due to noise is less than 10% down to sub-visual cirrus. For the cloud top height retrieval the uncertainty due to noise is around 100m for all cloud top heights.

TI  - Does slab-window opening cause uplift of the overriding plate? A case study from the Gulf of California
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complete subduction of an oceanic plate results in slab-window opening. A key uncertainty in this process is whether the higher heat flux and asthenospheric upwelling conventionally associated with slab-window opening generate a detectable topographic signature in the overriding plate. We focus on the Baja California Peninsula, which incorporates the western margin of the Gulf of California rift. The topography and tectonics of the rift flank along the peninsula are strongly bimodal. North of the Puertecitos accommodation zone, the primary drainage divide attains a mean elevation of ca. 1600 m above sea level (asl), above an asthenospheric slab-window opened by Pacific-Farallon spreading ridge subduction along this section of the trench at ca. 17-15 Ma. To the south, mean topography decreases abruptly to ca. 800 m asl (excluding the structurally distinct Los Cabos block at the southern tip of the peninsula), above fragments of the oceanic Farallon slab which stalled following slab tear-off at ca. 15-14 Ma. Along the peninsula, a low-relief surface established atop Miocene subduction-related volcaniclastic units has been incised by a west-draining canyon network in response to uplift. These canyons exhibit cut-and-fill relationships with widespread post-subduction lavas. Here, we utilise LANDSAT and digital elevation model (DEM) data, integrated with previously published K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar lava crystallisation ages, to constrain the onset of rift flank uplift to ca. 9-5 Ma later than slab-window formation in the north and ca. 11-10 Ma later in the south. These greatly exceed response time estimates of ca. 2 Ma or less for uplift triggered by slab-window opening. Instead, uplift timing of the high-elevation northern region is consistent with lower-lithospheric erosion driven by rift-related convective upwelling. To the south, stalled slab fragments likely inhibited convective return flow, preventing lithospheric erosion and limiting uplift to the isostatic response to crustal unloading during rifting.

TI  - Multiple remote-sensing assessment of the catastrophic collapse in Langtang Valley induced by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main shock of the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal induced numerous avalanches, rockfalls, and landslides in Himalayan mountain regions. A major village in the Langtang Valley was destroyed and numerous people were victims of a catastrophic avalanche event, which consisted of snow, ice, rock, and blast wind. Understanding the hazard process mainly depends on limited witness accounts, interviews, and an in situ survey after a monsoon season. To record the immediate situation and to understand the deposition process, we performed an assessment by means of satellite-based observations carried out no later than 2 weeks after the event. The avalanche-induced sediment deposition was delineated with the calculation of decreasing coherence and visual interpretation of amplitude images acquired from the Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). These outline areas are highly consistent with that delineated from a high-resolution optical image of WorldView-3 (WV-3). The delineated sediment areas were estimated as 0.63 km(2) (PALSAR-2 coherence calculation), 0.73 km(2) (PALSAR-2 visual interpretation), and 0.88 km(2) (WV-3). In the WV-3 image, surface features were classified into 10 groups. Our analysis suggests that the avalanche event contained a sequence of (1) a fast splashing body with an air blast, (2) a huge, flowing muddy mass, (3) less mass flowing from another source, (4) a smaller amount of splashing and flowing mass, and (5) splashing mass without flowing on the east and west sides. By means of satellite-derived pre-and post-event digital surface models, differences in the surface altitudes of the collapse events estimated the total volume of the sediments as 5.51 +/- 0.09 +/- 10(6) m(3), the largest mass of which are distributed along the river floor and a tributary water stream. These findings contribute to detailed numerical simulation of the avalanche sequences and source identification; furthermore, altitude measurements after ice and snow melting would reveal a contained volume of melting ice and snow.

TI  - Pastoral care (<i>Seelsorge</i>) and spiritual care in Germany
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - German-speaking countries the term spiritual care becomes more and more popular, not only in the realm of palliative care but also amongst pastoral care takers. In this article I argue that favouring of the term 'spiritual care' is not only a tribute to the changing situation in German-speaking countries, but also a way pastoral care takers want to deal with the challenges they face in a secular, multicultural society. I will discuss whether the use of the term 'spiritual care' is a way to 'lower the profile' of pastoral care and trying to be less explicit about the institution the pastors represent and the worldview they hold. This might look like an easy escape but does not foster the interaction in a multi-cultural space.

TI  - Spatially explicit modelling of agricultural dynamics in semi-arid environments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a software package called Spatially Explicit Agricultural Dynamics (SEAD), which investigates agricultural spatial and temporal land-use changes. SEAD is an agent-based model whose rules are set to mimic the human decision making processes regarding agricultural land expansion. Model calibration is based on remotely sensed data. Detection of agricultural lands was executed using intraand inter-annual Landsat images, with an overall accuracy of 86%. An analysis regarding the correlation of agricultural spread with water availability, irrigation infrastructure, road infrastructure, soil type, and geographical variables was conducted. These data, along with interviews with agricultural experts examining farmers' decision-making processes, were translated into rules that were used to model agricultural expansion. The SEAD results show that agricultural expansion in the north-western Negev (Israel) is highly dependent on water availability, which in turn is sensitive to forecasted climate change scenarios. While the spatial expansion patterns are mostly influenced by irrigation and road infrastructure positioning and placement, they vary in their infrastructural costs and agricultural settlement clustering and connectivity, thus affecting landscape fragmentation, travel time, and social/ecological connectivity. SEAD, being highly encapsulated and object-oriented in nature, can be reused in different settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying unpredictability: A multiple-model approach based on satellite imagery data from Mediterranean ponds
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluctuations in environmental parameters are increasingly being recognized as essential features of any habitat. The quantification of whether environmental fluctuations are prevalently predictable or unpredictable is remarkably relevant to understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms. However, when characterizing the relevant features of natural habitats, ecologists typically face two problems: (1) gathering long-term data and (2) handling the hard-won data. This paper takes advantage of the free access to long-term recordings of remote sensing data (27 years, Landsat TM/ETM+) to assess a set of environmental models for estimating environmental predictability. The case study included 20 Mediterranean saline ponds and lakes, and the focal variable was the water-surface area. This study first aimed to produce a method for accurately estimating the water-surface area from satellite images. Saline ponds can develop salt-crusted areas that make it difficult to distinguish between soil and water. This challenge was addressed using a novel pipeline that combines band ratio water indices and the short near-infrared band as a salt filter. The study then extracted the predictable and unpredictable components of variation in the water-surface area. Two different approaches, each showing variations in the parameters, were used to obtain the stochastic variation around a regular pattern with the objective of dissecting the effect of assumptions on predictability estimations. The first approach, which is based on Colwell's predictability metrics, transforms the focal variable into a nominal one. The resulting discrete categories define the relevant variations in the water-surface area. In the second approach, we introduced General Additive Model (GAM) fitting as a new metric for quantifying predictability. Both approaches produced a wide range of predictability for the studied ponds. Some model assumptions-which are considered very different a priori-had minor effects, whereas others produced predictability estimations that showed some degree of divergence. We hypothesize that these diverging estimations of predictability reflect the effect of fluctuations on different types of organisms. The fluctuation analysis described in this manuscript is applicable to a wide variety of systems, including both aquatic and non-aquatic systems, and will be valuable for quantifying and characterizing predictability, which is essential within the expected global increase in the unpredictability of environmental fluctuations. We advocate that a priori information for organisms of interest should be used to select the most suitable metrics for estimating predictability, and we provide some guidelines for this approach.

M3  - Article
AB  - Enteroviruses (EVs) cause severe outbreaks of respiratory and neurological disease as illustrated by EV-D68 and EV-A71 outbreaks, respectively. We have mapped European laboratory capacity for identification and characterisation of non-polio EVs to improve preparedness to respond to (re)-emerging EVs linked to severe disease. An online questionnaire on non-polio EV surveillance and laboratory detection was submitted to all 30 European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Twenty-nine countries responded; 26 conducted laboratory-based non-polio EV surveillance, and 24 included neurological infections in their surveillance. Eleven countries have established specific surveillance for EV-D68 via sentinel influenza surveillance (n = 7), typing EV-positive respiratory samples (n = 10) and/or acute flaccid paralysis surveillance (n = 5). Of 26 countries performing non-polio EV characterisation/ typing, 10 further characterised culture-positive EV isolates, whereas the remainder typed PCR-positive but culture-negative samples. Although 19 countries have introduced sequence-based EV typing, seven still rely entirely on virus isolation. Based on 2015 data, six countries typed over 300 specimens mostly by sequencing, whereas 11 countries characterised under 50 EV-positive samples. EV surveillance activity varied between EU/EEA countries, and did not always specifically target patients with neurological and/or respiratory infections. Introduction of sequence-based typing methods is needed throughout the EU/EEA to enhance laboratory capacity for the detection of EVs.

TI  - Atmospheric pollution over the eastern Mediterranean during summer - a review
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The eastern Mediterranean (EM) is one of the regions in the world where elevated concentrations of primary and secondary gaseous air pollutants have been reported frequently, mainly in summer. This review discusses published studies of the atmospheric dispersion and transport conditions characterizing this region during the summer, followed by a description of some essential studies dealing with the corresponding concentrations of air pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, total reactive nitrogen, methane, and sulfate aerosols observed there.The interlaced relationship between the downward motion of the subsiding air aloft induced by global circulation systems affecting the EM and the depth of the Persian Trough, a low-pressure trough that extends from the Asian monsoon at the surface controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of the mixed boundary layer during summer, is discussed. The strength of the wind flow within the mixed layer and its depth affect much the amount of pollutants transported and determine the potential of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants off their origins in the EM. The reduced mixed layer and the accompanying weak westerlies, characterizing the summer in this region, led to reduced ventilation rates, preventing an effective dilution of the contaminants. Several studies pointing at specific local (e.g., ventilation rates) and regional peculiarities (long-range transport) enhancing the build-up of air pollutant concentrations are presented.Tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentrations observed in the summer over the EM are among the highest over the Northern Hemisphere. The three essential processes controlling its formation (i.e., long-range transport of polluted air masses, dynamic subsidence at mid-tropospheric levels, and stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange) are reviewed. Airborne campaigns and satellite-borne initiatives have indicated that the concentration values of reactive nitrogen identified as precursors in the formation of O-3 over the EM were found to be 2 to 10 times higher than in the hemispheric background troposphere. Several factors favor sulfate particulate abundance over the EM. Models, aircraft measurements, and satellite-derived data have clearly shown that sulfate has a maximum during spring and summer over the EM. The carbon monoxide (CO) seasonal cycle, as obtained from global background monitoring sites in the EM, is mostly controlled by the tropospheric concentration of the hydroxyl radical (OH) and therefore demonstrates high concentrations over winter months and the lowest concentrations during summer when photochemistry is active. Modeling studies have shown that the diurnal variations in CO concentration during the summer result from long-range CO transport from European anthropogenic sources, contributing 60 to 80% of the boundary-layer CO over the EM. The values retrieved from satellite data enable us to derive the spatial distribution of methane (CH4), identifying August as the month with the highest levels over the EM. The outcomes of a recent extensive examination of the distribution of methane over the tropospheric Mediterranean Basin, as part of the ChemistryAerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx) program, using model simulations and satellite measurements, are coherent with other previous studies. Moreover, this methane study provides some insight into the role of the Asian monsoon anticyclone in controlling the variability of CH4 pollutant within mid-to-upper tropospheric levels above the EM in summer.

TI  - A new map of permafrost distribution on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has the largest areas of permafrost terrain in the mid-and low-latitude regions of the world. Some permafrost distribution maps have been compiled but, due to limited data sources, ambiguous criteria, inadequate validation, and deficiency of high-quality spatial data sets, there is high uncertainty in the mapping of the permafrost distribution on the TP. We generated a new permafrost map based on freezing and thawing indices from modified Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures (LSTs) and validated this map using various ground-based data sets. The soil thermal properties of five soil types across the TP were estimated according to an empirical equation and soil properties (moisture content and bulk density). The temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model was applied to simulate the permafrost distribution. Permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, and unfrozen ground covered areas of 1.06 x 10(6) km(2) (0.97-1.15 x 10(6) km(2), 90% confidence interval) (40 %), 1.46 x 10(6) (56 %), and 0.03 x 10(6) km(2) (1 %), respectively, excluding glaciers and lakes. Ground-based observations of the permafrost distribution across the five investigated regions (IRs, located in the transition zones of the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) and three highway transects (across the entire permafrost regions from north to south) were used to validate the model. Validation results showed that the kappa coefficient varied from 0.38 to 0.78 with a mean of 0.57 for the five IRs and 0.62 to 0.74 with a mean of 0.68 within the three transects. Compared with earlier studies, the TTOP modelling results show greater accuracy. The results provide more detailed information on the permafrost distribution and basic data for use in future research on the Tibetan Plateau permafrost.

TI  - Impacts of temperature extremes on European vegetation during the growing season
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is a key factor controlling plant growth and vitality in the temperate climates of the mid-latitudes like in vast parts of the European continent. Beyond the effect of average conditions, the timings and magnitudes of temperature extremes play a particularly crucial role, which needs to be better understood in the context of projected future rises in the frequency and/or intensity of such events. In this work, we employ event coincidence analysis (ECA) to quantify the likelihood of simultaneous occurrences of extremes in daytime land surface temperature anomalies (LSTAD) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We perform this analysis for entire Europe based upon remote sensing data, differentiating between three periods corresponding to different stages of plant development during the growing season. In addition, we analyze the typical elevation and land cover type of the regions showing significantly large event coincidences rates to identify the most severely affected vegetation types. Our results reveal distinct spatio-temporal impact patterns in terms of extraordinarily large co-occurrence rates between several combinations of temperature and NDVI extremes. Croplands are among the most frequently affected land cover types, while elevation is found to have only a minor effect on the spatial distribution of corresponding extreme weather impacts. These findings provide important insights into the vulnerability of European terrestrial ecosystems to extreme temperature events and demonstrate how event-based statistics like ECA can provide a valuable perspective on environmental nexuses.

TI  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Survey of Subsidence in Hampton Roads, Virginia (USA)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past century, the Hampton Roads area of the Chesapeake Bay region has experienced one of the highest rates of relative sea level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. This rate of relative sea level rise results from a combination of land subsidence, which has long been known to be present in the region, and rising seas associated with global warming on long timescales and exacerbated by shifts in ocean dynamics on shorter timescales. An understanding of the current-day magnitude of each component is needed to create accurate projections of future relative sea level rise upon which to base planning efforts. The objective of this study is to estimate the land component of relative sea level rise using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis applied to ALOS-1 synthetic aperture radar data acquired during 2007-2011 to generate high-spatial resolution (20-30 m) estimates of vertical land motion. Although these results are limited by the uncertainty associated with the small set of available historical SAR data, they highlight both localized rates of high subsidence and a significant spatial variability in subsidence, emphasizing the need for further measurement, which could be done with Sentinel-1 and NASA's upcoming NISAR mission.

TI  - Unveiling aerosol-cloud interactions - Part 1: Cloud contamination in satellite products enhances the aerosol indirect forcing estimate
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased concentrations of aerosol can enhance the albedo of warm low-level cloud. Accurately quantifying this relationship from space is challenging due in part to contamination of aerosol statistics near clouds. Aerosol retrievals near clouds can be influenced by stray cloud particles in areas assumed to be cloud-free, particle swelling by humidification, shadows and enhanced scattering into the aerosol field from (3-D radiative transfer) clouds. To screen for this contamination we have developed a new cloudaerosol pairing algorithm (CAPA) to link cloud observations to the nearest aerosol retrieval within the satellite image. The distance between each aerosol retrieval and nearest cloud is also computed in CAPA.Results from two independent satellite imagers, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), show a marked reduction in the strength of the intrinsic aerosol indirect radiative forcing when selecting aerosol pairs that are located farther away from the clouds (-0.28 +/- 0.26 Wm(-2)) compared to those including pairs that are within 15 km of the nearest cloud (-0.49 +/- 0.18 Wm(-2)). The larger aerosol optical depths in closer proximity to cloud artificially enhance the relationship between aerosol-loading, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. These results suggest that previous satellite-based radiative forcing estimates represented in key climate reports may be exaggerated due to the inclusion of retrieval artefacts in the aerosol located near clouds.

TI  - Unveiling aerosol-cloud interactions - Part 2: Minimising the effects of aerosol swelling and wet scavenging in ECHAM6-HAM2 for comparison to satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) are uncertain and the estimates of the ACI effective radiative forcing (ERFaci) magnitude show a large variability. Within the Aerosol_cci project the susceptibility of cloud properties to changes in aerosol properties is derived from the high-resolution AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) data set using the Cloud-Aerosol Pairing Algorithm (CAPA) (as described in our companion paper) and compared to susceptibilities from the global aerosol climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 and MODIS-CERES (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) data. For ECHAM6-HAM2 the dry aerosol is analysed to mimic the effect of CAPA. Furthermore the analysis is done for different environmental regimes.The aerosol-liquid water path relationship in ECHAM6-HAM2 is systematically stronger than in AATSR-CAPA data and cannot be explained by an overestimation of autoconversion when using diagnostic precipitation but rather by aerosol swelling in regions where humidity is high and clouds are present. When aerosol water is removed from the analysis in ECHAM6-HAM2 the strength of the susceptibilities of liquid water path, cloud droplet number concentration and cloud albedo as well as ERFaci agree much better with those of AATSR-CAPA or MODIS-CERES. When comparing satellite-derived to model-derived susceptibilities, this study finds it more appropriate to use dry aerosol in the computation of model susceptibilities.We further find that the statistical relationships inferred from different satellite sensors (AATSR-CAPA vs. MODIS-CERES) as well as from ECHAM6-HAM2 are not always of the same sign for the tested environmental conditions. In particular the susceptibility of the liquid water path is negative in non-raining scenes for MODIS-CERES but positive for AATSR-CAPA and ECHAM6-HAM2. Feedback processes like cloud-top entrainment that are missing or not well represented in the model are therefore not well constrained by satellite observations.In addition to aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing have an impact on liquid water path, cloud albedo and cloud droplet number susceptibilities. Aerosol processing leads to negative liquid water path susceptibilities to changes in aerosol index (AI) in ECHAM6-HAM2, likely due to aerosol-size changes by aerosol processing.Our results indicate that for statistical analysis of aerosolcloud interactions the unwanted effects of aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing need to be minimised when computing susceptibilities of cloud variables to changes in aerosol.

TI  - A new molecular-based lymph node staging classification determines the prognosis of breast cancer patients
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay is a novel molecular method that can detect metastasis in a whole lymph node based on cytokeratin 19 mRNA copy number. This cohort study aimed to establish an OSNA-based nodal staging (pN(mol)) classification for breast cancer.Methods: The cohort consisted of 1039 breast cancer patients who underwent sentinel node (SN) biopsy using the OSNA assay. Cutoff value of the SN tumour burden stratifying distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was determined, and predictive factors for DDFS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were investigated. pN(mol) classification of the SN status was defined as: pN0(mol)(sn), SN negative; pN1mi(mol)(sn), SN positive and tumour burden <cutoff-value; and pN1(mol)(sn), tumour burden >= cutoff-value. Median follow-up time; 68.3 months.Results: Cutoff value of the SN tumour burden was 2810 copies per mu l. Of the 1039 patients, 798, 95, and 146 had pN0(mol)(sn), pN1mi(mol)(sn), and pN1(mol)(sn) status, respectively. Five-year DDFS and BCSS rates were lower for pN1(mol)(sn) patients than for pN1mi(mol)(sn) patients (87.7% vs 98.8%, P = 0.001 and 93.1% vs 98.8%, P = 0.044, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed the pN(mol) classification was most significant predictor for DDFS and BCSS.Conclusions: The molecular-based pN classification determines the prognosis of breast cancer patients and could guide therapeutic decision making.

TI  - Clinicopathological predictors of recurrence in nodular and superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma: a multivariate analysis of 214 cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nodular melanoma (NM) accounts for most thick melanomas and because of their frequent association with ulceration, fast growth rate and high mitotic rate, contribute substantially to melanoma-related mortality. In a multicentric series of 214 primary melanomas including 96 NM and 118 superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), histopathological features were examined with the aim to identify clinicopathological predictors of recurrence.Methods: All consecutive cases of histopathologically diagnosed primary invasive SSM and NM during the period 2005-2010, were retrieved from the 12 participating Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI) centers. Each center provided clinico-pathological data such as gender, age at diagnosis, anatomical site, histopathological conventional parameters, date of excision and first melanoma recurrence.Results: Results showed that NM subtype was significantly associated with Breslow thickness (BT) at multivariate analysis: [BT 1.01-2 mm (OR 7.22; 95% CI 2.73-19.05), BT 2.01-4 mm (OR 7.04; 95% CI 2.54-19.56), and BT > 4 mm (OR 51.78; 95% CI 5.65-474.86) (p < 0.0001)]. Furthermore, mitotic rate (MR) was significantly correlated with NM histotype: [(MR 3-5 mitoses/mm(2) (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.01-6.83) and MR > 5 mitoses/mm(2) (OR 4.87; 95% CI 1.77-13.40) (p = 0.002)]. The risk of recurrence was not significantly associated with NM histotype while BT [BT 1.01-2.00 mm (HR 1.55; 95% CI 0.51-4.71), BT 2.01-4.00 mm (HR 2.42; 95% CI 0.89-6.54), BT > 4.00 mm. (HR 3.13; 95% CI 0.95-10.28) (p = 0.05)], mitotic rate [MR > 2 mitoses/mm(2) (HR 2.34; 95% CI, 1.11-4.97) (p = 0.03)] and the positivity of lymph node sentinel biopsy (SNLB) (HR 2.60; 95% CI 1.19-5.68) (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence at multivariate analysis.Conclusions: We found that NM subtype was significantly associated with higher BT and MR but it was not a prognostic factor since it did not significantly correlate with melanoma recurrence rate. Conversely, increased BT and MR as well as SNLB positivity were significantly associated with a higher risk of melanoma recurrence.

TI  - Precision Targeting of Tumor Macrophages with a CD206 Binding Peptide
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) expressing the multi-ligand endocytic receptor mannose receptor (CD206/MRC1) contribute to tumor immunosuppression, angiogenesis, metastasis, and relapse. Here, we describe a peptide that selectively targets MRC1-expressing TAMs (MEMs). We performed in vivo peptide phage display screens in mice bearing 4T1 metastatic breast tumors to identify peptides that target peritoneal macrophages. Deep sequencing of the peptide-encoding inserts in the selected phage pool revealed enrichment of the peptide CSPGAKVRC (codenamed " UNO"). Intravenously injected FAM-labeled UNO (FAM-UNO) homed to tumor and sentinel lymph node MEMs in different cancer models: 4T1 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma, B16F10 melanoma, WT-GBM glioma and MKN45-P gastric carcinoma. Fluorescence anisotropy assay showed that FAM-UNO interacts with recombinant CD206 when subjected to reducing conditions. Interestingly, the GSPGAK motif is present in all CD206-binding collagens. FAM-UNO was able to transport drug-loaded nanoparticles into MEMs, whereas particles without the peptide were not taken up by MEMs. In ex vivo organ imaging, FAM-UNO showed significantly higher accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes than a control peptide. This study suggests applications for UNO peptide in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic targeting of MEMs in solid tumors.

TI  - Monitoring the long term vegetation phenology change in Northeast China from 1982 to 2015
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has contributed to the extension of the growing season in North Hemisphere. In this paper, we investigated the spatial characteristics of the date of the start of the season (SOS), the date of the end of the season (EOS) and the length of the season (LOS) and their change trends from 1982 to 2015 in Northeast China. Our results showed that there was a significant advance of SOS and a significant delay of EOS, especially in the north part of Northeast China. For the average change slope of EOS in the study area, the delay trend was 0.25 d/y, which was more obvious than the advance trend of -0.13 d/y from the SOS. In particular, the LOS of deciduous needleleaf forest (DNF) and grassland increased with a trend of 0.63 d/y and 0.66 d/y from 1982 to 2015, indicating the growth season increased 21.42 and 22.44 days in a 34-year period, respectively. However, few negative signals were detected nearby Hulun Lake, suggesting that the continuous climate warming in the future may bring no longer growing periods for the grass in the semiarid areas as the drought caused by climate warming may limit the vegetation growth.

TI  - Empirical and model-based estimates of spatial and temporal variations in net primary productivity in semi-arid grasslands of Northern China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal variations in net primary productivity (NPP) reflect the dynamics of water and carbon in the biosphere, and are often closely related to temperature and precipitation. We used the ecosystem model known as the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) to estimate NPP of semiarid grassland in northern China counties between 2001 and 2013. Model estimates were strongly linearly correlated with observed values from different counties (slope = 0.76 (p < 0.001), intercept = 34.7 (p < 0.01), R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 35 g C.m(-2).year(-1), bias = -0.11 g C.m(-2).year(-1)). We also quantified inter-annual changes in NPP over the 13-year study period. NPP varied between 141 and 313 g C.m(-2).year(-1), with a mean of 240 g C.m(-2).year(-1). NPP increased from west to east each year, and mean precipitation in each county was significantly positively correlated with NPP D annually, and in summer and autumn. Mean precipitation was positively related to NPP in spring, but not significantly so. Annual and summer temperatures were mostly negatively correlated with NPP, but temperature was positively correlated with spring and autumn NPP. Spatial correlation and partial correlation analyses at the pixel scale confirmed precipitation is a major driver of NPP. Temperature was negatively correlated with NPP in 99% of the regions at the annual scale, but after removing the effect of precipitation, temperature was positively correlated with the NPP in 77% of the regions. Our data show that temperature effects on production depend heavily on recent precipitation. Results reported here have significant and far-reaching implications for natural resource management, given the enormous size of these grasslands and the numbers of people dependent on them.

TI  - Estimation of land surface heat fluxes based on visible infrared imaging radiometer suite data: case study in northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in surface-atmosphere interactions and can be monitored using remote sensing data. The visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) sensor is a generation of optical satellite sensors that provide daily global coverage at 375-to 750-m spatial resolutions with 22 spectral channels (0.412 to 12.05 mu m) and capable of monitoring ET from regional to global scales. However, few studies have focused on methods of acquiring ET from VIIRS images. The objective of this study is to introduce an algorithm that uses the VIIRS data and meteorological variables to estimate the energy budgets of land surfaces, including the net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat fluxes. A single-source model that based on surface energy balance equation is used to obtain surface heat fluxes within the Zhangye oasis in China. The results were validated using observations collected during the HiWATER (Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research) project. To facilitate comparison, we also use moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data to retrieve the regional surface heat fluxes. The validation results show that it is feasible to estimate the turbulent heat flux based on the VIIRS sensor and that these data have certain advantages (i.e., the mean bias error of sensible heat flux is 15.23 Wm(-2)) compared with MODIS data (i.e., the mean bias error of sensible heat flux is -29.36 Wm(-2)). Error analysis indicates that, in our model, the accuracies of the estimated sensible heat fluxes rely on the errors in the retrieved surface temperatures and the canopy heights. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Global height-resolved methane retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on MetOp
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the global height-resolved methane (CH4) retrieval scheme for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on MetOp, developed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The scheme precisely fits measured spectra in the 7.9 micron region to allow information to be retrieved on two independent layers centred in the upper and lower troposphere. It also uses nitrous oxide (N2O) spectral features in the same spectral interval to directly retrieve effective cloud parameters to mitigate errors in retrieved methane due to residual cloud and other geophysical variables. The scheme has been applied to analyse IASI measurements between 2007 and 2015. Results are compared to model fields from the MACC greenhouse gas inversion and independent measurements from satellite (GOSAT), airborne (HIPPO) and ground (TCCON) sensors. The estimated error on methane mixing ratio in the lower-and upper-tropospheric layers ranges from 20 to 100 and from 30 to 40 ppbv, respectively, and error on the derived column-average ranges from 20 to 40 ppbv. Vertical sensitivity extends through the lower troposphere, though it decreases near to the surface. Systematic differences with the other datasets are typically < 10 ppbv regionally and < 5 ppbv globally. In the Southern Hemisphere, a bias of around 20 ppbv is found with respect to MACC, which is not explained by vertical sensitivity or found in comparison of IASI to TCCON. Comparisons to HIPPO and MACC support the assertion that two layers can be independently retrieved and provide confirmation that the estimated random errors on the column-and layer-averaged amounts are realistic. The data have been made publically available via the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) data archive (Siddans, 2016).

AB  - Thirty-meters resolution turbidity maps derived from Landsat 8 (L8) images were used to investigate spatial and temporal variations of suspended matter patterns and distribution in the area of Po River prodelta (Italy) in the period from April 2013 to October 2015. The main focus of the work was the study of small and sub-mesoscale structures, linking them to the main forcings that control the fate of suspended sediments in the northern Adriatic Sea. A number of hydrologic and meteorological events of different extent and duration was captured by L8 data, quantifying how river discharge and meteomarine conditions modulate the distribution of turbidity on- and off-shore. At sub-mesoscale, peculiar patterns and smaller structures, as multiple plumes and sand bars, were identified thanks to the unprecedented spatial and radiometric resolution of L8 sensor. The use of these satellite-derived products provides interesting information, particularly on turbidity distribution among the different delta distributaries in specific fluvial regimes that fills the knowledge gap of traditional studies based only on in situ data. A novel approach using satellite data within model implementation is then suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wetland cover change detection using multi-temporal remotely sensed data A case study: Ghara Gheshlagh wetland in the southern part of the Urmia Lake
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia, located in northwest Iran, contains a number of wetlands significantly affecting the environmental, social, and economic conditions of the region. The ecological condition of Lake Urmia has degraded during the past decade, due to climate change, human activities, and unsustainable management. The poor condition of the lake has also affected the surrounding wetlands. This study analyzes the land cover change of one of the wetlands in the southern part of Lake Urmia, known as Ghara-Gheshlagh wetland, in the period 1989-2015 using post-classification change detection and machine learning image classification. For this analysis, three Landsat images, acquired in 1989 (TM), 2001 (TM), and 2015 (Landsat-8), were used for the classification and change detection. Support vector machine learning algorithm, a supervised learning method, is employed, and images are classified into four main land cover classes namely "water," "barren," "salty land," and "agriculture and grassland." Change detection was carried out for pairs of years 1989 to 2001 and 2001 until 2015. The results of this classification show that there is a sharp increase in the area of salt-saturated land as well as a decrease in the area of water resources. Overall classification accuracy obtained were high for the individual years: 1989 (91.48%), 2001 (90.63%), and 2015 (88.6%). Also, the Kappa coefficients for individual maps were high: 1989 (0.89), 2001 (0.8742), and 2015 (0.84). After that, the land cover change map of the study area is obtained between 1989 to 2001 and then 2001 to 2015. The results of this analysis suggest that more efforts should be taken to effectively manage water resources in the region and point to potential locations for focused management actions within the wetland area.

TI  - Analysis of ice shelf flexure and its InSAR representation in the grounding zone of the southern McMurdo Ice Shelf
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine tidal flexure in the grounding zone of the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, using a combination of TerraSAR-X repeat-pass radar interferometry, a precise digital elevation model, and GPS ground validation data. Satellite and field data were acquired in tandem between October and December 2014. Our GPS data show a horizontal modulation of up to 60% of the vertical displacement amplitude at tidal periods within a few kilometres of the grounding line. We ascribe the observed oscillatory horizontal motion to varying bending stresses and account for it using a simple elastic beam model. The horizontal surface strain is removed from nine differential interferograms to obtain precise bending curves. They reveal a fixed (as opposed to tidally migrating) grounding-line position and eliminate the possibility of significant upstream bending at this location. The consequence of apparent vertical motion due to uncorrected horizontal strain in interferometric data is a systematic mis-location of the interferometric grounding line by up to the order of one ice thickness, or several hundred metres. While our field site was selected due to its simple boundary conditions and low background velocity, our findings are relevant to other grounding zones studied by satellite interferometry, particularly studies looking at tidally induced velocity changes or interpreting satellite-based flexure profiles.

TI  - Dark ice dynamics of the south-west Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has increased in recent years due largely to changes in atmospheric circulation and atmospheric warming. Albedo reductions resulting from these changes have amplified surface melting. Some of the largest declines in GrIS albedo have occurred in the ablation zone of the south-west sector and are associated with the development of "dark" ice surfaces. Field observations at local scales reveal that a variety of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) can be present on the surface, ranging from inorganic particulates to cryoconite materials and ice algae. Meanwhile, satellite observations show that the areal extent of dark ice has varied significantly between recent successive melt seasons. However, the processes that drive such large interannual variability in dark ice extent remain essentially unconstrained. At present we are therefore unable to project how the albedo of bare ice sectors of the GrIS will evolve in the future, causing uncertainty in the projected sea level contribution from the GrIS over the coming decades.Here we use MODIS satellite imagery to examine dark ice dynamics on the south-west GrIS each year from 2000 to 2016. We quantify dark ice in terms of its annual extent, duration, intensity and timing of first appearance. Not only does dark ice extent vary significantly between years but so too does its duration (from 0 to > 80% of June-July-August, JJA), intensity and the timing of its first appearance. Comparison of dark ice dynamics with potential meteorological drivers from the regional climate model MAR reveals that the JJA sensible heat flux, the number of positive minimum-air-temperature days and the timing of bare ice appearance are significant interannual synoptic controls.We use these findings to identify the surface processes which are most likely to explain recent dark ice dynamics. We suggest that whilst the spatial distribution of dark ice is best explained by outcropping of particulates from ablating ice, these particulates alone do not drive dark ice dynamics. Instead, they may enable the growth of pigmented ice algal assemblages which cause visible surface darkening, but only when the climatological prerequisites of liquid meltwater presence and sufficient photosynthetically active radiation fluxes are met. Further field studies are required to fully constrain the processes by which ice algae growth proceeds and the apparent dependency of algae growth on melt-out particulates.

TI  - Monitoring tropical debris-covered glacier dynamics from high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry, Cordillera Blanca, Peru
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, are rapidly retreating and thinning as a result of climate change, altering the timing, quantity and quality of water available to downstream users. Furthermore, increases in the number and size of proglacial lakes associated with these melting glaciers is increasing potential exposure to glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Understanding how these glaciers are changing and their connection to proglacial lake systems is thus of critical importance. Most satellite data are too coarse for studying small mountain glaciers and are often affected by cloud cover, while traditional airborne photogrammetry and lidar are costly. Recent developments have made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) a viable and potentially transformative method for studying glacier change at high spatial resolution, on demand and at relatively low cost.Using a custom designed hexacopter built for high-altitude (4000-6000 m a.s.l.) operation, we completed repeat aerial surveys (2014 and 2015) of the debris-covered Llaca Glacier tongue and proglacial lake system. High-resolution orthomosaics (5 cm) and digital elevation models (DEMs) (10 cm) were produced and their accuracy assessed. Analysis of these datasets reveals highly heterogeneous patterns of glacier change. The most rapid areas of ice loss were associated with exposed ice cliffs and meltwater ponds on the glacier surface. Considerable subsidence and low surface velocities were also measured on the sediments within the pro-glacial lake, indicating the presence of extensive regions of buried ice and continued connection to the glacier tongue. Only limited horizontal retreat of the glacier tongue was observed, indicating that measurements of changes in aerial extent alone are inadequate for monitoring changes in glacier ice quantity.

TI  - First record of the invasive mosquito species <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) on the southernmost Mediterranean islands of Italy and Europe
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Aedes albopictus, a known worldwide vector of several mosquito-borne disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, was introduced into Europe in the late 1970s through global trade. First recorded in northern Italy in 1990, this mosquito species has rapidly spread throughout the country, where it was responsible for an outbreak of chikungunya in 2007 that affected more than 200 people. As part of the VectorNet project, which is aimed at improving preparedness and responsiveness for animal and human vector-borne diseases in Europe, a mosquito targeted study was carried out on the three southernmost Italian islands. The objective was to verify the current European southern distribution limits of Ae. albopictus and the potential occurrence of other invasive mosquito species, in the light of the introduction of high risk for vector-borne disease pathogens into Europe via migration flows.Results: In the summer 2015, six surveys for container-breeding mosquitoes were carried out by setting up a network of oviposition traps and BG Sentinel traps in selected areas on the islands of Pantelleria, Lampedusa and Linosa. Aedes albopictus was found on all three islands under investigation. The consequences on public health with regard to the presence of this mosquito vector and the migrant people entering the country from Africa and the Middle East are also discussed here.Conclusions: The detection of the Asian tiger mosquito on these islands, which represent the last European strip of land facing Africa, has important implications for public health policy and should prompt the national authorities to implement tailored surveillance activities and reinforce plans for preparedness strategies in such contexts.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy guided by indocyanine green, blue dye, and their combination in breast cancer patients: a prospective cohort study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent studies show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has the potential to improve the performance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. The current cohort study was designed to assess the value of the combination of ICG and methylene blue (MB) dye in patients undergoing SLN biopsy.Methods: A prospective self-controlled trial was designed to detect the difference in the detection efficacies of ICG, MB, and combined ICG and MB (ICG + MB) navigation methods. Between 2010 and 2013, 198 consecutive early breast cancer patients eligible for sentinel lymph node biopsy were enrolled and 200 biopsy procedures were performed by injection of both ICG and MB. SLNs were searched and removed under the guidance of fluorescence and/or blue dye. The mapping characteristics, the detection rate of SLNs and positive SLNs, and the number of SLNs of ICG, MB, and ICG + MB were compared. Injection safety of ICG and MB was evaluated.Results: Fluorescence imaging of lymphatic flow, which is helpful to locate the incision site, could be seen in 184 of 200 procedures. The nodal detection rate of ICG, MB, and ICG + MB samples was 97, 89, and 99.5% (.2 = 26.2, p < 0.001), respectively, with the combination method yielding a superior identification result. The addition of ICG to the MB method resulted in the identification of more lymph nodes (median 3 versus 2) and more positive axillas (22.7% involved axillas were discovered by fluorescence only) than either method alone. No acute or chronic allergic reaction was observed in this study. However, 23 patients (23/82) who received breast-conserving therapy reported temporary skin staining, and 5 patients had permanent tattooing. Palpable subcutaneous nodules at the injection sites were reported in nine patients. There were no reports of skin necrosis.Conclusions: The lymphatic navigation by ICG fluorescence detects SLNs at a high detection rate and improves the mapping performance when added to the MB method. The novel ICG + MB dual tracing modality, without involvement of radioactive isotopes, exhibits great potential as an alternative to traditional standard mapping methods.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, surveillance of livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in humans in Europe is not systematic but mainly event-based. In September 2014, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a questionnaire to collect data on the number of LA-MRSA from human samples (one isolate per patient) from national/regional reference laboratories in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in 2013. Identification of LA-MRSA as clonal complex (CC) 398 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was preferred, although surrogate methods such as spatyping were also accepted. The questionnaire was returned by 28 laboratories in 27 EU/EEA countries. Overall, LA-MRSA represented 3.9% of 13,756 typed MRSA human isolates, but it represented >= 10% in five countries (Belgium, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia). Seven of the reference laboratories did not type MRSA isolates in 2013. To monitor the dispersion of LA-MRSA and facilitate targeted control measures, we advocate periodic systematic surveys or integrated multi-sectorial surveillance.

TI  - End-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness in adults and children, United Kingdom, 2016/17
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Kingdom is in the fourth season of introducing a universal childhood influenza vaccine programme. The 2016/17 season saw early influenza A(H3N2) virus circulation with care home outbreaks and increased excess mortality particularly in those 65 years or older. Virus characterisation data indicated emergence of genetic clusters within the A(H3N2) C-3.2a group which the 2016/17 vaccine strain belonged to. Methods: The test-negative case-control (TNCC) design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory confirmed influenza in primary care. Results: Adjusted end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (aVE) estimates were 39.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.1 to 52.8) against all influenza and 40.6% (95% CI: 19.0 to 56.3) in 18-64-year-olds, but no significant aVE in >= 65-year-olds. aVE was 65.8% (95% CI: 30.3 to 83.2) for 2-17-year-olds receiving quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine. Discussion: The findings continue to provide support for the ongoing roll-out of the paediatric vaccine programme, with a need for ongoing evaluation. The importance of effective interventions to protect the >= 65-year-olds remains.

TI  - Assessing native desert vegetation recovery in a war-affected area using multispectral and hyperspectral imagery: a case study of the Sabah Al-Ahmad Nature Reserve, Kuwait
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary aim of this project was to assess vegetation changes in the Sabah Al-Ahmad Nature Reserve, Kuwait, which is a war-affected area following the Iraqi invasion in 1990. After the liberation in 1991, several portions of the reserve were under a restoration program. Remote sensing has been used as a tool to assess vegetation and land cover changes. We studied the feasibility of three common methods-the Mahalanobis distance (MD), maximum likelihood (ML), and support vector machine (SVM)-for classification of the multispectral imagery (Landsat) and hyperspectral (Hyperion). The reserve was also compared to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) located at Umm Nigga at the northern border of Kuwait, as it had recovered naturally, to distinguish between an autogenic recovery and a restored area. We discovered that the location was damaged during the military occupation, but a rapid recovery of the vegetation was then recorded in the reserve after the war from less than 1% measured in 1991 to 42% in 1998. Then, the vegetation cover significantly decreased in 2002 (26%) and slightly increased in 2013 (28%). We found that similar rapid increase in vegetation cover occurred in most parts of the reserve that was under the restoration program, and in the DMZ, which was naturally recovered. We concluded that remote sensing technologies are helpful tools in understanding the process of vegetation recovery as it provides information on location and timing of recovery, particularly where optimal condition exists.

TI  - Examining the Perception of Attendees on Sustainable Efforts Towards Event Greening Using the Values, Beliefs and Norms Theory
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Information in Business and Technology Management (12BM)
CL  - MALAYSIA
AB  - The elements of values, beliefs and norms will affect an individual's perception on certain issues. Understanding the environmental issues based on values will contribute to the ecological view in general. Then, this comprehension will change beliefs and norms. Given the awareness on ecological worldview, changes in norms would encourage people to be more pro-environmental. Norms are those actions articulated from the values and beliefs assimilated from theories and practices which is later executed based on selected preferences by an individual. These norms will be emulated into action in an individual's daily lives as a result of the combined and improved or adjusted values, beliefs and norms they have acquired from various sources. Ultimately, forming of a perception comes from the values, beliefs and norms of individuals. The combined elements of values, beliefs and norms will help the researcher to form a general perception on sustainable efforts towards event greening from the perspective of the event attendees. In this research, the focus is on event management and the efforts from event organizers to implement sustainable practices. The researchers wants to investigate from the perspective of event attendees. This research aims to explore the values, beliefs and norms theory on event attendees that influence their ecological worldview and pro-environmental personal norms and the effect that these dimensions have to uncover issues that will influence their perception on sustainable practices at events. The research findings are critical for the researcher to evaluate the situation and recommend appropriate green event management guidelines for event organizers to remain competitive by implementing sustainable practices for long-term survival in the event industry. The research methodology is a quantitative method using survey and the data is analyzed using the Multiple Linear Regression analysis This is the result from the pilot study of this research. The analysis indicated that, Values have a significant influence toward Perception, except for the Beliefs and Norms.

TI  - Meta-analysis of tumour burden in pre-operative axillary ultrasound positive and negative breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Management of the axilla in breast cancer is becoming increasingly conservative. Patients identified with a low axillary nodal burden (two or fewer involved nodes) at sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can avoid completion axillary node clearance (cANC). 'Fast track' to ANC in patients with involved nodes on pre-operative ultrasound may be over-treating a subgroup of these patients with low nodal burden, which would have precluded their need for ANC. This systematic review assesses the proportion of patients with involved nodes on pre-operative axillary ultrasound, which would fit low axillary burden criteria.Meta-analysis of studies comparing axillary burden of breast cancer patients identified as pre-operative ultrasound negative versus positive was performed. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients with two or fewer involved nodes (macrometastases only). Pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), means and probabilities of identifying two or fewer involved nodes versus greater than two were calculated.Six studies reported the axillary burden in 4271 patients who were either directed straight to ANC or cANC after SNB. There was a significantly greater axillary burden in the ultrasound positive versus negative groups (OR 5.95, 95% CI 5.80-6.11) with mean nodal retrieval values of 2.9 [standard error (SE) 0.2] and 1.6 (SE 0.2) nodes, respectively. Cumulative probabilities identified 78.9% of ultrasound negative and 43.2% of ultrasound positive patients possessed low axillary burden.Pre-operative ultrasound positive patients have significantly higher axillary burden. However, nearly half do fit the criteria of low axillary burden and could be considered for omission of ANC.

TI  - A synthesis of the environmental response of the North and South Atlantic Sub-Tropical Gyres during two decades of AMT
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenically-induced global warming is expected to decrease primary productivity in the subtropical oceans by strengthening stratification of the water column and reducing the flux of nutrients from deep -waters to the sunlit surface layers. Identification of such changes is hindered by a paucity of long-term, spatially -resolved, biological time -series data at the basin scale. This paper exploits Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) data on physical and biogeochemical properties (1995-2014) in synergy with a wide range of remote -sensing (RS) observations from ocean colour, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and altimetry (surface currents), combined with different modelling approaches (both empirical and a coupled 1-D Ecosystem model), to produce a synthesis of the seasonal functioning of the North and South Atlantic Sub -Tropical Gyres (STGs), and assess their response to longer -term changes in climate. We explore definitive characteristics of the STGs using data of physical (SST, SSS and peripheral current systems) and biogeochemical variables (chlorophyll and nitrate), with inherent criteria (permanent thermal stratification and oligotrophy), and define the gyre boundary from a sharp gradient in these physical and biogeochemical properties. From RS data, the seasonal cycles for the period 1998-2012 show significant relationships between physical properties (SST and PAR) and gyre area. In contrast to expectations, the surface layer chlorophyll concentration from RS data (CHL) shows an upward trend for the mean values in both subtropical gyres. Furthermore, trends in physical properties (SST, PAR, gyre area) differ between the North and South STGs, suggesting the processes responsible for an upward trend in CHL may vary between gyres. There are significant anomalies in CHL and SST that are associated with El Nifio events. These conclusions are drawn cautiously considering the short length of the time -series (1998-2012), emphasising the need to sustain spatially -extensive surveys such as AMT and integrate such observations with models, autonomous observations and RS data, to help address fundamental questions about how our planet is responding to climate change. A small number of dedicated AMT cruises in the keystone months of January and July would complement our understanding of seasonal cycles in the STGs.

TI  - Spatial Monitoring of Desertification Extent in Western Iraq using Landsat Images and GIS
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification refers to land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas caused by various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. In recent decades, sandstorms have increased significantly in Western Iraq, which primarily increased desert lands. Proper management is required to control and to monitor the phenomena, as well as to calculate the desertified areas caused by desertification. The study area covered 50,861.854km(2) in Western Iraq. Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+, and Landsat-8 OLI data for 1990, 2002, and 2014 were used. Maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify the images. Change detection results were discussed in two terms: short-term (1990-2002) and (2002-2014) and long-term (1990-2014) analysis. Change detection analysis from 1990 to 2014 showed that desert area increased to 2286.7308km(2), becoming a new source of dust storms. Hazard occurrence probability was studied on September and October 2014. The desertification amount decreased from 1990 to 2002 and increased significantly from 2002 to 2014. Sandstorms have recently been considered a hazardous phenomenon affecting the human population, the vegetation, and the ecosystem in Iraq. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - A phenology based geo-informatics approach to map land use and land cover (2003-2013) by spatial segregation of large heterogenic river basins
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on land use and land cover (LULC) is critical for policy decisions especially for management of land and water resources' activities in large river basins around the world. Phenology based LULC classification is the most promising approach particularly in the areas with diversified cropping patterns. Sometimes in large river basins, local climate and topography provides two different phenological information sets for the same crops in the same season. Based on accurate phenological information of the main crops in spatially segregated units, the remote sensing based classification was used to map the LULC changes for a period of 2003-2013 in the Kabul River Basin (KRB) of Afghanistan. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products of Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) with 250 m spatial resolution for this study. The overall accuracy (mean) of the LULC classification throughout the study period was around 68.15% +/- 9.45 while the producer and user accuracies (mean) were 75.9 +/- 113% and 76.4 +/- 11.2%, respectively. Results show that the cropping patterns vary significantly in the spatially disaggregated units. From 2003 till 2013, the ground coverage of wheat, barley and rice was increased by 31%, 7% and 32%, respectively. Overall, there has been only 2% increment in the agricultural area across the KRB between 2003 and 2013. This relatively increased trend of land cover change has taken place as a result of partial improvement in political stability as well as investment in irrigation infrastructure and agricultural development in the region. This study further provides insight to develop new agriculture strategies in order to maintain the ecosystem required to fulfil the rising food demands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved atmospheric correction and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> remote sensing models for turbid waters in a dusty environment
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the commonly used atmospheric correction models (NIR, SWIR, NIR-SWIR and FM) and ocean color products (OC3 and OC2) derived from MODIS images over the Arabian Gulf, Sea of Oman, and Arabian Sea. The considered atmospheric correction models have been used to derive MODIS normalized water-leaving radiances (nL(w)), which are compared to in situ water nL(w)(lambda) data collected at different locations by Masdar Institute, United Arab of Emirates, and from AERONET-OC (the ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network) database. From this comparison, the NIR model has been found to be the best performing model among the considered atmospheric correction models, which in turn shows disparity, especially at short wavelengths (400-500 nm) under high aerosol optical depth conditions (AOT (869) > 0.3) and over turbid waters. To reduce the error induced by these factors, a modified model taking into consideration the atmospheric and water turbidity conditions has been proposed. A turbidity index was used to identify the turbid water and a threshold of AOT (869) = 0.3 was used to identify the dusty atmosphere. Despite improved results in the MODIS nL(w)(2) using the proposed approach, Chl-a models (OC3 and OC2) show low performance when compared to the in situ Chl-a measurements collected during several field campaigns organized by local, regional and international organizations. This discrepancy might be caused by the improper parametrization of these models or/and the improper selection of bands. Thus, an adaptive power fit algorithm (R-2 = 0.95) has been proposed to improve the estimation of Chl-a concentration from 0.07 to 10 mg/m(3) by using a new blue/red MODIS band ratio of (443,488)/645 instead of the default band ratio used for OC3(443,488)/547. The selection of this new band ratio (443,488)/645 has been based on using band 645 nm which has been found to represent both water turbidity and algal absorption.

TI  - Spectral characterization of forest plantations with Landsat 8/OLI images for forest planning and management
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of Landsat 8/OLI images to differentiate the age and estimate the total volume of Pinus elliottii, in order to determine the applicability of these data in the planning and management of forest activity. Fifty-three sampling units were installed, and dendrometric variables of 9-and-10-year-old P. elliottii commercial stands were measured. The digital numbers of the image were converted into surface reflectance and, subsequently, vegetation indices were determined. Red and near-infrared reflectance values were used to differentiate the ages of the stands. Regression analysis of the spectral variables was used to estimate the total volume. Increase in age caused an addition in reflectance in the near-infrared band and a decrease in the red band. The general equation for estimating the total volume for P. elliottii had an R-adj(2) of 0.67 with a S-yx of 31.46 m(3) ha(-1). Therefore, the spectral data with medium spatial resolution from the Landsat 8/OLI satellite can be used to distinguish the growth stages of the stands and can, thus, be used in the planning and proper management of forest activity on a spatial and temporal scale.

TI  - Axillary local anesthetic spread after the thoracic interfacial ultrasound block - a cadaveric and radiological evaluation
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ANESTESIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Oral opioid analgesics have been used for management of peri- and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing axillary dissection. The axillary region is a difficult zone to block and does not have a specific regional anesthesia technique published that offers its adequate blockade.Methods: After institutional review board approval, anatomic and radiological studies were conducted to determine the deposition and spread of methylene blue and local anesthetic injected respectively into the axilla via the thoracic inter-fascial plane. Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies were then conducted in 15 of 34 patients scheduled for unilateral breast surgery that entailed any of the following: axillary clearance, sentinel node biopsy, axillary node biopsy, or supernumerary breasts, to ascertain the deposition and time course of spread of solution within the thoracic interfascial plane in vivo.Results: Radiological and cadaveric studies showed that the injection of local anesthetic and methylene blue via the thoracic inter-fascial plane, using ultrasound guide technique, results in reliable deposition into the axilla. In patients, the injection of the local anesthetic produced a reliable axillary sensory block. This finding was supported by Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies that showed hyper-intense signals in the axillary region.Conclusions: These findings define the anatomic characteristics of the thoracic interfascial plane nerve block in the axillary region, and underline the clinical potential of this novel nerve block.

TI  - Global association of aerosol with flash density of intense lightning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A global scale study of the association between aerosol loading and lightning production was conducted, using a full year's data for 2012 (as well as seasonal data) of the cloud-to-ground lightning record from the world wide lightning location network and aerosol optical depth measured by MODIS. 70% of all grid squares examined and 94% of the statistically significant ones had higher flash densities under polluted conditions than the clean ones. This trend is evident for large continental regions in North, Central and South America, Europe, southern Africa and north-east Australia. A detailed examination of the link to the meteorology was performed for four continental regions: the Amazon, North America, southern Africa and the Maritime Continent. The findings showed a similar trend under different meteorological conditions (defined by subsets of specified CAPE values and pressure velocity at 400 hPa). The results of this study suggest a route to association between aerosol loading and lightning-production rates in thunderclouds.

TI  - MILK PRODUCTION AS AN INDICATOR OF DROUGHT VULNERABILITY OF CITIES LOCATED IN THE BRAZILIAN SEMIARID REGION
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several spectral indices have been used to estimate droughts, however, these indicators only give evidence of a dry spell leaving out its impacts on significant economic activities performed in a given region. In this context, livestock breeding in one of the most important activities to analyze in the Brazilian semiarid region. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the drought indices, obtained through remote sensory devices, and annual milk production (2004 - 2014), identifying the most affected cities by the drought and were considered the most vulnerable and in need of special attention during dry periods. In order to analyze the data, the hierarchical grouping technique and correlation analyses between milk production and VCI - Vegetation Condition Index, TCI - Temperature Condition Index, VHI Vegetation Health Index, PCI - Precipitation Condition Index and SDCI - Scaled Drought Condition indices were used. The intense correlation between milk production and the drought indices may be related to the dependency of the cities' economies on natural resources. On the other hand, the diversification of the cities' economic activities may enable access to various resources and drought vulnerability reduction.

TI  - Regional Carbon Predictions in a Temperate Forest Using Satellite Lidar
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large uncertainties in terrestrial carbon stocks and sequestration predictions result from insufficient regional data characterizing forest structure. This study uses satellite waveform lidar from ICESat to estimate regional forest structure in central New England, where each lidar waveform estimates fine-scale forest heterogeneity. ICESat is a global sampling satellite, but does not provide wall-to-wall coverage. Comprehensive, wall-to-wall ecosystem state characterization is achieved through spatial extrapolation using the random forestmachine-learning algorithm. This forest description allows for effective initialization of individual-based terrestrial biosphere models making regional carbon flux predictions. Within 42/43.5 N and 73/71.5 W, above-ground carbon was estimated at 92.47 TgC or 45.66 MgC ha(-1), and net carbon fluxes were estimated at 4.27 TgC yr(-1) or 2.11 MgC ha-1 yr-1. This carbon sequestration potential was valued at 47% of fossil fuel emissions in eight central New England counties. In preparation for new lidar and hyperspectral satellites, linking satellite data and terrestrial biosphere models are crucial in improving estimates of carbon sequestration potential counteracting anthropogenic sources of carbon.

TI  - Identifying drought events in sugarcane using drought indices derived from Modis sensor
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of several spectral indices, calculated using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (Modis) images, in identifying drought events in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) crops. Images of Terra and Aqua satellites were used to calculate the spectral indices, using visible (red), near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands, and eight indices were selected: NDVI, EVI2, GVMI, NDI6, NDI7, NDWI, SRWI, and MSI. The indices were calculated using images between October and April of the crop years 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, and 2013/14. These indices were then correlated with the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), calculated for 1, 3, and 6 months. Four of them had significant correlations with SPEI: GVMI, MSI, NDI7, and NDWI. Spectral indices from Modis sensor on board the Aqua satellite (MYD) were more suited for drought detection, and March provided the most relevant indices for that purpose. Drought indices calculated from Modis sensor data are effective for detecting sugarcane drought events, besides being able to indicate seasonal fluctuations.

TI  - Can tree species diversity be assessed with Landsat data in a temperate forest?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of forest trees as an indicator of ecosystem health can be assessed using the spectral characteristics of plant communities through remote sensing data. The objectives of this study were to investigate alpha and beta tree diversity using Landsat data for six dates in the Gonen dam watershed of Turkey. We used richness and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices to calculate tree alpha diversity. We also represented the relationship between beta diversity and remotely sensed data using species composition similarity and spectral distance similarity of sampling plots via quantile regression. A total of 99 sampling units, each 20 m x 20 m, were selected using geographically stratified random sampling method. Within each plot, the tree species were identified, and all of the trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 7 cm were measured. Presence/absence and abundance data (tree species number and tree species basal area) of tree species were used to determine the relationship between richness and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, which were computed with ground field data, and spectral variables derived (2 x 2 pixels and 3 x 3 pixels) from Landsat 8 OLI data. The Shannon-Weiner index had the highest correlation. For all six dates, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) was the spectral variable most strongly correlated with the Shannon index and the tree diversity variables. The Ratio of green to red (VI) was the spectral variable least correlated with the tree diversity variables and the Shannon basal area. In both beta diversity curves, the slope of the OLS regression was low, while in the upper quantile, it was approximately twice the lower quantiles. The Jaccard index is closed to one with little difference in both two beta diversity approaches. This result is due to increasing the similarity between the sampling plots when they are located close to each other. The intercept differences between two investigated beta diversity were strongly related to the development stage of a number of sampling plots in the tree species basal area method. To obtain beta diversity, the tree basal area method indicates better result than the tree species number method at representing similarity of regions which are located close together. In conclusion, NDVI is helpful for estimating the alpha diversity of trees over large areas when the vegetation is at the maximum growing season. Beta diversity could be obtained with the spectral heterogeneity of Landsat data. Future tree diversity studies using remote sensing data should select data sets when vegetation is at the maximum growing season. Also, forest tree diversity investigations can be identified by using higher-resolution remote sensing data such as ESA Sentinel 2 data which is freely available since June 2015.

TI  - Relationship between MRPV Model Parameters from MISRL2 Land Surface Product and Land Covers: A Case Study within Mainland Spain
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we showed that the multi-angle satellite remote sensing product, MISR L2 Land Surface (MIL2ASLS), which has a scale of 1.1 km, could be suitable for improving land-cover studies. Using seven images from this product, captured by the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer sensor (MISR), we explored the values reached by the three parameters (rho 0, Theta, and k) of the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete model, which was modified by Martonchick (MRPV). Thereafter, we compared the values and behaviors shown in seven Co-ordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover categories, in the red and near infrared (NIR) bands, over the seven MISR orbits captured in 2006 for Mainland Spain. Furthermore, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) ancillary data and the illumination angles from the same pixels, which made up the images. These ancillary data were also provided by the MISR products. An inferential statistic test was performed to evaluate the relationship between each parameter-band combination, and the land cover in every MISR orbit used. The results suggested that the Theta parameters of this product seemed to be the most related to photosynthetic activity, and it should be comparable with the widely-used NDVI. On the other hand, the k and parameter values were not related, or at least not entirely related, to the phenology of land coverage. These seemed to be more influenced by the anisotropy behavior of the studied land cover pixels. Additionally, we observed, by constructing analysis of variance, how the mean of each MRPV parameter-band differed statistically (p < 0.01) by land covers and orbits. This study suggested that the MISR MRPV model parameter data product has great potential to be used to improve land cover applications.

TI  - Estimating the "Forgone" <i>ESV</i>s for Small-Scale Gold Mining Using Historical Image Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ghana's economic development relies largely on the mining industry, but the ecological cost is very high, particularly for the small-scale sector. To ascertain and give an account of the ecological pressures from the small-scale gold mining sector, we quantified and appraised the ecosystems (land cover types) degradation due to mining land use along portions of the renowned Pra River basin of Ghana. The study classified and analysed high-quality Landsat image data (1986-2016) to monitor processes and changes in the river basin and adopted the Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) model to quantify the forgone value in monetary term. The results revealed that the initial ESV of 17.69 million US$ in 1986 increased to 18.40 million US$ in 2002 for the study landscape with the small-scale mining sector accounting for 8.4% of the trade-off costs. The expansion of forest areas and its higher value coefficient (VC) was, however, prevalent and this resulted in a net positive change during this period. However, in 2016, out of the total ESV of 14.63 million US$ obtained, the small-scale mining activities accounted for 36.8% of the trade-off costs. The substantial increase in trade-off costs with a subsequent decrease in ESV in the study landscape, following the intensification of small-scale gold mining, indicates that their activities have been degrading the watershed ecosystem and are, therefore, unsustainable. The study affirms the need for policymakers/government to review the laws, particularly on post-mining monitoring schemes to deter illegal miners and support the registered small-scale miners who are willing to implement land rehabilitation activities.

TI  - Identification of Risk Factors in Lymphatic Surgeries for Melanoma <i>A National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Review</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymphadenectomy (LAD) are commonly performed in the staging and care of patients with malignant melanoma. These procedures are accompanied by complications that may result in hospital readmission, negatively affecting patient outcomes and potentially affecting surgical procedure reimbursement. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database offers a large data set allowing physicians to evaluate 30-day readmission for surgical complications. We used this database to explore predictors of 30-day hospital readmission for SLNB and LAD in the axillary, cervical, and inguinal regions.Methods: Data from the years 2005 to 2014 of the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database were used. Cohorts were constructed according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, classification and current procedural terminology codes. The outcome of 30-day return to hospital was defined as patients who were readmitted to the hospital or the operating room within 30 days. Multiple logistic regression results are presented for a prespecified set of predictors and predictors that were significant on univariate logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated using maximum likelihood estimates, along with Wald test P values.Results: A total of 3006 patients were included. Of those, 151 (5.0%) returned to the hospital. Among 1235 LAD patients, 65 (5.3%) returned; among 1771 SLNB patients, 86 (4.9%) returned. Smoking was a predictor of hospital readmission for overall SLNB and for cervical SLNB on multivariate analysis. Age was a significant predictor for cervical and inguinal LAD. Hypertension was significant for cervical LAD. Diabetes, preoperative hematocrit, and male sex were predictors for inguinal SLNB. There were no significant predictors for axillary SLNB and axillary LAD, as well as overall LAD procedures.Conclusions: This is the first and largest study using American College of Surgeons NSQIP to examine 30-day readmission after SLNB and LAD for melanoma in 3 commonly operated anatomical regions. We have found several significant risk factors associated with hospital readmission, which are now being used as a quality measure for hospital performance and reimbursement, that may help surgeons optimize patient selection for SLNB and LAD.

TI  - A comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging to axillary ultrasound in the detection of axillary nodal metastases in newly diagnosed breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer are increasingly undergoing breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative staging including evaluation of axillary lymph node metastases (ALNM). This retrospective study aims to evaluate the utility of adding axillary ultrasound (AUS) in the preoperative setting when an MRI is planned or has already been performed. This IRB approved, HIPAA compliant study reviewed a total of 271 patients with a new diagnosis of invasive breast cancer at a single institution, between June 1, 2010 and June 30, 2013. The study included patients who received both AUS and MRI for preoperative staging. Data were divided into two cohorts, patients who underwent MRI prior to AUS and those who underwent AUS prior to MRI. AUS and MRI reports were categorized according to BI-RADS criteria as suspicious or not suspicious for ALNM. In the setting of a negative MRI and subsequent positive AUS, only one out of 25 cases (4%) were positive for metastases after correlating with histologic pathology. MRI detected metastatic disease in four out of 27 (15%) patients who had false-negative AUS performed prior to MRI. Our results indicate the addition of AUS after preoperative MRI does not contribute significantly to increased detection of missed disease. MRI could serve as the initial staging imaging method of the axilla in the setting that AUS is not initially performed and may be valuable in identification of lymph nodes not identified on AUS.

TI  - Simulation-Based Interpretation and Alignment of High-Resolution Optical and SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful alignment of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data requires that we account for the effects of sensor-specific geometric distortion, which is a consequence of the different imaging concepts of the sensors. This paper introduces SimGeoI, a simulation framework for the object-related interpretation of optical and SAR images, as a solution to this problem. Using metainformation from the images and a digital surface model as input, the processor follows the steps of scene definition, ray tracing, image generation, geocoding, interpretation layer generation, and image part extraction. Thereby, for the first time, object-related sections of optical and SAR images are automatically identified and extracted in world coordinates under consideration of three-dimensional object shapes. A case study for urban scenes in Munich and London, based on WorldView-2 images and high-resolution TerraSAR-X data, confirms the potential of SimGeoI in the context of a perspective-independent and object-focused analysis of high-resolution satellite data.

T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Image-guided surgery is a relevant way to reduce surgical morbidity and maximize cytoreductive surgery approach especially in ovarian cancer. Sentinel lymph node detection is a promising approach to avoid radical lymph node dissection and is slightly becoming standard in daily practice in endometrial and cervical cancer surgery even if it needs to be evaluated more precisely. Regarding carcinomatosis of ovarian origin, detection and treatment of microscopic disease could be appropriate to avoid local recurrences. Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy are innovative techniques that allow to precise limits of excision (fluorescence-guided surgery) and to treat microscopic disease. Further developments of those strategies are necessary to become standard diagnosis tools and treatment options.

TI  - Evaluation and Aggregation Properties of Thermal Infra-Red-Based Evapotranspiration Algorithms from 100 m to the km Scale over a Semi-Arid Irrigated Agricultural Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimates are particularly needed for monitoring the available water of arid lands. Remote sensing data offer the ideal spatial and temporal coverage needed by irrigation water management institutions to deal with increasing pressure on available water. Low spatial resolution (LR) products present strong advantages. They cover larger zones and are acquired more frequently than high spatial resolution (HR) products. Current sensors such as Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offer a long record history. However, validation of ET products at LR remains a difficult task. In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate scaling properties of ET fluxes obtained at high and low resolution by two commonly used Energy Balance models, the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB). Both are forced by local meteorological observations and remote sensing data in Visible, Near Infra-Red and Thermal Infra-Red spectral domains. Remotely sensed data stem from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and MODIS sensors, respectively, resampled at 100 m and 1000 m resolutions. The study zone is a square area of 4 by 4 km(2) located in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural zone in the northwest of Mexico. Wheat is the dominant crop, followed by maize and vegetables. The HR ASTER dataset includes seven dates between the 30 December 2007 and 13 May 2008 and the LR MODIS products were retrieved for the same overpasses. ET retrievals from HR ASTER products provided reference ET maps at LR once linearly aggregated at the km scale. The quality of this retrieval was assessed using eddy covariance data at seven locations within the 4 by 4 km(2) square. To investigate the impact of input aggregation, we first compared to the reference dataset all fluxes obtained by running TSEB and SEBS models using ASTER reflectances and radiances previously aggregated at the km scale. Second, we compared to the same reference dataset all fluxes obtained with SEBS and TSEB models using MODIS data. LR fluxes obtained by both models driven by aggregated ASTER input data compared well with the reference simulations and illustrated the relatively good accuracy achieved using aggregated inputs (relative bias of about 3.5% for SEBS and decreased to less than 1% for TSEB). Results also showed that MODIS ET estimates compared well with the reference simulation (relative bias was down to about 2% for SEBS and 3% for TSEB). Discrepancies were mainly related to fraction cover mapping for TSEB and to surface roughness length mapping for SEBS. This was consistent with the sensitivity analysis of those parameters previously published. To improve accuracy from LR estimates obtained using the 1 km surface temperature product provided by MODIS, we tested three statistical and one deterministic aggregation rules for the most sensible input parameter, the surface roughness length. The harmonic and geometric averages appeared to be the most accurate.

TI  - A logistic regression model predicting high axillary tumour burden in early breast cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose As elective axillary dissection is loosing ground for early breast cancer (BC) patients both in terms of prognostic and therapeutic power, there is a growing interest in predicting patients with (nodal) high tumour burden (HTB), especially after a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB) because they would really benefit from further axillary intervention either by complete lymph-node dissection or axillary radiation therapy.Methods/patients Based on an analysis of 1254 BC patients in whom complete axillary clearance was performed, we devised a logistic regression (LR) model to predict those with HTB, as defined by the presence of three or more involved nodes with macrometastasis. This was accomplished through prior selection of every variable associated with HTB at univariate analysis.Results Only those variables shown as significant at the multivariate analysis were finally considered, namely tumour size, lymphovascular invasion and histological grade. A probability table was then built to calculate the chances of HTB from a cross-correlation of those three variables. As a suggestion, if we were to follow the rationale previously used in the micrometastasis trials, a threshold of about 10% risk of HTB could be considered under which no further axillary treatment is warranted.Conclusions Our LR model with its probability table can be used to define a subgroup of early BC patients suitable for axillary conservative procedures, either sparing completion lymph-node dissection or even SNB altogether.

TI  - Treefall Gap Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper knowledge about resources in forest management is fundamental. One of the most important parameters of forests is their size or spatial extension. By determining the area of treefall gaps inside the compartments, a more accurate yield can be calculated and the scheduling of forestry operations could be planned better. Several field- and remote sensing-based approaches are in use for mapping but they provide only static measurements at high cost. The Earth Observation satellite mission Sentinel-2 was put in orbit as part of the Copernicus programme. With the 10-m resolution bands, it is possible to observe small-scale forestry operations like treefall gaps. The spatial extension of these gaps is often less than 200 m(2), thus their detection can only be done on sub-pixel level. Due to the higher temporal resolution of Sentinel-2, multiple observations are available in a year; therefore, a time series evaluation is possible. The modelling of illumination can increase the accuracy of classification in mountainous areas. The method was tested on three deciduous forest sites in the Borzsony Mountains in Hungary. The area evaluation produced less than 10% overestimation with the best possible solutions on the sites. The presented work shows a low-cost method for mapping treefall gaps which delivers annual information about the gap area in a deciduous forest.

TI  - Satellite and Ground Observations of Snow Cover in Tibet during 2001-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal snow cover of the Tibetan Plateau exerts a profound environmental influence both regionally and globally. Daily observations of snow depth at 37 meteorological stations in Tibet and MODIS eight-day snow products (MOD10A2) during the period 2001-2015 are analyzed with respect to the frequency and spatial distribution of snow cover for each season and for various altitude ranges. The results show that the average snow cover percentage was 16%. Snow cover frequency was less than 21% for 70% of the Tibetan area, while it was more than 40% in eastern Tibet and in the Himalayas. We also estimated the variations in the starting times of snow accumulation and ablation. During the 15 years, both datasets revealed a significant trend of earlier onset of ablation, but no evident trend for the start of accumulation. The two datasets differed slightly with respect to the seasonal variation of snow cover. MODIS data showed more snow in winter than in other seasons, but the ground data showed most snow in early spring. For the station locations, the correlation between ground and MODIS snow cover percentage (number of snow-covered stations/number of cloud-free stations) is 0.77. Combining the advantages of remote sensing data and ground observation data is the best way to investigate snow in Tibet.

TI  - Numerical modelling of erosion and assimilation of sulfur-rich substrate by martian lava flows: Implications for the genesis of massive sulfide mineralization on Mars
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mantle-derived volcanic rocks on Mars display physical and chemical commonalities with mafic-ultramafic ferropicrite and komatiite volcanism on the Earth. Terrestrial komatiites are common hosts of massive sulfide mineralization enriched in siderophile-chalcophile precious metals (i.e., Ni, Cu, and the platinum-group elements). These deposits correspond to the batch segregation and accumulation of immiscible sulfide liquids as a consequence of mechanicalithermo-mechanical erosion and assimilation of sulfur-rich bedrock during the turbulent flow of high-temperature and low-viscosity komatiite lava flows. This study adopts this mineralization model and presents numerical simulations of erosion and assimilation of sulfide- and sulfate-rich sedimentary substrates during the dynamic emplacement of (channelled) mafic-ultramafic lava flows on Mars. For sedimentary substrates containing adequate sulfide proportions (e.g., 1 wt% S), our simulations suggest that sulfide supersaturation in low-temperature (<1350 degrees C) flows could be attained at < 200 km distance, but may be postponed in high-temperature lavas flows (> 1400 degrees C). The precious-metals tenor in the derived immiscible sulfide liquids may be significantly upgraded as a result of their prolonged equilibration with large volumes of silicate melts along flow conduits. The influence of sulfate assimilation on sulfide supersaturation in martian lava flows is addressed by simulations of melt-gas equilibration in the C-H-O-S fluid system. However, prolonged sulfide segregation and deposit genesis by means of sulfate assimilation appears to be limited by lava oxidation and the release of sulfur-rich gas. The identification of massive sulfide endowments on Mars is not possible from remote sensing data. Yet the results of this study aid to define regions for the potential occurrence of such mineral systems, which may be the large canyon systems Noctis Labyrinthus and Valles Marineris, or the Hesperian channel systems of Mars' highlands (e.g., Kasei Valles), most of which have been periodically draped by mafic-ultramafic lavas.

TI  - A Phenological Approach to Spectral Differentiation of Low-Arctic Tundra Vegetation Communities, North Slope, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra ecosystems exhibit small-scale variations in species composition, micro-topography as well as significant spatial and temporal variations in moisture. These attributes result in similar spectral characteristics between distinct vegetation communities. In this study we examine spectral variability at three phenological phases of leaf-out, maximum canopy, and senescence of ground-based spectroscopy, as well as a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, from five dominant low-Arctic tundra vegetation communities in the Toolik Lake Research Area, Alaska, in order to inform spectral differentiation and subsequent vegetation classification at both the ground and satellite scale. We used the InStability Index (ISI), a ratio of between endmember and within endmember variability, to determine the most discriminative phenophase and wavelength regions for identification of each vegetation community. Our results show that the senescent phase was the most discriminative phenophase for the identification of the majority of communities when using both ground-based and simulated EnMAP reflectance spectra. Maximum canopy was the most discriminative phenophase for the majority of simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance data. As with previous ground-based spectral characterization of Alaskan low-Arctic tundra, the blue, red, and red-edge parts of the spectrum were most discriminative for all three reflectance datasets. Differences in vegetation colour driven by pigment dynamics appear to be the optimal areas of the spectrum for differentiation using high spectral resolution field spectroscopy and simulated hyperspectral EnMAP and multispectral Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra. The phenological aspect of this study highlights the potential exploitation of more extreme colour differences in vegetation observed during senescence when hyperspectral data is available. The results provide insight into both the community and seasonal dynamics of spectral variability to better understand and interpret currently used broadband vegetation indices and also for improved spectral unmixing of hyperspectral aerial and satellite data which is useful for a wide range of applications from fine-scale monitoring of shifting vegetation composition to the identification of vegetation vigor.

TI  - First Detection of Two Near-Earth Asteroids With a Southern Hemisphere Planetary Radar System
T2  - RADIO SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the first demonstration of a Southern Hemisphere planetary radar system to detect two near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The demonstration was conducted in a bistatic manner, with the 70m antenna of the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex transmitting at2.1GHz and reception at the Parkes Radio Telescope, outfitted with multiple receivers, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This initial system was used to detect the NEAs (43577) 2005UL5 and(33342) 1998WT24 during their close approaches in2015 November and2015 December, respectively. We describe the performance of the system and consider future possibilities using other antennas of the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex as transmitters.Plain Language Summary Planetary radar uses large radio dishes to transmit and receive radar signals off distant objects in the solar system. Careful processing of these signals over periods of several hours allows researchers to very accurately determine orbits, measure rotation rates, and in some cases to map surface features. In the past all of these activities have been performed with assets in the Northern Hemisphere. This paper details the first use of a Southern Hemisphere network for this task. The 70m dish at the NASA/JPL/CSIRO complex at Tidbinbilla in Canberra, Australia, was used as the transmitter, and the Parkes and Narrabri radio telescopes were used as receivers to successfully detect and track asteroids. A Southern Hemisphere network allows asteroids approaching from the south to be observed, filling in a blind spot in our existing capabilities.

TI  - Review and assessment of latent and sensible heat flux accuracy over the global oceans
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - For over a decade, several research groups have been developing air-sea heat flux information over the global ocean, including latent (LHF) and sensible (SHF) heat fluxes over the global ocean. This paper aims to provide new insight into the quality and error characteristics of turbulent heat flux estimates at various spatial and temporal scales (from daily upwards). The study is performed within the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Heat Flux (OHF) project. One of the main objectives of the OHF project is to meet the recommendations and requirements expressed by various international programs such as the World Research Climate Program (WCRP) and Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR), recognizing the need for better characterization of existing flux errors with respect to the input bulk variables (e.g. surface wind, air and sea surface temperatures, air and surface specific humidities), and to the atmospheric and oceanic conditions (e.g. wind conditions and sea state). The analysis is based on the use of daily averaged LHF and SHF and the associated bulk variables derived from major satellite-based and atmospheric reanalysis products. Inter-comparisons of heat flux products indicate that all of them exhibit similar space and time patterns. However, they also reveal significant differences in magnitude in some specific regions such as the western ocean boundaries during the Northern Hemisphere winter season, and the high southern latitudes. The differences tend to be closely related to large differences in surface wind speed and/or specific air humidity (for LHF) and to air and sea temperature differences (for SHF). Further quality investigations are performed through comprehensive comparisons with daily-averaged LHF and SHF estimated from moorings. The resulting statistics are used to assess the error of each OHF product. Consideration of error correlation between products and observations (e.g., by their assimilation) is also given. This reveals generally high noise variance in all products and a weak signal in common with in situ observations, with some products only slightly better than others. The OHF LHF and SHF products, and their associated error characteristics, are used to compute daily OHF multiproduct-ensemble (OHF/MPE) estimates of LHF and SHF over the ice-free global ocean on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid. The accuracy of this heat multiproduct, determined from comparisons with mooring data, is greater than for any individual product. It is used as a reference for the anomaly characterization of each individual OHF product.

TI  - Inflammatory pain assessment in the arthritis of the temporomandibular joint in rats: A comparison between two phlogistic agents
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders are a group of conditions that result in TMJ pain, which frequently limits basic daily activities. Experimental models that allow the study of the mechanisms underlying these inflammatory and pain conditions are of great clinical relevance. The aim of this study was to evaluate nociception, inflammation and participation of the macrophage/microglia cells in the arthritis of the TMJ induced by two phlogistic agents. 84 rats were divided into 2 groups: Zy, which received zymosan intra-articularly, or Cg, which received carrageenan intra-articularly. Mechanical nociception, total leukocyte influx to the synovial fluid and histopathological analyses were evaluated in the TMJ. The participation of macrophage/microglia located in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and in the subnucleus caudalis (V-SnC) was assessed immunohistochemically. Both agents induced mechanical hyperalgesia 6 h after the induction, but a more persistent algesic state was perceived in the Cg group, which lasted for 120 h. Even though both groups presented increased leukocyte influx, the Zygroup presented a more intense influx. Zymosan recruited resident macrophage in the trigeminal ganglia 24 h after the injection. In the V-SnC, the group Cg presented a more prolonged immunolabeling pattern in comparison with the group Zy. It can be concluded that zymosan induced a more intense infiltrate and peripheral nervous changes, while Cg lead to a moderate TMJ inflammation with prominent changes in the V-SnC.

TI  - Utility of remote sensing-based surface energy balance models to track water stress in rain-fed switchgrass under dry and wet conditions
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models to track water stress in rain-fed switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has not been explored yet. In this paper, the theoretical framework of crop water stress index (CWSI; 0 = extremely wet or no water stress condition and 1 = extremely dry or no transpiration) was utilized to estimate CWSI in rain-fed switchgrass using Landsat-derived evapotranspiration (ET) from five remote sensing based single-source SEB models, namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping ET with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop). CWSI estimates from the five SEB models and a simple regression model that used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), near-surface temperature difference, and measured soil moisture (SM) as covariates were compared with those derived from eddy covariance measured ET (CWSIEC) for the 32 Landsat image acquisition dates during the 2011 (dry) and 2013 (wet) growing seasons. Results indicate that most SEB models can predict CWSI reasonably well. For example, the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.14 (SEBAL) to 0.29 (SSEBop) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranged from 0.25 (SSEBop) to 0.72 (SEBAL), justifying the added complexity in CWSI modeling as compared to results from the simple regression model (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.16). All SEB models underestimated CWSI in the dry year but the estimates from SEBAL and S-SEBI were within 7% of the mean CWSIEC and explained over 60% of variations in CWSIEC. In the wet year, S-SEBI mostly overestimated CWSI (around 28%), while estimates from METRIC, SEBAL, SEBS, and SSEBop were within 8% of the mean CWSIEC. Overall, SEBAL was the most robust model under all conditions followed by METRIC, whose performance was slightly worse and better than SEBAL in dry and wet years, respectively. Underestimation of CWSI under extremely dry soil conditions and the substantial role of SM in the regression model suggest that integration of SM in SEB models could improve their performances under dry conditions. These insights will provide useful guidance on the broader applicability of SEB models for mapping water stresses in switchgrass under varying geographical and meteorological conditions.

TI  - A GIS-Based Procedure for Landslide Intensity Evaluation and Specific Risk Analysis Supported by Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of landslide specific risk, defined as the expected degree of loss due to landslides, requires the parameterization and the combination of a number of socio-economic and geological factors, which often needs the interaction of different skills and expertise (geologists, engineers, planners, administrators, etc.). The specific risk sub-components, i.e., hazard and vulnerability of elements at risk, can be determined with different levels of detail depending on the available auxiliary data and knowledge of the territory. These risk factors are subject to short-term variations and nowadays turn out to be easily mappable and evaluable through remotely sensed data and GIS (Geographic Information System) tools. In this work, we propose a qualitative approach at municipal scale for producing a "specific risk" map, supported by recent satellite PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) data derived from SENTINEL-1 C-band images in the spanning time 2014-2017, implemented in a GIS environment. In particular, PSI measurements are useful for the updating of a landslide inventory map of the area of interest and are exploited for the zonation map of the intensity of ground movements, needed for evaluating the vulnerability over the study area. Our procedure is presented throughout the application to the Volterra basin and the output map could be useful to support the local authorities with updated basic information required for environmental knowledge and planning at municipal level. Moreover, the proposed procedure is easily managed and repeatable in other case studies, as well as exploiting different SAR sensors in L- or X-band.

TI  - Quality indicators in breast cancer care: An update from the EUSOMA working group
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2010, EUSOMA published a position paper, describing a set of benchmark quality indicators (QIs) that could be adopted by breast centres to allow standardised auditing and quality assurance and to establish an agreed minimum standard of care. Towards the end of 2014, EUSOMA decided to update the paper on QIs to consider and incorporate new scientific knowledge in the field. Several new QIs have been included to address the need for improved follow-up care of patients following primary treatments. With regard to the management of elderly patients, considering the complexity, the expert group decided that, for some specific quality indicators, if centres fail to meet the minimum standard, older patients will be excluded from analysis, provided that reasons for non-adherence to the QI are specified in the clinical chart and are identified at the review of the clinical records. In this way, high standards are promoted, but centres are able to identify and account for the effect of non-standard treatment in the elderly. In the paper, there is no QI for outcome measurements, such as relapse rate or overall survival. However, it is hoped that this will be developed in time as the databases mature and user experience increases. All breast centres are required to record outcome data as accurately and comprehensively as possible to allow this to occur. In the paper, different initiatives undertaken at international and national level to audit quality of care through a set of QIs have been mentioned. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gain Form of the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter and Its Relevance to Satellite Data Assimilation with Model Space Ensemble Covariance Localization
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - To ameliorate suboptimality in ensemble data assimilation, methods have been introduced that involve expanding the ensemble size. Such expansions can incorporate model space covariance localization and/or estimates of climatological or model error covariances. Model space covariance localization in the vertical overcomes problematic aspects of ensemble-based satellite data assimilation. In the case of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), the expanded ensemble size associated with vertical covariance localization would also enable the simultaneous update of entire vertical columns of model variables from hyperspectral and multispectral satellite sounders. However, if the original formulation of the ETKF were applied to an expanded ensemble, it would produce an analysis ensemble that was the same size as the expanded forecast ensemble. This article describes a variation on the ETKF called the gain ETKF (GETKF) that takes advantage of covariances from the expanded ensemble, while producing an analysis ensemble that has the required size of the unexpanded forecast ensemble. The approach also yields an inflation factor that depends on the localization length scale that causes the GETKF to perform differently to an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) using the same expanded ensemble. Experimentation described herein shows that the GETKF outperforms a range of alternative ETKF-based solutions to the aforementioned problems. In cycling data assimilation experiments with a newly developed storm-track version of the Lorenz-96 model, the GETKF analysis root-mean-square error (RMSE) matches the EnSRF RMSE at shorter than optimal localization length scales but is superior in that it yields smaller RMSEs for longer localization length scales.

TI  - Prevalence of oral anticoagulation and quality of its management in primary healthcare: A study by the Health Sentinel Network of the Region of Valencia (Spain)
T2  - ATENCION PRIMARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of patients with oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) in the Region of Valencia and to evaluate the quality of management of OAT with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) carried out in primary healthcare.Design: Observational cross-sectional study conducted through the Health Sentinel Network of the Region of Valencia, which includes a survey and the retrospective analysis of OAT monitoring.Setting: Primary healthcare, Region of Valencia, Spain.Subjects: All patients aged 18 years or older on OAT who consulted during the year 2014. The population covered by the 59 doctors of the Health Sentinel Network constitutes 2.2% of the adult population of the Region of Valencia, and it is representative of it.Key measurements: Demographic, socioeconomic and health data as well as information concerning OAT. Quality of OAT management with VKA was assessed by means of the percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR), computed using the Rosendaal method.Results: A total of 1,144 patients were recorded (mean age 74.5 +/- 11 years; 49.7% women). Prevalence of OAT in the Region of Valencia is 1.3 cases per 100 population. The characteristic profile of these patients is an old person, with several comorbidities and a low level of education, who lives accompanied. Atrial fibrillation is the most common indication. 82.8% of patients on OAT with VKA were monitored in primary healthcare. The average TTR was 65.0%, and 53.9% of patients had a TTR >= 65%. Among inadequately controlled patients, 74.4% were perceived as well-controlled by their primary care doctor.Conclusions: Prevalence of OAT is high, and it is expected to increase. The degree of control achieved meets the generally accepted quality standard (mean TTR >= 65%), and it is comparable to that observed in other national and international studies. However, there is wide scope for improvement. It is crucial to optimize the management of this therapy in the most effective and cost-effective way. Among other measures, access of physicians to their patients' clinical information should be improved. 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Iodine-125 seeds to guide removal of impalpable breast lesions: radio-guided occult lesion localization - a pilot study
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to confirm that radio-guided occult lesion localization using low activity iodine 125 (I-125) seeds (ROLLIS) could be safely and accurately used for localization and guided excision of impalpable breast lesions in different multidisciplinary settings and to prepare staff for a randomized controlled trial.MethodPreoperative image-guided localization of 102 lesions using one or two I-125 seeds with hook-wire back-up was performed in 99 participants at two tertiary hospitals. Preoperative core biopsy in 24 lesions was benign or indeterminate (Group A) and malignant in 78 lesions (Group B). Imaging and histopathology findings and re-excision rates were recorded. Training requirements for new staff and seed handling protocols were refined.ResultsAll seeds and lesions were successfully removed. In five of 23 Group A participants, malignancy on final pathology required definitive surgery for positive margins. The re-excision rate in Group B was 17%. Overall re-excision rate was 18%. Thirty-seven clinical staff members were trained. Sentinel node localization was successful in all 76 cases. Seeds of low activity were successfully used.ConclusionThe ROLLIS technique using a lower dose (approximate to 2 MBq) seed is safe, effective and can easily be adopted in a large multi-disciplinary setting.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 Radar Data for the Assessment of Soil and Cereal Cover Parameters
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to analyze the potential use of Sentinel-1 (S1) radar data for the estimation of soil characteristics (roughness and water content) and cereal vegetation parameters (leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation height (H)) in agricultural areas. Simultaneously to several radar acquisitions made between 2015 and 2017, using S1 sensors over the Kairouan Plain (Tunisia, North Africa), ground measurements of soil roughness, soil water content, LAI and H were recorded. The NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) index computed from Landsat optical images revealed a strong correlation with in situ measurements of LAI. The sensitivity of the S1 measurements to variations in soil moisture, which has been reported in several scientific publications, is confirmed in this study. This sensitivity decreases with increasing vegetation cover growth (NDVI), and is stronger in the VV (vertical) polarization than in the VH cross-polarization. The results also reveal a similar increase in the dynamic range of radar signals observed in the VV and VH polarizations as a function of soil roughness. The sensitivity of S1 measurements to vegetation parameters (LAI and H) in the VV polarization is also determined, showing that the radar signal strength decreases when the vegetation parameters increase. No vegetation parameter sensitivity is observed in the VH polarization, probably as a consequence of volume scattering effects.

TI  - Modelling size-fractionated primary production in the Atlantic Ocean from remote sensing
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine primary production influences the transfer of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the availability of energy for the pelagic food web. Both the rate and the fate of organic carbon from primary production are dependent on phytoplankton size. A key aim of the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) programme has been to quantify biological carbon cycling in the Atlantic Ocean and measurements of total primary production have been routinely made on AMT cruises, as well as additional measurements of size-fractionated primary production on some cruises. Measurements of total primary production collected on the AMT have been used to evaluate remote-sensing techniques capable of producing basin-scale estimates of primary production. Though models exist to estimate size-fractionated primary production from satellite data, these have not been well validated in the Atlantic Ocean, and have been parameterised using measurements of phytoplankton pigments rather than direct measurements of phytoplankton size structure. Here, we re-tune a remote-sensing primary production model to estimate production in three size fractions of phytoplankton (<2 mu m, 2-10 mu m and >10 mu m) in the Atlantic Ocean, using measurements of size-fractionated chlorophyll and size-fractionated photosynthesis-irradiance experiments conducted on AMT 22 and 23 using sequential filtration-based methods. The performance of the remote-sensing technique was evaluated using: (i) independent estimates of size-fractionated primary production collected on a number of AMT cruises using C-14 on-deck incubation experiments and (ii) Monte Carlo simulations. Considering uncertainty in the satellite inputs and model parameters, we estimate an average model error of between 0.27 and 0.63 for log(10)-transformed size-fractionated production, with lower errors for the small size class (<2 mu m), higher errors for the larger size classes (2-10 mu m and >10 mu m), and errors generally higher in oligotrophic waters. Application to satellite data in 2007 suggests the contribution of cells <2 mu m and >2 mu m to total primary production is approximately equal in the Atlantic Ocean. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Combining Participatory Influenza Surveillance with Modeling and Forecasting: Three Alternative Approaches.
T2  - JMIR public health and surveillance
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks affect millions of people every year and its surveillance is usually carried out in developed countries through a network of sentinel doctors who report the weekly number of Influenza-like Illness cases observed among the visited patients. Monitoring and forecasting the evolution of these outbreaks supports decision makers in designing effective interventions and allocating resources to mitigate their impact.OBJECTIVE: Describe the existing participatory surveillance approaches that have been used for modeling and forecasting of the seasonal influenza epidemic, and how they can help strengthen real-time epidemic science and provide a more rigorous understanding of epidemic conditions.METHODS: We describe three different participatory surveillance systems, WISDM (Widely Internet Sourced Distributed Monitoring), Influenzanet and Flu Near You (FNY), and show how modeling and simulation can be or has been combined with participatory disease surveillance to: i) measure the non-response bias in a participatory surveillance sample using WISDM; and ii) nowcast and forecast influenza activity in different parts of the world (using Influenzanet and Flu Near You).RESULTS: WISDM-based results measure the participatory and sample bias for three epidemic metrics i.e. attack rate, peak infection rate, and time-to-peak, and find the participatory bias to be the largest component of the total bias. The Influenzanet platform shows that digital participatory surveillance data combined with a realistic data-driven epidemiological model can provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of epidemic intensities, and the ground truth data lie within the 95 percent confidence intervals for most weeks. The statistical accuracy of the ensemble forecasts increase as the season progresses. The Flu Near You platform shows that participatory surveillance data provide accurate short-term flu activity forecasts and influenza activity predictions. The correlation of the HealthMap Flu Trends estimates with the observed CDC ILI rates is 0.99 for 2013-2015. Additional data sources lead to an error reduction of about 40% when compared to the estimates of the model that only incorporates CDC historical information.CONCLUSIONS: While the advantages of participatory surveillance, compared to traditional surveillance, include its timeliness, lower costs, and broader reach, it is limited by a lack of control over the characteristics of the population sample. Modeling and simulation can help overcome this limitation as well as provide real-time and long-term forecasting of influenza activity in data-poor parts of the world.

TI  - Editorial: "Special Focus on Holm Tetens's 'Thinking God' ('Gott denken')"
T2  - NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SYSTEMATISCHE THEOLOGIE UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In Germany, Holm Tetens is an influential analytic philosopher of science, mind, and logic. For many years he had been arguing within the widely accepted framework of naturalism and atheism. It came, to put it mildly, as a surprise to the entire philosophical community in Germany when he published a book defending theism in 2015. In this book "Thinking God" he claims that physicalism is an incomplete account of reality, because the mental and ideal realm cannot be reduced to the physical realm. As an alternative, he develops a version of theistic idealism which stands in the tradition of "panentheism". Human subjectivity is fully embedded into the all-encompassing divine subjectivity. In dealing with the problem of theodicy, he then argues that the hope for eternal life and salvation by a supremely good being makes life more meaningful, esp. because it offers a prospect for justice to the countless victims of history. To Tetens, the worldview of naturalism and the worldview of theistic idealism are on the one hand both equally rational and defensible. On the other hand, both cannot be defeated by knock-down arguments. In closing, he urges his peers in philosophy to take the question of God seriously again. Shortly after the publication of the book, the Catholic Academy of Bavaria and the Munich School of Philosophy jointly organized an international master class on Tetens's views which was taught by himself. The papers published in this issue grew out of this master class. For each paper by a young scholar there is also a reply by Tetens. The following editorial addresses specifically the German-speaking audience. It was thus not translated into English. All original papers discussing Tetens's views and his replies to these, however, were written in English for the sake of reaching a larger worldwide readership.

TI  - Theorizing spatial dynamics of metropolitan regions: A preliminary study in Java and Madura Islands, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at exploring the spatial dynamics of metropolitan regions in Java and Madura Islands, which are commonly known as the most developed areas in Indonesia. The analyses have used GIS-based and tabular data methods applying spreadsheet operations detailed at sub-district (kecamatan) level. An urban sub-district is defined as that with a built-up ratio of more than 22.5% and a population density of more than 1250 people/km2. Delineation of the built-up areas has used an unsupervised classification of 741-bands of Landsat TM7 satellite imageries for the years of 1990 and 2011. The potential sprawl is based on the comparison between the rate of population growth and that of built-up areas. The results show that generally, built-up areas significantly grow on the fringe zones of Java big cities. In metropolitan regions, an indication of non-compact growth occurs, albeit agricultural activities are still dominant there. Sprawl is found to be more in rural and outer than suburban and inner peripheral areas. In this regard, local governments should pay more attention to this issue because it can endanger the food security and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Nonlinear bias compensation of ZiYuan-3 satellite imagery with cubic splines
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many high-resolution satellites such as the ALOS, MOMS-2P, QuickBird, and ZiYuan1-02C satellites, the ZiYuan-3 satellite suffers from different levels of attitude oscillations. As a result of such oscillations, the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) obtained using a terrain-independent scenario often have nonlinear biases. In the sensor orientation of ZiYuan-3 imagery based on a rational function model (RFM), these nonlinear biases cannot be effectively compensated by an affine transformation. The sensor orientation accuracy is thereby worse than expected. In order to eliminate the influence of attitude oscillations on the RFM-based sensor orientation, a feasible nonlinear bias compensation approach for ZiYuan-3 imagery with cubic splines is proposed. In this approach, no actual ground control points (GCPs) are required to determine the cubic splines. First, the RPCs are calculated using a three-dimensional virtual control grid generated based on a physical sensor model. Second, one cubic spline is used to model the residual errors of the virtual control points in the row direction and another cubic spline is used to model the residual errors in the column direction. Then, the estimated cubic splines are used to compensate the nonlinear biases in the RPCs. Finally, the affine transformation parameters are used to compensate the residual biases in the RPCs. Three ZiYuan-3 images were tested. The experimental results showed that before the nonlinear bias compensation, the residual errors of the independent check points were nonlinearly biased. Even if the number of GCPs used to determine the affine transformation parameters was increased from 4 to 16, these nonlinear biases could not be effectively compensated. After the nonlinear bias compensation with the estimated cubic splines, the influence of the attitude oscillations could be eliminated. The RFM-based sensor orientation accuracies of the three ZiYuan-3 images reached 0.981 pixels, 0.890 pixels, and 1.093 pixels, which were respectively 42.1%, 48.3%, and 54.8% better than those achieved before the nonlinear bias compensation.

TI  - Airborne DInSAR Results Using Time-Domain Backprojection Algorithm: A Case Study Over the Slumgullion Landslide in Colorado With Validation Using Spaceborne SAR, Airborne LiDAR, and Ground-Based Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The major impediment to accurate airborne repeat-pass differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) is compensating for aircraft motion caused by air turbulence. Various motion compensation (MoCo) procedures have been used in the airborne DInSAR processing to acquire reliable deformation mapping. In this paper, we present the use of time-domain backprojection (BP) algorithm for SAR focusing in an airborne DInSAR survey: No MoCo procedure is needed because the BP algorithm is inherently able to compensate for platform motion. In this study, we present the results of a pilot study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of deformation mapping with an airborne SAR system based on the monitoring of the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA between July 3 and 10 of 2015. The employed airborne SAR system is an Artemis SlimSAR that is a compact, modular, and multi-frequency radar system. Airborne light detection and ranging and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations, as well as spaceborne DInSAR results using COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images, were used to verify the performance of the airborne SAR system. The surface velocities of the landslide derived from the airborne DInSAR observations showed good agreement with the GNSS and spaceborne DInSAR estimates. A three-dimensional deformation map of the Slumgullion landslide was also generated, which displayed distinct correlation between the landslide motion and topographic variation. This study shows that an inexpensive airborne L-band DInSAR system has the potential to measure centimeter level deformation with flexible temporal and spatial baselines.

TI  - Observed long-term greening of alpine vegetation-a case study in the French Alps
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We combined imagery from multiple sources (MODIS, Landsat-5, 7, 8) with land cover data to test for long-term (1984-2015) greening or browning trends of vegetation in a temperate alpine area, the Ecrins National Park, in the context of recent climate change and domestic grazing practices. We showed that over half (56%) of the Ecrins National Park displayed significant increases in peak normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImax) over the last 16 years (2000-2015). Importantly, the highest proportional increases in NDVImax occurred in rocky habitats at high elevations (> 2500 ma.s.l.). While spatial agreement in the direction of change in NDVImax as detected by MODIS and Landsat was high (76% overlap), correlations between log-response ratio values were of moderate strength (approx. 0.3). In the context of above treeline habitats, we found that proportional increases in NDVImax were higher between 1984 and 2000 than between 2000 and 2015, suggesting a slowing of greening dynamics during the recent decade. The timing of accelerated greening prior to 2000 coincided with a pronounced increase in the amount of snow-free growing degree-days that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. In the case of grasslands and low-shrub habitats, we did not find evidence for a negative effect of grazing on greening trends, possibly due to the low grazing intensity typically found in the study area. We propose that the emergence of a longer and warmer growing season enabled high-elevation plant communities to produce more biomass, and also allowed for plant colonization of habitats previously characterized by long-lasting snow cover. Increasing plant productivity in an alpine context has potential implications for biodiversity trajectories and for ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. The presented evidence for long-term greening trends in a representative region of the European Alps provides the basis for further research on mechanisms of greening in alpine landscapes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of sea surface temperature in Irish waters (1982-2015) using AVHRR sensor
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal and spatial variability of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), a key variable linked to climate change, was analysed using a continuous 34-year time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data (1982-2015). The climatological analysis showed a significant latitudinal SST gradient waters were warmer in the south and colder in the north. A seasonal effect was evident, with lowest SST values in March and highest SST in August. Results suggest that the temporal and spatial variability in Irish waters is mainly related to the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the warming from anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Overall, the warming trend was significant (p-value of <= 0.05) and positive (0.26 degrees C decade(-1)) for the whole study area. However, this trend was not spatially homogeneous and varied between the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) Divisions, having the most significant positive trends in the north (VIa, VIb, VIIb and VIIc) and east (VIId and VIIe). Seasonal SST trends were similar to the annual trends but warming was more intense in the autumn.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine abuse prevalence for OxyContin and comparator opioids over a 6-year period prior to and following market entry of reformulated OxyContin and assess consistency in abuse across treatment settings and geographic regions.DESIGN: An observational study examining longitudinal changes using cross-sectional data from treatment centers for substance use disorder.SETTING: A total of 874 facilities in 39 states in the United States within the National Addictions Vigilance Intervention and Prevention Program (NAVIPPRO) surveillance system.PARTICIPANTS: Adults (72,060) assessed for drug problems using the Addiction Severity Index-Multimedia Version (ASI-MV) from January 2009 through December 2015 who abused prescription opioids.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Percent change in past 30-day abuse.RESULTS: OxyContin had significantly lower abuse 5 years after reformulation compared to levels for original OxyContin. Consistency of magnitude in OxyContin abuse reductions across geographic regions, ranging from 41 to 52 percent with differences in abuse reductions in treatment setting categories occurred. Changes in geographic region and treatment settings across study years did not bias the estimate of lower OxyContin abuse through confounding.CONCLUSION: In the postmarket setting, limitations and methodologic challenges in abuse measurement exist and it is difficult to isolate singular impacts of any one intervention given the complexity of prescription opioid abuse. Expectations for a reasonable threshold of abuse for any one ADF product or ADF opioids as a class are still uncertain and undefined. A significant decline in abuse prevalence of reformulated OxyContin was observed 5 years after its reformulation among this treatment sample of individuals assessed for substance use disorder that was lower historically for the original formulation of this product.

TI  - Submesoscale Sea Surface Temperature Variability from UAV and Satellite Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earlier studies of spatial variability in sea surface temperature (SST) using ship-based radiometric data suggested that variability at scales smaller than 1 km is significant and affects the perceived uncertainty of satellite-derived SSTs. Here, we compare data from the Ball Experimental Sea Surface Temperature (BESST) thermal infrared radiometer flown over the Arctic Ocean against coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements to assess the spatial variability of skin SSTs within 1-km pixels. By taking the standard deviation, sigma, of the BESST measurements within individual MODIS pixels, we show that significant spatial variability of the skin temperature exists. The distribution of the surface variability measured by BESST shows a peak value of O(0.1) K, with 95% of the pixels showing sigma < 0.45 K. Significantly, high-variability pixels are located at density fronts in the marginal ice zone, which are a primary source of submesoscale intermittency near the surface. SST wavenumber spectra indicate a spectral slope of -2, which is consistent with the presence of submesoscale processes at the ocean surface. Furthermore, the BESST wavenumber spectra not only match the energy distribution of MODIS SST spectra at the satellite-resolved wavelengths, they also span the spectral slope of -2 by -3 decades, from wavelengths of 8 km to < 0.08 km.

TI  - Spectral-temporal characterization of wheat cultivars through NDVI obtained by terrestrial sensors
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing applications in agriculture are presented as a very promising reality, but research is still needed for the correct use of spectral data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spectral-temporal patterns of eleven wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.). The experiment was conducted in Cascavel, PR, in the year 2014. With the help of the GreenSeeker and FieldSpec 4 terrestrial sensors, spectral signatures were determined and the temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were created. Statistical differences between wheat cultivars were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scott-Knott test. Grain yields obtained with INSEY (In-Season Estimate of Yield) factors were correlated. NDVI normalized by degree-days accumulated from the Feekes growth stages 2 and 8 showed to be more consistent in the estimation of grain yield, explaining approximately 70% of the variation. At the Feekes stage 10.1, wheat cultivars presented different spectral patterns in the near and medium infrared bands. This suggests that these spectral bands can be used to differentiate wheat cultivars.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Surface Temperature from MODIS Data in Coastal Waters
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of sea surface temperature retrieved from remote images is a fundamental need for monitoring ocean and coastal waters. This study proposes a method for retrieving accurate measurements of SST in coastal waters. The method involves the estimation of effect of total suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration on the value of sea surface emissivity (SSE) and the inclusion of this effect in SSE value that is put into SST calculation. Data collected in three Italian coastal waters were exploited to obtain SSTskin and SSE values and to analyze SPM effects on SSE value. The method was tested on MODIS images. Satellite measurements of SST obtained with current operational algorithm, which does not require SSE value as explicit input, were compared with in situ values of SSTskin and RMSD is equal to 1.13 K. Moreover, SST data were retrieved with an algorithm for retrieving SST measurements from MODIS data, which allows the inclusion of SSE value with SPM effect. These data were compared with in situ values of SSTskin, and RMSD is equal to 0.68 K.

TI  - Satellite-based forecasts for seeing and photometric quality at the European Extremely Large Telescope site
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we describe a new algorithm for short-time satellite-based forecasts for seeing and photometric quality at the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) site (Armazones) and we analyse the correlation between the Paranal and Armazones sites. The algorithm uses data from the polar satellite Aqua's ModerateResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES 13). We have analysed 13 years (2003-2015) of cloud coverage data from MODIS in order to obtain the cyclical perturbations through Fourier analysis. Then we have developed the forecast model using GOES 13 d data (2015). Monthly calibration atmospheric-layer temperature thresholds have been achieved through the daily temperature range detected by the satellite. The algorithm works through conditional probability. This allowed us to extrapolate the main frequency of the cloud-coverage perturbations, achieving three results: there are two major seasonal meteorological frequencies at Armazones and a short one of 14 days. This result allows us to improve the rate of the prediction algorithm by introducing a new threshold function. The correlation of 98 per cent found between the pixel above Paranal and the pixel above Armazones allows us to use the Paranal ground data to validate the prediction model. We analysed the 2015 data at Armazones and reached a correlation of 97 per cent for the short-time photometry and seeing quality forecast.

TI  - Learner Characteristics and Understanding Nature of Science Is There an Association?
T2  - SCIENCE & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible associations between preservice science teachers' understanding of nature of science and their learner characteristics; understanding of nature of scientific inquiry, science teaching self-efficacy beliefs, metacognitive awareness level, and faith/worldview schemas. The sample of the current study was 60 3rd-year preservice science teachers enrolled in the Nature of Science and History of Science course. Using a descriptive and associational case study design, data were collected by means of different qualitative and quantitative questionnaires. Analysis of the data revealed that preservice science teachers' understanding of nature of science and nature of scientific inquiry were highly associated. Similarly, science teaching self-efficacy beliefs, metacognitive awareness levels, and faith/worldviews of the preservice science teachers were found to be significantly associated with their understanding of nature of science. Thus, it can be concluded that there might be other factors interfering with the learning processes of nature of science.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS BRDF/Albedo Model Parameters (MCD43A1 Collection 6) for Directional Reflectance Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of solar radiation reflected from Earth's surface are the basis for calculating albedo, vegetation indices, and other terrestrial attributes. However, the bi-directional geometry of illumination and viewing (i.e., the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)) impacts reflectance and all variables derived or estimated based on these data. The recently released MODIS BRDF/Albedo Model Parameters (MCD43A1 Collection 6) dataset enables retrieval of directional reflectance at arbitrary solar and viewing angles, potentially increasing precision and comparability of data collected under different illumination and observation geometries. We quantified the ability of MCD43A1 Collection 6 for retrieving directional reflectance and compared the daily Collection 6 retrievals to those of MCD43A1 Collection 5, which are retrieved on an eight-day basis. Correcting MODIS-based estimates of surface reflectance from the illumination and viewing geometry of the Terra satellite (MOD09GA) to that of the MODIS Aqua (MYD09GA) overpass, as well as MCD43A4 Collection 6 and Landsat-5 TM images show that the BRDF correction of MCD43A1 Collection 6 results in greater consistency among datasets, with higher R-2 (0.63-0.955), regression slopes closer to unity (0.718-0.955), lower root mean squared difference (RMSD) (0.422-3.142), and lower mean absolute error (MAE) (0.282-1.735) compared to the Collection 5 data. Smaller levels of noise (observed as high-frequency variability within the time series) in MCD43A1 Collection 6 in comparison to Collection 5 corroborates the improvement of BRDF parameters time series. These results corroborates that the daily MCD43A1 Collection 6 product represents the anisotropy of surface features and results in more precise directional reflectance derivation at any solar and viewing geometry than did the previous Collection 5.

TI  - Region-wide glacier mass budgets for the Tanggula Mountains between ∼1969 and ∼2015 derived from remote sensing data
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal changes in the properties of glaciers located on the central Tibetan Plateau are a sensitive indicator of climate change and the water supply. To estimate the region-wide glacier budgets for three study sites covering the region extending from West-Geladandong to Bugyai Kangri, we compared 1968/1969 topographic maps, the 2000 SRTM DEM, and recent ASTER DEMs for glacier mass budget calculations. Between similar to 1969 and similar to 2015, the specific mass budget was -0.31 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) for the entire Tanggula Mountains, which is lower than the global average. This ongoing mass loss is mainly caused by increasing summer temperatures since the 1960s. Heterogeneous glacier behavior can be explained by a combination of factors, including meteorological conditions, proglacial lakes, and surge-type glaciers.

TI  - On-Orbit Characterization of the MODIS SDSM Screen for Solar Diffuser Degradation Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflective solar bands (RSBs) are calibrated on-orbit using a solar diffuser (SD) with its degradation tracked by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). The SDSM has nine detectors with wavelengths from 0.41 to 0.94 mu m. It is operated during each scheduled SD calibration event, making alternate observations of the sun and the SD. Due to erroneous design parameters, which led to the misalignment of the key elements in the SDSM, there are significant ripples in the sun view responses as the solar viewing angle changes. At the mission beginning, the effect of the ripples was eliminated by normalizing each SDSM detector response to the response of detector 9 (D9) at 0.94 mu m, assuming that D9 had no degradation. However, D9 degradation increases over MODIS operation times. Degradation of up to 2% has recently been observed in D9 for the Terra MODIS. A newly implemented approach reduces the sun view ripples using a lookup table constructed using SDSM data carefully selected from a short period early in the mission lifetime. In this paper, we provide an overview of different approaches that have been applied over the years by the MODIS Characterization Support Team to track the on-orbit SD degradation. We evaluate the overall SD and SDSM on-orbit performance for both Terra and Aqua MODIS, as well as the impact on the MODIS RSB calibration uncertainty.

TI  - The Temporal and Spatial Variability of the Confined Aquifer Head and Storage Properties in the San Luis Valley, Colorado Inferred From Multiple InSAR Missions
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from multiple satellite missions were combined to study the temporal and spatial variability of head and storage properties in a confined aquifer system on a decadal time scale. The area of study was a 4,500 km(2) agricultural basin in the San Luis Valley (SLV), Colorado. We had available previous analyses of C-band ERS-1/2 data from June 1992 to November 2000, and L-band ALOS PALSAR data from October 2009 to March 2011. We used C-band Envisat data to fill in the time period from November 2006 to July 2010. In processing the Envisat data, we successfully employed a phase interpolation between persistent scatterer pixels to reduce the impact of vegetation decorrelation, which can significantly reduce the quality of C-band InSAR data over agricultural basins. In comparing the results from the L-band ALOS data and C-band Envisat data in a 10 month overlapping time period, we found that the shorter wavelength of C-band InSAR allowed us to preserve small deformation signals that were not detectable using L-band ALOS data. A significant result was the finding that the elastic storage properties of the SLV confined aquifer system remained stable over the 20 year time period and vary slowly in space, allowing us to combine InSAR data acquired from multiple missions to fill the temporal and spatial gaps in well data. The InSAR estimated head levels were validated with well measurements, which indicate little permanent water-storage loss over the study time period in the SLV.

TI  - An Attitude Jitter Correction Method for Multispectral Parallax Imagery Based on Compressive Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Attitude jitter is a common problem for high-resolution earth-observation satellites and can diminish the geo-positioning and mapping performance of observed images. It is especially necessary to address this problem when high-performance attitude measurements are unavailable. Therefore, an attitude jitter correction method for multispectral parallax imagery that utilizes the compressive-sensing technology is proposed in this letter. In the proposed method, the attitude jitter is estimated from the parallax disparities of different band images, and then the image displacement caused by attitude jitter can be corrected. Using the normalized cross correlation method and compressive-sensing technology, the proposed method can deal with the condition of texture-feature deficiency in the partial image. The multispectral images of the Terra and ZY-3 satellites are used as experimental data to evaluate the proposed method. The registration errors of different bands are greatly reduced in both the cross- and along-track directions, and the experiment results indicate that the proposed method is effective for correcting the attitude jitter of both satellites.

TI  - Deriving colored dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient from ocean color with a neural quasi-analytical algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to develop an approach to estimate the gelbstoff absorption coefficient (a(g)) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). This approach includes two components: the inherent optical properties are semianalytically derived from the R-rs by a neural quasianalytical algorithm (NQAA), and then the derivations are semianalytically extended to a(g) estimations using a band difference approach. This method is then evaluated with the various type of ocean color data including synthetic, field measured, and satellite-observed data. The results show that the method can produce an excellent quantitative agreement between the estimated and known a(g) in ocean waters with a wide range of optical properties, while significantly reducing the effects of residual error in SeaWiFS R-rs, primarily from the imperfect atmospheric correction algorithm on the retrieval of a(g) in the clear open oceans. Furthermore, with the application of this new algorithm, the SeaWiFS a(g) products exhibit more spatially and temporally uniform results than the band ratio approach-based a(g) retrieval algorithm. These results indicate that the new algorithm is an encouraging approach to process ocean color images for a(g) retrieval, although a greater number of independent tests with in situ and satellite data are required to further validate and improve this approach.

TI  - Parameterizing Anthropogenic Heat Flux with an Energy-Consumption Inventory and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities is an important factor affecting the urban climate. Thus, refined AH parameterization of a large area can provide data support for regional meteorological research. In this study, we developed a refined anthropogenic heat flux (RAHF) parameterization scheme to estimate the gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF). Firstly, the annual total AH emissions and annual mean AHF of Beijing municipality in the year 2015 were estimated using a top-down, energy-consumption inventory method, which was derived based on socioeconomic statistics and energy consumption data. The heat released from industry, transportation, buildings (including both commercial and residential buildings), and human metabolism were taken into account. Then, the county-scale AHF estimation model was constructed based on multi-source remote sensing data, such as Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (Suomi-NPP) visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) nighttime light (NTL) data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. This model was applied to estimate the annual mean AHF of the counties in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Finally, the gridded AHF data with 500-m resolution was obtained using a RAHF parameterization scheme. The results indicate that the annual total AH emissions of Beijing municipality in the year 2015 was approximately 1.704 x 10(18) J. Of this, the buildings contribute about 34.5%, followed by transportation and industry with about 30.5% and 30.1%, respectively, and human metabolism with only about 4.9%. The annual mean AHF value of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is about 6.07 Wm(-2), and the AHF in urban areas is about in the range of 20 Wm(-2) and 130 Wm(-2). The maximum AHF value is approximately 130.84 Wm(-2), mostly in airports, railway stations, central business districts, and other densely-populated areas. The error analysis of the county-scale AHF results showed that the residual between the model estimation and energy consumption statistics is less than 1%. In addition, the spatial distribution of RAHF results is generally centered on urban area and gradually decreases towards suburbs. The spatial pattern of the RAHF results within urban areas corresponds well to the distribution of population density, building density, and the industrial district. The spatial heterogeneity of AHF within urban areas is well-reflected through the RAHF results. The RAHF results can be used in meteorological and environmental modeling for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The results of this study also highlight the superiority of Suomi-NPP VIIRS NTL data for AHF estimation.

TI  - Estimating sea surface salinity in the northern Gulf of Mexico from satellite ocean color measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes, yet its remote estimation in coastal waters has been difficult because satellite sensors designed to "measure" SSS lack sufficient resolution and coverage, and higher-resolution ocean color measurements suffer from optical and biogeochemical complexity when used to estimate SSS. In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through modeling, validation, and extensive tests in contrasting environments. Specifically, using extensive SSS datasets collected by many groups spanning > 10 years and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) estimated remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 412, 443, 488 (490), 555, and 667 (670) nm and sea surface temperature (SST), a multilayer perceptron neural network-based (MPNN) SSS model has been developed and validated with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The MPNN was selected over many other empirical approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), decision tree, random forest, and supporting vector machines (SVMs) after extensive evaluations. The MPNN was trained by a back-propagation learning technique with LevenbergMarquardt optimization and Bayesian regularization. The model showed an overall performance of root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.2, with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.86, mean bias (MB) = 0.0, and mean ratio (MR) = 1.0 for SSS ranging between 1 and 37 (N = 3640). Validation using an independent dataset showed a RMSE of 1.1, MB of 0.0, and MR of 1.0 for SSS ranging between 27 and 37 (N = 412). The model with its original parameterization has been tested in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya coastal region, Florida's Big Bend region, and in the offshore Mississippi River plume, with satisfactory performance obtained in each case. Comparison with concurrent Aquarius-derived SSS maps (110-km resolution) showed similar agreement in offshore waters as indicated above, but the new 1-km resolution SSS maps revealed more finer-scale features as well as salinity gradients in coastal waters. The sensitivity of the model to realistic model input errors in satellite derived SST and Rrs was also thoroughly examined, with uncertainties in the model-derived SSS being always < 1 for SSS > 30. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity test all indicated the robustness of the MPNN model in estimating SSS in most, if not all, coastal waters and offshore plumes in the northern GOM. Thus, the model provided a basis for generating near real-time 1-km resolution SSS maps from satellite measurements. However, the model showed limitations when applied to regions with known algal blooms or up welling as they both led to low Rrs in the blue bands that may be falsely recognized as caused by low SSS.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of carbon sequestration reduction induced by disturbances in temperate Eurasian steppe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperate Eurasian steppe (TES) is a region where various environmental, social, and economic stresses converge. Multiple types of disturbance exist widely across the landscape, and heavily influence carbon cycling in this region. However, a current quantitative assessment of the impact of disturbances on carbon sequestration is largely lacking. In this study, we combined the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS), the Shiyomi grazing model, and the global fire model (Glob-FIRM) to investigate the impact of the two major types of disturbance in the TES (i.e. domestic grazing and fire) on regional carbon sequestration. Model performance was validated using satellite data and field observations. Model outputs indicate that disturbance has a significant impact on carbon sequestration at a regional scale. The annual total carbon lost due to disturbances was 7.8 TgCyr(-1), accounting for 14.2% of the total net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Domestic grazing plays the dominant role in terrestrial carbon consumption, accounting for 95% of the total carbon lost from the two disturbances. Carbon losses from both disturbances significantly increased from 1999 to 2008 (R-2 = 0.82, P < 0.001 for grazing, R-2 = 0.51, P < 0.05 for fire). Heavy domestic grazing in relatively barren grasslands substantially reduced carbon sequestration, particularly in the grasslands of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the far southwest of Inner Mongolia. This spatially-explicit information has potential implications for sustainable management of carbon sequestration in the vast grassland ecosystems.

TI  - False Negative Rate of the Highest Radioactive Count of Sentinel Lymph Node in Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary staging in women with breast cancer had changed drastically since the concept of sentinel lymph node was introduced. Sentinel lymph node biopsy caused significantly less morbidity than axillary lymph node dissection. The number of nodes removed are variable. However, removing more nodes results in a higher complication rate. If the lymph node with the highest radiologic count could be used to represent the entire group of sentinel nodes then we might be able to limit the number of nodes removed.Objective: The present study was conducted to find the false negative rate of the sentinel lymph node with various radiologic count in early breast cancer patients.Material and Method: Women with early stage breast cancer and clinically node negative who had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy in the breast and endocrine surgery unit of Ramathibodi Hospital between July 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015 were recruited. Radiologic count of each sentinel nodes was documented and the false negative rate of the sentinel node with the highest radiologic count was calculated. False negative rate is defined as the rate of nodal metastasis in lymph nodes other than the node with the highest radiologic count.Results: One hundred thirty sentinel lymph node biopsies were performed. Of this, 39 women had sentinel lymph node metastasis. The false negative rate of the node with the highest radiologic count is 17.9%. The false negative rate was reduced to 7.7% if we included the second and third highest nodes.Conclusion: Removal of only the sentinel node with the highest radiologic count has an unacceptably high false negative rate. This can be improved by removing the second and third highest nodes.

TI  - Surgical Staging of the Axilla: Is It on Its Way Out? A Retrospective Study and Review of the Literature
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has long been the mode of staging of the axilla in invasive breast cancer. We studied the incidence of axillary disease in patients with ultrasound negative axilla in a selected group of patients. We noted that the false negative rate of axillary ultrasound and SLNB was comparable in a subset of early breast cancer patients.Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the reference standard for axillary staging in all patients with invasive breast cancer. Surgical practices are being reviewed for a more conservative approach to the axilla. Patients and Methods: In this audit, we studied the incidence of axillary disease in patients with ultrasound negative axilla. The selection criteria are similar to an ongoing national study: female patients, age > 50 years, primary breast lesion < 1.5 cm in size, and estrogen receptorepositive and HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-negative disease. We studied the data of all breast cancer patients, January 2013 to December 2015, in a population of 350,000 with annual incidence of about 400 cancers. Results: In our patient subset, we studied a total of 261 patients. The average false-negative (FN) rate with axillary ultrasound (AUS) per year was noted to be 10.7% (P = .0052). This is comparable to SLNB, which has a FN rate of approximately 10%. The sensitivity of AUS to exclude axillary disease was 89.3% (95% confidence interval, 84.9-92.3). Conclusion: Because the FN rate of AUS and SLNB are comparable, the former can possibly replace the latter, at least in a subset of early breast cancer patients. This finding has wide implications.

T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper has presented a study of the dependence of the H+ ions concentration in the plasmasphere on geographic longitude. A vast database of measurements of the cold plasma density by the Alpha-3 instrument on board the INTERBALL-1 satellite has been used for the study. Based on these measurements, a dependence of the H+ ions concentration in the filled magnetic flux tube in the plasmasphere in the equatorial plane under quiet geomagnetic conditions has been obtained as a function of geographic longitude. Studies have been performed for two seasons, summer and winter. It has been shown that, during the summer in the near-midnight sector, the minimum in the H+ concentration falls within geographic longitudes of 270A degrees-315A degrees. The ratio of the concentration of H+ ions at various longitudes could reach a factor of three. During the winter, in the near-noon sector, the maximum of the H+ ions concentration falls within longitudes of 180A degrees-225A degrees, whereas the concentration ratio could reach a factor of 2.2.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of SMAP Soil Moisture Using MODIS Land Surface Temperature and NDVI During SMAPVEX15
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission provides a global surface soil moisture (SM) product at 36-km resolution from its L-band radiometer. While the coarse resolution is satisfactory to many applications, there are also a lot of applications which would benefit from a higher resolution SM product. The SMAP radiometer-based SM product was downscaled to 1 km using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and validated against airborne data from the Passive Active L-band System instrument. The downscaling approach uses MODIS land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index to construct soil evaporative efficiency, which is used to downscale the SMAP SM. The algorithm was applied to one SMAP pixel during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15) in a semiarid study area for validation of the approach. SMAPVEX15 offers a unique data set for testing SM downscaling algorithms. The results indicated reasonable skill (root-mean-square difference of 0.053 m(3)/m(3) for 1-km resolution and 0.037 m(3)/m(3) for 3-km resolution) in resolving high-resolution SM features within the coarse-scale pixel. The success benefits from the fact that the surface temperature in this region is controlled by soil evaporation, the topographical variation within the chosen pixel area is relatively moderate, and the vegetation density is relatively low over most parts of the pixel. The analysis showed that the combination of the SMAP and MODIS data under these conditions can result in a high-resolution SM product with an accuracy suitable for many applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal multiresolution modeling to infill missing areal data and enhance the temporal frequency of infrared satellite images
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution environmental observations from satellite remote sensing are useful for gaining insight into climate variability over large regions of the earth. However, data products derived from infrared remote sensing can have large amounts of missing data due to periodic cloud cover obscuring the earth's surface. In addition, these products are commonly derived from instruments aboard polar-orbiting satellites, which make relatively infrequent passes over each region of the planet, leaving large blocks of data that are missing in time. The goal of this research is to overcome these issues by spatially and temporally infilling temperature data using satellite observations. To accomplish this, we propose novel statistical modeling techniques to account for dissonance between the areal spatial support of the data and the continuous temporal domain. In addition, we develop a novel multiresolution approach that accommodates the large spatial dimensionality of high-resolution satellite images. The result of our work is a computationally efficient methodology that provides the means to infill satellite data products both spatially and temporally. The methodology is demonstrated using land surface temperature fields from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, over Harris County, Texas, USA.

TI  - Estimation and spatial distribution of aboveground carbon storage for natural <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> var. <i>mongolica</i> forests on sandy land
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of carbon storage and carbon density of a single category of forest is an important basis for studying regional forest carbon storage. Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (MP) natural forests were selected as the object of this study, and a new method for estimating MP stand structure was established based on the combination of inventory data, ground survey data and multi-source remote sensing data. Based on the method, we estimated the carbon storage and carbon density of MP forests in the natural concentrated distribution region (the region of Honghuaerji Forestry Bureau under the jurisdiction of Inner Mongolia). Finally, the topographic features of carbon storage and carbon density of MP forests were discussed in combination with topographic features. The results showed that there was a significant linear relationship between diameter at breast height and Tasseled Cap Greenness of Landsat-8 OLI. The area of the natural MP forests in the study region was 70923.30 hm(2) in 2016, the aboveground (stem, branch and leaf) carbon storage was 3.91 Tg C, and average carbon density was 55.18 t.hm(-2)(10.26-148.75 t.hm(-2)). Influenced by human interference and natural elements, the carbon storage and carbon density increased first and then decreased with increasing altitude, whereas it decreased with increasing slope. The maximum carbon density occurred on the sunny slope and the minimum value was located on the shade slope due to the heliophilous characteristics for the MP. According to the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon storage and carbon density, subregion-specific management can significantly improve carbon sink.

TI  - Assessing Crop Coefficients for Natural Vegetated Areas Using Satellite Data and Eddy Covariance Stations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) method for potential evapotranspiration assessment is based on the crop coefficient, which allows one to relate the reference evapotranspiration of well irrigated grass to the potential evapotranspiration of specific crops. The method was originally developed for cultivated species based on lysimeter measurements of potential evapotranspiration. Not many applications to natural vegetated areas exist due to the lack of available data for these species. In this paper we investigate the potential of using evapotranspiration measurements acquired by micrometeorological stations for the definition of crop coefficient functions of natural vegetated areas and extrapolation to ungauged sites through remotely sensed data. Pastures, deciduous and evergreen forests have been considered and lower crop coefficient values are found with respect to FAO data.

TI  - Sentinel-3 coverage-driven mission design: Coupling of orbit selection and instrument design
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The first satellite of the Sentinel-3 series was launched in February 2016. Sentinel-3 payload suite encompasses the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) with a swath of 1270 km, the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) yielding a dual-view scan with swaths of 1420 km (nadir) and 750 km (oblique view), the Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) working in Ku-band and C-band, and the dual-frequency Microwave Radiometer (MWR).In the early stages of mission and system design, the main driver for the Sentinel-3 reference orbit selection was the requirement to achieve a revisit time of two days or less globally over ocean areas with two satellites (i.e. 4 day global coverage with one satellite). The orbit selection was seamlessly coupled with the OLCI instrument design in terms of field of view (FoV) definition driven by the observation zenith angle (OZA) and sunglint constraints applied to ocean observations. The criticality of the global coverage requirement for ocean monitoring derives from the sunglint phenomenon, i.e. the impact on visible channels of the solar ray reflection on the water surface. This constraint was finally overcome thanks to the concurrent optimisation of the orbit parameters, notably the Local Time at Descending Node (LTDN), and the OLCI instrument FoV definition.The orbit selection process started with the identification of orbits with short repeat cycle (2-4 days), firstly to minimise the time required to achieve global coverage with existing constraints, and then to minimise the swath required to obtain global coverage and the maximum required OZA. This step yielded the selection of a 4-day repeat cycle orbit, thus allowing 2-day coverage with two adequately spaced satellites. Then suitable candidate orbits with higher repeat cycles were identified in the proximity of the selected altitudes and the reference orbit was ultimately chosen. Rationale was to keep the swath for global coverage as close as possible to the previous optimum value, but to tailor the repeat cycle length (i.e. the ground-track grid) to optimise the topography mission performances. The final choice converged on the sun-synchronous orbit 14 + 7/27, reference altitude similar to 800 km, LTDN = 10h00.Extensive coverage analyses were carried out to characterise the mission performance and the fulfilment of the requirements, encompassing revisit time, number of acquisitions, observation viewing geometry and swath properties. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Sentinel-3 orbit selection, starting from coverage requirements and highlighting the close interaction with the instrument design activity.

TI  - Using foliar spectral properties to assess the effects of drought on plant water potential
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought frequency is predicted to increase in future environments. Leaf water potential (Psi(LW)) is commonly used to evaluate plant water status, but traditional measurements can be logistically difficult and require destructive sampling. We used reflectance spectroscopy to characterize variation in Psi(LW) of Quercus oleoides Schltdl. & Cham. under differential water availability and tested the ability to predict pre-dawn Psi(LW) (PD Psi(LW)) using spectral data collected hours after pressure chamber measurements on dark-acclimated leaves. Psi(LW) was measured with a Scholander pressure chamber. Leaf reflectance was collected at one or both of two time points: immediately (Psi(LW)) and similar to 5 h after pressure chamber measurements (PD Psi(LW)). Predictive models were constructed using partial least-squares regression. Model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and the percent RMSE of the data range (% RMSE). Psi(LW) and PD Psi(LW) were well predicted using spectroscopic models and successfully estimated a wide variation in Psi(LW) (light-or dark-acclimated leaves) as well as PD.LW (dark-acclimated leaves only). Mean Psi(LW) R-2, RMSE and bias values were 0.65, 0.51 MPa and 0.09, respectively, with a % RMSE between 8% and 20%, while mean PD Psi(LW) R-2, RMSE and bias values were 0.60, 0.44 MPa and 0.01, respectively, with a % RMSE between 9% and 20%. Estimates of PD Psi(LW) produced similar statistical outcomes when analyzing treatment effects on PD Psi(LW) as those found using reference pressure chamber measurements. These findings highlight a promising approach to evaluate plant responses to environmental change by providing rapid measurements that can be used to estimate plant water status as well as demonstrating that spectroscopic measurements can be used as a surrogate for standard, reference measurements in a statistical framework.

TI  - Secondary node analysis as an indicator for axillary lymphadenectomy in breast cancer patients
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Currently, there is no agreement regarding if it would be necessary to perform an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients who have macrometastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). We studied the utility of the secondary node analysis (SN), defined as the following node after the SLN in an anatomical and lymphatic pathway, as a sign of malignant axillary involvement.Methods: An observational, retrospective and multicentre study was designed to assess the utility of the SN as a sign of axillary involvement. Among 2273 patients with breast cancer, a valid sample of 283 was obtained representing those who had the SN studied. Main end-points of our study were: the SLN, the SN and the ALND histological pattern. Sensitivity, specificity and precision of the test were also calculated.Results: SN test, in cases with positive SLN, has a sensitivity of 61.1%, a specificity of 78.7%, a positive predictive value of 45.8% and a negative predictive value of 87.3% with a precision of 74.7%.Conclusion: The study of the SN together with the technique of the SLN allows a more precise staging of the axillary involvement, in patients with breast cancer, than just the SLN technique.

TI  - A pilot study to assess near infrared laparoscopy with indocyanine green (ICG) for intraoperative sentinel lymph node mapping in early colon cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous attempts at sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in colon cancer have been compromised by ineffective tracers and the inclusion of advanced disease. This study evaluated the feasibility of fluorescence detection of SLNs with indocyanine green (ICG) for lymphatic mapping in T1/T2 clinically staged colonic malignancy.Methods: Consecutive patients with clinical Tl/T2 stage colon cancer underwent endoscopic peritumoral submucosal injection of indocyanine green (ICG) for fluorescence detection of SLN using a near-infrared (NIR) camera. All patients underwent laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision surgery. Detection rate and sensitivity of the NIR-ICG technique were the study endpoints.Results: Thirty patients mean age = 68 years [range = 38-80], mean BMI = 26.2 (IQR = 24.7-28.6) were studied. Mesocolic sentinel nodes (median = 3/patient) were detected by fluorescence within the standard resection field in 27/30 patients. Overall, ten patients had lymph node metastases, with one of these patients having a failed SLN procedure. Of the 27 patients with completed SLN mapping, nine patients had histologically positive lymph nodes containing malignancy. 3/9 had positive SLNs with 6 false negatives. In five of these false negative patients, tumours were larger than 35 mm with four also being T3/T4.Conclusion: ICG mapping with NIR fluorescence allowed mesenteric detection of SLNs in clinical Tl/T2 stage colonic cancer.

TI  - Prognostic value of local relapse for patients with endometrial cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of our study was to determine survival and prognostic factors associated with isolated local recurrence of endometrial cancer.Methods: Data of 1229 patients with endometrial carcinoma treated between 2000 and 2012 were extracted from maintained databases of nine French University Hospitals as well as from the Senti-Endo trial. Patients with isolated central pelvic and vaginal recurrence were selected for further analysis.Results: Two hundreds and twenty five patients recurred during the inclusion period, 20 with isolated central pelvic recurrence and 23 with vaginal recurrence. Patients without recurrence had initially significantly less lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.01), less advanced diseases (>stage II) (p < 0.001) and more often low or intermediate risk tumours than patients with local recurrence. Local recurrence was statistically associated with better overall survival than non-local recurrence (p = 0.028) but dramatically decreased overall survival when compared to patients without any recurrence (p < 0.001). The site of recurrence, i.e. vaginal or central pelvic, was significantly associated with overall survival (p = 0.015). Patients without brachytherapy at initial management were more likely to have local recurrence of their disease when compared to those without recurrence (p = 0.03). None of the prognostics factors for survival in patients with local recurrence was statistically significant in multivariate analysis.Conclusions: Local recurrence is a key event in endometrial cancer evolution severely impacting overall survival. Better understanding of the factors associated with prolonged survival is mandatory to improve our management of these patients.

TI  - Metal toxicity assessment by sentinel species of mangroves: <i>In situ</i> case study integrating chemical and biomarkers analyses
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, there is a lack of knowledge about tropical ecotoxicology dealing with the potential impact of metal contamination in mangrove ecosystem. This habitat is considered a nursery for several animal species, among them the "uca"-crab (Ucides cordatus), known as a key species due to its biological and economical importance. This study evaluated the association involving metal contamination (Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Mn and Hg) in water, sediment, red-mangrove vegetation (Rhizophora mangle) and tissues of uga crab, together with its geno-cytotoxic responses, based on micronucleated hemocytes frequency and the retention time of neutral red in lysosomes. We assessed six mangrove areas with distinct pollution levels in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, where the water and sediment contamination by metals were associated with accumulation of these pollutants in biotic compartments (mangrove leaves and crab). In U. cordatus, metal accumulation was best explained by metal concentration found in leaves of R. mangle than in the water or sediment, indicating that feeding drives metal exposure in this organism. Mercury (Hg) concentration in sediment, copper (Cu) concentration in hepatopancreas of U. cordnnic and lead (Pb) in water and green leaves of R. mangle showed a significant correlation with genotoxic impact in U. cordatus. However, copper concentration (in green/senescent leaves and hepatopancreas) and lead (in sediment), were the major metals affecting lysosomal membrane integrity. Therefore, representatives of all compartments were associated with cyto and genotoxicity in this species, thus requiring a holistic approach to issues related to sublethal damage. Probability estimates of cytogenetic impacts related to metal concentration in abiotic compartments (significantly correlated with known biomarkers: Hg in sediment; and Pb in water and sediment) are also presented. Our results highlight the need for environmental restoration of mangroves areas contaminated with metals, responsible for cytogenetic injuries and revealing a pre-pathological condition in this sentinel species, in addition to ecological disturbances.

TI  - Extreme multi-basin flooding linked with extra-tropical cyclones
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluvial floods are typically investigated as 'events' at the single basin-scale, hence flood management authorities may underestimate the threat of flooding across multiple basins driven by large-scale and nearly concurrent atmospheric event(s). We pilot a national-scale statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of extreme multi-basin flooding (MBF) episodes, using peak river flow data for 260 basins in Great Britain (1975-2014), a sentinel region for storms impacting northwest and central Europe. During the most widespread MBF episode, 108 basins (similar to 46% of the study area) recorded annual maximum (AMAX) discharge within a 16 day window. Such episodes are associated with persistent cyclonic and westerly atmospheric circulations, atmospheric rivers, and precipitation falling onto previously saturated ground, leading to hydrological response times < 40 h and documented flood impacts. Furthermore, peak flows tend to occur after 0-13 days of very severe gales causing combined and spatially-distributed, yet differentially time-lagged, wind and flood damages. These findings have implications for emergency responders, insurers and contingency planners worldwide.

TI  - An alternative approach for estimating above ground biomass using Resourcesat-2 satellite data and artificial neural network in Bundelkhand region of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of above ground biomass (AGB) of any forest is a longstanding scientific endeavor, which helps to estimate net primary productivity, carbon stock and other biophysical parameters of that forest. With advancement of geospatial technology in last few decades, AGB estimation now can be done using space-borne and airborne remotely sensed data. It is a well-established, time saving and cost effective technique with high precision and is frequently applied by the scientific community. It involves development of allometric equations based on correlations of ground-based forest biomass measurements with vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data. However, selection of the best-fit and explanatory models of biomass estimation often becomes a difficult proposition with respect to the image data resolution (spatial and spectral) as well as the sensor platform position in space. Using Resourcesat-2 satellite data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this pilot scale study compared traditional linear and nonlinear models with an artificial intelligence-based non-parametric technique, i.e. artificial neural network (ANN) for formulation of the best-fit model to determine AGB of forest of the Bundelkhand region of India. The results confirmed the superiority of ANN over other models in terms of several statistical significance and reliability assessment measures. Accordingly, this study proposed the use of ANN instead of traditional models for determination of AGB and other bio-physical parameters of any dry deciduous forest of tropical sub-humid or semi-arid area. In addition, large numbers of sampling sites with different quadrant sizes for trees, shrubs, and herbs as well as application of LiDAR data as predictor variable were recommended for very high precision modelling in ANN for a large scale study.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Linear Structures in the Exploration of Groundwater
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of linear structures on major geological formations plays a crucial role in resource exploration in the Inner Niger Delta. Highlighting and mapping of the large lithological units were carried out using image fusion, spectral bands (RGB coding), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and band ratio methods. The automatic extraction method of linear structures has permitted the obtaining of a structural map with 82,659 linear structures, distributed on different stratigraphic stages. The intensity study shows an accentuation in density over 12.52% of the total area, containing 22.02% of the linear structures. The density and nodes (intersections of fractures) formed by the linear structures on the different lithologies allowed to observe the behavior of the region's aquifers in the exploration of subsoil resources. The central density, in relation to the hydrographic network of the lowlands, shows the conditioning of the flow and retention of groundwater in the region, and in-depth fluids. The node areas and high-density linear structures, have shown an ability to have rejections in deep (pores) that favor the formation of structural traps for oil resources.

TI  - Subpixel urban impervious surface mapping: the impact of input Landsat images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the heterogeneity of urban environments, subpixel urban impervious surface mapping is a challenging task in urban environmental studies. Factors, such as atmospheric correction, climate conditions, seasonal effect, urban settings, substantially affect fractional impervious surface estimation. Their impacts, however, have not been well studied and documented. In this research, we performed direct and comprehensive examinations to explore the impacts of these factors on subpixel estimation when using an effective machine learning technique (Random Forest) and provided solutions to alleviate these influences. Four conclusions can be drawn based on the repeatable experiments in three study areas under different climate conditions (humid continental, tropical monsoon, and Mediterranean climates). First, the performance of subpixel urban impervious surface mapping using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance imagery is comparable to, and even slightly better than, the surface reflectance imagery provided by U.S. Geological Services in all seasons and in all testing regions. Second, the effect of images with leaf-on/off season varies, and is contingent upon different climate regions. Specifically, humid continental areas may prefer the leaf-on imagery (e.g., summer), while the tropical monsoon and Mediterranean regions seem to favor the fall and winter imagery. Third, the overall estimation performance in the humid continental area is somewhat better than the other regions. Finally, improvements can be achieved by using multi-season imagery, but the increments become less obvious when including more than two seasons. The strategy and results of this research could improve and accommodate regional/national sub pixel land cover mapping using Landsat images for large-scale environmental studies.

TI  - Identifying sustainability challenges on land and water uses: The case of Lake Ziway watershed, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper firstly analyzes the land use - land cover (LULC) in Lake Ziway watershed (Ethiopia) and quantifies the changing patterns from 1973 to 2014 using Landsat images. Secondly, the paper estimates sediment yields using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model). It also assesses and estimates water abstraction from Lake Ziway using survey data. The study shows that the conversions from woodlands into agricultural lands and settlement areas are the major detected LULC changes. Of the total area of the watershed, agricultural lands and settlement areas together increased from 57% in 1973 to 75% in 2014 at the expense of woodlands whose areas decreased from 26.16% to 6.63% in the study periods. The study also shows that water abstraction and sediment loads are increasing at Lake Ziway watershed. The major driving forces behind these LULC changes and the impacts on the lake natural condition are anthropogenic factors such as population growth, land policy changes and deforestation. Increasing demands for more land and water resources, i.e., land for settlements and cultivation, wood for fuel and charcoals, and water for irrigation and municipal water supply, are the underlying causes for the observed changes on the watershed resources. Thus, if the existing scenarios of human pressures are left neglected without management interventions, severe watershed degradations will continue to further affect the watershed's resources including the hydrology. Therefore, responsible government institutions should start mobilizing the local communities along with providing financial and material supports for watershed rehabilitation through afforestation and soil and water conservation activities. Additionally, the free -access practices for water use should be replaced by user-charge policy to regulate water abstractions in order to adequately sustain the water level of Lake Ziway and its feeder rivers. In this respect, this study provides firsthand information to policy makers and planners to put in place a comprehensive land and water use plan and regulations against the unruly human actions in the watershed before irreversible losses might happen to Lake Ziway and its watershed resources.

TI  - Impact of impurities and cryoconite on the optical properties of the Morteratsch Glacier (Swiss Alps)
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of reflected energy by snow and ice plays a fundamental role in their melting processes. Different non-ice materials (carbonaceous particles, mineral dust (MD), microorganisms, algae, etc.) can decrease the reflectance of snow and ice promoting the melt. The object of this paper is to assess the capability of field and satellite (EO-1 Hyperion) hyperspectral data to characterize the impact of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) on the surface reflectance of ice and snow of the Vadret da Morteratsch, a large valley glacier in the Swiss Alps. The spatial distribution of both narrow-band and broad-band indices derived from Hyperion was analyzed in relation to ice and snow impurities. In situ and laboratory reflectance spectra were acquired to characterize the optical properties of ice and cryoconite samples. The concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and levoglucosan were also determined to characterize the impurities found in cryoconite. Multi-wavelength absorbance spectra were measured to compare the optical properties of cryoconite samples and local moraine sediments. In situ reflectance spectra showed that the presence of impurities reduced ice reflectance in visible wavelengths by 80-90 %. Satellite data also showed the outcropping of dust during the melting season in the upper parts of the glacier, revealing that seasonal input of atmospheric dust can decrease the reflectance also in the accumulation zone of the glacier. The presence of EC and OC in cryoconite samples suggests a relevant role of carbonaceous and organic material in the darkening of the ablation zone. This darkening effect is added to that caused by fine debris from lateral moraines, which is assumed to represent a large fraction of cryoconite. Possible input of anthropogenic activity cannot be excluded and further research is needed to assess the role of human activities in the darkening process of glaciers observed in recent years.

TI  - Performance of the two-source energy budget (TSEB) model for the monitoring of evapotranspiration over irrigated annual crops in North Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and the domain of validity of the two source energy balance model (TSEB) for the monitoring of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) as a first step towards its use for irrigation planning. Secondary objectives were to analyze the ability of TSEB model to detect water stress and to evaluate evapotranspiration partition between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) over irrigated annual crops. Within this context, TSEB was compared to the calibrated FAO-56 dual approach, taken as a reference tool for the monitoring of crop water consumption. TSEB computes ET,, as the residual of a double component energy balance driven by the radiative surface temperature (T-s) used as a proxy of crop hydric conditions; the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy of Basal Crop Coefficient (K-cb) and assesses the hydric status directly by solving a two layer soil water budget. Both approaches were evaluated over four plots of wheat and sugar beet located in the Haouz plain (Marrakech, Morocco) that were instrumented with eddy covariance systems during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Series of ASTER images were acquired during the first agricultural season. Both models offered fair performances compared to ET observations with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 1 mm day-1 apart from the FAO-56 dual approach on the sugar beet plot because of uncertain irrigation inputs. This highlights a major weakness of this model when water inputs are uncertain; a very likely case at the plot scale. By contrast, the TSEB model offered smoother performances in all cases. The potentialities of both approaches to predict a water stress index based on the departure from potential evapotranspiration (ETa) was evaluated: although the FAO-56 dual was better suited to detect high water stresses, the TSEB model was able to detect moderate stresses without a need to prescribe water inputs. Finally, the partition of ETa between soil evaporation and plant transpiration was estimated indirectly by confrontation between simulated soil evaporation and surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture acquired spatially with Theta Probe sensors and taken as a proxy of soil evaporation. TSEB evaporation was well correlated to surface soil moisture (r = 0.82) for low Leaf Area Index (LAI) values (<1.5 m(2) m(-2)). In addition, TSEB predicted partition compared well to snapshot measurements based on the stable isotope method, This in-depth comparison of two simple tools to monitor ET, leads us to the conclusion that the TSEB model can reasonably be used to map ETa on large scale and possibly for the decision-making process of irrigation scheduling.

TI  - Estimation of daily minimum land surface air temperature using MODIS data in southern Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface air temperature (LSAT) is a key variable in agricultural, climatological, hydrological, and environmental studies. Many of their processes are affected by LSAT at about 5 cm from the ground surface (LSAT(5cm)). Most of the previous studies tried to find statistical models to estimate LSAT at 2 m height (LSAT(2m)) which is considered as a standardized height, and there is not enough study for LSAT(5cm) estimation models. Accurate measurements of LSAT(5cm) are generally acquired from meteorological stations, which are sparse in remote areas. Nonetheless, remote sensing data by providing rather extensive spatial coverage can complement the spatiotemporal shortcomings of meteorological stations. The main objective of this study was to find a statistical model from the previous day to accurately estimate spatial daily minimum LSAT(5cm), which is very important in agricultural frost, in Fars province in southern Iran. Land surface temperature (LST) data were obtained using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra satellites at daytime and nighttime periods with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. These data along with geometric temperature and elevation information were used in a stepwise linear model to estimate minimum LSAT(5cm) during 2003-2011. The results revealed that utilization of MODIS Aqua nighttime data of previous day provides the most applicable and accurate model. According to the validation results, the accuracy of the proposed model was suitable during 2012 (root mean square difference (RMSD) = 3.07 A degrees C, = 87 %). The model underestimated (overestimated) high (low) minimum LSAT(5cm). The accuracy of estimation in the winter time was found to be lower than the other seasons (RMSD = 3.55 A degrees C), and in summer and winter, the errors were larger than in the remaining seasons.

TI  - Aircraft Reconstruction in High-Resolution SAR Images Using Deep Shape Prior
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contour shapes are important features. An accurate contour shape of a target can provide important prior information for applications, such as target recognition, which can improve the accuracy of target interpretation. In this paper, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target reconstruction method is proposed, which can be used to reconstruct the target by using shape priors to perform an accurate extraction of the contour shape feature. The method is divided into two stages. In the deep shape prior extraction stage, a generative deep learning modelling method is used to obtain deep shape priors. In the reconstruction stage, a novel coarse-to-fine pose estimation method combined with an optimization algorithm is proposed, which integrates deep shape priors into the process of reconstruction. Specifically, to address the issue of object rotation, candidate poses are obtained using the coarse pose estimation method, which avoids an exhaustive search of each pose. In addition, an energy function composed of a scattering term and shape term to combine the fine pose estimation, is constructed and optimized via an iterative optimization algorithm to achieve the goal of object reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time shape priors have been used to extract shape features of SAR targets. Experiments are conducted on a data set acquired by TerraSAR-X images and the results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.

TI  - A global satellite environmental data record derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 microwave Earth observations
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - Spaceborne microwave remote sensing is widely used to monitor global environmental changes for understanding hydrological, ecological, and climate processes. A new global land parameter data record (LPDR) was generated using similar calibrated, multifrequency brightness temperature (T-b) retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). The resulting LPDR provides a long-term (June 2002-December 2015) global record of key environmental observations at a 25 km grid cell resolution, including surface fractional open water (FW) cover, atmosphere precipitable water vapor (PWV), daily maximum and minimum surface air temperatures (T-mx and T-mn), vegetation optical depth (VOD), and surface volumetric soil moisture (VSM). Global mapping of the land parameter climatology means and seasonal variability over the full-year records from AMSR-E (2003-2010) and AMSR2 (2013-2015) observation periods is consistent with characteristic global climate and vegetation patterns. Quantitative comparisons with independent observations indicated favorable LPDR performance for FW (R >= 0 : 75; RMSE <= 0.06), PWV (R >= 0 : 91; RMSE <= 4.94 mm), T-mx and T-mn (R >= 0 : 90; RMSE <= 3.48 degrees C), and VSM (0 : 63 <= R <= 0 : 84; bias-corrected RMSE <= 0.06 cm(3) cm(-3)). The LPDR-derived global VOD record is also proportional to satellite-observed NDVI (GIMMS3g) seasonality (R >= 0 : 88) due to the synergy between canopy biomass structure and photosynthetic greenness. Statistical analysis shows overall LPDR consistency but with small biases between AMSR-E and AMSR2 retrievals that should be considered when evaluating long-term environmental trends. The resulting LPDR and potential updates from continuing AMSR2 operations provide for effective global monitoring of environmental parameters related to vegetation activity, terrestrial water storage, and mobility and are suitable for climate and ecosystem studies. The LPDR dataset is publicly available at http://files.ntsg.umt.edu/data/LPDR_v2/.

TI  - Effects of External Digital Elevation Model Inaccuracy on StaMPS-PS Processing: A Case Study in Shenzhen, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - External Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with different resolutions and accuracies cause different topographic residuals in differential interferograms of Multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR), especially for the phase-based StaMPS-PS. The PS selection and deformation parameter estimation of StaMPS-PS are closely related to the spatially uncorrected error, which is directly affected by external DEMs. However, it is still far from clear how the high resolution and accurate external DEM affects the results of the StaMPS-PS (e.g., PS selection and deformation parameter calculation) on different platforms (X band TerraSAR, C band ENVISAT ASAR and L band ALOS/PALSAR1). In this study, abundant synthetic tests are performed to assess the influences of external DEMs on parameter estimations, such as the mean deformation rate and the deformation time-series. Real SAR images, covering Shenzhen city in China, are also selected to analyze the PS selection and distribution as well as to validate the results of synthetic tests. The results show that the PS points selected by the 5 m TanDEM-X DEM are 10.32%, 4.25% and 0.34% more than those selected by the 30 m SRTM DEM at X, C and L bands SAR platforms, respectively, when a multi-look geocoding operation is adopted for X band in the SRTM DEM case. We also find that the influences of external DEMs on the mean deformation rate are not significant and are inversely proportional to the wavelength of the satellite platforms. The standard deviations of the mean deformation rate difference for the X, C and L bands are 0.54, 0.30 and 0.10 mm/year, respectively. Similarly, the influences of external DEMs on the deformation time-series estimation for the three platforms are also slight, except for local artifacts whose root-mean-square error (RMSE) 6 mm. Based on these analyses, some implications and suggestions for external DEMs on StaMPS-PS processing are discussed and provided.

TI  - Fire Regimes and Their Drivers in the Upper Guinean Region of West Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Guinean region of West Africa exhibits strong geographic variation in land use, climate, vegetation, and human population and has experienced phenomenal biophysical and socio-economic changes in recent decades. All of these factors influence spatial heterogeneity and temporal trends in fires, but their combined effects on fire regimes are not well understood. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the spatial patterns and interrelationships of multiple fire regime components, identify recent trends in fire activity, and explore the relative influences of climate, topography, vegetation type, and human activity on fire regimes. Fire regime components, including active fire density, burned area, fire season length, and fire radiative power, were characterized using MODIS fire products from 2003 to 2015. Both active fire and burned area were most strongly associated with vegetation type, whereas fire season length was most strongly influenced by climate and topography variables, and fire radiative power was most strongly influenced by climate. These associations resulted in a gradient of increasing fire activity from forested coastal regions to the savanna-dominated interior, as well as large variations in burned area and fire season length within the savanna regions and high fire radiative power in the westernmost coastal regions. There were increasing trends in active fire detections in parts of the Western Guinean Lowland Forests ecoregion and decreasing trends in both active fire detections and burned area in savanna-dominated ecoregions. These results portend that ongoing regional landscape and socio-economic changes along with climate change will lead to further changes in the fire regimes in West Africa. Efforts to project future fire regimes and develop regional strategies for adaptation will need to encompass multiple components of the fire regime and consider multiple drivers, including land use as well as climate.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing and local ecological knowledge to monitor rangeland dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands are among the most extensive anthropogenic landscapes on earth, supporting nearly 500 million people. Disagreements over the extent and severity of rangeland degradation affect pastoralist livelihoods, especially when impacts of drought and over-grazing are confounded. While vegetation indices (such as NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from remotely sensed imagery are often used to monitor rangelands, their strategic integration with local ecological knowledge (LEK) is under-appreciated. Here, we explore these complementary approaches in Kyrgyzstan's pasture-rich province of Naryn, where disagreements regarding pasture degradation could greatly benefit from additional information. We examine a time series of MODIS satellite imagery (2000-2015) to characterize browning trends in vegetation as well as to distinguish between climate- and grazing-induced trends. We also compare and contrast measured trends with LEK perceptions of pasture degradation. To do so, we first examine statistical trends in NDVI as well as in NDVI residuals after de-trending with meteorological data. Second, we use participatory mapping to identify areas local pasture managers believe are overgrazed, a particularly useful approach in lieu of reliable historical stocking rates for livestock in this region. Lastly, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of LEK and remote sensing for landscape monitoring.Browning trends were widespread as declining trends in NDVI (and NDVI residuals) covered 24% (and 9%) of the landscape, respectively. Local managers' perceptions of pasture degradation better reflected trends seen in NDVI than in climate-controlled NDVI residuals, suggesting patterns in the latter are less apparent to managers. Our approach demonstrated great potential for the integration of two inexpensive and effective methods of rangeland monitoring well-suited to the country's needs. Despite limitations due to terrain, our approach was most successful within the semi-arid steppe where pasture degradation is believed to be most severe. In many parts of the world, sources of long-term spatially extensive data are rare or even non-existent. Thus, paired LEK and remote sensing can contribute to comprehensive and informative assessments of land degradation, especially where contentious management issues intersect with sparse data availability. LEK is a valuable source of complementary information to remote sensing and should be integrated more routinely and formally into landscape monitoring. To aid this endeavor, we synthesize advice for linking LEK and remote sensing across diverse landscape situations.

AB  - This study examined vegetation greening at two arctic sites: the Apex River Watershed (ARW), Baffin Island, Nunavut (a Low Arctic site) and the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut (a High Arctic site). The vegetation at both study sites was characterized using a supervised land-cover classification approach using high spatial resolution satellite remote sensing data (i.e., IKONOS [4 m] and WorldView-2 [2 m]). Meanwhile, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data spanning the past 30 years were derived from intermediate spatial resolution data (i.e., Landsat TM/ETM/OLI [30 m]). The land-cover classifications were used to partition the Landsat NDVI time series by vegetation type. Climate variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and growing season length [GSL]) were examined to explore potential relationships of NDVI to climate warming trends. The results of the land-cover classifications demonstrated inherent trends of vegetation types along elevation and moisture gradients. The NDVI time series for the CBAWO (1985-2015) demonstrated an overall significant increase in greening, specifically in the dry and mesic vegetation types. Conversely, similar greening (overall or by vegetation type) was not observed for the ARW (1984-2015). Based on climate data from the nearest permanent weather station (Mould Bay, Nunavut), the overall increase in NDVI at the CBAWO was largely attributed to a significant increase in July temperatures and GSL.

TI  - The 2017 complete overhaul of adjuvant therapies for high-risk melanoma and its consequences for staging and management of melanoma patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectacular outcomes of the phase III trials regarding nivolumab versus ipilimumab in fully resected stage IIIB/C-IV and of the combination of dabrafenib (D) plus trametinib (T) in BRAF-mutant stage III patients demonstrate that effective treatments in advanced melanoma are also highly effective in the adjuvant setting. In 2016, an overall survival benefit with adjuvant high-dose ipilimumab was demonstrated, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 1325 comparing pembrolizumab versus placebo will complete the picture in the early 2018. Toxicity profiles are in line with the experience in advanced melanoma, i.e. favourable for the anti-PD1 agents and for D + T and problematic for ipilimumab. The 2017 outcomes are practice changing and put an end to the use of interferon (IFN) and ipilimumab. In countries with only access to IFN, its use can be restricted to patients with ulcerated melanoma, based on the individual patient data meta-analysis recently published. Because of the results of the Melanoma Sentinel Lymph node Trial-2 (MSLT-2) trial, completion lymph node dissection (CLND) will decrease sharply, leading to a lack of optimal prognostic information. Prognosis in sentinel node-positive stage IIIA/B patients is extremely heterogeneous with 5-year survival rates varying from 90% to 40% and depends mostly on the number of positive nodes identified by CLND. This information is crucial for clinical decision-making. How to guarantee optimal staging information needs to be discussed urgently. Further improvements of adjuvant therapies will have to address all these questions as well as the exploration of neoadjuvant use of active drugs and combination approaches. Important paradigm shifts in the management of high-risk melanoma patients are upon us. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geo-Environmental Estimation of Land Use Changes and Its Effects on Egyptian Temples at Luxor City
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, the Egyptian temples at Luxor city have been intensely investigated, but most of these studies just focused on the classical sides of the archaeological and historical descriptions. Many of the environmental problems are the inevitable results of the unplanned urban crawling around the monuments temples. This paper aims at assessing the environmental changes around some temples of Luxor City using remote sensing and GIS techniques. In particular, a historical database made up of Corona and Landsat TM data have been investigated along with the new acquisitions of Quickbird 2 and Sentinel 2. Results from our investigation highlighted rapid changes in urban and agricultural areas, which adversely affected the Egyptian monumental temples causing serious degradation phenomena. Using the information obtained from our RS&GIS based analysis, mitigation strategies have been also identified for supporting the preservation of the archaeological area.

TI  - Microscopic lymphovascular invasion is an independent predictor of survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Despite routine inclusion of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status in pathologic reports of resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA), the clinical implications of LVI have not been well characterized.Methods: This study is a retrospective review of 2640 patients who underwent a pancreatectomy for PDA at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, or Johns Hopkins Hospital (2003-2014). Clinical and pathologic records were extracted from institutional databases.Results: The median post-resection survival for the total cohort was 19.2 months with a 5-year survival rate of 15.2%. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model including conventional pathologic features, LVI was an independent predictor of survival (HR = 1.14, P = 0.017). In a stratified Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with N0, LVI-PDA had a significantly improved overall survival compared to those with N0, LVI+PDA (median 31 vs 24 mo, P = 0.020). Similarly, patients with N1, LVI-PDA had superior survival to patients with N1, LVI+ disease (18.6 vs 16.5 mo, P = 0.001).Conclusions: As the first large scale study focused on the clinical impact of LVI status in PDA, these data indicate that this routinely reported pathologic feature is a bona fide and independent adverse prognostic factor.

TI  - Assessment of RISAT-1 and Radarsat-2 for Sea Ice Observations from a Hybrid-Polarity Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing several Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions will provide a data set with higher temporal resolution. It is of great importance to understand the difference between various available sensors and polarization modes and to consider how to homogenize the data sets for a following combined analysis. In this study, a uniform and consistent analysis across different SAR missions is carried out. Three pairs of overlapping hybrid-and full-polarimetric C-band SAR scenes from the Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) and Radarsat-2 satellites are used. The overlapping Radarsat-2 and RISAT-1 scenes are taken close in time, with a relatively similar incidence angle covering sea ice in the Fram Strait and Northeast Greenland in September 2015. The main objective of this study is to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between a simulated and a real hybrid-polarity (HP) SAR system. The similarities and dissimilarities between the two sensors are evaluated using 13 HP features. The results indicate a similar separability between the sea ice types identified within the real HP system in RISAT-1 and the simulated HP system from Radarsat-2. The HP features that are sensitive to surface scattering and depolarization due to volume scattering showed great potential for separating various sea ice types. A subset of features (the second parameter in the Stokes vector, the ratio between the HP intensity coefficients, and the alpha(s) angle) were affected by the non-circularity property of the transmitted wave in the simulated HP system across all the scene pairs. Overall, the best features, showing high separability between various sea ice types and which are invariant to the non-circularity property of the transmitted wave, are the intensity coefficients from the right-hand circular transmit and the linear horizontal receive channel and the right-hand circular on both the transmit and the receive channel, and the first parameter in the Stokes vector.

TI  - Monitoring surface urban heat island formation in a tropical mountain city using Landsat data (1987-2015)
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since it was first described about two centuries ago and due to its adverse impacts on urban ecological environment and the overall livability of cities, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has been, and still is, an important research topic across various fields of study. However, UHI studies on cities in mountain regions are still lacking. This study aims to contribute to this endeavor by monitoring and examining the formation of surface UHI (SUHI) in a tropical mountain city of Southeast Asia-Baguio City, the summer capital of the Philippines- using Landsat data (1987-2015). Based on mean surface temperature difference between impervious surface (IS) and green space (GS1), SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area increased from 2.7 degrees C in 1987 to 3.4 degrees C in 2015. Between an urban zone (>86% impervious) and a rural zone (<10% impervious) along the urban-rural gradient, it increased from 4.0 degrees C in 1987 to 8.2 degrees C in 2015. These results are consistent with the rapid urbanization of the area over the same period, which resulted in a rapid expansion of impervious surfaces and substantial loss of green spaces. Together with landscape composition variables (e.g. fraction of IS), topographic variables (e.g. hillshade) can help explain a significant amount of spatial variations in surface temperature in the area (R-2 = 0.56-0.85) (p < 0.001). The relative importance of the 'fraction of IS' variable also increased, indicating that its unique explanatory and predictive power concerning the spatial variations of surface temperature increases as the city size becomes bigger and SUHI gets more intense. Overall, these results indicate that the cool temperature of the study area being situated in a mountain region did not hinder the formation of SUHI. Thus, the formation and effects of UHIs, including possible mitigation and adaptation measures, should be considered in landscape planning for the sustainable urban development of the area.

TI  - Benthic Habitat Mapping Using Multispectral High-Resolution Imagery: Evaluation of Shallow Water Atmospheric Correction Techniques
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote multispectral data can provide valuable information for monitoring coastal water ecosystems. Specifically, high-resolution satellite-based imaging systems, as WorldView-2 (WV-2), can generate information at spatial scales needed to implement conservation actions for protected littoral zones. However, coastal water-leaving radiance arriving at the space-based sensor is often small as compared to reflected radiance. In this work, complex approaches, which usually use an accurate radiative transfer code to correct the atmospheric effects, such as FLAASH, ATCOR and 6S, have been implemented for high-resolution imagery. They have been assessed in real scenarios using field spectroradiometer data. In this context, the three approaches have achieved excellent results and a slightly superior performance of 6S model-based algorithm has been observed. Finally, for the mapping of benthic habitats in shallow-waters marine protected environments, a relevant application of the proposed atmospheric correction combined with an automatic deglinting procedure is presented. This approach is based on the integration of a linear mixing model of benthic classes within the radiative transfer model of the water. The complete methodology has been applied to selected ecosystems in the Canary Islands (Spain) but the obtained results allow the robust mapping of the spatial distribution and density of seagrass in coastal waters and the analysis of multitemporal variations related to the human activity and climate change in littoral zones.

TI  - Disaggregation of SMOS Soil Moisture to 100 m Resolution Using MODIS Optical/Thermal and Sentinel-1 Radar Data: Evaluation over a Bare Soil Site in Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 40 km resolution SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture, previously disaggregated at a 1 km resolution using the DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) method based on MODIS optical/thermal data, is further disaggregated to 100 m resolution using Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees). For this purpose, three distinct radar-based disaggregation methods are tested by linking the spatio-temporal variability of sigma degrees and soil moisture data at the 1 km and 100 m resolution. The three methods are: (1) the weight method, which estimates soil moisture at 100 m resolution at a certain time as a function of sigma degrees ratio (100 m to 1 km resolution) and the 1 km DISPATCH products of the same time; (2) the regression method which estimates soil moisture as a function of sigma degrees where the regression parameters (e.g., intercept and slope) vary in space and time; and (3) the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) method, which estimates 100 m resolution soil moisture from the cumulative probability of 100 m resolution backscatter and the maximum to minimum 1 km resolution (DISPATCH) soil moisture difference. In each case, disaggregation results are evaluated against in situ measurements collected between 1 January 2016 and 11 October 2016 over a bare soil site in central Morocco. The determination coefficient (R-2) between 1 km resolution DISPATCH and localized in situ soil moisture is 0.31. The regression and CDF methods have marginal effect on improving the DISPATCH accuracy at the station scale with a R-2 between remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture of 0.29 and 0.34, respectively. By contrast, the weight method significantly improves the correlation between remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture with a R-2 of 0.52. Likewise, the soil moisture estimates show low root mean square difference with in situ measurements (RMSD = 0.032 m(3) m(-3)).

TI  - Estimation of aboveground tree carbon stock using SPOT-HRG data (a case study: Darabkola forests)
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are among the most important carbon sinks on earth. However, their complex structure and vast areas preclude accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks. Data sets from forest monitoring using advanced satellite imagery are now used in international policy agreements. Data sets enable tracking of emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and other types of land-use changes. The aim of this study is to determine the capability of SPOT-HRG Satellite data to estimate aboveground carbon stock in a district of Darabkola research and training forest, Iran. Preprocessing to eliminate or reduce geometric error and atmospheric error were performed on the images. Using cluster sampling, 165 sample plots were taken. Of 165 plots, 81 were in natural habitats, and 84 were in forest plantations. Following the collection of ground data, biomass and carbon stocks were quantified for the sample plots on a per hectare basis. Nonparametric regression models such as support vector regression were used for modeling purposes with different kernels including linear, sigmoid, polynomial, and radial basis function. The results showed that a third-degree polynomial was the best model for the entire studied areas having an root mean square error, bias and accuracy, respectively, of 38.41, 5.31, and 62.2; 42.77, 16.58, and 57.3% for the best polynomial for natural forest; and 44.71, 2.31, and 64.3% for afforestation. Overall, these results indicate that SPOT-HRG satellite data and support vector machines are useful for estimating aboveground carbon stock.

TI  - Seasonal Verification of Dust Forecast over the Indian Region
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The medium-range forecast of the dust aerosols over Indian region produced by the NCMRWF numerical weather prediction model with mineral dust scheme from May 2013 to May 2014 is examined in this study. Coarse mode aerosol observations are only used for comparison with dust forecast with the assumption that coarse mode aerosol over Indian region largely represents dust aerosol, especially over the areas of high dust load. Accuracy and trends of the day-to-day dust forecast are studied at three AERONET locations in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) using surface and MODIS satellite retrievals of coarse mode aerosol optical depth for entire one year (May 2013-May 2014). Seasonal mean geographical distribution of the medium-range forecast of dust by the model over Indian region is validated with different satellite retrievals for all four seasons. Availability of suitable observations is one of the limiting factors and big challenges for the validation of the dust forecast. The main focus of this study is to assess dust forecast by the model over Indian region for all seasons, to know the biases and errors of the model forecast for its optimal use. The study finds that model dust forecast is comparable to AERONET observations over three locations for all seasons except monsoon season.

AB  - Of the 338 species identified as Nearctic-Neotropical migrants occurring in North America, 98.5% have been recorded in Texas. The seasonal migration of these birds is a well-studied natural phenomenon individuals weighing < 15 g will cross in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 965 km non-stop, completing a total distance of 1900-3200 km over the course of 26-80 h. The physiologically demanding nature of this feat makes the Texas coastline crucial to the success of these species. We used a fusion of multi-spectral remote sensing data and distributional modeling techniques to generate and evaluate predictive maps identifying critical areas for migratory passerines on the Texas coast. Imagery acquired from Landsat 8 OLI, maps provided by United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Transportation, and migratory bird occurrence records from the eBird citizen-contributed database were used to build predictive distribution models using three algorithms. Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.

TI  - Detection of Irrigated Crops from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data to Estimate Seasonal Groundwater Use in South India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian agriculture relies on monsoon rainfall and irrigation from surface and groundwater. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability. In this study, we have developed and tested a methodology for monitoring these spatiotemporal variations using Sentinel-1 and -2 observations over the Kudaliar catchment, Telangana State (similar to 1000 km(2)). These free radar and optical data have been acquired since 2015 on a weekly basis over continental areas, at a high spatial resolution (10-20 m) that is well adapted to the small areas of South Indian field crops. A machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest method, was used over three growing seasons (January to March and July to November 2016 and January to March 2017) to classify small patches of inundated rice paddy, maize, and other irrigated crops, as well as surface water stored in the small reservoirs scattered across the landscape. The crop production comprises only irrigated crops (less than 20% of the areas) during the dry season (Rabi, December to March), to which rain-fed cotton is added to reach 60% of the areas during the monsoon season (Kharif, June to November). Sentinel-1 radar backscatter provides useful observations during the cloudy monsoon season. The lowest irrigated area totals were found during Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3.5 and 5% with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with increasing areas of irrigated crops during Rabi 2017. During this season, 16% of rice and 6% of irrigated crops were detected after the exceptional rainfalls observed in September. Surface water in small surface reservoirs reached 3% of the total area, which corresponds to a high value. The use of both Sentinel datasets improves the method accuracy and strengthens our confidence in the resulting maps. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, the high short term variability of irrigated area totals in South India, as a proxy for estimating irrigated water and groundwater needs. These are estimated over the study period to range from 49.5 +/- 0.78 mm (1.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2016, and 44.9 +/- 2.9 mm (6.5% uncertainty) in the Kharif season, to 226.2 +/- 5.8 mm (2.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2017. This variation must be related to groundwater recharge estimates that range from 10 mm to 160 mmyr(-1) in the Hyderabad region. These dynamic agro-hydrological variables estimated from Sentinel remote sensing data are crucial in calibrating runoff, aquifer recharge, water use and evapotranspiration for the spatially distributed agro-hydrological models employed to quantify the impacts of agriculture on water resources.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability in a Turbid and Dynamic Tidal Estuarine Environment (Tasmania, Australia): An Assessment of MODIS Band 1 Reflectance
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Patterns of turbidity in estuarine environments are linked to hydrodynamic processes. However, the linkage between patterns and processes remains poorly resolved due to the scarcity of data needed to resolve fine scale highly dynamic processes in tidal estuaries. The application of remote sensing technology to monitor dynamic coastal areas such as estuaries offers important advantages in this regard, by providing synoptic maps of larger, constantly changing regions over consistent periods. In situ turbidity measurements were correlated against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terra sensor 250 m surface reflectance product, in order to assess this product for examining the complex estuarine waters of the Tamar estuary (Australia). Satellite images were averaged to examine spatial, seasonal and annual patterns of turbidity. Relationships between in situ measurements of turbidity and reflectance is positively correlated and improves with increased tidal height, a decreased overpass-in situ gap, and one day after a rainfall event. Spatial and seasonal patterns that appear in seasonal and annual MODIS averages, highlighting the usefulness of satellite imagery for resource managers to manage sedimentation issues in a degraded estuary.

TI  - Site affinity of whitespotted eagle rays <i>Aetobatus narinari</i> assessed using photographic identification
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photographic identification was used to track the movements of the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari around South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands. A total of 165 individuals were identified, aided by the computer program (IS)-S-3 Spot. The sex ratio across all study sites in 2015 was not significantly different from 1:1 (x(2)=28, P>005). 339% of all individual rays were resighted at least once and the maximum number of days between the first and last sighting was 1640 (median 165, interquartile range, IQR=698). Sightings of individuals occurred at locations differing from the original sighting location 246% of the time (07-20km away). The entire population around South Caicos has yet to be sampled and these rays exhibited site affinity during the study period; they are either resident to South Caicos or are using the area for parts of the year before making movements elsewhere and then returning. Given these results, A. narinari is suited to local-scale management and conservation efforts.

TI  - Performance of Three MODIS Fire Products (MCD45A1, MCD64A1, MCD14ML), and ESA Fire_CCI in a Mountainous Area of Northwest Yunnan, China, Characterized by Frequent Small Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of end-users looking for ground data about fire activity in regions where accurate official datasets are not available adopt a free-of-charge global burned area (BA) and active fire (AF) products for applications at the local scale. One of the pressing requirements from the user community is an improved ability to detect small fires (less than 50 ha), whose impact on terrestrial environments is empirically known but poorly quantified, and is often excluded from global earth system models. The newest generation of BA algorithms combines the capabilities of both the BA and AF detection approaches, resulting in a general improvement of detection compared to their predecessors. Accuracy assessments of these products have been done in several ecosystems; but more complex ones, such as regions that are characterized by frequent small fires and steep terrain has never been assessed. This study contributes to the understanding of the performance of global BA and AF products with a first assessment of four selected datasets: MODIS-based MCD45A1; MCD64A1; MCD14ML; and, ESA's Fire_CCI in a mountainous region of northwest Yunnan; P.R. China. Due to the medium to coarse resolution of the tested products and the reduced sizes of fires (often smaller than 50 ha) we used a polygon intersection assessment method where the number and locations of fire events extracted from each dataset were compared against a reference dataset that was compiled using Landsat scenes. The results for the two sample years (2006 and 2009) show that the older, non-hybrid products MCD45A1 and, MCD14ML were the best performers with SOrensen index (F1 score) reaching 0.42 and 0.26 in 2006, and 0.24 and 0.24 in 2009, respectively, while producer's accuracies (PA) were 30% and 43% in 2006, and 16% and 47% in 2009, respectively. All of the four tested products obtained higher probabilities of detection when smaller fires were excluded from the assessment, with PAs for fires bigger than 50 ha being equal to 53% and 61% in 2006, 41% and 66% in 2009 for MCD45A1 and MCD14ML, respectively. Due to the technical limitations of the satellites' sensors, a relatively low performance of the four products was expected. Surprisingly, the new hybrid algorithms produced worse results than the former two. Fires smaller than 50 ha were poorly detected by the products except for the only AF product. These findings are significant for the future design of improved algorithms aiming for increased detection of small fires in a greater diversity of ecosystems.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Provide analysis of data identifying the impending mass turnover of Directors and Coordinators of General Surgery residency programs and the potential effect on successful continuing accreditation including the ACGME Next Accreditation System (NAS) and associated self study.METHODS: The Association of Residency Coordinators in Surgery, Executive Committee (ARCS EC) anonymously surveyed 254 general surgery Program Coordinators in September/October 2016. This represents 60`% of all the members within the Association of Residency Coordinators in Surgery. Survey was accomplished using SurveyMonkey. Questions included demographics and experience of the Director and Coordinator, accreditation status, significant job stressors, and potential retirements or position changes planned or possible.RESULTS: 153 (60%) respondents completed the survey. Data from the survey indicates that 67% of Program Directors have been in their position less than six (6) years. 34% of Program Coordinators have been in their position less than five (5) years. 56% of coordinators have been on the job less than ten (10) years. Coordinators in 76% of programs reported significant levels of burnout. 59% have considered resigning from their position in the past year. Participants consistently reported increasing responsibilities and expectations combined with declining or inadequate levels of support as sources of job stress. Other contributors to Coordinator burnout were identified as related to the additional ACGME accreditation requirements and salaries not commensurate with workload.CONCLUSION: This survey represents a sentinel preliminary look at the possible impending manning crisis in general surgery residency program leadership. A Program Director is supported by a Program Coordinators who are burned out and considering a job change. The resultant potential turnover in personnel and loss of collective program knowledge may have devastating ramifications to program accreditation. Subsequent survey of the workforce will evaluate proposed solutions and interventions to prevent this outcome and secure the future success of general surgery programs.

TI  - A comparison of nighttime lights data for urban energy research: Insights from scaling analysis in the US system of cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas contribute to about 75% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions and are a primary driver of climate change. If greenhouse gas emissions for the top 20 emitting urban areas were aggregated into a one country, it would rank third behind China and the US. With urban areas forecasted to triple between 2010 and 2030 and urban population expected to increase by more than 2.5 billion, sustainable development will require a better understanding of how different types of urbanization affect energy use. However, there is a scarcity of data on energy use at the urban level that are available globally. Nighttime light satellite data have been shown to be related to energy use, but to date there has not been a systematic comparison of how well different sources of nighttime light data and their derived products can proxy electricity use. This paper fills this gap. First, we perform a comparative analysis of different types of nighttime light satellite data to proxy for electricity use for US cities. Second, we examine how the different types of nighttime light satellite data scale with the size of urban settlements and connect these findings to recent theoretical advances in scaling. We find that (1) all measures of nighttime light and urban electricity use in the US are strongly correlated and (2) different nighttime light-derived data can measure distinct urban energy characteristics such as energy infrastructure volume versus energy use. Our results do not show a clear best nighttime light proxy for total electricity consumption, despite of the use of higher spatial and temporal resolution data.

AB  - A 67-year-old female was referred to our hospital because she was pointed out mass in her right breast by her previous doctor. Core needle biopsy examination was performed at that time which revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. There'reno palpable masses in her breast or any superficial lymph nodes on her visiting our hospital. Breast ultrasonography images showed multiple nodules in C area of right breast. Breast enhanced MRI image revealed multiple enhanced nodules which showed rapid arising and plateau or slowly decreasing pattern in time intensity curve. CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed no distant metastasis. Based on these findings, the case was diagnosed as right breast cancer, cT1N0M0, Stage I . For this case, we performed right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological findings was ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)accompanied by sclerosing adenosis. Though we didn't perform adjuvant chemotherapy, she has been alive without recurrence for 6 years. Because it's difficult to make correct diagnosis with small specimen collected by core needle biopsy, we should take DCIS in sclerosing adenosis into consideration to prevent overdiagnosis.

TI  - Intraoperative prediction of the two axillary lymph node macrometastases threshold in patients with breast cancer using a one-step nucleic acid cytokeratin-19 amplification assay.
T2  - Molecular and clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity and practicality of using a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay during breast cancer staging surgery to predict and discriminate between at least 2 involved nodes and more than 2 involved nodes and facilitate the decision to provide axillary conservation in the presence of a low total axillary node tumour burden. A total of 700 consecutive patients, not treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, received intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) analysis using OSNA for cT1-T3 cN0 invasive breast cancer. Patients with at least one macrometastasis on whole-node SLN analysis underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The total tumour load (TTL) of the macrometastatic SLN sample was compared with the non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) status of the ALND specimen using routine histological assessment. In total, 122/683 patients (17.9%) were found to have an OSNA TTL indicative of macrometastasis. In addition, 45/122 (37%) patients had NSLN metastases on ALND with a total positive lymph node burden exceeding the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial threshold of two macrometastatic nodes. The TTL negative predictive value was 0.975 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.962-0.988]. The area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81-0.91), indicating that SLN TTL was associated with the prediction (and partitioning) of total axillary disease burden. OSNA identifies a TTL threshold value where, in the presence of involved SLNs, ALND may be avoided. This technique offers objective confidence in adopting conservative management of the axilla in patients with SLN macrometastases.

TI  - Can Nor'wester events initiate stratospheric moistening?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibility of stratospheric moistening being initiated by deep convective Nor'wester events has been investigated over a period of three years spanning from 2013 to 2015 at a tropical location Kolkata, in India using radiosonde and satellite data. The back trajectories, instability indices, outgoing long wave radiation (OLR), convective available potential energy (CAPE), geopotential height maps, vertical pressure velocity, specific humidity, wind vectors and precipitable water vapour (PWV) have been examined to assess the convective activity prevailing over the atmosphere during these events. Increase in specific humidity, wind velocity at various levels of the lower atmosphere and CAPE values indicate an upwelling of moist air from the troposphere to lower stratosphere during Nor'westers. Decrease in OLR and large differences in the values of instability indices, relative humidity and precipitable water vapour during Nor'westers compared to normal convection also signify high intensity of convection and hence the possibility of higher stratospheric moistening during Nor'wester events.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From FY-3C/VIRR Data and Its Cross-Validation With Terra/MODIS
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate inversion of land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing data is an essential and challenging topic for earth observation applications. This paper successfully retrieves the LST from FY-3C/VIRR data with split-window method. With the simulated data, the algorithm coefficients are acquired with root mean square errors lower than 1.0 K for all subranges when view zenith angle (VZA) < 30 degrees and the water vapor content (WVC) < 4.25 g/cm(2), as well as those in which the VZA < 30 degrees and the LST < 307.5 K. In addition, a detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out. The analysis result indicates that the total LST uncertainty caused by the standard error of the algorithm, the uncertainties of land surface emissivity and WVC, and the instrument noise would be 1.22 K and 0.94 K for dry and wet atmosphere, respectively. Furthermore, LST retrieval method is applied to the visible and infrared radiometer measurements over the study area covering the geographical latitude of 31.671 degrees N to 44.211 degrees N and longitude of 10.739 degrees W to 1.898 degrees E, and the derived LST is cross-validated with Terra/MODIS LST product. The preliminary validation result shows that the split-window method determines the LST within 2.0 K for vegetation and soil areas.

TI  - Performance Comparison Between Reflection Symmetry Metric and Product of Multilook Amplitudes for Ship Detection in Dual-Polarization SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflection symmetry metric (RSM) and product of multilook amplitudes (PMA) detectors, which were proposed recently, have been demonstrated to be promising methods for processing dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for ship detection. The improvements in ship detection performance by using the RSM, compared to that using the PMA, are investigated in this paper. As the ship-sea contrast (or the signal-clutter-ratio, SCR) is a central index to assess the performance of a detection method, the SCRs in the RSM and PMA are first defined and compared. Next, a theoretical explanation for why the RSM outperforms the PMA in detection performance is provided. The detection performance is then characterized by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The preliminary experimental results performed on measured RADARSAT-2, ALOS-PALSAR, and NASA/JPL AIRSAR images verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.

TI  - Treatment of the axila in breast cancer surgery: Systematic review of its impact on survival
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy and ACOSOG-Z0011 criteria have modified axillary treatment in breast cancer surgery. We performed a systematic review of studies assessing the impact of axillary treatment on survival. The search showed 6891 potentially eligible items. Of them, 23 clinical trials and 12 meta-analyses published between 1980 and 2017 met the study criteria. The review revealed that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in patients pN0 and pN1mic, without compromising survival. In patients pN1 it is proposed not to treat the axilla or replace ALND for axillary radiotherapy. The main limitations of this study are the inclusion of old tests that do not use therapeutic targets and lack of risk categorization of relapse. In conclusion, axillary treatment can be avoided in patients without metastatic involvement or micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node. However, there is no evidence to make a recommendation of axillary treatment in N1 patients, so individualized analysis of patient risk factors is needed. (C) 2017 AEC.

TI  - Examining the NDVI-rainfall relationship in the semi-arid Sahel using geographically weighted regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sahel of Africa is an eco-sensitive zone with complex relations emerging between vegetation productivity and rainfall. These relationships are spatially non-stationary, non-linear, scale dependant and often fail to be successfully modelled by conventional regression models. In response, we apply a local modelling technique, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), which allows for relationships to vary in space. We applied the GWR using climatic data (Normalized Vegetation Difference Index and rainfall) on an annual basis during the growing seasons (June September) for 2002-2012. The operating scale of the Sahelian NDVI rainfall relationship was found to stabilize around 160 km. With the selection of an appropriate scale, the spatial pattern of the NDVI-rainfall relationship was significantly better explained by the GWR than the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. GWR performed better in terms of predictive power, accuracy and reduced residual autocorrelation. Moreover, GWR formed spatial clusters with local regression coefficients significantly higher or lower than those that the global OLS model resulted in, highlighting local variations. Areas near wetlands and irrigated lands displayed weak correlations while humid areas such as the Sudanian region at southern Sahel produced higher and more significant correlations. Finally, the spatial relationship of rainfall and NDVI displayed temporal variations as there were significant differences in the spatial trends throughout the study period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - From REDD plus MRV Perspective: Comparison of Two Different Forest Management Regimes Using Geospatial Techniques in Ludi Khola Watershed, Gorkha District, Nepal
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a practical example of using remote sensing data and methods for forest management in Ludi Khola watershed (5750 ha) Gorkha District, a REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) pilot project site in Nepal. The study area consists of 1888 ha that are assigned to 31 community forests (CFs) and 3862 ha that belong to non-community forests such as governmental and private forests (Non-CFs). By using high-resolution GeoEye-1 (2009 and 2012) satellite images and forest inventory data, temporal dynamics of land cover transitions, tree canopy size classes (crown projection area), Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) were estimated and compared for the two forest regimes (CFs and Non-CFs). Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) segmentation and classification techniques were performed. By using the change matrix method, forest area conversion to non-forest (forest loss) of only 1 ha (0.05%) in CF and 27 ha (0.7%) in Non-CF was observed over 2009-2012. On the other hand, change from non-forest to forest (forest gain) occurred on 12 ha (0.6%) in CF and 60 ha (1.5%) in NonCF. According to land cover information from 2009 to 2012, closed broadleaved forest concealed almost 87% of total CFs' forest area and 59% of total Non-CFs' forest area, while open broadleaved forest occupied almost 12 and 20% in CFs and Non-CFs, respectively. The community-based inventory revealed an annual increment of 3.7 t/ha AGB, whereas remote sensing-based modelling estimated 4.5 t/ha AGB. The integration of remote sensing and field data can demonstrate and endorse a much more efficient REDD+ Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system in terms of information content, reliability, cost, transparency, verifiability, and scalability.

TI  - Value of dimensionality reduction for crop differentiation with multi-temporal imagery and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the use of automated and manual feature selection - prior to machine learning - for the differentiation of crops in a Mediterranean climate (Western Cape, South Africa). Five Landsat-8 images covering the different crop class phenological stages were acquired and used to generate a range of spectral and textural features within an object-based image analysis (OBIA) paradigm. The features were used as input to decision trees (DTs), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) supervised classifiers. Testing was done by performing classifications (using all spatial variables) and then incrementally reducing the feature counts (based on importance allocated to features by filters), feature extraction, and manual (semantic) feature selection. Classification and regression trees (CART) and RF were used as methods to filter feature selection. Feature-extraction methods employed include principal components analysis (PCA) and Tasselled cap transformation (TCT). The classification results were analysed by comparing the overall accuracies and kappa coefficients of each scenario, while McNemar's test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in accuracies among classifiers. Feature selection was found to improve the overall accuracies of the DT, k-NN, and RF classifications, but reduced the accuracy of SVM. The results showed that SVM with feature extraction (PCA) on individual image dates produced the most accurate classification (96.2%). Semantic groupings of features for classification also revealed that using the image bands and indices is not sufficient for crop classification, and that additional features are needed. The accuracy differences of the classifiers were, however, not statistically significant, which suggests that, although dimensionality reduction can improve crop differentiation when multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery is used, it had a marginal effect on the results. For operational crop-type classification in the study area (and similar regions), we conclude that the SVM algorithm can be applied to the full set of features generated. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in melanoma patients: Impact of melanoma-related limb lymphoedema
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To explore health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in recurrence-free melanoma patients, with a focus on the association between melanoma-related limb lymphoedema and HRQoL.Methods: HRQoL was evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the breast cancer module (EORTC QLQ-BR23) subscales body image and future perspective, the Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy-General subscale social/family well-being and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data were analysed using linear and ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age and gender.Results: A total of 431 melanoma patients who had undergone wide local excision and axillary or inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or complete lymph node dissection (CLND) participated. No patients had had recurrence of the disease or had received adjuvant radiotherapy. The HRQoL scores improved with time after surgery. Melanoma-related limb lymphoedema was present in 109 patients (25%). Patients with lymphoedema had significantly worse HRQoL scores in the EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales global health status/quality of life, role and social functioning, fatigue, pain and financial difficulties, as well as in the QLQ-BR23 body image subscale. No associations were found between the limb affected (upper or lower limb), clinical stage of lymphoedema, duration of lymphoedema or type of surgery (SLNB or CLND) and HRQoL. We found an interaction with age and gender in the associations between lymphoedema and HRQoL: younger patients and women with lymphoedema had worse social functioning and women had significantly more impaired body image.Conclusions: The negative impact of melanoma-related limb lymphoedema on HRQoL emphasises the importance of developing strategies for increasing awareness and improving prevention and treatment of lymphoedema.

TI  - Exploring traditional Indigenous leadership concepts: A spiritual foundation for Blackfeet leadership
T2  - LEADERSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically examining the cultural foundation for traditional leadership within the Blackfoot Confederacy, composed of the Blackfeet (Pikuni or South Piegan) in Montana, USA, and the North Piegan, Blood (Kainai), and Blackfoot (Siksika) in Alberta, Canada, reveals that authority for leadership is grounded in tribal spirituality. This spiritual authority is integrated within traditional and complex structures that organize the social structures of the Blackfeet, a structure of extended family, bands, and societies that all influence leadership. Traditional leadership authority arises through medicine bundle rituals, ceremonial rites, and protocols that exist within the Niitsitapi (Blackfeet people) worldview. Understanding the complex foundations of traditional tribal leadership facilitates future research and understanding of Indigenous leadership, especially when international borders separate tribes.

TI  - Uniform rate of cigarette excise under GST in India
T2  - TOBACCO CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The Government of India's plan to implement a Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a major step towards a modern tax system. It will be important from a public health and fiscal perspective that GST is at least 'revenue neutral' with respect to tobacco taxation. In this paper, we calculate revenue neutral central excise rates on cigarettes under different GST scenarios, including the GST Committee's recommended 40% demerit rate.Methods We use the WHO Tax Simulation model to estimate total tax revenues from cigarettes in financial year (FY) 2016-2017. This revenue outcome was increased by 5% to set an inflation-adjusted revenue neutral target for FY 2017-2018. We then introduce GST together with a uniform excise on cigarettes to generate this target amount of tax revenue.Findings We estimate that tax revenue from cigarettes will amount to Rupees (INR) 368 billion in FY 20162017 (INR 149 billion in Value Added Tax and INR 219 billion in excise). The revenue neutral target for FY 2017-2018 is therefore INR 388 billion. If India were to adopt a 40% GST rate on tobacco in FY 2017-2018, then a uniform excise of INR 2225 per 1000 cigarette sticks would be required to generate the target amount of total tax revenue.Conclusions The implementation of GST is a golden opportunity for India to adopt best practices in related areas of taxation. A uniform excise on cigarettes as described here would be an essential component of an efficient and effective tax system for India.

TI  - DIRSIG5: Next-Generation Remote Sensing Data and Image Simulation Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital imaging and remote sensing image generation model is a physics-based image and data simulation model that is primarily used to generate synthetic imagery across the visible to thermal infrared regions using engineering-driven descriptions of remote sensing systems. The model recently went through a major redesign and reimplementation effort to address changes in user requirements and numerical computation trends that have emerged in the 15 years since the last major development effort. The new model architecture adopts some of the latest light transport algorithms matured by the computer graphics community and features a framework that is easily parallelized at the microscale (multi-threading) and macroscale (cluster-based computing). A detailed description of the framework is provided, including a novel method for efficiently storing, evaluating, integrating, and sampling spherical and hemispherical datasets appropriate for the representation of modeled or measured bidirectional scattering, reflectance, and transmission distribution functions. The capabilities of the model are then briefly demonstrated and cross-verified with scenarios of interest to the remote sensing community.

TI  - Indicative Capacity of NDVI in Predictive Mapping of the Properties of Plow Horizons of Soils on Slopes in the South of Western Siberia
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The informativeness of NDVI for predictive mapping of the physical and chemical properties of plow horizons of soils on different slope positions within the first (280-310 m a.s.l.) and second (240-280 m a.s.l.) altitudinal steps has been examined. This index is uninformative for mapping soil properties in small hollows, whose factual width is less than the Landsat image resolution (30 m). In regression models, NDVI index explains 52% of variance in the content of humus; 35 and 24% of variance in the contents of total and nitrate nitrogen; 19 and 29% of variance in the contents of total and available phosphorus; 25 and 50% of variance in the contents of exchangeable calcium and manganese; and 30 and 29% of variance in the contents of fine silt and soil water, respectively. On the basis of the models obtained, prognostic maps of the soil properties have been developed. Spatial distribution patterns of NDVI calculated from Landsat 8 images (30-m resolution) serve as the cartographic base and the main indicator of the soil properties. The NDVI values and the contents of humus, physical clay (< 0.01 mm) and fine silt particles, total and nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, and exchangeable calcium and manganese in the soils of the first altitudinal step are higher than those in the soils of the second altitudinal step. An opposite tendency has been found for the available phosphorus content: in the soils of the second altitudinal step and the hollow, its content is higher than that in the soils of the first altitudinal step by 1.8 and 2.4 times, respectively. Differences in the pH of soil water suspensions, easily available phosphorus, and clay in the soils of the compared topographic positions (first and second altitudinal steps and the hollow) are statistically unreliable.
