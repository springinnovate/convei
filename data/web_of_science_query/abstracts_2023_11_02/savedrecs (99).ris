TI  - Complementary Use of Glider Data, Altimetry, and Model for Exploring Mesoscale Eddies in the Tropical Pacific Solomon Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale activity is an important component of the Solomon Sea circulation that interacts with the energetic low-latitude western boundary currents of the South Tropical Pacific Ocean carrying waters of subtropical origin before joining the equatorial Pacific. Mixing associated with mesoscale activity could explain water mass transformation observed in the Solomon Sea that likely impacts El Nino Southern Oscillation dynamics. This study makes synergetic use of glider data, altimetry, and high-resolution model for exploring mesoscale eddies, especially their vertical structures, and their role on the Solomon Sea circulation. The description of individual eddies observed by altimetry and gliders provides the first elements to characterize the 3-D structure of these tropical eddies, and confirms the usefulness of the model to access a more universal view of such eddies. Mesoscale eddies appear to have a vertical extension limited to the Surface Waters (SW) and the Upper Thermocline Water (UTW), i.e., the first 140-150 m depth. Most of the eddies are nonlinear, meaning that eddies can trap and transport water properties. But they weakly interact with the deep New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent that is a key piece of the equatorial circulation. Anticyclonic eddies are particularly efficient to advect salty and warm SW coming from the intrusion of equatorial Pacific waters at Solomon Strait, and to impact the characteristics of the New Guinea Coastal Current. Cyclonic eddies are particularly efficient to transport South Pacific Tropical Water (SPTW) anomalies from the North Vanuatu Jet and to erode by diapycnal mixing the high SPTW salinity.

TI  - Detection of cropland field parcels from Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A slowdown in global agricultural expansion, spurred by land limitations, improved technologies, and demand for specific crops has led to increased agricultural intensification. While agricultural expansion has been heavily scrutinized, less attention has been paid to changes within cropland systems. Here we present a method to detect individual cropland field parcels from temporal Landsat imagery to improve cropland estimates and better depict the scale of farming across South America. The methods consist of multi-spectral image edge extraction and multi-scale contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and adaptive thresholding using Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) products. We tested our methods across a South American region with approximately 82% of the 2000/2001 total cropland area, using a Landsat time series composite with a January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2001 timeframe. A thematic accuracy assessment revealed an overall cropland f-score of 91%, while an object-based assessment of 5480 fields showed low geometric errors. The results illustrate that Landsat time series can be used to accurately estimate cropland in South America, and the low geometric errors of the per-parcel estimates highlight the applicability of the proposed methods over a large area. Our approach offers a new technique of analyzing agricultural changes across a broad geographic scale. By using multi-temporal Landsat imagery with a semi-automatic field extraction approach, we can monitor within-agricultural changes at a high degree of accuracy, and advance our understanding of regional agricultural expansion and intensification dynamics across South America.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Ship Wake Detection on Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel technique for ship wake detection has been recently proposed and applied on X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar images provided by COSMO/SkyMed and TerraSAR-X. The approach shows that the vast majority of wake features are correctly detected and validated in critical situations. In this paper, the algorithm was applied to 28 wakes imaged by Sentinel-1 mission with different polarizations and incidence angles with the aim of testing the method's robustness with reference to radar frequency and resolution. The detection process is properly modified. The results show that the features were correctly classified in 78.5% of cases, whereas false confirmations occur mainly on Kelvin cusps. Finally, the results were compared with the algorithm performance on X-band images, showing that no significant difference arises. In fact, the total false confirmations rate was 15.8% on X-band images and 18.5% on C-band images. Moreover, since the main criticality concerns again the false confirmation of Kelvin cusps, the same empirical criterion suggested for the X-band SAR images yielded a negligible 1.5% of false detection rate.

TI  - A randomised comparison of two faecal immunochemical tests in population-based colorectal cancer screening
T2  - GUT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Colorectal cancer screening programmes are implemented worldwide; many are based on faecal immunochemical testing (FIT). The aim of this study was to evaluate two frequently used FITs on participation, usability, positivity rate and diagnostic yield in population-based FIT screening.Design Comparison of two FITs was performed in a fourth round population-based FIT-screening cohort. Randomly selected individuals aged 50-74 were invited for FIT screening and were randomly allocated to receive an OC -Sensor (Eiken, Japan) or faecal occult blood (FOB)-Gold (Sentinel, Italy) test (March-December 2014). A cut-off of 10 mg haemoglobin (Hb)/g faeces (ie, 50 ng Hb/mL buffer for OC-Sensor and 59 ng Hb for FOB-Gold) was used for both FITs.Results In total, 19 291 eligible invitees were included (median age 61, IQR 57-67; 48% males): 9669 invitees received OC-Sensor and 9622 FOB-Gold; both tests were returned by 63% of invitees (p = 0.96). Tests were non-analysable in 0.7% of participants using OC-Sensor vs 2.0% using FOB-Gold (p < 0.001). Positivity rate was 7.9% for OC-Sensor, and 6.5% for FOB-Gold (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia (1.4% for OC-Sensor vs 1.2% for FOB-Gold; p = 0.15) or positive predictive value (PPV; 31% vs 32%; p = 0.80). When comparing both tests at the same positivity rate instead of cut-off, they yielded similar PPV and detection rates.Conclusions The OC-Sensor and FOB-Gold were equally acceptable to a screening population. However, FOB-Gold was prone to more non-analysable tests. Comparison between FIT brands is usually done at the same Hb stool concentration. Our findings imply that for a fair comparison on diagnostic yield between FIT's positivity rate rather than Hb concentration should be used.

TI  - Both hemispheric influenza vaccine recommendations would have missed near half of the circulating viruses in Madagascar
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza immunization still poses a critical challenge globally and specifically for tropical regions due to their complex influenza circulation pattern. Tropical regions should select the WHO's Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere recommended vaccine composition based on local surveillance. Analyses of influenza immunization effectiveness have neglected to account for the proportion of circulating viruses prevented from causing infection each year. We investigate this question for Madagascar, where influenza vaccines are not widely available.Methods: Seventy-eight Malagasy influenza strains characterized from 2002 to 2014 were challenged with hypothetical scenarios in which the WHO's Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere recommended vaccine compositions were provided to the population. Match between circulating and vaccine strains was determined by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Strain-specific positive matches were scored assuming 9 months of protection, and scenarios incorporated vaccine delays from zero to 5 months.Results: Malagasy influenza strains matched 54% and 44%, respectively, with the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere recommended vaccine strains when the vaccine was delivered as soon as available. The matching values further decreased when additional delivery and application delays were considered. Differences between recommended compositions were not statistically significant.Conclusion: Our results showed matching with the Northern Hemisphere vaccine barely above 50%, even in the more favourable scenario. This suggests that if implemented, routine influenza vaccines would not provide an optimal protection against half of the influenza strains circulating in any epidemic season of Madagascar. We suggest that this limitation in influenza vaccine efficacy deserves greater attention, and should be considered in cost/benefit analyses of national influenza immunization programmes.

M3  - Article

CP  - 5th IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
CL  - Marina Bay Sands, SINGAPORE
AB  - Buildings that are rotated with respect to the sensor trajectory could be erroneously classified as vegetated areas in the Pauli basis, and subsequently in many decomposition theorems despite the considerable amount of work done to solve that issue. This misjudgement is linked to the high level of their cross-polarized contribution. Using electromagnetic simulation tools and image analysis, we study the value of these cross-polarization components. We show that forested areas and cities exhibit significantly different cross-polarization levels; indeed, the origin of these components is actually distinct. Based on that, to discriminate between the two environments, we introduce an extension to the Pauli basis where the cross polarization is split into two classes, one for rotated dihedrals and the other for random scatterers. This approach is then tested on two synthetic aperture radar images: the first acquired at C-band using RADARSAT-2 over Downtown San Francisco and the second using RAMSES at X-band over an industrial area near Paris.

TI  - Urban Sprawl and Adverse Impacts on Agricultural Land: A Case Study on Hyderabad, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many Indian capitals are rapidly becoming megacities due to industrialization and rural-urban emigration. Land use within city boundaries has changed dynamically, accommodating development while replacing traditional land-use patterns. Using Landsat-8 and IRS-P6 data, this study investigated land-use changes in urban and peri-urban Hyderabad and their influence on land-use and land-cover. Advanced methods, such as spectral matching techniques with ground information were deployed in the analysis. From 2005 to 2016, the wastewater-irrigated area adjacent to the Musi river increased from 15,553 to 20,573 hectares, with concurrent expansion of the city boundaries from 38,863 to 80,111 hectares. Opportunistic shifts in land-use, especially related to wastewater-irrigated agriculture, emerged in response to growing demand for fresh vegetables and urban livestock feed, and to easy access to markets due to the city's expansion. Validation performed on the land-use maps developed revealed 80-85% accuracy.

TI  - Estimation of leaf area index using WorldView-2 and Aster satellite image: a case study from Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) of a forest ecosystem using two different satellite images, WorldView-2 and Aster. For this purpose, 108 sample plots were taken from pure Crimean pine forest stands of Yenice Forest Management Planning Unit in Ilgaz Forest Management Enterprise, Turkey. Each sample plot was imaged with hemispherical photographs with a fish-eye camera to determine the LAI. These photographs were analyzed with the help of Hemisfer Hemiview software program, and thus, the LAI of each sample plot was estimated. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis method was used to model the statistical relationships between the LAI values and band spectral reflection values and some vegetation indices (Vis) obtained from satellite images. The results show that the high-resolution WorldView-2 satellite image is better than the medium-resolution Aster satellite image in predicting the LAI. It was also seen that the results obtained by using the VIs are better than the bands when the LAI value is predicted with satellite images.

AB  - A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a surgical staging procedure performed for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who are clinically lymph-node negative to determine whether there is low volume nodal metastasis in the draining lymph node field. A systematic review was recently performed to update the Australian clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of melanoma, addressing the question, 'When is a sentinel lymph node biopsy indicated?' This article discusses the findings of the systematic review and the evidence base for the updated guidelines.

TI  - Forest canopy structure and reflectance in humid tropical Borneo: A physically-based interpretation using spectral invariants
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South East Asia region is a triple hotspot of carbon, biodiversity, and forest degradation. The latter is leading to heterogeneous forest landscapes with predominant and varying intensity of human modification. Optical Earth observation data offers the most feasible and accessible means of mapping and monitoring the forest cover heterogeneity in this region. Further, difficulties in ground data collection in this region present the need for more robust physically-based interpretation of satellite data which extends beyond simple empirical correlations of reflectance data with forest characteristics. We present an application of forest reflectance parameterization based on spectral invariants in lowland humid tropical forests of Malaysian Borneo. Our framework combined field measurements (hemispherical photos) of canopy structure, radiative transfer modelling at leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy scale (PARAS), and assessments using satellite data (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, ETM +). Field data were collected representing a gradient of forest degradation within a large-scale experimental landscape. Results showed limited ability of Landsat-class satellites to uncover the full gradient of forest degradation in this biome due to similarity in canopy structure as characterized by effective canopy cover, leaf area index, and angular profile of canopy gap fraction. Our findings, however, showed strong expression of leaf optical properties at canopy level. This supports the feasibility to remotely measure canopy biochemistry in dense humid tropical rainforests at medium spatial resolution using freely available Landsat-class satellites, and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite missions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The value of CT at the time of diagnosis for patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma clinically asymptomatic for metastatic disease is unclear.Methods: A retrospective medical chart review was performed on 198 consecutive patients identified with primary T1b-T4b head and neck melanoma clinically asymptomatic for metastatic disease referred for sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures between 2004 and 2014.Results: Initial CTs identified clinically occult melanoma metastases in 8.1% and advanced second primary tumors in 3.5% of patients. CT findings were falsenegative in 1% and false-positive in 6% of patients. Overall survival (OS) for patients with true-positive CT findings was lower than for the other patients (P < .001).Conclusion: CT imaging when staging patients with head and neck melanoma seems to identify more metastases than has been reported for melanoma at other sites. Preoperative CTs decreased the number of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBs), thus avoiding the stress and cost of this surgical procedure in 12% of patients.

AB  - The simulation of optical images can playkey roles in the development of new instruments, the quantitative evaluation of algorithms and in the training of both image analysis software and human analysts. Methods for image simulation include surrogate data collections, operations on empirical imagery, statistical generation techniques, and full physical modeling approaches. Each method offers advantages or disadvantages in terms of time, cost, and realism. Current state of the art suggests three-dimensional radiative transfer models capture most of the significant characteristics of real imagery and find valuable use in system development and evaluation programs. Emerging computational power available from multithreading, graphical processing units, and techniques from deep learning will continue to enable even more realistic simulations in the near future.

TI  - Spatial Optimization of Agricultural Land Use Based on Cross-Entropy Method
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated optimization model was developed for the spatial distribution of agricultural crops in order to efficiently utilize agricultural water and land resources simultaneously. The model is based on the spatial distribution of crop suitability, spatial distribution of population density, and agricultural land use data. Multi-source remote sensing data are combined with constraints of optimal crop area, which are obtained from agricultural cropping pattern optimization model. Using the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin as an example, the spatial distribution of maize and wheat were optimized by minimizing cross-entropy between crop distribution probabilities and desired but unknown distribution probabilities. Results showed that the area of maize should increase and the area of wheat should decrease in the study area compared with the situation in 2013. The comprehensive suitable area distribution of maize is approximately in accordance with the distribution in the present situation; however, the comprehensive suitable area distribution of wheat is not consistent with the distribution in the present situation. Through optimization, the high proportion of maize and wheat area was more concentrated than before. The maize area with more than 80% allocation concentrates on the south of the study area, and the wheat area with more than 30% allocation concentrates on the central part of the study area. The outcome of this study provides a scientific basis for farmers to select crops that are suitable in a particular area.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Series Remote Sensing Image Prediction Based on Multi-Dictionary Bayesian Fusion
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contradictions in spatial resolution and temporal coverage emerge from earth observation remote sensing images due to limitations in technology and cost. Therefore, how to combine remote sensing images with low spatial yet high temporal resolution as well as those with high spatial yet low temporal resolution to construct images with both high spatial resolution and high temporal coverage has become an important problem called spatio-temporal fusion problem in both research and practice. A Multi-Dictionary Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Reflectance Fusion Model (MDBFM) has been proposed in this paper. First, multiple dictionaries from regions of different classes are trained. Second, a Bayesian framework is constructed to solve the dictionary selection problem. A pixel-dictionary likehood function and a dictionary-dictionary prior function are constructed under the Bayesian framework. Third, remote sensing images before and after the middle moment are combined to predict images at the middle moment. Diverse shapes and textures information is learned from different landscapes in multi-dictionary learning to help dictionaries capture the distinctions between regions. The Bayesian framework makes full use of the priori information while the input image is classified. The experiments with one simulated dataset and two satellite datasets validate that the MDBFM is highly effective in both subjective and objective evaluation indexes. The results of MDBFM show more precise details and have a higher similarity with real images when dealing with both type changes and phenology changes.

TI  - Mixture Statistical Distribution Based Multiple Component Model for Target Detection in High Resolution SAR Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an innovative Mixture Statistical Distribution Based Multiple Component (MSDMC) model for target detection in high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Traditional detection algorithms usually ignore the spatial relationship among the target's components. In the presented method, however, both the structural information and the statistical distribution are considered to better recognize the target. Firstly, the method based on compressed sensing reconstruction is used to recover the SAR image. Then, the multiple component model composed of a root filter and some corresponding part filters is applied to describe the structural information of the target. In the following step, mixture statistical distributions are utilised to discriminate the target from the background, and the Method of Logarithmic Cumulants (MoLC) based Expectation Maximization (EM) approach is adopted to estimate the parameters of the mixture statistical distribution model, which will be finally merged into the proposed MSDMC framework together with the multiple component model. In the experiment, the aeroplanes and the electrical power towers in TerraSAR-X SAR images are detected at three spatial resolutions. The results indicate that the presented MSDMC Model has potential for improving the detection performance compared with the state-of-the-art SAR target detection methods.

TI  - Modification of the SUNFLUX solar radiation scheme with a new aerosol parameterization and its validation using observation network data
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - SUNFLUX is a fast parameterization scheme for determination of the solar radiation at the Earth's surface. In this paper, SUNFLUX is further modified in the treatment of aerosols. A new aerosol parameterization scheme is developed for five aerosol species. Observational data from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations are used to evaluate the accuracy of the original and modified SUNFLUX schemes. General meteorological data are available at SURFRAD stations, but not at BSRN stations. Therefore, the total precipitable water content and aerosol data are obtained from AERONET stations. Fourteen stations are selected from both BSRN and AERONET. Cloud fraction data from MODIS are further used to screen the cloud. Ten-year average aerosol mixing ratios simulated by the CAM-chem system are used to calculate the fractions of aerosol optical depth for each aerosol species, and these fractions are further used to convert the observed total aerosol optical depth into the components of individual species for use in the evaluations. The proper treatment of multiple aerosol types in the model is discussed. The evaluation results using SUNFLUX with the new aerosol scheme, in terms of the BSRN dataset, are better than those using the original aerosol scheme under clear-sky conditions. However, the results using the SURFRAD dataset are slightly worse, attributable to the differences in the input water vapor and aerosol optical depth. Sensitivity tests are conducted to investigate the error response of the SUNFLUX scheme to the errors in the input variables.

TI  - Testing transformative energy scenarios through causal layered analysis gaming
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Improving Scenario Methodology - Theory and Practice
CL  - Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, ENGLAND
AB  - This paper presents the results of an innovative pilot experiment on elaborating transformative energy scenarios by using a causal layered analysis (CLA) game. CIA is an integrative and communicative method, which divides issues into four layers: litany, systemic causes, worldviews, and metaphors. In the piloted CIA game, four existing scenario drafts from the Neo-Carbon Energy project: "Radical Startups", "Value-Driven Techemoths", "Green DIY Engineers" and "New Consciousness" were used. The CLA game session, as depicted in this paper, worked through the CIA layers sequentially per each scenario, contributed new elements to the scenario narratives, and utilised roleplay for the worldview and metaphor layers. This CLA game highlighted the complexity, polyphony and actor dynamics of the future worlds. We identify four key benefits: developing the CIA game scenario methodology, gaming-based social learning, deepening of sociocultural energy scenario drafts and exploration of energy transformation toward renewable energy based futures. As a new type of CIA workshop, the game expanded the method's boundaries. Recommendations are presented for developing serious gaming further in scenario processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ship-Iceberg Discrimination in Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery by Supervised Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellites provide multispectral images with pixel sizes down to 10 m. This high resolution allows for fast and frequent detection, classification and discrimination of various objects in the sea, which is relevant in general and specifically for the vast Arctic environment. We analyze several sets of multispectral image data from Denmark and Greenland fall and winter, and describe a supervised search and classification algorithm based on physical parameters that successfully finds and classifies all objects in the sea with reflectance above a threshold. It discriminates between objects like ships, islands, wakes, and icebergs, ice floes, and clouds with accuracy better than 90%. Pan-sharpening the infrared bands leads to classification and discrimination of ice floes and clouds better than 95%. For complex images with abundant ice floes or clouds, however, the false alarm rate dominates for small non-sailing boats.

TI  - Near-infrared image-guided lymphatic mapping in minimally invasive oesophagectomy of distal oesophageal cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the potential of near-infrared (NIR) imaging during minimally invasive oesophagectomy in patients with distal oesophageal cancer for detection of nodal metastases inside and outside the standard en bloc surgical field.METHODS: We enrolled 6 patients diagnosed with distal oesophageal cancer for intraoperative lymphatic mapping with NIR imaging. Indocyanine green dye was injected endoscopically in 8 corners of the primary tumour at the start of the operation. The minimally invasive oesophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy was performed using 3D optics. A separate endoscopic fluorescence imaging system was used to systematically detect the NIR signal of 23 lymphatic stations. The NIR-positive stations outside the en bloc resection area were also removed for histological analysis.RESULTS: Lymphatic mapping was successful in all patients. The NIR-positive areas were most commonly detected in the lower mediastinum (100% of patients), cardia (83%), region of the left gastric artery (67%), celiac axis (50%) and pericardial-diaphragmatic groove (50%). We detected NIR-positive areas outside the traditional en bloc field above the azygous arch in 50% of the patients. A total of 182 lymph nodes were resected from 6 patients. In 3 patients, a total of 19 lymph node metastases were detected, 4 of which were outside the en bloc field.CONCLUSIONS: NIR imaging can be useful for detecting lymphatic stations that most likely present with metastatic disease and to guide the tailored extension of the traditional lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Burden of influenza among hospitalized febrile children in Ghana
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza surveillance data from Africa indicate a substantial disease burden with high mortality. However, local influenza data from district hospitals with limited laboratory facilities are still scarce.Objectives: To identify the frequency and seasonal distribution of influenza among hospitalized febrile children in a rural hospital in Ghana and to describe differential diagnoses to other severe febrile infections.Methods: Between January 2014 and April 2015, all children with a temperature of >= 38 degrees C admitted to a district hospital in Ghana were screened for influenza A and B by RT-PCR and differentiated to subtypes A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2). Malaria microscopy and blood cultures were performed for each patient.Results: A total of 1063 children with a median age of 2 years (IQR: 1-4 years) were recruited. Of those, 271 (21%) were classified as severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and 47 (4%) were positive for influenza, namely 26 (55%) influenza B, 15 (32%) A(H1N1) pdm09, and 6 (13%) A(H3N2) cases. Influenza predominantly occurred in children aged 3-5 years and was more frequently detected in the major rainy season (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.47-6.19) during the first half of the year. Two (4%) and seven (15%) influenza-positive children were co-diagnosed with an invasive bloodstream infection or malaria, respectively.Conclusion: Influenza contributes substantially to the burden of hospitalized febrile children in Ghana being strongly dependent on age and corresponds with the major rainy season during the first half-year.

TI  - The Valmy thrust sheet: A regional structure formed during the protracted assembly of the Roberts Mountains allochthon, Nevada, USA
T2  - GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthesis of field, biostratigraphic, detrital zircon geochronologic, and remote sensing data across north-central Nevada, United States, defines a thick, regionally extensive sheet of Middle-Upper Ordovician Valmy Formation quartzite that structurally overlies deformed early Paleozoic units of the Roberts Mountains allochthon. Late Paleozoic regional unconformities that record tectonic disruptions have been recognized in the foreland of central and eastern Nevada and locally within the Roberts Mountains allochthon; these identify multiple, regional tectonic events between the Devonian-Mississippian initiation of the Antler orogeny and the Permian-Triassic Sonoma orogeny. However, few studies have documented the regional kinematic history of the Robert Mountains allochthon sensu stricto. In the Independence Mountains of northern Nevada, emplacement of the Roberts Mountains allochthon is restricted to the Mississippian. In the Tuscarora Mountains, the range west and southwest of the Independence Mountains, several deformation events have been identified, and emplacement of the thrust sheet containing the Valmy Formation is restricted to the Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian. These structural and temporal relations, reflected in the Antler foreland basin adjacent to the Roberts Mountains allochthon and overlap sequences, suggest that the Roberts Mountains allochthon is a composite stratigraphic terrane assembled along the Cordilleran margin during two or more late Paleozoic contractional events.Valmy Formation deposits likely represent the development of coalescing submarine fans below or within bypass channels in a deep slope or rise environment. Petrographic characteristics, biostratigraphy, and detrital zircon U-Pb age populations of the Valmy Formation link it to coeval slope and rise turbidites of the Vinini Formation and shelfal Eureka Quartzite; Valmy Formation detrital zircon age populations are dissimilar to the rift-to-drift facies of the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Prospect Mountain Quartzite. Throughout north-central Nevada, the Valmy Formation is in fault contact with units of the Roberts Mountains allochthon, including the Devonian-Mississippian Slaven Chert, Silurian-Devonian Elder Sandstone, and Cambrian(?)-Ordovician Vinini Formation, which were deformed prior to, or during, emplacement of the thrust sheet containing Valmy Formation quartzite. Our mapping and data synthesis, guided by regional quartz maps based on remote sensing (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER]) data, delineate similar structural relationships discontinuously for >200 km along strike of the Roberts Mountains allochthon.Exploration for concealed gold deposits within reach of drilling requires knowledge of the relative thicknesses of the Roberts Mountains allochthon and the Valmy Formation. Overall thicknesses of deformed Roberts Mountains allochthon units between the Valmy Formation and underlying carbonate rocks, which host large, world-class Carlin-type gold deposits, vary by hundreds of meters, but are generally less than 700 m in three of the areas studied here. Recognition of windows through and klippen of the Roberts Mountains allochthon is essential for identification of areas where deposits may be at or near the surface. Correspondingly, most ongoing exploration for Carlin-type gold deposits subjacent to the Roberts Mountains allochthon targets concealed deposits. The model proposed in this study is applicable to determining depth to rocks prospective for undiscovered deposits.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Organic Matter Content Using Hyperspectral Techniques Combined with Normalized Difference Spectral Index
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, proximal hyperspectral technology provides a new approach in timely, effectively and nondestructive way to detect soil organic matter (SOM). However, the hyperspectral dataset contains too many wavelengths which could lead to the collinearity, redundancy and noise to models. The Normalized Difference Spectral Index (NDSI) derived from soil spectral reflectance could enhance the relationship between spectral features and SOM, and also could eliminate the irrelevant wavelengths. In this paper, 56 topsoil samples at 0 similar to 20 cm depth were collected as research objects from Gong' an County in Jianghan Plain, the spectral reflectance was measured using the ASD FieldSpec3 spectrum analyzer, and the SOM was determined using potassium dichromate external heating method in the laboratory. In the next stage, the raw spectral reflectance (Raw) was prepared for three spectral transformations, i,e. inverse-log reflectance (LR), first order differential reflectance (FDR) and continuum removal reflectance (CR). 2-D correlograms of the determination coefficients (R-2) were constructed using all two-band combinations of 4 spectral transformations in NDSI against SOM in the range of 400 similar to 2 400 nm. Then, the determination coefficients (R-2) of the 4 spectral transformations for 1-D determination coefficients and 2-D determination coefficients by F significant test were got (p<0.001), which could be used to extract sensitive bands and spectral index. At last, partial least squares regression (PLSR) method were used to build quantitative inversion model of SOM based on sensitive bands and spectral index for this study area, respectively. Feasibility of 2-D spectral index for building model was this study aimed to explore. The results showed that, the 2-D determination coefficients were better than 1-D determination coefficients, especially the determination coefficients of LR was improved by about 0.26. Compared to the sensitive bands derived from 1-D determination coefficients, on the whole, the sensitive spectral index derived from 2-D determination coefficients using PLSR method could obtain more robust prediction accuracies. The prediction accuracy of NDSILR-PLSR was the best, and its values of R2, RPD for the predicted model were 0.82, 2.46, which could estimate SOM comprehensively and stably. In the future, this method could be applied to air-or space-borne images with a lower spectral resolution (e.g. ASTER, Landsat TM), and the results could also provide great potential in the field of sensor design for portable proximal sensing researching.

TI  - Climate change and alpine stream biology: progress, challenges, and opportunities for the future
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In alpine regions worldwide, climate change is dramatically altering ecosystems and affecting biodiversity in many ways. For streams, receding alpine glaciers and snowfields, paired with altered precipitation regimes, are driving shifts in hydrology, species distributions, basal resources, and threatening the very existence of some habitats and biota. Alpine streams harbour substantial species and genetic diversity due to significant habitat insularity and environmental heterogeneity. Climate change is expected to affect alpine stream biodiversity across many levels of biological resolution from micro- to macroscopic organisms and genes to communities. Herein, we describe the current state of alpine stream biology from an organism-focused perspective. We begin by reviewing seven standard and emerging approaches that combine to form the current state of the discipline. We follow with a call for increased synthesis across existing approaches to improve understanding of how these imperiled ecosystems are responding to rapid environmental change. We then take a forward-looking viewpoint on how alpine stream biologists can make better use of existing data sets through temporal comparisons, integrate remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies, and apply genomic tools to refine knowledge of underlying evolutionary processes. We conclude with comments about the future of biodiversity conservation in alpine streams to confront the daunting challenge of mitigating the effects of rapid environmental change in these sentinel ecosystems.

TI  - Ground Deformation Detection Using China's ZY-3 Stereo Imagery in an Opencast Mining Area
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and extraction of mining-induced ground deformation can be used to understand the deformation process and space distribution and to estimate the deformation laws and trends. This study focuses on the application of ground deformation detection and extraction combined with digital surface model (DSM), derived from China's ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite stereo imagery and the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) data. A district covering 200 km(2) around the west open-pit mine in Fushun of Liaoning Province, a city located in Northeast China, is chosen as the study area. Regional overall deformation, typical region deformation, and topographical profile deformation are extracted to analyze the distribution and the link between the regional ground deformations. The results show that the mean elevation has already increased by 3.12 m from 2010 to 2015; 71.18% of this area is deformed, and 22.72% of this area has an elevation variation of more than 10 m. Four districts of rising elevation and three districts of descending elevation are extracted. They are deformed with distinct elevation and volume changes. The total area with distinct rising elevation (>15 m) is about 8.44 km(2), and the change in volume is 2.47 x 10(8) m(3). However, the total area with distinct descending elevation (<-10 m) is about 6.12 km(2), and the change in volume is 2.01 x 10(8) m(3). Moreover, the deformation in the local mining area has expanded to the surrounding areas. Experiments in the mining area demonstrate that ground deformation, especially acute deformation such as large fractures or landslides, can be monitored using DSMs derived from ZY-3 satellite stereo images.

TI  - A Feature-Based Approach of Decision Tree Classification to Map Time Series Urban Land Use and Land Cover with Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI in a Coastal City, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of temporal changes in urban land use and land cover (LULC) is important for monitoring urban expansion and changes in LULC, urban planning, environmental management, and environmental modeling. In this study, we present a feature-based approach of the decision tree classification (FBA-DTC) method for mapping LULC based on spectral and topographic information. Landsat 5 TM and Land 8 OLI images were employed, and the technique was applied to the coastal city of Xiamen, China. The method integrates multi-spectral features such as SAVI (soil adjustment vegetation index), NDWI (normalized water index), MNDBaI (modified normalized difference barren index), BI (brightness index), and WI (wetness index), with topographic features including DEM and slope. In addition, the new approach distinguishes between fallow land and cropland, and separates high-rise buildings from beaches and water bodies. Several of the FBA-DTC parameters (or rules) from 1997 to 2015 remained constant (i.e., DEM and slope), whereas others changed slightly. WI was negatively related to percent area of beach land, and BI was negatively related to percent area of arable land. The FBA-DTC method had an average user's accuracy (UA) of 91.36% for built-up land, an average overall accuracy (OA) of 92.13%, and a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.90 for the period from 2003 to 2015, representing respective increases of 15.87%, 10.17%, and 0.13, compared with values calculated using maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Over the past 12 years, built-up land increased from 23.67% to 43.17% owing to occupation of coastal reclamation, arable land, and forest land. The FBA-DTC method presented here is a valuable technique for evaluating urban growth and changes in LULC classification for coastal cities.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Suomi NPP-VIIRS Image for Lake Mapping
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing the dynamics of a lake-water area using remotely sensed images has always been an essential task. Most of the fine spatial resolution data are unsuitable for this purpose because of their low temporal resolution and limited scene coverage. A Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP-VIIRS) is a newly-available and appropriate sensor for monitoring large lakes due to its frequent revisits and wide swath (more than 3000 km). However, it provides visible and infrared images at relatively coarse spatial resolutions, which would sometimes hamper the accurate mapping of lake shorelines. This study, therefore, proposes a two-step downscaling method that combines spectral unmixing and subpixel mapping to produce a finer resolution lake map from NPP-VIIRS imagery, which is then applied to delineate the shorelines of five plateau lakes in Yunnan Province, as well as the shoreline dynamics of Poyang Lake at three separate times. A newly published global water dynamic dataset is employed in this study to improve the downscaling method. Results suggest that the proposed method can generate a finer resolution lake map that exhibits more details of the shoreline than hard classification. The downscaling results of the Suomi NPP-VIIRS generally achieve higher than 75% accuracy, while the downscaling results of a Landsat-simulated fraction map could have accuracy higher than 85%. This reveals that errors and uncertainties exist in both procedures, but mainly come from the spectral unmixing procedure which retrieves water fractions from NPP-VIIRS data.

TI  - Incidence of lower limb lymphedema after vulvar cancer A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is an important concern for patients with vulvar cancer. Studies of the incidence of vulvar cancer-related lymphedema and its risk factors have substantially increased in the new millennium.Objectives: This article is a meta-analysis that aimed to systematically evaluate the incidence of LLL and its risk factors related to vulvar cancer.Data sources: Data were collected from eligible studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science.Synthesis methods: Random effects models were used to calculate a pooled overall estimate of LLL incidence, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effects of different study designs, countries of study origin, diagnostic methods, and extent of lymph node surgery. Risk factors for lymphedema were also evaluated.Results: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria for the assessment of lymphedema incidence with a pooled estimate of 28.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22.1-35.5]. The estimate was 16.7% (95% CI 9.7-23.7) when data were restricted to prospective cohort studies (7 studies). The incidence of LLL was increased by approximately 5-fold in women who underwent inguinofemoral lymph node dissection compared to those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. The reported risk factors included wound infection, inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, older age, body mass index (BMI), and radiation therapy.Conclusions: Approximately 3 in 10 women who survive vulvar cancer will develop lower limb lymphedema. More studies are needed to improve the understanding of its risk factors and to develop prevention and management strategies to alleviate this distressing disorder.

TI  - A cloud-enabled automatic disaster analysis system of multi-sourced data streams: An example synthesizing social media, remote sensing and Wikipedia data
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media streams and remote sensing data have emerged as new sources for tracking disaster events, and assessing their damages. Previous studies focus on a case-by-case approach, where a specific event was first chosen and filtering criteria (e.g., keywords, spatiotemporal information) are manually designed and used to retrieve relevant data for disaster analysis. This paper presents a framework that synthesizes multi-sourced data (e.g., social media, remote sensing, Wikipedia, and Web), spatial data mining and text mining technologies to build an architecturally resilient and elastic solution to support disaster analysis of historical and future events. Within the proposed framework, Wikipedia is used as a primary source of different historical disaster events, which are extracted to build an event database. Such a database characterizes the salient spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of each type of disaster. Additionally, it can provide basic semantics, such as event name (e.g., Hurricane Sandy) and type (e.g., flooding) and spatiotemporal scopes, which are then tuned by the proposed procedures to extract additional information (e.g., hashtags for searching tweets), to query and retrieve relevant social media and remote sensing data for a specific disaster. Besides historical event analysis and pattern mining, the cloud-based framework can also support real-time event tracking and monitoring by providing on-demand and elastic computing power and storage capabilities. A prototype is implemented and tested with data relative to the 2011 Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 Colorado flooding. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of Thermal Structure of Arctic Lakes at Local and Regional Scales Using in Situ and Multidate Landsat-8 Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic coastal plain is covered with numerous thermokarst lakes. These lakes are closely linked to climate and environmental change through their heat and water budgets. We examined the intralake thermal structure at the local scale and investigated the water temperature pattern of lakes at the regional scale by utilizing extensive in situ measurements and multidate Landsat-8 remote sensing data. Our analysis indicates that the lake skin temperatures derived from satellite thermal sensors during most of the ice-free summer period effectively represent the lake bulk temperature because the lakes are typically well-mixed and without significant vertical stratification. With the relatively high-resolution Landsat-8 thermal data, we were able to quantitatively examine intralake lateral temperature differences and gradients in relation to geographical location, topography, meteorological factors, and lake morphometry for the first time. Our results suggest that wind speed and direction not only control the vertical stratification but also influences lateral differences and gradients of lake surface temperature. Wind can considerably reduce the intralake temperature gradient. Interestingly, we found that geographical location (latitude, longitude, distance to the ocean) and lake morphometry (surface size, depth, volume) not only control lake temperature regionally but also affect the lateral temperature gradient and homogeneity level within each individual lake. For the Arctic coastal plain, at regional scales, inland and southern lakes tend to have larger horizontal temperature differences and gradients compared to coastal and northern lakes. At local scales, large and shallow lakes tend to have large lateral temperature differences relative to small and deep lakes.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change in Vientiane Area, Lao PDR Using Object-Oriented Classification on Multi-Temporal Landsat Data
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Information in Business and Technology Management (12BM)
CL  - MALAYSIA
AB  - Monitoring of land use and land cover change using remote sensing is important to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the environment. Digital change detection using post-classification can help to elucidate dynamics of landscape change. This study illustrates the effectiveness of object-oriented classification compared to pixel-oriented classification in generating land cover information and its temporal changes. Spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover types in Vientiane area, Lao PDR were analyzed using Landsat images in two-time series (1990 and 2015). We used the top-down approach to classify the Landsat images in iterative steps with three hierarchical scale levels. Scale levels of 25, 10 and 5 with different weighting parameters were used to map the land cover type of Vientiane in 1990 and 2015. With object-oriented classification, overall accuracy and Kappa statistic were improved by 13.44% and 0.16 for land cover classification (LCC) 1990. For LCC 2015 the improvements in overall accuracy and Kappa statistic were 28.71% and 0.25. Based on the LCC 1990 and 2015, we observed an significant growth of plantation areas over the 25 years in the study area. Instead of traditional agricultural activity the plantation seemed to be the new driver in the rural areas of Lao PDR. The object-oriented classification approach can be applied in other areas of Lao PDR to generate accurate information on land cover changes for better land resource management.

TI  - An Alarmingly High Proportion of HIV-1 Isolates Carrying Mutations Corresponding to Resistance to Antiretroviral Drugs among HIV-Positive High-Risk Groups in Central Vietnam: a Substudy of the National Sentinel Survey
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the prevalence of HIV drug resistance among high-risk groups such as injecting drug users (IDUs), female sex workers (FSWs), and men having sex with men (MSM) in central Vietnam. We used HIV-positive blood samples from 2012-2013 sentinel surveillance surveys. Study subjects were screened for HIV infection by standardized screening assays, and the HIV-positive samples were further tested for HIV viral load and drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) by in-house assays. DRMs were identified using the Stanford University online sequence analysis tool. Their risk behaviors were also investigated. During the study period, 6,016 (high-risk) subjects were screened, and 97 tested positive for HIV infection (IDUs: n = 63, 3.0%; FSWs: n = 24, 0.9%; and MSM: n = 10, 1.0%). Ninety-two of the 97 samples (45 from 2012 and 47 from 2013) were available for further testing. HIV RNA was detected in 56 (60.9%) of the 92 samples, and drug resistance genotyping was successfully performed on 40 (71.4%) samples. All these isolates were subtype CRFOLAE, except for 1 (2.5%) IDU whose HIV belongs to subtype B. Thirteen individuals (32.5%) were carrying HIV with at least 1 DRM: 9 IDUs, 1 FSW, and 3 MSM. Thus, HIV seroprevalence among high-risk individuals in central Vietnam is low, but a high proportion of drug resistant HIV-1 isolates is observed in the high-risk group.

TI  - Rates of virological suppression and drug resistance in adult HIV-1-positive patients attending primary healthcare facilities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province in South Africa has the highest HIV disease burden in the country, with an estimated population prevalence of 24.7%. A pilot sentinel surveillance project was undertaken in KZN to classify the proportion of adult patients failing first-line ART and to describe the patterns of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in patients with virological failure (VF).Methods: Cross-sectional surveillance of acquired HIV drug resistance was conducted in 15 sentinel ART clinics between August and November 2013. Two population groups were surveyed: on ART for 12-15 months (Cohort A) or 24-36 months (Cohort B). Plasma specimens with viral load >= 1000 copies/mL were defined as VF and genotyped for DRMs.Results: A total of 1299 adults were included in the analysis. The prevalence of VF was 4.0%(95% CI 1.8-8.8) among 540 adults in Cohort A and 7.7% (95% CI 4.4-13.0) of 759 adults in Cohort B. Treatment with efavirenz was more likely to suppress viral load in Cohort A (P = 0.005). Independent predictors of VF for Cohort B included male gender, advanced WHO stage at ART initiation and treatment with stavudine or zidovudine compared with tenofovir. DRMs were detected in 89% of 123 specimenswith VF, including M184I/V, K103N/S, K65N/R, V106A/M and Y181C.Conclusions: VF in adults in KZN was < 8% up to 3 years post-ART initiation but was associated with a high frequency of DRMs. These data identify key groups for intensified adherence counselling and highlight the need to optimize first-line regimens to maintain viral suppression.

TI  - Climate Engine: Cloud Computing and Visualization of Climate and Remote Sensing Data for Advanced Natural Resource Monitoring and Process Understanding
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paucity of long-term observations, particularly in regions with heterogeneous climate and land cover, can hinder incorporating climate data at appropriate spatial scales for decision-making and scientific research. Numerous gridded climate, weather, and remote sensing products have been developed to address the needs of both land managers and scientists, in turn enhancing scientific knowledge and strengthening early-warning systems. However, these data remain largely inaccessible for a broader segment of users given the computational demands of big data. Climate Engine (http://ClimateEngine.org) is a web-based application that overcomes many computational barriers that users face by employing Google's parallel cloud-computing platform, Google Earth Engine, to process, visualize, download, and share climate and remote sensing datasets in real time. The software application development and design of Climate Engine is briefly outlined to illustrate the potential for high-performance processing of big data using cloud computing. Second, several examples are presented to highlight a range of climate research and applications related to drought, fire, ecology, and agriculture that can be rapidly generated using Climate Engine. The ability to access climate and remote sensing data archives with on-demand parallel cloud computing has created vast opportunities for advanced natural resource monitoring and process understanding.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Law powerfully influences health and can be a critical tool for promoting population well-being. Evaluation research is needed to measure the health effects of law and guide policy making and implementation. The purpose of this study was to assess trends in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for scientific public health law research (PHLR).Methods: Using data from the UberResearch NIH grant repository, we collected and coded all grants with a focus on health law between FY'85 and FY'14 and then analyzed the grants by funding agency and topic areas.Results: Between FY' 85 and FY' 14, NIH funded 510 research grants on health policy making, the health effects of laws or enforcement practices. On average, 4 PHLR grants were funded annually with a median total funding of $545 956 (range: $2535-$ 44 052 300) and a median annual funding of $205 223 (range: $2535-$ 7 019 517).Conclusions: National Institutes of Health has supported important PHLR but not nearly to the extent necessary to ensure that public health laws affecting the population are evaluated in a rigorous and timely manner. In addition to greater funding evaluation research, NIH can increase its support for creating legal datasets, fund training in PHLR, and work with the National Library of Medicine to create Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to PHLR.

TI  - The Increment of Social Axioms over Broad Personality Traits in the Prediction of Dyadic Adjustment: An Investigation Across Four Ethnic Groups
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between personality, social axioms, and dyadic adjustment. A sample of 420 participants (210 heterosexual couples), approximately evenly distributed between four ethnic backgrounds (Romanian, Hungarian, German, and Rroma), was investigated in a cross-sectional approach with the Romanian versions of the Social Axioms Survey, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. The analyses were based on the actor-partner interdependence model. The results showed that social axioms show incremental validity over personality traits in the prediction of dyadic adjustment, attesting to the usefulness of a worldview measure in predicting interpersonal outcomes over and above that provided by a measure of personality. Three of the five dimensions of social axioms were associated with dyadic adjustment, with either actor or partner effects. A few significant differences have been found between the various ethnic groups on effects of the social axioms on dyadic adjustment: The positive actor effect of reward for application is not visible for German men, the negative partner effect of social cynicism is not detectable for Rroma men, and the negative partner effect of social complexity is not visible for Rroma women.

TI  - Surface Water Mapping by Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of surface water is useful in a variety of remote sensing applications, such as estimating the availability of water, measuring its change in time, and predicting droughts and floods. Using the imagery acquired by currently active Landsat missions, a surface water map can be generated from any selected region as often as every 8 days. Traditional Landsat water indices require carefully selected threshold values that vary depending on the region being imaged and on the atmospheric conditions. They also suffer from many false positives, arising mainly from snow and ice, and from terrain and cloud shadows being mistaken for water. Systems that produce high-quality water maps usually rely on ancillary data and complex rule-based expert systems to overcome these problems. Here, we instead adopt a data-driven, deep-learning-based approach to surface water mapping. We propose a fully convolutional neural network that is trained to segment water on Landsat imagery. Our proposed model, named Deep-WaterMap, learns the characteristics of water bodies from data drawn from across the globe. The trained model separates water from land, snow, ice, clouds, and shadows using only Landsat bands as input. Our code and trained models are publicly available at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/deepwatermap/.

TI  - Estimation of High-Resolution Surface Shortwave Radiative Fluxes Using SARA AOD over the Southern Great Plains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) plays a determinant role in estimations of surface shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes. Therefore, this study aims to develop a hybrid scheme to produce surface SW fluxes, based on AOD at 1-km spatial resolution retrieved from the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) and several Terra MODIS land and atmospheric products (i.e., geolocation properties, water vapor amount, total ozone column, surface reflectance, and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance). Estimations based on SARA were made over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) under cloud-free conditions in 2014 and compared with estimations based on the latest Terra MODIS AOD product at 3-km resolution. Validation against ground-based measurements showed that SARA-based fluxes obtain lower RMSE and bias values compared with MODIS-based estimations. MODIS-based downward and net fluxes are satisfactory, while the direct and diffuse components are less reliable. The results demonstrate that the SARA-based scheme produces better surface SW radiative fluxes than the MODIS-based estimates provided in this and other similar studies and that these fluxes are comparable to existing CERES data products which have been tested over the SGP.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of Urmia Lake water using spaceborne multisensor data and 3D modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Preserving aquatic ecosystems and water resources management is crucial in arid and semi-arid regions for anthropogenic reasons and climate change. In recent decades, the water level of the largest lake in Iran, Urmia Lake, has decreased sharply, which has become a major environmental concern in Iran and the region. The efforts to revive the lake concerns the amount of water required for restoration. This study monitored and assessed Urmia Lake status over a period of 30 years (1984 to 2014) using remotely sensed data. A novel method is proposed that generates a lakebed digital elevation model (LBDEM) for Urmia Lake based on time series images from Landsat satellites, water level field measurements, remote sensing techniques, GIS, and 3D modeling. The volume of water required to restore the Lake water level to that of previous years and the ecological water level was calculated based on LBDEM. The results indicate a marked change in the area and volume of the lake from its maximum water level in 1998 to its minimum level in 2014. During this period, 86% of the lake became a salt desert and the volume of the lake water in 2013 was just 0.83% of the 1998 volume. The volume of water required to restore Urmia Lake from benchmark status (in 2014) to ecological water level (1274.10 m) is 12.546 Bm(3), excluding evaporation. The results and the proposed method can be used by national and international environmental organizations to monitor and assess the status of Urmia Lake and support them in decision-making.

TI  - Combining Estimation of Green Vegetation Fraction in an Arid Region from Landsat 7 ETM+ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC), or green vegetation fraction, is an important parameter for characterizing conditions of the land surface vegetation, and also a key variable of models for simulating cycles of water, carbon and energy on the land surface. There are several types of FVC estimation models using remote sensing data, and evaluating their performance over a specific region is of great significance. Therefore, this study firstly evaluated three types of FVC estimation models using Landsat 7 ETM+ data in an agriculture region of Heihe River Basin, China, and then proposed a combination strategy from different individual models to improve the FVC estimation accuracy, which employed the multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian model average (BMA) methods. The validation results indicated that the spectral mixture analysis model with three endmembers (SMA3) achieved the best FVC estimation accuracy (determination coefficient (R-2) = 0.902, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.076) among the seven individual models using Landsat 7 ETM+ data. In addition, the MLR and BMA combination methods could both improve FVC estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.913, RMSE = 0.063 and R-2 = 0.904, RMSE = 0.069 for MLR and BMA, respectively). Therefore, it could be concluded that both MLR and BMA combination methods integrating FVC estimates from different models using Landsat 7 ETM+ data could effectively weaken the estimation errors of individual models and improve the final FVC estimation accuracy.

TI  - Can contemporary satellites estimate swell dissipation rate?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Swell dissipation can influence air-sea interactions and is an error source in numerical models. Remote sensors, including altimeters and synthetic aperture radars, were employed to estimate swell dissipation rates in previous studies. A detailed error analysis is conducted here to better understand the results of these studies. With the help of a numerical model, we find that the point source model cannot separate swell dissipation from frequency dispersion and angular spreading effectively. Monte Carlo simulations of remotely sensing an ideal swell packet show that the accuracy of the estimated dissipation rate depends on the number, the span, and the wave height error of the observations on the swell track. The results also demonstrate that the dependence between estimated dissipation rates and wave steepness is an inherent relation from the fitting process which cannot prove that the boundary-layer turbulence is the leading reason for swell dissipation. Both the point source and the measurement errors of wave heights cause large errors of estimated dissipation rates. Comparing the overall error with the estimated dissipation rates, this study shows that the present swell tracking scheme using satellite data is sufficient to estimate a mean dissipation rate statistically through many swell tracks but is insufficient for case studies of swell dissipation. Besides, a buffer analysis shows that islands might cause more potential errors in many swell tracks used in previous studies, and ideal locations for future experiments are also identified. More advanced techniques are required for a better understanding of swell dissipation.

TI  - BeiDou Geostationary Satellite Code Bias Modeling Using Fengyun-3C Onboard Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validated and investigated elevation- and frequency-dependent systematic biases observed in ground-based code measurements of the Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite system, using the onboard BeiDou code measurement data from the Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun-3C. Particularly for geostationary earth orbit satellites, sky-view coverage can be achieved over the entire elevation and azimuth angle ranges with the available onboard tracking data, which is more favorable to modeling code biases. Apart from the BeiDou-satellite-induced biases, the onboard BeiDou code multipath effects also indicate pronounced near-field systematic biases that depend only on signal frequency and the line-of-sight directions. To correct these biases, we developed a proposed code correction model by estimating the BeiDou-satellite-induced biases as linear piece-wise functions in different satellite groups and the near-field systematic biases in a grid approach. To validate the code bias model, we carried out orbit determination using single-frequency BeiDou data with and without code bias corrections applied. Orbit precision statistics indicate that those code biases can seriously degrade single-frequency orbit determination. After the correction model was applied, the orbit position errors, 3D root mean square, were reduced from 150.6 to 56.3 cm.

TI  - Quantification of landscape transformation due to the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in Zimbabwe using remotely sensed data
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - After independence, Zimbabwe adopted two major land reform programmes to address the racially skewed land ownership. Due to the perceived failure of these programmes, the country embarked on a highly politicised and forceful acquisition and re-distribution of white owned commercial farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP). Whereas a large number of Zimbabweans have been allocated land under the programme, there has been a significant decline in agricultural productivity and an increase in degradation of land and associated resources. Popular opinion has even suggested the country's current socio-economic challenges are linked to the programme. Mitigating land degradation, enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting natural resources sustainability requires an objective understanding and determination landscape transformation within relevant administrative decision making spatial extents. In this study, we adopted multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery to determine landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP in Chipinge administrative district, characterised by heterogeneous land usage and natural resources. Major land use-land-cover types were determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm and accuracy established using field survey and ancillary data. Results show significant landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP. Specifically, there was a decline in plantations, small farms, water bodies and forests and an increase in bare areas and settlements. This study demonstrates the value of remotely data in monitoring landscape transformation arising from a shift in policy. Furthermore, these results provide an insight into multi-temporal spatial changes in cultivated, natural and degraded lands, valuable for designing measures to improve landscape productivity and to adopt relevant rehabilitation measures. Understanding multi-temporal landscape change within an administrative boundary is particularly valuable for area specific planning, policy formulation and adoption of desired mitigation measures.

TI  - A lake-centric geospatial database to guide research and inform management decisions in an Arctic watershed in northern Alaska experiencing climate and land-use changes
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are dominant and diverse landscape features in the Arctic, but conventional land cover classification schemes typically map them as a single uniform class. Here, we present a detailed lake-centric geospatial database for an Arctic watershed in northern Alaska. We developed a GIS dataset consisting of 4362 lakes that provides information on lake morphometry, hydrologic connectivity, surface area dynamics, surrounding terrestrial ecotypes, and other important conditions describing Arctic lakes. Analyzing the geospatial database relative to fish and bird survey data shows relations to lake depth and hydrologic connectivity, which are being used to guide research and aid in the management of aquatic resources in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Further development of similar geospatial databases is needed to better understand and plan for the impacts of ongoing climate and land-use changes occurring across lake-rich landscapes in the Arctic.

TI  - The SMAP Level 4 Carbon Product for Monitoring Ecosystem Land-Atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> Exchange
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product provides model estimates of the Net Ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) incorporating SMAP soil moisture information. The L4C product includes NEE, computed as total ecosystem respiration less gross photosynthesis, at a daily time step posted to a 9-km global grid by plant functional type. Component carbon fluxes, surface soil organic carbon stocks, underlying environmental constraints, and detailed uncertainty metrics are also included. The L4C model is driven by the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture data assimilation product, with additional inputs from the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 weather analysis, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite vegetation data. The L4C data record extends from March 31, 2015 to present with ongoing production and 8-12 day latency. Comparisons against concurrent global CO2 eddy flux tower measurements, satellite solar-induced canopy florescence, and other independent observation benchmarks show favorable L4C performance and accuracy, capturing the dynamic biosphere response to recent weather anomalies. Model experiments and L4C spatiotemporal variability were analyzed to understand the independent value of soil moisture and SMAP observations relative to other sources of input information. This analysis highlights the potential for microwave observations to inform models where soil moisture strongly controls land CO2 flux variability; however, skill improvement relative to flux towers is not yet discernable within the relatively short validation period. These results indicate that SMAP provides a unique and promising capability for monitoring the linked global terrestrial water and carbon cycles.

TI  - Analysis of sentinel node positivity in primary cutaneous melanoma: an 8-year single institution experience
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard method for determining the pathologic status of the regional lymph nodes.The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and clinicopathologic factors predictive of SLN positivity, and to evaluate the prognostic importance of SLNB in patients with cutaneous melanoma.We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent SLNB for primary melanoma at our institution from 2005 to 2012. Statistical analysis was performed using chi (2) and Fischer exact test.In total, 318 patients underwent SLNB, of which 65 were for thin melanoma (<= 1 mm). There were 36 positive SLNB, 278 negative SLNB and in four cases the SLN was not located. The incidence rate for SLNB was 11.3% overall and 1.5% in thin melanomas alone. Statistical analysis identified Breslow thickness > 1 mm (P = 0.006), Clark level >= IV (P = 0.004) and age < 75 years (P = 0.035) as the strongest predictors of SLN positivity. Our overall false negativity rate was 20% (9/45) with one case of false-negative SLNB in thin melanomas.Breslow thickness of the primary tumour remains the strongest predictor of SLN positivity. Our findings point to a possible limited role for SLNB in thin melanoma due to its low positivity rate, associated false-negative rate and related morbidity.

TI  - A call to strengthen the Burkina Faso pharmacovigilance system
T2  - SANTE PUBLIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale deployment of new medicines has been observed over the last two decades in many Sub-Saharan Africa countries faced with major public health issues such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. However, some of these medicines may be responsible for varying degrees of toxicity, with adverse drug reactions leading to decreased compliance or even discontinuation of treatment. Pharmacovigilance systems therefore had to be set up in these countries, such as in Burkina Faso, West Africa, which initiated the organization of pharmacovigilance activities in 2008. Despite this progress, the systems in place have not yet achieved a sufficient level of performance to deal with drug-related health issues, highlighting the need for further actions. Pharmacovigilance in Burkina Faso can be strengthened at multiple levels: pre-service and in-service training of health workers; the establishment of active surveillance based on sentinel sites; informing the public and raising awareness; and strengthening national coordination.

TI  - An Improved Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) Distributed Hydrological Model and Its Verification in Ganjiang River Basin, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupled routing and excess storage (CREST) distributed hydrological model has been applied regionally and globally for years. With the development of remote sensing, requirements for data assimilation and integration have become new challenges for the CREST model. In this paper, an improved CREST model version 3.0 (Tsinghua University and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Beijing, China) is proposed to enable the use of remotely-sensed data and to further improve model performance. Version 3.0 model's runoff generation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration based on three soil layers to make the CREST model friendly to remote sensing products such as soil moisture. A free water reservoir-based module which separates three runoff components and a four mechanism-based cell-to-cell routing module are also developed. Traditional CREST and CREST 3.0 are applied in the Ganjiang River basin, China to compare their simulation capability and applicability. Research results indicate that CREST 3.0 outperforms the traditional model and has good application prospects in data assimilation, flood forecasting, and water resources planning and management applications.

TI  - Outcome following sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided decisions in breast cancer patients with conversion from positive to negative axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes achieve complete node remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in this situation is uncertain. This study evaluated the outcomes of sentinel biopsy-guided decisions in patients who had conversion of axillary nodes from clinically positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.We reviewed the records of 1247 patients from five hospitals in Korea who had breast cancer with clinically axillary lymph node-positive status and negative conversion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 2005 and 2012. Patients who underwent axillary operations with sentinel biopsy-guided decisions (Group A) were compared with patients who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy (Group B). Axillary node recurrence and distant recurrence-free survival were compared.There were 428 cases in Group A and 819 in Group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that recurrence-free survivals were not significantly different between Groups A and B (4-year axillary recurrence-free survival: 97.8 vs. 99.0%; p = 0.148). Multivariate analysis also indicated the two groups had no significant difference in axillary and distant recurrence-free survival.For breast cancer patients who had clinical conversion of axillary lymph nodes from positive to negative following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary surgery, and axillary lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy had similar rates of recurrence. Thus, sentinel biopsy-guided axillary operation in breast cancer patients who have clinically axillary lymph node positive to negative conversion following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a useful strategy.

TI  - Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as the sole method for sentinel node biopsy detection in patients with breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles is a novel method in breast cancer. Several studies have verified the non-inferiority of SPIO compared with the standard use of radioisotope Tc-99m with or without blue dye. The aim of the MONOS study presented here was to evaluate the use of SPIO as a sole tracer and the efficacy of tracer injection in the preoperative setting.Methods: This prospective cohort study was carried out in two hospitals, one using Tc-99m and the other SPIO. Tc-99m was injected in the morning of the day of surgery or the day before. SPIO was either injected before surgery in the outpatient clinic or 1 h before the operation.Results: A total of 338 consecutive patients with breast cancer underwent 343 procedures; SPIO nanoparticles were used in 184 procedures and Tc-99m-labelled tracer in 159. Detection rates for SPIO and Tc-99m were 95.6 and 96.9 per cent respectively (P = 0.537). All nodes with SPIO uptake were coloured brown. Fewer nodes were retrieved with SPIO (mean 1.35 versus 1.89), regardless of whether blue dye was used (P < 0.001). Preoperative SPIO injection (58.7 per cent of procedures), a median of 16 (range 2-27) days before the procedure, was associated with a better tracer-specific detection rate (95.3 versus 86 per cent; P = 0.031) and retrieval of more nodes (mean 1.43 versus 1.03; P < 0.001) than perioperative administration. Skin staining was present in 39.9 per cent of patients, and was related to breast-conserving surgery and periareolar injection.Conclusion: The use of SPIO alone is a safe alternative, with results comparable to those of the standard dual technique using Tc-99m and blue dye. The efficacy of injection in the preoperative setting simplifies logistics and improves performance. Skin staining can be prevented by a deeper peritumoral injection.

TI  - Microhabitat differences in crab assemblage structures in a subtropical mangrove estuary on Iriomote Island, southern Japan
T2  - FISHERIES SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crab assemblage structures in sandy flat, muddy flat and mangrove forest microhabitats in a mangrove estuary of the Urauchi River, Iriomote Island, southern Japan, differed clearly among the three microhabitats, species and individual numbers being greater inside the mangrove forest than on the flats. A similarity index showed distinct differences in species composition among the microhabitat assemblages, primarily due to the differential distributions of dominant species, such as the soldier crab Mictyris guinotae, sentinel crab Macrophthalmus convexus and sesarmid crab Perisesarma bidens. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the differences likely arose from among-microhabitat differences in the physical environment, the mangrove forest being characterized mainly by structurally complex mangrove roots, lower soil porewater temperatures and higher relative substrate elevation, the sandy flat by lower organic content of the sediment and higher porewater oxygen amount, and the muddy flat by higher levels of sediment water and organic material. The findings suggested that microhabitat-related physical differences are important factors determining crab distribution patterns in mangrove estuaries.

TI  - Interaction of Sea Breeze and Deep Convection over the Northeastern Adriatic Coast: An Analysis of Sensitivity Experiments Using a High-Resolution Mesoscale Model
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the sensitivity of a high-resolution mesoscale atmospheric model in the model reproduction of thermally induced local wind (i.e., sea breezes, SB) on the development of deep convection (Cb). The three chosen cases are simulated by the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model at three (nested) model domains, whereas the area of the interest is Istria (peninsula in the northeastern Adriatic). The sensitivity tests are accomplished by modifying (1) the model setup, (2) the model topography and (3) the sea surface temperature (SST) distribution. The first set of simulations (over the three 1.5-day periods during summer) is conducted by modifying the model setup, i.e., microphysics and the boundary layer parameterizations. The same events are simulated with the modified topography where the mountain heights in Istria are reduced to 30% of their initial height. The SST distribution has two representations in the model: a constant SST field from the ECMWF skin temperature analysis and a varying SST field, which is provided by hourly geostationary satellite data. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments is statistically analyzed through several different approaches (i.e., the standard statistical measures, the spectral method and the image moment analysis). The overall model evaluation of each model setup revealed certain advantages of one model setup over the others. The numerical tests with the modified topography showed the influence of reducing the mountains heights on the pre-thunderstorm characteristics due to: (1) decrease of sensible heat flux and mid-tropospheric moisture and (2) change of slope-SB wind system. They consequently affect the evolution and dimensions of SBs and the features of the thunderstorm itself: timing, location and intensity (weaker storm). The implementation of the varying SST field in the model have an impact on the characteristics and dynamics of the SB and finally on the accuracy of Cb evolution, duration and the intensity. SST variations emphasized the importance of the phase matching in both daytime cycles of SB and Cb due to their extremely strong nonlinear relationship.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire frequency, relative area burned, and fire return intervals (FRI) have been studied in larchdominated forests along the transect from the southern (45A degrees N) to the northern (73A degrees N) distribution limits of larch stands based on analysis of satellite imagery (NOAA/AVHRR, Terra/MODIS; 1996-2015) and collection of tree cross cuts with fire scars. A significant increasing trend in fire extent (R (2) = 0.50, p < 0.05) has been revealed. Histograms of fire extent and frequency are bimodal in the southern and middle taiga (with peaks in spring-summer and late summer-autumn periods) but become unimodal toward the north (> 55A degrees N). The length of FRI increases from 80 years at 62A degrees N to similar to 200 years at the Arctic Circle and reaches similar to 300 years near the northern limit of larch stands, showing a significant inverse correlation with the length of fire season (r =-0.69). In turn, the length of fire season, area burned and FRI are closely correlated with latitudinal variation in solar irradiance (r = 0.97, 0.81, and -0.95, respectively).

TI  - Trends in Phenological Parameters and Relationship Between Land Surface Phenology and Climate Data in the Hyrcanian Forests of Iran
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation activity may be changed in response to climate variability by affecting seasonality and phenological events. Monitoring of land surface phenological changes play a key role in understanding feedback of ecosystem dynamics. This study focuses on the analysis of trends in land surface phenology derived parameters using normalized difference vegetation index time series based on Global Inventory Monitoring and Mapping Studies data in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran covering the period 1981-2012. First, we applied interpolation for data reconstruction in order to remove outliers and cloud contamination in time series. Phenological parameters were retrieved by using the midpoint approach, whereas trends were estimated using the Theil-Sen approach. Correlation coefficients were evaluated from multiple linear regression between phenological parameters against temperature and precipitation time series. Significant Mann-Kendall test analysis indicate average start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) increased by -0.16 and +0.14 days per year, respectively. Results of significant trend analysis showed that later EOS was associated with increasing temperature trends and we found strongest relationships between temperature and phenological parameters in the west of the Hyrcanian forests, where precipitation was abundant. Moreover, SOS correlated strongly with total precipitation and mean temperature. This study allows us to better estimate the drivers affecting the vegetation dynamics in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran.

TI  - Efficient Evaluation of Multichannel SAR Data Recombination Filters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well-established technique for observing the Earth on a global scale. As applications become more demanding, it is desirable to overcome the limitations imposed by the SAR principle, one of which is the tradeoff between the swath width and the instantaneous azimuth bandwidth, determining the resolution. Recombination of multiple channels with displaced phase centers has been proposed as a convenient way to create high resolution wide-swath images. We analyze various approximations made in the channel transfer functions and their impact on the reconstruction result using examples inspired by current imaging modes of the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions. In order to do so, we introduce an efficient method to assess the quality of reconstruction filters for an arbitrary number of channels without the need of full time-domain simulations.

TI  - Estimation of premature forests in Georgia (USA) using US Forest Service FIA data and Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We used geographic information system applications and statistical analyses to classify young, premature forest areas in southeastern Georgia using combined data from Landsat TM 5 satellite imagery and ground inventory data. We defined premature stands as forests with trees up to 15 years old. We estimated the premature forest areas using three methods: maximum likelihood classification (MLC), regression analysis, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) modeling. Overall accuracy (OA) of classifying the premature forest using MLC was 82% and the Kappa coefficient of agreement was 0.63, which was the highest among the methods that we have tested. The kNN approach ranked second in accuracy with OA of 61% and a Kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.22. Regression analysis yielded an OA of 57% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.14. We conclude that Landsat imagery can be effectively used for estimating premature forest areas in combination with image processing classifiers such as MLC.

TI  - ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION OF NON-PALPABLE AND SUSPICIOUS AXILLARY LYMPH NODES WITH SUBSEQUENT REMOVAL AFTER TATTOOING: FALSE-NEGATIVE RESULTS AND CONCORDANCE WITH SENTINEL LYMPH NODES
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-guided FNA) for axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) is currently used with various techniques for the initial staging of breast cancer and tagging of ALNs. With the implementation of the tattooing of biopsied ALNs, the rate of false-negative results of US-guided FNA for non-palpable and suspicious ALNs and concordance with sentinel lymph nodes were determined by node-to node analyses. A total of 61 patients with breast cancer had negative results for metastasis on US-guided FNA of their non-palpable and suspicious ALNs. The biopsied ALNs were tattooed with an injection of 1-3 mL Charcotrace (Phebra, Lane Cove West, Australia) ink and removed during sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection. We determined the rate of false-negative results and concordance with the sentinel lymph nodes by a retrospective review of surgical and pathologic findings. The association of false-negative results with clinical and imaging factors was evaluated using logistic regression. Of the 61 ALNs with negative results for US-guided FNA, 13 (21%) had metastases on final pathology. In 56 of 61 ALNs (92%), tattooed ALNs corresponded to the sentinel lymph nodes. Among the 5 patients (8%) without correspondence, 1 patient (2%) had 2 metastatic ALNs of 1 tattooed node and 1 sentinel lymph node. In multivariate analysis, atypical cells on FNA results (odds ratio 5 20.7, p = 0.040) was independently associated with false-negative FNA results. False-negative ALNs after US-guided FNA occur at a rate of 21% and most of the tattooed ALNs showed concordance with sentinel lymph nodes.

AB  - A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with cecal cancer, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, peritoneum dissemination, and left breast cancer. We administered mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab for cecal cancer and an aromatase inhibitor for her breast cancer. She received 7 courses of systemic chemotherapy and showed a partial response. She additionally received 5 courses of mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab. We performed ileocecal resection, sigmoidectomy, right oophorectomy, dissection of the para-aortic lymph nodes, and peritoneal dissemination. The histopathological findings revealed adenocarcinoma, ypT3, ypN0, ycM0, ypStage II (therapeutic effect Grade 2). One month later, she underwent an enforced left breast segmental resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy(0/2). The results of the pathological examination indicated no residual cancers (therapeutic effect Grade 3). The patient is now in good health and was administered S-1 as an outpatient.

TI  - Low-Cloud Feedbacks from Cloud-Controlling Factors: A Review
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The response to warming of tropical low-level clouds including both marine stratocumulus and trade cumulus is a major source of uncertainty in projections of future climate. Climate model simulations of the response vary widely, reflecting the difficulty the models have in simulating these clouds. These inadequacies have led to alternative approaches to predict low-cloud feedbacks. Here, we review an observational approach that relies on the assumption that observed relationships between low clouds and the "cloud-controlling factors" of the large-scale environment are invariant across time-scales. With this assumption, and given predictions of how the cloud-controlling factors change with climate warming, one can predict low-cloud feedbacks without using any model simulation of low clouds. We discuss both fundamental and implementation issues with this approach and suggest steps that could reduce uncertainty in the predicted low-cloud feedback. Recent studies using this approach predict that the tropical low-cloud feedback is positive mainly due to the observation that reflection of solar radiation by low clouds decreases as temperature increases, holding all other cloud-controlling factors fixed. The positive feedback from temperature is partially offset by a negative feedback from the tendency for the inversion strength to increase in a warming world, with other cloud-controlling factors playing a smaller role. A consensus estimate from these studies for the contribution of tropical low clouds to the global mean cloud feedback is 0.25 +/- 0.18 W m(-2) K-1 (90% confidence interval), suggesting it is very unlikely that tropical low clouds reduce total global cloud feedback. Because the prediction of positive tropical low-cloud feedback with this approach is consistent with independent evidence from low-cloud feedback studies using high-resolution cloud models, progress is being made in reducing this key climate uncertainty.

TI  - Predicting Top-of-Atmosphere Thermal Radiance Using MERRA-2 Atmospheric Data with Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image data from space-borne thermal infrared (IR) sensors are used for a variety of applications, however they are often limited by their temporal resolution (i.e., repeat coverage). To potentially increase the temporal availability of thermal image data, a study was performed to determine the extent to which thermal image data can be simulated from available atmospheric and surface data. The work conducted here explored the use of Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) developed by The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to predict top-of-atmosphere (TOA) thermal IR radiance globally at time scales finer than available satellite data. For this case study, TOA radiance data was derived for band 31 (10.97 m) of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Two approaches have been followed, namely an atmospheric radiative transfer forward modeling approach and a supervised learning approach. The first approach uses forward modeling to predict TOA radiance from the available surface and atmospheric data. The second approach applied four different supervised learning algorithms to the atmospheric data. The algorithms included a linear least squares regression model, a non-linear support vector regression (SVR) model, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a convolutional neural network (CNN). This research found that the multi-layer perceptron model produced the lowest overall error rates with an root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.36 W/m(2) <bold>sr</bold> m when compared to actual Terra/MODIS band 31 image data. These studies found that for radiances above 6 W/m(2) <bold>sr</bold> m, the forward modeling approach could predict TOA radiance to within 12 percent, and the best supervised learning approach can predict TOA to within 11 percent.

AB  - The multicentric/multifocal form of breast cancer has been considered as relative contraindicationfor breast conserving surgery. According to the results of the studies conducted in the last century, the local recurrence rate of the disease after breast conserving surgeries of multicentric/multifocal breast cancer exceeds 40%. Thus these data were considered as main argument for mastectomy advocates, as non-alternative surgical treatment in these cases. Wide clinical application of oncoplastic surgical techniques gave us possibilities to resolve dilemma: excise tumor - containing quadrant with achieving clear margins and satisfactory cosmetic outcome, without increasing risk of disease-related complications. In cases of multicentricity/ multicocality of breast cancer, total axillary lymphadenectomy might be avoided when size of tumor is less than 2 cm and there are no signs of malignant involvement of axillary lymph nodes; In case of clinically negative axillary lymph nodes - sentinel lymph node biopsy might be the standard option. Of course, adjuvant treatment should be planned in accordance with the principles of personalized medicine, based on the results of multidisciplinary review and taking into consideration modern advanced guidelines and recommendations.

TI  - Estimation of canopy carotenoid content of winter wheat using multi-angle hyperspectral data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise estimation of carotenoid (Car) content in crops, using remote sensing data, could be helpful for agricultural resources management. Conventional methods for Car content estimation were mostly based on reflectance data acquired from nadir direction. However, reflectance acquired at this direction is highly influenced by canopy structure and soil background reflectance. Off-nadir observation is less impacted, and multi-angle viewing data are proven to contain additional information rarely exploited for crop Car content estimation. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of multi-angle observation data for winter wheat canopy Car content estimation. Canopy spectral reflectance was measured from nadir as well as from a series of off-nadir directions during different growing stages of winter wheat, with concurrent canopy Car content measurements. Correlation analyses were performed between Car content and the original and continuum removed spectral reflectance. Spectral features and previously published indices were derived from data obtained at different viewing angles and were tested for Car content estimation. Results showed that spectral features and indices obtained from backscattering directions between 20 degrees and 40 degrees view zenith angle had a stronger correlation with Car content than that from the nadir direction, and the strongest correlation was observed from about 30 degrees backscattering direction. Spectral absorption depth at 500 nm derived from spectral data obtained from 30 degrees backscattering direction was found to reduce the difference induced by plant cultivars greatly. It was the most suitable for winter wheat canopy Car estimation, with a coefficient of determination 0.79 and a root mean square error of 19.03 mg/m(2). This work indicates the importance of taking viewing geometry effect into account when using spectral features/indices and provides new insight in the application of multi-angle remote sensing for the estimation of crop physiology.

TI  - Conditional Survival-Based "Abbreviated" Routine Cancer Surveillance for Pathologic Stage IB Melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - A negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for stage IB (T1b/T2a N0) melanoma would predict an excellent long-term prognosis. Combined with the concept of conditional survival, an "abbreviated" cancer surveillance strategy was implemented to reduce the number of visits and total length of follow-up. Retrospective review of all pathologic stage IB melanoma patients (negative SLNB) at a single institution between 2006 and 2008 after implementation of an "abbreviated" cancer surveillance; clinic visits every six months for five years followed by one annual visit (total follow-up six years). Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and information regarding recurrences were obtained. Recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survival were calculated. Eighty-seven patients underwent the "abbreviated" cancer surveillance. Median age was 55.4 years and 50.6 per cent were male. Median Breslow thickness was 1.1 mm (range 0.5-2.0 mm) and 1.1 per cent were ulcerated. Primary tumor site was 49 per cent extremities, 39 per cent trunk, and 12 per cent head/ neck. Median follow-up was 68.6 months. Five-year recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survivals were 89, 95, and 88 per cent, respectively. During surveillance, 10 patients had concerning symptoms or physical findings prompting subsequent workup, all of which were negative for recurrence/metastases. There were only three true melanoma recurrences; all were distant metastases and presented symptomatically between scheduled follow-up visits. In light of the excellent prognosis for pathologic (SLNB negative) stage IB melanoma, an "abbreviated" cancer surveillance schedule based on conditional survival would reduce both direct and indirect costs in this cohort. The few recurrences were symptomatic and unlikely to have changed with more intensive surveillance.

TI  - Impact of drought and normal monsoon scenarios on aerosol induced radiative forcing and atmospheric heating in Varanasi over middle Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations on aerosols with specific emphasis to black carbon (BC) are reported for an urban site over middle Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), South Asia. Emphases are made to evaluate variation in BC concentrations during typical monsoon season (June-September, JJAS) from 2009 to 2011, and to recognize its impact on aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and atmospheric heating. Almost entire Indian sub-continent experienced a drought year in 2009 before achieving a normal monsoon in 2010 and 2011. The ground monitoring station in Varanasi over middle-IGP experienced minimum monsoonal rain during 2009 drought year (total monsoon rain: 437.3 mm), which gradually increased during 2010 (deficit monsoon, 613.4 mm), before achieving a normal monsoon in year 2011 (1207.0 mm). The BC mass loading during drought year was relatively high (mean +/- SD: 7.0 +/- 3.3; range: 5.3-8.8 mu g m(-3)) compared to 2010 (4.9 +/- 2.1, 3.7-5.8 mu g m(-3)) and 2011 (4.6 +/- 2.1, 3.2-5.2 mu g m(-3)). The increase in BC aerosols especially during drought year was associated to lower wind speed and reduced rate of wet removal, which potentially enhanced BC loading in comparison to years with normal monsoon. Columnar aerosol loading in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD) was retrieved from space-borne MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on-board Terra satellite. It has revealed high AOD over Varanasi during drought (2009: 1.03 +/- 0.15) and deficit monsoon (2010: 1.07 +/- 0.53) before being reduced during 2011 (0.89 +/- 0.20). Conclusively, a radiative transfer model was run to estimate the ARF for composite aerosols for both surface (SUF), atmosphere (ATM) and top of the atmosphere (TOA). The 2009 drought year was found to have reasonably higher ATM and SUF forcing (ATM: 105; SUF: - 122 W m(-2)) in comparison to deficit (ATM: 61; SUF: - 88 W m(-2)) and normal (ATM: 67; SUF: -89 W m(-2)) monsoon scenarios. The lower atmosphere heating rates during 2009 monsoon was also recorded to be as high as 2.9 K day(-1) in comparison to 2010 (1.7 K day(-1)) and 2011 (1.9 K day(-1)). Such findings provide meaningful outcomes in terms of climatic effects of BC aerosols and their associated inference on Indian summer monsoon.Capsule: BC induced aerosol radiative forcing during 2009 drought year was higher in comparison to deficit (2010) and normal (2011) monsoon scenarios over middle IGP.

TI  - Retrieval of Rice Crop Growth Variables Using Multi-Temporal RISAT-1 Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - Russian Agricultural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing sensors have great potential due to their capability to operate in any weather condition for the wide range of agricultural applications. The rice crop variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and plant height (PH) were retrieved for the monitoring of crop growth to improve crop production. The interaction of rice crop variables with medium spatial resolution (25 m) Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) data for Varanasi district, India, was examined. The multi-temporal dual polarization (HH- and HV-) images having frequency 5.35 GHz at C-band were investigated. Crop growth profile derived from the analysis of temporal backscattering (July-October, 2013) showed 3-4 dB difference throughout its growth cycle. The rice crop variables were retrieved by the inversion of polynomial models and showed higher values of coefficient of determination (R-2) for HH-polarization in comparison to HV-polarization.

TI  - Exploring Subpixel Learning Algorithms for Estimating Global Land Cover Fractions from Satellite Data Using High Performance Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) refers to the physical and biological cover present over the Earth's surface in terms of the natural environment such as vegetation, water, bare soil, etc. Most LC features occur at finer spatial scales compared to the resolution of primary remote sensing satellites. Therefore, observed data are a mixture of spectral signatures of two or more LC features resulting in mixed pixels. One solution to the mixed pixel problem is the use of subpixel learning algorithms to disintegrate the pixel spectrum into its constituent spectra. Despite the popularity and existing research conducted on the topic, the most appropriate approach is still under debate. As an attempt to address this question, we compared the performance of several subpixel learning algorithms based on least squares, sparse regression, signal-subspace and geometrical methods. Analysis of the results obtained through computer-simulated and Landsat data indicated that fully constrained least squares (FCLS) outperformed the other techniques. Further, FCLS was used to unmix global Web-Enabled Landsat Data to obtain abundances of substrate (S), vegetation (V) and dark object (D) classes. Due to the sheer nature of data and computational needs, we leveraged the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) high-performance computing architecture to optimize and scale our algorithm for large-scale processing. Subsequently, the S-V-D abundance maps were characterized into four classes, namely forest, farmland, water and urban areas (in conjunction with nighttime lights data) over California, USA using a random forest classifier. Validation of these LC maps with the National Land Cover Database 2011 products and North American Forest Dynamics static forest map shows a 6% improvement in unmixing-based classification relative to per-pixel classification. As such, abundance maps continue to offer a useful alternative to high-spatial-resolution classified maps for forest inventory analysis, multi-class mapping, multi-temporal trend analysis, etc.

TI  - Pilot-study on the feasibility of sentinel node navigation surgery in combination with thoracolaparoscopic lymphadenectomy without esophagectomy in early esophageal adenocarcinoma patients
T2  - DISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-risk submucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma's might be treated curatively by means of radical endoscopic resection, followed by thoracolaparoscopic lymphadenectomy without concomitant esophagectomy. A preclinical study has shown the feasibility and safety of this approach; however, no studies are performed in a clinical setting. In addition, sentinel node navigation surgery could be valuable in tailoring the extent of the lymphadenectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of thoracolaparoscopic lymphadenectomy without esophagectomy (phase I) and sentinel node navigation surgery (phase II) in patients with early esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients with T1N0M0 early esophageal adenocarcinoma scheduled for esophagectomy without neoadjuvant therapy were included. Phase I: Two-field, esophagus preserving, thoracolaparoscopic lymphadenectomy was performed, followed by esophagectomy in the same session. Primary outcome parameters were the number of lymph nodes resected, and number of retained lymph nodes in the esophagectomy specimen. Phase II: A radioactive tracer was injected endoscopically the day before surgery. Static imaging was performed 15 and 120 minutes after injection. The day of surgery, sentinel node navigation surgery followed by esophagectomy was performed. Primary outcome parameters were the percentage of patients with a detectable sentinel node, and the concordance between static imaging and probe-based detection of sentinel node. Phase I: Five patients were included, and a median of 30 (IQR: 25-46) lymph nodes was resected. A median of 6 (IQR: 2-9) retained lymph nodes was found in the esophagectomy specimen. No acute adverse events occurred, but near the end of lymphadenectomy esophageal discoloration was observed, possibly indicating ischemia. Phase II: In all five included patients sentinel nodes could be visualized and resected, at a median of 3 (IQR: 2-5) locations. There was a high concordance between imaging and probe-based detection of sentinel nodes. In conclusion, sentinel node navigation surgery followed by lymphadenectomy without concomitant esophagectomy seems feasible in patients with high-risk submucosal early esophageal adenocarcinoma. More evidence is however needed before applying this technique in clinical practice.

TI  - Circa 2010 Land Cover of Canada: Local Optimization Methodology and Product Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information is necessary for a large range of environmental applications related to climate impacts and adaption, emergency response, wildlife habitat, etc. In Canada, a 2008 user survey indicated that the most practical land cover data is provided in a nationwide 30 m spatial resolution format, with an update frequency of five years. In response to this need, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) has generated a 30 m land cover map of Canada for the base year 2010, as the first of a planned series of maps to be updated every five years, or more frequently. This land cover dataset is also the Canadian contribution to the 30 m spatial resolution 2010 Land Cover Map of North America, which is produced by Mexican, American and Canadian government institutions under a collaboration called the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS). This paper describes the mapping approach used for generating this land cover dataset for Canada from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) Landsat sensor observations. The innovative part of the mapping approach is the local optimization of the land cover classifier, which has resulted in increased spatial consistency and accuracy. Training and classifying with locally confined reference samples over a large number of partially overlapping areas (i.e., moving windows) ensures the optimization of the classifier to a local land cover distribution, and decreases the negative effect of signature extension. A weighted combination of labels, which is determined by the classifier in overlapping windows, defines the final label for each pixel. Since the approach requires extensive computation, it has been developed and deployed using the Government of Canada's High-Performance Computing Center (HPC). An accuracy assessment based on 2811 randomly distributed samples shows that land cover data produced with this new approach has achieved 76.60% accuracy with no marked spatial disparities.

TI  - Pure acinic cell carcinoma of the breast A case report and literature review
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale: Acinic cell carcinoma (AcCC) of the breast is a rare histological type of malignant epithelial neoplasm exhibiting acinic cell differentiation.Patient concerns: A 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a palpable mass over the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.Diagnoses: Physical examination revealed an irregular mass in the lateral upper quadrant of the left breast, approximately 1.5cm in diameter. Histologically, the tumor cells were round to oval, had displaced nuclei with striking single nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm, and contained large coarse cytoplasmic granules. They showed an infiltrating growth pattern with a combination of cystic and cribriform feature. We diagnosed the tumor as AcCC of the breast.Interventions: The patient was given a simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. After the surgery, AcCC of the breast was confirmed histologically.Outcomes: The patient was symptom free 3months after surgery.Lessons: AcCC of the breast is a very rare tumor, and its prognosis appears to be good. Thus, treatment followed the guidelines for invasive breast carcinoma and no further therapy was suggested by oncologists based on the tumor biology.

TI  - Land-use regime shift triggered the recent degradation of alpine pastures in Nyanpo Yutse of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is a cultural landscape where traditional pastoralism substantially shaped the present mosaic structure of the alpine grasslands. During the past two decades, however, severe grassland degradations of this region has been considered as the major ecological concern.In this study we took an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the impact of the historical land-use regimes to the observed degradation, by conducting an in-depth case study in a local pastoral village in the Nyanpo Yutse region.Firstly, we mapped historical land-use intensities (LUIs) of the study area at land-use transition time points of 1970s, 1984, 1994 and 2015 with oral history and participatory GIS (PGIS) approaches. Secondly, we conducted Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series analysis to detect the temporal and spatial patterns of the degradation. Thirdly, we discussed the causal relations between the land-use and land-cover changes.Livestock and pasture privatization from 1984 to 1994 created the land-use regime shift which resulted in a marked increase in LUIs and decreased pastoral mobility. The LUI increase in this transition period fostered the establishment of short-grass vegetation which facilitated the spreading of plateau pikas. The installment of iron fences as private pasture borders from 2004 to 2007 eventually started the onset of degradation.Our case study illustrates that the past land-use regime shift triggered the recent ecological regime shift in Nyanpo Yutse. Severe grassland degradation occurred with a time lag during which cumulative LUIs surpassed the vulnerability threshold of the biophysical system.

TI  - Precise orbit determination of the Fengyun-3C satellite using onboard GPS and BDS observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The GNSS Occultation Sounder instrument onboard the Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) tracks both GPS and BDS signals for orbit determination. One month's worth of the onboard dual-frequency GPS and BDS data during March 2015 from the FY-3C satellite is analyzed in this study. The onboard BDS and GPS measurement quality is evaluated in terms of data quantity as well as code multipath error. Severe multipath errors for BDS code ranges are observed especially for high elevations for BDS medium earth orbit satellites (MEOs). The code multipath errors are estimated as piecewise linear model in grid and applied in precise orbit determination (POD) calculations. POD of FY-3C is firstly performed with GPS data, which shows orbit consistency of approximate 2.7 cm in 3D RMS (root mean square) by overlap comparisons; the estimated orbits are then used as reference orbits for evaluating the orbit precision of GPS and BDS combined POD as well as BDS-based POD. It is indicated that inclusion of BDS geosynchronous orbit satellites (GEOs) could degrade POD precision seriously. The precisions of orbit estimates by combined POD and BDS-based POD are 3.4 and 30.1 cm in 3D RMS when GEOs are involved, respectively. However, if BDS GEOs are excluded, the combined POD can reach similar precision with respect to GPS POD, showing orbit differences about 0.8 cm, while the orbit precision of BDS-based POD can be improved to 8.4 cm. These results indicate that the POD performance with onboard BDS data alone can reach precision better than 10 cm with only five BDS inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit satellites and three MEOs. As the GNOS receiver can only track six BDS satellites for orbit positioning at its maximum channel, it can be expected that the performance of POD with onboard BDS data can be further improved if more observations are generated without such restrictions.

TI  - Comparison and integration of feature reduction methods for land cover classification with RapidEye imagery
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature reduction (FR) methods can effectively reduce the feature set and improve the accuracy for land cover classification (LCC) using high resolution remote sensing data with high dimensional or strongly correlated feature sets. However, FR methods have rarely been applied for LCC in arid regions with complex geographic environments, especially for the integration of feature selection (FS) and feature extraction (FE) methods. This study investigated the comparison and integration of FR methods for LCC in part of Dunhuang Basin, northwestern China, which is a typical inland arid region and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Five spectral bands and 9 vegetation indices features that derived from RapidEye satellite imagery were used with support vector machines algorithm. Two wrapper FS methods, based on random forest algorithm (varSelRF and Boruta packages in R software), were used. Three FE methods (principal component analysis, PCA; independent component analysis, ICA; and minimum noise fraction transformation, MNF), were employed to extract a reduced number of reconstructed new features. Integration of varSelRF and PCA methods (varSelRF-PCA) was attempted. All 14 features were relevant, indicated by Boruta method; only 6 features, including the red-edge band selected by the varSelRF module, had higher importance. All the five FR methods could improve classification accuracy, but only varSelRF achieved significant improvement. The varSelRF outperformed the FE methods, followed by MNF, PCA, and ICA. The proposed varSelRF-PCA model significantly improved classification accuracy and outperformed all the FS or FE methods.

TI  - Bias characterization of CrIS radiances at 399 selected channels with respect to NWP model simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on board the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite is a hyperspectral Fourier Transform Spectrometer. In this study, biases of the 399 channels used in numerical weather prediction applications are characterized based on the differences between CrIS observations and model simulations in clear-sky conditions over ocean. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask is used for selecting CrIS clear-sky data. The global mean biases are within +/- 1 K for most channels (more than 390). Biases for the channels not affected by trace gases other than water vapor in long-wave infrared (LWIR), middle-wave infrared (MWIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands vary from about - 0.5 to 0.3 K, - 0.2 to 0.8 K, and - 0.1 to 0.9 K, respectively. The scan-angle variations of biases are less than +/- 0.4 K for all channels. The MWIR sounding channels have larger biases in middle and high latitudes than the tropics, which might be associated with latitudinal differences of water vapor variability. The SWIR CO2 channels are affected by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) in the upper stratosphere and the window channels could be affected by the sun glint effect, both of which are considered in model simulations. Biases of the NLTE affected channels during daytime are found to be 0.5-1 K higher than nighttime. The SWIR window channels have colder biases at Field of Regards (FORs) 6-15 than the other scan positions due to the sun glint effect.

TI  - Quantifying the Role of Snowmelt in Stream Discharge in an Alaskan Watershed: An Analysis Using a Spatially Distributed Surface Hydrology Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a spatially distributed surface hydrology model to investigate the role of snowmelt in stream discharge for the Tanana Flats Basin in interior Alaska. The Parameter ESTimation code is used to calibrate the model with observed stream discharge data. The model was further evaluated using remote sensing-based snow cover product and in situ snowpack water equivalent (SWE) observations. A 36year (1980-2015) U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System simulation shows (1) the monthly stream discharge from the Tanana Flats Basin in April decreased by 44%; (2) snow cover area at high altitudes (above 2000m) decreased in summer, both SWE and snowmelt also decreased significantly, especially in spring; (3) the timings of snowmelt onset and ending shifted by 2 (earlier) and 5 (later) days per decade, respectively; and (4) snowmelt accounts for 40% of the annual stream discharge. This study provides a quantitative tool to investigating hydrological systems considering the impacts of snow dynamics in cold regions. This study also suggests that future warming will further decrease snow coverage, advance snow melting time, and hereafter change the stream discharge dynamics in the Arctic.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Data Fusion Model for Generating NDVI Time Series in Heterogeneous Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series vegetation indices with high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency are important for crop growth monitoring and management. However, due to technical constraints and cloud contamination, it is difficult to obtain such datasets. In this study, a spatio-temporal vegetation index image fusion model (STVIFM) was developed to generate high spatial resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series images with higher accuracy, since most of the existing methods have some limitations in accurately predicting NDVI in heterogeneous regions, or rely on very computationally intensive steps and land cover maps for heterogeneous regions. The STVIFM aims to predict the fine-resolution NDVI through understanding the contribution of each fine-resolution pixel to the total NDVI change, which was calculated from the coarse-resolution images acquired on two dates. On the one hand, it considers the difference in relationships between the fine- and coarse-resolution images on different dates and the difference in NDVI change rates at different growing stages. On the other hand, it neither needs to search similar pixels nor needs to use land cover maps. The Landsat-8 and MODIS data acquired over three test sites with different landscapes were used to test the spatial and temporal performance of the proposed model. Compared with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method, the proposed STVIFM outperforms the STARFM and ESTARFM at three study sites and different stages when the land cover or NDVI changes were captured by the two pairs of fine- and coarse-resolution images, and it is more robust and less computationally intensive than the FSDAF.

TI  - Reconstruction of Daily Sea Surface Temperature Based on Radial Basis Function Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A radial basis function network (RBFN) method is proposed to reconstruct daily Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) with limited SST samples. For the purpose of evaluating the SSTs using this method, non-biased SST samples in the Pacific Ocean (10 degrees N-30 degrees N, 115 degrees E-135 degrees E) are selected when the tropical storm Hagibis arrived in June 2014, and these SST samples are obtained from the Reynolds optimum interpolation (OI) v2 daily 0.25 degrees SST (OISST) products according to the distribution of AVHRR L2p SST and in-situ SST data. Furthermore, an improved nearest neighbor cluster (INNC) algorithm is designed to search for the optimal hidden knots for RBFNs from both the SST samples and the background fields. Then, the reconstructed SSTs from the RBFN method are compared with the results from the OI method. The statistical results show that the RBFN method has a better performance of reconstructing SST than the OI method in the study, and that the average RMSE is 0.48 degrees C for the RBFN method, which is quite smaller than the value of 0.69 degrees C for the OI method. Additionally, the RBFN methods with different basis functions and clustering algorithms are tested, and we discover that the INNC algorithm with multi-quadric function is quite suitable for the RBFN method to reconstruct SSTs when the SST samples are sparsely distributed.

TI  - MARTA GANs: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of deep learning, supervised learning has frequently been adopted to classify remotely sensed images using convolutional networks. However, due to the limited amount of labeled data available, supervised learning is often difficult to carry out. Therefore, we proposed an unsupervised model called multiple-layer feature-matching generative adversarial networks (MARTA GANs) to learn a representation using only unlabeled data. MARTA GANs consists of both a generative model G and a discriminative model D. We treat D as a feature extractor. To fit the complex properties of remote sensing data, we use a fusion layer to merge the mid-level and global features. G can produce numerous images that are similar to the training data; therefore, D can learn better representations of remotely sensed images using the training data provided by G. The classification results on two widely used remote sensing image databases show that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Assessment of vulnerability for coastal erosion with GIS and AHP techniques case study: Southern coastline of Sri Lanka
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal Vulnerability Index for erosion was introduced for southwestern coast of Sri Lanka in this study. Slope, geomorphology, erosion rate, dune width, tide direction, tidal range, wave height, protection methods and adjacent land use type were used as variables. Existing maps, Google Earth images, field observations, and questionnaire surveys were used as data sources and decision model was prepared using GIS technique. Weights for the model were determined through questionnaire surveys and analytical hierarchical process technique. It was revealed that 7.5% and 23.7% of coastline are very highly and highly vulnerable for coastal erosion, respectively. A total of 27.11% of study area was classified as moderately and 29.4% as lower vulnerable. Only 12.25% of the line is very low vulnerable for coastal erosion. Two hot spots were identified to be given immediate attention. Coastal slope was recognized as most influential factor for high vulnerability using Pearson product moment correlation coefficient values.Summary for Managers It can be concluded that the southern coastline of Sri Lanka is in risk and immediate attention of policy makers for mitigation process is highly recommended. It is recommended to construct artificial barriers after analyzing the characteristics and the profile of the coast. Special attention is highly required for hot spot areas in Kahawa and Hikkaduwa coastal areas. Furthermore, study recommends to introduce different buffer zones for various purposes and uses.

TI  - FengYun-3C VIRR Active Fire Monitoring: Algorithm Description and Initial Assessment Using MODIS and Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible and Infra-Red Radiometer (VIRR) is an improved third-generation earth observation sensor that has channels ranging from the visible to thermal bands and is carried on board the Chinese FengYun-3C satellite. The VIRR instrument provides full global coverage at a spatial resolution of 1 km. It is neither appropriate nor correct to simply duplicate the parameters used in algorithms designed for other sensors. Hence, this paper proposes an active fire-monitoring algorithm designed for the VIRR sensor. A newly proposed concept-the "infrared channel slope"-is employed in the algorithm, which can detect active fire pixels by identifying deviations in their mid-infrared and thermal infrared brightness temperatures. "Dynamic thresholds" are also used to allow the algorithm to adapt to different situations. Different fire events that occurred in different parts of the world between 2014 and 2016 are selected to test the robustness of the algorithm. The testing consists of two parts: a rough assessment using products of a similar spatial resolution and then a detailed assessment based on fine spatial resolution images. In the rough assessment part, the results are compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Fire and Thermal Anomaly product (MOD14A1) and the China Meteorological Administration's Global Fire References (GFR) products from the National Satellite Meteorological Center. In the detailed assessment, imagery acquired by the Landsat-7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and the Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager is used. The MODIS and Landsat data are utilized as reference data to validate the accuracy while the comparison with the GFR products is carried out to demonstrate the advantages of this method. The assessment demonstrates that the algorithm produces comparable results to those obtained using MOD14A1 and is a significant improvement compared with GFR.

TI  - Target Practice: Counterterrorism and the Amplification of Data Friction
T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Review
AB  - The nineteenth-century strategist Carl von Clausewitz describes fog and friction as fundamental features of war. Military leverage of sophisticated information technology in the twenty-first century has improved some tactical operations but has not lifted the fog of war, in part, because the means for reducing uncertainty create new forms of it. Drawing on active duty experience with an American special operations task force in Western Iraq from 2007 to 2008, this article traces the targeting processes used to find, fix, and finish alleged insurgents. In this case they did not clarify the political reality of Anbar province but rather reinforced a parochial worldview informed by the Naval Special Warfare community. The unit focused on the performance of direct action raids during a period in which indirect action engagement with the local population was arguably more appropriate for the strategic circumstances. The concept of data friction, therefore, can be understood not simply as a form of resistance within a sociotechnical system but also as a form of traction that enables practitioners to construct representations of the world that amplify their own biases.

TI  - Monitoring Thermal Pollution in Rivers Downstream of Dams with Landsat ETM plus Thermal Infrared Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams play a significant role in altering the spatial pattern of temperature in rivers and contribute to thermal pollution, which greatly affects the river aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the temporal and spatial variation of thermal pollution caused by dams is important to prevent or mitigate its harmful effect. Assessments based on in-situ measurements are often limited in practice because of the inaccessibility of water temperature records and the scarcity of gauges along rivers. By contrast, thermal infrared remote sensing provides an alternative approach to monitor thermal pollution downstream of dams in large rivers, because it can cover a large area and observe the same zone repeatedly. In this study, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal infrared imagery were applied to assess the thermal pollution caused by two dams, the Geheyan Dam and the Gaobazhou Dam, located on the Qingjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze River downstream of the Three Gorges Reservoir in Central China. The spatial and temporal characteristics of thermal pollution were analyzed with water temperatures estimated from 54 cloud-free Landsat ETM+ scenes acquired in the period from 2000 to 2014. The results show that water temperatures downstream of both dams are much cooler than those upstream of both dams in summer, and the water temperature remains stable along the river in winter, showing evident characteristic of the thermal pollution caused by dams. The area affected by the Geheyan Dam reaches beyond 20 km along the downstream river, and that affected by the Gaobazhou Dam extends beyond the point where the Qingjiang River enters the Yangtze River. Considering the long time series and global coverage of Landsat ETM+ imagery, the proposed technique in the current study provides a promising method for globally monitoring the thermal pollution caused by dams in large rivers.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Urban Land Change in the Middle Yangtze River Basin Urban Agglomeration, China between 2000 and 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed studies on the spatiotemporal patterns of urban agglomeration in the Middle Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) are rare. This paper analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in the MYRB using multi-temporal remote sensing data circa 2000, 2008 and 2016 integrated with geographic information system (GIS) techniques and landscape analysis approaches. A multi-level analysis of the rate and intensity, type as well as the landscape changes of urban expansion at regional, prefectural and inner-city levels was performed. Results show that the MYRB experienced rapid urban expansion with an annual expansion rate of 3.199%, especially in the Chang-Zhu-Tan and Poyang Lake metropolitan areas. The small and medium cities presented faster urban expansion than the larger cities with annual growth rates three times the average level. Urban expansion within the three capital cities was further analyzed in detail. It is found that outlying expansion and edge-expansion were the dominant growth patterns at all the three levels. Although urbanization in the MYRB has a remarkable increase in the past sixteen years, its annual growth rate of urban land expansion has fallen behind the three other large urban agglomerations in China as a result. Finally, the spatial evolution of the socioeconomic structure of the MYRB was further explored. It indicated that urban land was distributed mainly along the "northwest-southeast" direction and that the economic spatial interactions among cities showed a pattern of "multi-polarization and fragmentation", which illustrates the weak radiative driving forces of the central cities. The MYRB urban agglomeration faces a great challenge to manage trades-offs between narrowing the intra-regional disparity and maintaining synergetic development among cities.

TI  - Recognition of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with papillary thyroid cancer by nano-carbon and methylene blue
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare the accuracy and feasibility of methylene blue and nano-carbon in clinical tracing of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).Methods: Ninety-six PTC patients were selected and randomly divided into a methylene blue group and a nano-carbon group (n=48). During surgery, tracer agent was injected around the tumor, and SLNs were resected and subjected to frozen pathological examination. The results were compared with those of routine pathological examination after surgery.Results: Latent lymph node metastasis (level VI and lateral neck) was detected in both groups, with neck distribution of SLNs. There was no significant difference in the detection rate or accuracy of SLNs between two groups (P>0.05). The incorrect resection rate of parathyroid gland and incidence of temporary hypoparathyroidism in the methylene blue group were significantly higher than those of the nano-carbon group (t=4.137, P<0.05).Conclusions: The state of PTC lymph nodes can be well evaluated by SLN biopsy using both methylene blue and nano-carbon as tracers, but using nano-carbon has a lower incidence rate of parathyroid injury, with great clinical prospects accordingly.

TI  - Policy factors impact analysis based on remote sensing data and the CLUE-S model in the Lijiang River Basin, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is affected by many driving factors such as the economy, population, and government policy. This study investigated the relationship between government policy and land use change to develop an understanding applicable to the formulation of strategies for sustainable land use. The Lijiang River Basin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China was selected for this study. The predicted characteristics of land use change were explored using the CLUE-S numerical model and logistic regression. Using Landsat remote sensing imagery as source data, we simulated the tendency of land use change from 1993 to 2020 under two scenarios: a Natural Growth Scenario (NS) and a Government Intervention Scenario (GS), and we analyzed the possible social driving factors. The results revealed that from 1993 to 2015, both construction and cultivated land have shown a tendency of areal increase. Water and woodland areas both decreased from 1993 to 2006 but then they increased dramatically from 2006 to 2015. Shrubland areas increased from 1993 to 2006 but decreased slightly from 2006 to 2015. The CLUE-S model was used to predict the spatial patterns of land use for 2020. It showed that under the NS, the areas of construction and cultivated land increased, while the areas of other land uses decreased. Under the GS, the areas of construction land, woodland, cultivated land, and water all increased, while the areas of the others declined. Furthermore, the area of woodland decreased for every county under the NS, but areas of woodland expansion were located in Lingchuan and Lingui counties under the GS. Hotspots of cultivated land occurred in Lingchuan County under the NS and in Xingan County under the GS. Water area decreased in every county under the NS, whereas increases in water areas occurred in Lingchuan and Guilin counties under the GS. Construction land expanded in Lingchuan County under the NS and in Guilin County under the GS. The Returning Farmland to Forest Program could be considered a successful addition to the eco-environmental policies implemented in the Lijiang River Basin.

TI  - Relative importance of climate changes at different time scales on net primary productivity-a case study of the Karst area of northwest Guangxi, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate changes are considered to significantly impact net primary productivity (NPP). However, there are few studies on how climate changes at multiple time scales impact NPP. With MODIS NPP product and station-based observations of sunshine duration, annual average temperature and annual precipitation, impacts of climate changes at different time scales on annual NPP, have been studied with EEMD (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) method in the Karst area of northwest Guangxi, China, during 2000-2013. Moreover, with partial least squares regression (PLSR) model, the relative importance of climatic variables for annual NPP has been explored. The results show that (1) only at quasi 3-year time scale do sunshine duration and temperature have significantly positive relations with NPP. (2) Annual precipitation has no significant relation to NPP by direct comparison, but significantly positive relation at 5-year time scale, which is because 5-year time scale is not the dominant scale of precipitation; (3) the changes of NPP may be dominated by inter-annual variabilities. (4) Multiple time scales analysis will greatly improve the performance of PLSR model for estimating NPP. The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores of sunshine duration and temperature at quasi 3-year time scale, and precipitation at quasi 5-year time scale are greater than 0.8, indicating important for NPP during 2000-2013. However, sunshine duration and temperature at quasi 3-year time scale are much more important. Our results underscore the importance of multiple time scales analysis for revealing the relations of NPP to changing climate.

TI  - A Novel Method of Unsupervised Change Detection Using Multi-Temporal PolSAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing unsupervised change detection methods using full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) do not use all the polarimetric information, and the results are subject to the influence of noise. In order to solve these problems, a novel automatic and unsupervised change detection approach based on multi-temporal full PolSAR images is presented in this paper. The proposed method integrates the advantages of the test statistic, generalized statistical region merging (GSRM), and generalized Gaussian mixture model (GMM) techniques. It involves three main steps: (1) the difference image (DI) is obtained by the likelihood-ratio parameter based on a test statistic; (2) the GSRM method is applied to the DI; and (3) the DI, after segmentation, is automatically analyzed by the generalized GMM to generate the change detection map. The generalized GMM is derived under a non-Gaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of the changed and unchanged classes, and automatically identifies the optimal number of components. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with multi-temporal PolSAR images acquired by Radarsat-2 over the city of Wuhan in China. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the change detection results is improved and the false alarm rate reduced, when compared with some of the traditional change detection methods.

TI  - Appling the One-Class Classification Method of Maxent to Detect an Invasive Plant <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> with Time-Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora has become the main invasive plant along the Chinese coast and now threatens the local ecological environment. Accurately monitoring the distribution of S. alterniflora is urgent and essential for developing cost-effective control strategies. In this study, we applied the One-Class Classification (OCC) methods of Maximum entropy (Maxent) and Biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) based on Landsat time-series imagery to detect the species on the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China. We conducted four experimental setups (i.e., single-scene analysis, time-series analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series analysis and a compressed time-series analysis), using OCC methods to recognize the species. Then, we tested the performance of a compressed time-series model for S. alterniflora detection and evaluated the expansibility of this approach when it was applied to a larger region. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Maxent and BSVM performed equally well, and Maxent appeared to have a more balanced performance over the summer months; (2) the Maxent model with the Default Parameter Set (Maxent-DPS) showed a slightly higher accuracy and more overfitting than Maxent with the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples sizes (AICc)-selected parameter set model, but a t-test found no significant difference between these two settings; (3) April and December were deemed to be important periods for the detection of S. alterniflora; (4) a compressed time-series analysis modelincluding only three variables (December NDVI, March green and the third Principal Component in January, PC3)yielded higher accuracy than single-scene analyses, which indicated that time-series analysis can better detect S. alterniflora than single-scene analyses; and (5) the Maxent model using the reconstructed optimal variables and 70 training samples over a larger region produced encouraging results with an overall accuracy of 90.88% and a Kappa of 0.78. The one-class classification method combined with a phenology-based detection strategy is therefore promising for the application of the long-term detection of S. alterniflora over extended areas.

TI  - Deriving 3-D Time-Series Ground Deformations Induced by Underground Fluid Flows with InSAR: Case Study of Sebei Gas Fields, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique has proven to be a powerful tool for the monitoring of time-series ground deformations along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction. However, the one-dimensional (1-D) measurements cannot provide comprehensive information for interpreting the related geo-hazards. Recently, a novel method has been proposed to map the three-dimensional (3-D) deformation associated with underground fluid flows based on single-track InSAR LOS measurements and the deformation modeling associated with the Green's function. In this study, the method is extended in temporal domain by exploiting the MT-InSAR measurements, and applied for the first time to investigate the 3-D time series deformation over Sebei gas field in Qinghai, Northwest China with 37 Sentinel-1 images acquired during October 2014-July 2017. The estimated 3-D time series deformations provide a more complete view of ongoing deformation processes as compared to the 1-D time series deformations or the 3-D deformation velocities, which is of great importance for assessing the possible geohazards. In addition, the extended method allows for the retrieval of time series of fluid volume changes due to the gas extraction in the Sebei field, which agrees well with those from the PetroChina Qinghai Oilfield Company Yearbooks (PQOCYs). This provides a new way to study the variations of subsurface fluids at unprecedented resolution.

TI  - Evaluation of the VIIRS BRDF, Albedo and NBAR products suite and an assessment of continuity with the long term MODIS record
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters, Albedo quantities, and Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VITAS), on the Suomi-NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite are evaluated with spatially representative in situ tower albedometer measurements and through comparison with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long term record. White Sky Albedo (WSA), Black Sky Albedo (BSA), NBAR, and Quality Assurance (QA) results show that the VIIRS algorithm is performing well at the global scale and is able to provide global data products comparable with the heritage MODIS (with an absolute bias of 0.0069 for short-wave broadband WSA) despite the spectral, angular, and effective spatial resolution differences between the two sensors. Both VIIRS and MODIS albedo are shown to agree well with in situ albedo measurements at a number of spatially representative sites. This evaluation provides confidence that the high quality, daily VIIRS BRDF model parameters, Albedo, and NBAR products will be able to provide the long term continuity required by the modeling and monitoring communities.

TI  - Estimating Snow Depth Using Multi-Source Data Fusion Based on the D-InSAR Method and 3DVAR Fusion Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth is a general input variable in many models of agriculture, hydrology, climate, and ecology. However, there are some uncertainties in the retrieval of snow depth by remote sensing. Errors occurred in snow depth evaluation under the D-InSAR methods will affect the accuracy of snow depth inversion to a certain extent. This study proposes a scheme to estimate spatial snow depth that combines remote sensing with site observation. On the one hand, this scheme adopts the Sentinel-1 C-band of the European Space Agency (ESA), making use of the two-pass method of differential interferometry for inversion of spatial snow depth. On the other hand, the 3DVAR (three dimensional variational) fusion algorithm is used to integrate actual snow depth data of virtual stations and real-world observation stations into the snow depth inversion results. Thus, the accuracy of snow inversion will be improved. This scheme is applied in the study area of Bayanbulak Basin, which is located in the central hinterland of Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. Observation data from stations in different altitudes are selected to test the fusion method. According to the results, most of the obtained snow depth values using interferometry are lower than the observed ones. However, after the fusion using the 3DVAR algorithm, the snow depth accuracy is slightly higher than it was in the inversion results (R-2 = 0.31 vs. R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 2.51 cm vs. RMSE = 1.96 cm; R-2 = 0.27 vs. R-2 = 0.46, RMSE = 4.04 cm vs. RMSE = 3.65 cm). When compared with the inversion results, the relative error (RE) improved by 6.97% and 3.59%, respectively. This study shows that the scheme can effectively improve the accuracy of regional snow depth estimation. Therefore, its future application is of great potential.

TI  - Analysis of Coastline Extraction from Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline extraction is a fundamental work for coastal resource management, coastal environmental protection and coastal sustainable development. Due to the free access and long-term record, Landsat series images have the potential to be used for coastline extraction. However, dynamic features of different types of coastlines (e.g., rocky, sandy, artificial), caused by sea level fluctuation from tidal, storm and reclamation, make it difficult to be accurately extracted with coarse spatial resolution, e.g., 30 m, of Landsat images. To access this problem, we analyze the performance of coastline extraction by integrating downscaling, pansharpening and water index approaches in increasing the accuracy of coastline extraction from the latest Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. In order to prove the availability of the proposed method, we designed three strategies: (1) Strategy 1 uses the traditional water index method to extract coastline directly from original 30 m Landsat-8 OLI multispectral (MS) image; (2) Strategy 2 extracts coastlines from 15 m fused MS images generated by integrating 15 m panchromatic (PAN) band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms; (3) Strategy 3 first downscales the PAN band to a finer spatial resolution (e.g., 7.5 m) band, and then extracts coastlines from pansharpened MS images generated by integrating downscaled spatial resolution PAN band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms. Using the coastline extracted from ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) 5.8 m MS image as reference, accuracies of coastlines extracted from MS images in three strategies were validated visually and quantitatively. The results show that, compared with coastline extracted directly from 30 m Landsat-8 MS image (strategy 1), strategy 3 achieves the best accuracies with optimal mean net shoreline movement (MNSM) of -2.54 m and optimal mean absolute difference (MAD) of 11.26 m, followed by coastlines extracted in strategy 2 with optimal MNSM of -4.23 m and optimal MAD of 13.54 m. Further comparisons with single-band thresholding (Band 6), AWEI, and ISODATA also confirmed the superiority of strategy 3. For the various used pansharpening algorithms, five multiresolution analysis MRA-based pansharpening algorithms are more efficient than the component substitution CS-based pansharpening algorithms for coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery. Among the five MRA-based fusion methods, the coastlines extracted from the fused images generated by Indusion, additive a trous wavelet transform (ATWT) and additive wavelet luminance proportional (AWLP) produced the most accurate and visually realistic representation. Therefore, pansharpening approaches can improve the accuracy of coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery, and downscaling the PAN band to finer spatial resolution is able to further improve the coastline extraction accuracy, especially in crenulated coasts.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval and Spatiotemporal Pattern Analysis Using Sentinel-1 Data of Dahra, Senegal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture is of great significance for the understanding of the water exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. The two-satellite constellation of the Sentinel-1 mission provides C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which are suitable for soil moisture monitoring. In this paper, we aim to assess the capability of pattern analysis based on the soil moisture retrieved from Sentinel-1 time-series data of Dahra in Senegal. The look-up table (LUT) method is used in the retrieval with the backscattering coefficients that are simulated by the advanced integrated equation Model (AIEM) for the soil layer and the Michigan microwave canopy scattering (MIMICS) model for the vegetation layer. The temporal trend of Sentinel-1A soil moisture is evaluated by the ground measurements from the site at Dahra, with an unbiased root-mean-squared deviation (ubRMSD) of 0.053 m(3)/m(3), a mean average deviation (MAD) of 0.034 m(3)/m(3), and an R value of 0.62. The spatial variation is also compared with the existing microwave products at a coarse scale, which confirms the reliability of the Sentinel-1A soil moisture. The spatiotemporal patterns are analyzed by empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), and the geophysical factors that are affecting soil moisture are discussed. The first four EOFs of soil moisture explain 77.2% of the variance in total and the primary EOF explains 66.2%, which shows the dominant pattern at the study site. Soil texture and the normalized difference vegetation index are more closely correlated with the primary pattern than the topography and temperature in the study area. The investigation confirms the potential for soil moisture retrieval and spatiotemporal pattern analysis using Sentinel-1 images.

TI  - Dynamic sentinel node biopsy for penile cancer: an initial experience in an Irish Hospital
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of nodal metastases is the single most important prognostic factor in penile cancer. However, reliable assessment of nodal status in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients poses a challenge. Approximately 20% of these patients harbour occult nodal metastases. Currently available non-invasive radiological investigations are unreliable in excluding micrometastatic disease.Dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) is a minimally invasive procedure for assessing lymph node involvement. We report our initial experience with DSNB in assessing the status of regional lymph nodes in cN0 penile cancer patients.DSNB was performed in penile cancer patients with at least one cN0 groin. All patients undergoing DSNB at our institution were included. Lymphoscintigraphic images were obtained from all patients, after intradermal, peritumoral injection of a Technetium-99m nanocolloid. The sentinel nodes were defined as the nodes identified on lymphoscintigraphy, which were also radioactive intraoperatively using a gamma probe.In total, 18 groins from 11 patients underwent DSNB. Of these, 11 patients underwent bilateral DSNB and 4 had unilateral DSNB. The mean (range) age of patients at the time of presentation of their primary tumour was 63 (39-78) years. A mean of 1.2 nodes per groin was retrieved. One lymph node was positive in one patient, who subsequently underwent a bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection. Overall, the median (range) follow-up was 12.8 (2.7-31.3) months with no local or regional recurrences.Further cases and longer follow-up will define the accuracy of this technique in the Irish population.

TI  - Forest Types Classification Based on Multi-Source Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays an important role in global carbon, hydrological and atmospheric cycles and provides a wide range of valuable ecosystem services. Timely and accurate forest-type mapping is an essential topic for forest resource inventory supporting forest management, conservation biology and ecological restoration. Despite efforts and progress having been made in forest cover mapping using multi-source remotely sensed data, fine spatial, temporal and spectral resolution modeling for forest type distinction is still limited. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal-spectral fusion framework through spatial-spectral fusion and spatial-temporal fusion. Addressing the shortcomings of the commonly-used spatial-spectral fusion model, we proposed a novel spatial-spectral fusion model called the Segmented Difference Value method (SEGDV) to generate fine spatial-spectra-resolution images by blending the China environment 1A series satellite (HJ-1A) multispectral image (Charge Coupled Device (CCD)) and Hyperspectral Imager (HSI). A Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Adaptive Fusion Model (HSTAFM) was used to conduct spatial-temporal fusion to generate the fine spatial-temporal-resolution image by blending the HJ-1A CCD and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The spatial-spectral-temporal information was utilized simultaneously to distinguish various forest types. Experimental results of the classification comparison conducted in the Gan River source nature reserves showed that the proposed method could enhance spatial, temporal and spectral information effectively, and the fused dataset yielded the highest classification accuracy of 83.6% compared with the classification results derived from single Landsat-8 (69.95%), single spatial-spectral fusion (70.95%) and single spatial-temporal fusion (78.94%) images, thereby indicating that the proposed method could be valid and applicable in forest type classification.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that the establishment of anatomo-power in China preceded and set the foundation for biopower. Anatomo-power is disciplinary power over live bodies in the military, schools, and hospitals, but also the power of the medical profession over dead bodies to investigate pathology through dissection. At the turn of the twentieth century, Chinese conceptions of political anatomy were used to advocate anatomical knowledge, and an anatomy law in 1913 made routinized dissection possible. Chinese society began to be transformed as old taboos were broken, and thousands of new terms allowed the scientific worldview to take root among professionals and the public. Anatomical researchers addressed both microscopic pathology to cure individuals and macroscopic questions that grouped individuals into a population to be managed, or that sought data to tell new narratives about the origins and future of humanity-a new political anatomy based on the practice of human dissection.

TI  - Modeling spring-summer phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan with and without riverine nutrient loading
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - There were two phytoplankton blooms captured by remote sensing in Lake Michigan in 1998, one from March to May, and one during June. In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical-biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20 days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20 m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.

TI  - The Black Swan: Yeats and the Science of the Unknown
T2  - IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay views science as a creative mask for the poetry and philosophy of W.B. Yeats. It explores the changing worldview which occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century with the discovery of wave-particle duality by Max Planck in 1900. It considers the new concepts of reality which arose at this time in relation to modernism and Yeats's response to the paradigmatic change of era he was a part of. Accordingly, the poet's understanding of universal history in A Vision (1925, 1937) is used alongside close readings of his poetry to evince an argument which unites that poetry with philosophy, scientific theory, and modernism as aspects of one universe of knowledge which refracts different aspects of itself through the prism of time.

TI  - Riparian vegetation as an indicator of riparian condition: Detecting departures from historic condition across the North American West
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain riparian ecosystems support unique vegetation communities and high biodiversity relative to terrestrial landscapes. Accordingly, estimating riparian ecosystem health across landscapes is critical for sustainable river management. However, methods that identify local riparian vegetation condition, an effective proxy for riparian health, have not been applied across broad, regional extents. Here we present an index to assess reach-scale (500 m segment) riparian vegetation condition across entire drainage networks within large, physiographically-diverse regions. We estimated riparian vegetation condition for 53,250 km of perennial streams and rivers, 25,685 km in Utah, and 27,565 km in twelve watersheds of the interior Columbia River Basin (CRB), USA. We used nationally available, existing land cover classification derived from 30 m Landsat imagery (LANDFIRE EVT) and a modeled estimate of pre-European settlement land cover (LANDFIRE BpS). The index characterizes riparian vegetation condition as the ratio of existing native riparian vegetation cover to pre-European settlement riparian vegetation cover at a given reach. Roughly 62% of Utah and 48% of CRB watersheds showed significant (>33%) to large (>66%) departure from historic condition. Riparian vegetation change was predominantly caused by human land-use impacts (development and agriculture), or vegetation change (native riparian to invasive or upland vegetation types) that likely resulted from flow and disturbance regime alteration. Through comparisons to ground-based classification results, we estimate the existing vegetation component of the index to be 85% accurate. Our assessments yielded riparian condition maps that will help resource managers better prioritize sites and treatments for reach-scale conservation and restoration activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Remote sensing of species diversity using Landsat 8 spectral variables
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remote sensing in biodiversity estimation has largely relied on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI exploits spectral information from red and near infrared bands of Landsat images and it does not consider canopy background conditions hence it is affected by soil brightness which lowers its sensitivity to vegetation. As such NDVI may be insufficient in explaining tree species diversity. Meanwhile, the Landsat program also collects essential spectral information in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region which is related to plant properties. The study was intended to: (i) explore the utility of spectral information across Landsat-8 spectrum using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and estimate alpha diversity (alpha-diversity) in the savannah woodland in southern Africa, and (ii) define the species diversity index (Shannon (H'), Simpson (D-2) and species richness (S) - defined as number of species in a community) that best relates to spectral variability on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager dataset. We designed 90 m x 90 m field plots (n = 71) and identified all trees with a diameter at breast height (DbH) above 10 cm. H', D-2 and S were used to quantify tree species diversity within each plot and the corresponding spectral information on all Landsat-8 bands were extracted from each field plot. A stepwise linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between species diversity indices (H', D-2 and S) and Principal Components (PCs), vegetation indices and Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture layers with calibration (n = 46) and test (n = 23) datasets. The results of regression analysis showed that the Simple Ratio Index derivative had a higher relationship with H', D-2 and S (r(2) = 0.36; r(2) = 0.41; r(2) = 0.24 respectively) compared to NDVI, EVI, SAVI or their derivatives. Moreover the Landsat-8 derived PCs also had a higher relationship with H' and D-2 (r(2) of 0.36 and 0.35 respectively) than the frequently used NDVI, and this was attributed to the utilization of the entire spectral content of Landsat-8 data. Our results indicate that: (i) the measurement scales of vegetation indices impact their sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to explain tree species diversity; (ii) principal components enhance the utility of Landsat-8 spectral data for estimating tree species diversity and (iii) species diversity indices that consider both species richness and abundance (H' and D-2) relates better with Landsat-8 spectral variables.

TI  - Bio-thermal effects of open dumps on surroundings detected by remote. sensing-Influence of geographical conditions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has used remotely sensed data of Landsat-8 for monitoring open dumps of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) using vegetation health as a bio-indicator and thermal emissions from it. Open dump of Mahmood Booti has been found to affect the surrounding vegetation up to 800 m in dry summers and reducing to 400 m in winters, while averaging to a distance of about 650 m. Average thermal influence zone has been observed to have same radial extent of about 650 m varying between the minimum of 350 m in dry summer and maximum of 1000 m in winter. All the corresponding details of bio-indicators and temperature variations have also been discussed. In addition to this, the results and methodology of spatial analysis for Mahmood Booti dump of Lahore, Pakistan, surrounded by a heterogeneous land cover, have been compared with the main dumping facility of Faisalabad, Pakistan, which is surrounded by a homogeneous vegetation cover all around. This comparison yielded two main conclusions, first, the surrounding geography of an open MSW dump affects the severity of bio-thermal effects, in addition to waste age, characterization, pile etc. Second, GIS analysis for studying bio-thermal effects requires modification that varies for prevailing neighborhood land cover conditions of MSW open dumps. Use of remotely sensed data for monitoring dumped MSW is a good alternative but selection of proper GIS methodology, representing natural setting of phenomena is equally important as that of the accuracy of the remotely sensed data.

TI  - Incidence Angle Dependence of First-Year Sea Ice Backscattering Coefficient in Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery Over the Kara Sea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have studied the incidence angle (theta(0)) dependence of the sea ice backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees) for Sentinel-1 (S-1) extra wide (EW) mode dual-polarization (HH/HV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired over the Kara Sea under winter and summer melting conditions. The determination of the sigma degrees versus theta(0) dependence was based on SAR image pairs acquired on ascending and descending orbits over the same sea ice area with a short time difference. The SAR noise floor was subtracted from the HV images. From the image pairs 1.1 by 1.1 km windows representing level first-year ice (LFYI) and deformed first-year ice (DFYI) were manually selected, and a linear regression was fit between the resulting sigma degrees and theta(0) differences of the windows to estimate the slope b(1) (dB/1 degrees) between sigma degrees and theta(0). For example, under winter condition b(1) for DFYI at HH- and HV-polarizations was found to be -0.24 and -0.16 dB/1 degrees, respectively, and b(1) for LFYI at HH-polarization was -0.25 dB/1 degrees. It was not possible to determine a reliable b(1) for LFYI at HV due to a contamination effect of the S-1 noise floor. The b(1) values at HH compared well with previous studies. They can be used to compensate the sigma degrees incidence angle variation in the S-1 EW SAR images with good accuracy. The HH b(1) values are applicable to other S-1 imaging modes and other C-band SAR sensors like RADARSAT-2. Unfortunately, the HV b(1) values are specific to the S-1 EW mode due to the noise floor problem.

TI  - Prediction of hourly ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations 3 days in advance using neural networks with satellite data in eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an attempt to explore the effectiveness of satellite data in predicting hourly PM2.5 (Respirable particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter below 2.5 mu m) concentrations for a chosen number of forward time steps over eastern China. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol optical depth (AOD), hourly forecasted meteorological variables, along with respective pollutant predictors from 2013 to 2015 were used as input to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) type of back-propagation neural network. A novel approach, based on the correlation coefficients between surface PM2.5 and meteorological variables, was employed in selecting the averaging periods for meteorological input. Backward air mass trajectory was combined with AOD so as to explicitly measure the contribution of regional transport. Owing to the spatial variability of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, each grid cell on the AOD retrievals was assigned to a prediction model trained by the nearest monitoring station from them. The proposed model seems to perform better in southern China. Also predictions incorporating transport predictor tend to have higher rates of detecting PM2.5 exceedance hours. We further introduced a sensitive analysis in Beijing by testing a model with surface PM2.5 input, evaluated versus the AOD input one. The two models were evaluated on the perturbed test set with input values ranging from 10 to 40%. It is found that PM model significantly outperforms the AOD one when the prediction horizon is longer than 36 h. This approach shows potential to be adapted for other regions, but will be most useful for areas without access to sophisticated deterministic models.

TI  - Object-oriented stand type classification based on the combination of multi-source remote sen-sing data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of forest type is one of the key problems in forest resource monitoring. The Radarsat-2 data and QuickBird remote sensing image were used for object. based classification to study the object. based forest type classification and recognition based on the combination of multi. source remote sensing data. In the process of object. based classification, three segmentation schemes (segmentation with QuickBird remote sensing image only, segmentation with Radarsat-2 data only, segmentation with combination of QuickBird and Radarsat-2) were adopted. For the three segmentation schemes, ten segmentation scale parameters were adopted (25-250, step 25), and modified Euclidean distance 3 index was further used to evaluate the segmented results to determine the optimal segmentation scheme and segmentation scale. Based on the optimal segmented result, three forest types of Chinese fir, Masson pine and broad. leaved forest were classified and recognized using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Foundation (RBF) kernel according to different feature combinations of topography, height, spectrum and common features. The results showed that the combination of Radarsat-2 data and QuickBird remote sensing image had its advantages of object. based forest type classification over using Radarsat-2 data or QuickBird remote sensing image only. The optimal scale parameter for QuickBird&Radarsat-2 segmentation was 100, and at the optimal scale, the accuracy of object. based forest type classification was the highest (OA=86%, Kappa = 0.86), when using all features which were extracted from two kinds of data re. sources. This study could not only provide a reference for forest type recognition using multi. source remote sensing data, but also had a practical significance for forest resource investigation and monitoring.

TI  - A The role of preoperative axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology. in identifying patients with extensive axillary lymph node involvement
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the recent past, both clinically node-positive and node-negative but sentinel node-positive patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), although the two groups seem to have substantially different degree of nodal involvement.Methods: Data on consecutive primary breast cancer patients with documented axillary ultrasound (AXUS) results who underwent ALND between January 2003 and December 2015 either because of AXUS-guided fine needle aspiration (A-FNAC) results or because of a positive sentinel lymph node were retrospectively analysed.Results: After exclusions, 316 patients staged by SNB and ALND with negative AXUS or A-FNAC (group A) were compared with 159 patients having positive A-FNAC results (group B). Tumour size and the proportion of mastectomies were greater, histological grade higher and lymphovascular invasion more frequent in Group B, where palpable lymph nodes were also more common. The proportion of cases with extensive nodal involvement (pN2 and pN3 cases) was about 3 times as much in Group B (63%) than in Group A (18%). Removal of the 50 patients with palpable lymph nodes from the analysis did not greatly influence these proportions: 60% and 19% extensive nodal involvements were noted, respectively. In this series, patients with suspicious AXUS and negative A-FNAC had more often extensive nodal involvement (25%) than AXUS negative patients (17%).Conclusions: Patients in whom axillary metastases are detected by ultrasound-guided biopsy have significantly more involved nodes than SLNB-positive patients, and therefore are likely to benefit from axillary treatment.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy after primary chemotherapy in cT2 N0/1 breast cancer patients: Long-term results of a retrospective study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is controversial whether sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is adequate in breast cancer patients who become cN0 after primary chemotherapy. To address this we retrospectively compared outcomes in T2 cases given primary chemotherapy, comparing those given axillary dissection (AD) with those given SNB but no AD if sentinel nodes were clinically negative post-chemotherapy.Methods: We examined overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and axillary failure in 317 consecutive cT2 cN0/1 patients given primary chemotherapy followed by quadrantectomy/mastectomy, between January 2002 and December 2007. The approach to the axilla changed over time allowing division into three groups: 101 (31.9%) given upfront AD; 139 (43.8%) given SNB + AD; and 77 (24.3%) given SNB only because the SNs were negative.Results: After median follow-ups of 92 (AD), 99 (SNB + AD) and 72 months (SNB-only), OS (p = 0.131) and DFS (p = 0.087) did not differ between the 3 groups, or between SNB-only and the ypN1 and ypN0 subgroups of SNB + AD, or between the cN0 and cN1 subgroups (before chemotherapy) of the SNB-only group. No SNB-only patient had axillary failure. OS (p = 0.004) and DFS (p = 0.002) were better in patients with complete response than those with partial response or stable/progressive disease.Conclusions: SNB is adequate in T2 patients who are cN0 after primary chemotherapy, irrespective of axillary status before. Better outcomes after complete pathological remission confirm the prognostic importance of response to primary chemotherapy, and suggest that all T2 patients should receive primary chemotherapy.

TI  - Forecasting winter wheat yields using MODIS NDVI data for the Central Free State region
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Consumption of wheat is widespread and increasing in South Africa. However, global wheat production is projected to decline. Wheat yield forecasting is therefore crucial for ensuring food security for the country. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the anthesis wheat growth stage is suitable for forecasting dryland wheat yields in the Central Free State region using satellite imagery and linear predictive modelling. A period of 10 years of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter and 10 years of wheat yield data were used for model calibration. Diagnostic plots and statistical procedures were used for model validation and assessment of model adequacy. The period 30 days before harvest during the anthesis stage was established to be the best period during which to use the linear regression model. The calibrated model had a coefficient of determination of 0.73, a p-value of 0.00161 and a root mean squared error of 0.41 tons/ha. Residual plots confirmed that a linear model had a good fit for the data. The quantile-quantile plot provided evidence that the residuals were normally distributed, which means that assumptions of linear regression were fulfilled and the model can be used as a forecasting tool. Model validation showed high levels of accuracy. The evidence indicates that use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data during the anthesis growth stage is a reliable, cost-effective and potentially time-saving alternative to ground-based surveys when forecasting dryland wheat yields in the Central Free State.Significance:Developing a cost-effective technique based on satellite imagery for wheat yield forecasting is vital for food security planning in South Africa.

TI  - A coastal surface seawater analyzer for nitrogenous nutrient mapping
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-data-based modeling of chlorophyll indicates that ocean waters in the mesosphere category are responsible for the majority of oceanic net primary productivity. Coastal waters, which frequently have surface chlorophyll values in the mesosphere range and have strong horizontal chlorophyll gradients and large temporal variations. Thus programs of detailed coastal nutrient surveys are essential to the study of the dynamics of oceanic net primary productivity, along with land use impacts on estuarine and coastal ecosystems. The degree of variability in these regions necessitates flexible instrumentation capable of near real-time analysis to detect and monitor analytes of interest. This work describes the development of a portable coastal surface seawater analyzer for nutrient mapping that can simultaneously elucidate with high resolution the distribution of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium - the three principal nitrogenous inorganic nutrients in coastal systems. The approach focuses on the use of pulsed xenon flash lamps to construct an analyzer which can be adapted to any automated chemistry with fluorescence detection. The system has two heaters, on-the-fly standardization, on-board data logging, an independent 24 volt direct current power supply, internal local operating network, a 12 channel peristaltic pump, four rotary injection/selection valves, and an intuitive graphical user interface. Using the methodology of Masserini and Fanning (2000) the detection limits for ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate plus nitrite were 11, 10, and 22 nM, respectively. A field test of the analyzer in Gulf of Mexico coastal waters demonstrated its ability to monitor and delineate the complexity of inorganic nitrogen nutrient enrichments within a coastal system.

TI  - Investigating spatial and seasonal variations of urban heat island effect over Jaipur city and its relationship with vegetation, urbanization and elevation parameters
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the principal parameters for the analysis of surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. Analysis of 8-day night-time LST data shows that significant SUHI exists over the Jaipur study area. Average maximum UHI intensity from 2003 to 2015 varies from 5.12 K to 10.37 K, and overall average maximum UHI intensity is 7.86 K. A negative correlation exists between LST and vegetation indices. The relationship between LST and percent impervious surface area (% ISA) is almost same throughout the entire season with a consistent rising trend. A positive correlation has been found between LST and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), especially for monsoon season. The trend of LST and NDBI relationship during the different season is different, which clearly indicates that the relationship between LST and NDBI is season dependent. NDBI cannot be used as a good indicator for SUHI studies where bare land is predominant especially for the summer season. Hence % ISA can be used as a better parameter for SUHI studies than NDBI. As the elevation increases, rising trend of LST can be observed in the study area. LST-Elevation scatterplots show a negative relationship in high altitude areas, especially during monsoon season.

TI  - Cultural theory of risk as a heuristic for understanding perceptions of oil and gas development in Eastern Montana, USA
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper applies Douglas' cultural theory of risk to understand perceptions of risk associated with oil and gas development in eastern Montana. Based on the analysis of interviews with 36 rural residents, findings show the dominant perception of risk is most closely aligned with an Individualist worldview. Despite direct experience with oil or wastewater spills, most interviewees described spills as "no big deal", viewed nature as resilient, and felt that the economic benefits outweigh negative impacts. Cultural theory was a useful heuristic for understanding this dominant worldview, as well as identifying points of deviation. For example, interviewees discussed the benefits of landowner associations - a more Egalitarian approach to dealing with oil companies. Some landowners relied on external authorities (e.g., sheriff) when dealing with oil companies, revealing a Hierarchical approach to issues they face. Interviewees expressed frustration with the lack of enforcement of existing regulations, which can be interpreted as either support for - or indictment of - Hierarchical solutions. While the Individualist worldview is dominant, our qualitative analysis reveals the complex tensions at work among rural residents. The results suggest areas where policymakers, advocacy groups, and residents may find common ground to address potential environmental and health risks.

TI  - Use of Indocyanine Green for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Case Series and Methods Comparison.
T2  - Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is indicated for patients with biopsy-proven thickness melanoma greater than 1.0mm. Use of lymphoscintigraphy along with vital blue dyes is the gold standard for identifying sentinel lymph nodes intraoperatively. Indocyanine green (ICG) has recently been used as a method of identifying sentinel lymph nodes. We herein describe a case series of patients who have successfully undergone ICG-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma. We compare 2 imaging systems that are used for ICG-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy.METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent ICG-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma using the SPY Elite system (Novadaq, Mississigua, Canada) and the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe system (Mitaka USA, Park City, Utah). We analyzed costs for 2 systems that utilize ICG for sentinel lymph node biopsies.RESULTS: Intraoperative use of ICG for sentinel lymph node biopsies was successful in correctly identifying sentinel lymph nodes. There was no difference between the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe and SPY Elite systems in the ability to detect sentinel lymph nodes; however, the former was associated with a lower operating cost and ease of use compared with the latter.CONCLUSION: ICG-assisted sentinel lymph biopsy using the SPY Elite or the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe systems for melanoma are comparable in terms of sentinel node detection. The Neo probe system delivers pertinent clinical data with the advantages of lower cost and ease of operation.

TI  - Satellite Assessment of Early-Season Forecasts for Vegetation Conditions of Grazing Allotments in Nevada, United States
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent and heterogeneity of rangelands in the state of Nevada (United States) pose a challenging situation for land managers when determining stocking levels for livestock grazing. Overutilization can cause lasting environmental damage, while underutilization can create unnecessary economic hardship for livestock operators. An improved ability to forecast vegetation stress later in the growing season would allow resource managers to better manage the tradeoffs between ecological and economic concerns. This research maps how well growing season conditions for vegetation within grazing allotments of Nevada can be predicted at different times of the year by analyzing 15 yr of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor, cumulative monthly precipitation, and the Palmer drought severity index. Land cover classes within the grazing allotments that are not relevant to grazing were removed from the analysis, as well as areas that showed N 50% change in EVI since these likely represented transitions or disturbances that were not related to interannual climate variability. The datasets were gridded at spatial resolutions from 4 to 72 km, and the correspondence between image and meteorological datasets was found to improve as measurements were averaged over larger areas. A 16-km sampling grid was judged to provide the best balance between predictive ability and spatial precision. The average R-2 of regressions between the vegetation index and meteorological variables within each of the 16-km grid cells was 0.69. For most of Nevada, the ability to predict vegetation conditions for the entire growing season (February-September) generally peaks by the end of May. However, results vary by region, with the northeast particularly benefiting from late-season data. Regressions were performed with and without very wet years, and the ability to make early predictions is better when including wet years than in dry to typical conditions.

TI  - The 2015 M<i><sub>w</sub></i>7.2 Sarez Strike-Slip Earthquake in the Pamir Interior: Response to the Underthrusting of India's Western Promontory
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pamir orogen, Central Asia, is the result of the ongoing northward advance of the Indian continent causing shortening inside Asia. Geodetic and seismic data place the most intense deformation along the northern rim of the Pamir, but the recent 7 December 2015, M(w)7.2 Sarez earthquake occurred in the Pamir's interior. We present a distributed slip model of this earthquake using coseismic geodetic data and postseismic field observations. The earthquake ruptured an approximate to 80km long, subvertical, sinistral fault consisting of three right-stepping segments from the surface to approximate to 30km depth with a maximum slip of three meters in the upper 10km of the crust. The coseismic slip model agrees well with en echelon secondary surface breaks that are partly influenced by liquefaction-induced mass movements. These structures reveal up to 2m of sinistral offset along the northern, low-offset segment of modeled rupture. The 2015 event initiated close to the presumed epicenter of the 1911 M-w approximate to 7.3 Lake Sarez earthquake, which had a similar strike-slip mechanism. These earthquakes highlight the importance of NE trending sinistral faults in the active tectonics of the Pamir. Strike-slip deformation accommodates shear between the rapidly northward moving eastern Pamir and the Tajik basin in the west and is part of the westward (lateral) extrusion of thickened Pamir plateau crust into the Tajik basin. The Sarez-Karakul fault system and the two large Sarez earthquakes likely are crustal expressions of the underthrusting of the northwestern leading edge of the Indian mantle lithosphere beneath the Pamir.Plain Language Summary The Pamir mountains in Central Asia are being piled up by the northward advancing Indian continent. Nowadays most of the deformation occurs at the Pamir's rim, but on 7 December 2015, a large earthquake struck the interior of this mountain range (magnitude 7). We use radar satellite data with centimeter accuracy to measure the coseismic displacement of this earthquake and find that an 80km long segment of the Sarez-Karakul fault was ruptured. This fault splits the Pamir in a western and eastern part. Our geologists, who visited the area 9months after the earthquake, confirmed our observations and further reported that the rupture was heavily damped at the surface by permafrost. The area was already once struck by a large earthquake in 1911. The question arises if also this event activated the Sarez-Karakul fault, as this fault is the only known large structure in the Pamir's interior. But the center of the Pamir deforms only little, and it is unlikely that this fault ruptures twice in 100 years. Finally, we show that both earthquakes occurred directly on top of the Indian promontory bulldozing into the Asian crust underneath the Pamir.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Collection 6 aerosol retrieval algorithms over Indo-Gangetic Plain: Implications of aerosols types and mass loading
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the performance of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) AOD retrieval algorithms, including Dark Target (DT) aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 3 and 10 km spatial resolutions, Deep Blue (DB) AOD at 10 km, and the merged DT-DB AOD at 10 km across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), South Asia. A total of 14,736 collocated Aqua MODIS C6 AOD at 550 nm were evaluated against AOD from six AERONET stations over IGP, measured during the satellite overpass (+/- 1 h) from 2006 to 2015. The effects of aerosol heterogeneity, in terms of both aerosol loading and the aerosol type, on the uncertainty of the satellite-borne AOD retrieval were examined. The DT algorithm at both resolutions (3 km and 10 km) overestimated the AOD by 14-25%, with only 51.37-61.29% of the retrievals falling within the expected error (EE). The DT 3 km algorithm underestimates the surface reflectance in comparison to the DT 10 km, with the latter outperforming the former both in terms of number of collocations and retrieval accuracy, especially over urban areas. The DB 10 km was able to retrieve AOD over both arid/desert regions and vegetated surfaces even under low aerosol loading conditions. Yet, its performance was still poor, with retrieval accuracy of 53.76%, low RMSE (0.214), and generally underestimated AOD across the IGP. The merged DT-DB AOD product was mostly dominated by DT retrievals (73%-100%), except over bright land surfaces and 56.03% of the merged DT-DB retrievals fell within the EE. The retrieval accuracy of MODIS C6 products was found to be strongly dependent on the estimated surface reflectance and the aerosol type. Across IGP, DB predicted the surface reflectance better while DT at both resolutions overestimated the surface reflectance at varying extent. For high aerosol loading conditions with varying aerosol size, retrieval accuracy of DT 10 km poses lower sensitivity while DT at 3 km exhibits larger uncertainty in estimating surface reflectance. In contrast, DB 10 km shows greater bias that depends on the aerosol size. For very high aerosol loading conditions, dominated by fine or mixed aerosols, all the algorithms have errors in the aerosol model. The DT 10 km, DB 10 km and the merged AOD performed almost equally within the threshold level while the DT 3 km showed the poorest performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and RMSE. We conclude that across IGP, DB 10 km AOD has the highest accuracy in retrieving fine mode aerosols while DT 10 km AOD has almost identical accuracy in retrieving varying aerosol types. For coarse dominated aerosols, when the dissimilarity between DT and DB remains highest, the merged AOD is found to have higher accuracy in retrieving AOD across IGP.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program focuses on assessing the degree to which federal land management under the aquatic conservation strategy (ACS) of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) has been effective in maintaining and improving watershed conditions. We used stream sampling data and upslope/riparian geographic information system (GIS) and remote-sensing data to evaluate condition for sixth-field watersheds in each aquatic province within the NWFP area. Stream conditions were evaluated based on sampling data collected from 2002 to 2013 (214 watersheds) as part of an 8-year repeating (rotating) sample design. For both rotations, approximately 60 percent of the stream scores fell between 40 and 60 and relatively few (2 percent) were less than 20; no watersheds scored above 80 during either rotation. We detected small but improving status trends in physical habitat, aquatic macroinvertebrates scores. and water temperature. Upslope/riparian condition scores were calculated for 1993 and 2012, and the difference between these two distributions of scores was used to represent trend. In 2012, a total of 26 percent of the overall watershed area received scores above 80.68 percent scored between 40 and 80, and only 6 percent scored below 40. Since 1993. scores in 16 percent of the NWFP area increased by more than 5 percent, while only 7 percent declined by a similar magnitude. Although at the plan level the mean score changed little (+1), there were broad-scale moderate gains resulting from vegetation growth and larger but more concentrated gains resulting from road decommissioning. These gains, which occurred predominantly in areas most heavily managed prior to the NWFP, were largely offset by high declines in scores stemming from large fires, particularly in reserve areas.

TI  - Assessment of recent glacier changes and its controlling factors from 1976 to 2011 in Baspa basin, western Himalaya
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers are normally difficult to monitor through field observations because of highly rugged and extremely inaccessible mountainous terrain. Thus, using Landsat data (MSS, ETM+ and TM), changes in glacier area, length, and debris cover have been delineated in the Baspa basin, which is a highly glacierized sub-basin of the Satluj River in the western Himalaya. Out of the total 109 glaciers inventoried through Landsat TM imagery (2011), 36 glaciers were found to be heavily debris covered (32.5 +/- 2.0%). A shrinkage in glacier area of 41.2 +/- 10.5 km(2) (i.e., 18.1 +/- 4.1%) at a rate of 1.18 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) from 1976 (227.4 +/- 9.4 km(2)) to 2011 (186.2 +/- 3.7 km(2)) has been recorded. The overall glacier retreat studied for 33 glaciers varied from 3.3 +/- 0.03%, that is, 0.87 +/- 0.06 km at a rate of 17.2 +/- 1 m a(-1) to 30 +/- 6.6%, that is, 0.60 +/- 0.04 km at a rate of 24.8 +/- 0.2 m a-1. Consequently, the debris cover has increased by 23.5 +/- 1.4 km(2) (16.3 +/- 3.8%) from 1976 to 2011. Overall, the clean, small sized, low-altitude glaciers with south to southwest aspect and relatively steep slope have lost maximum area, which indicated a major control of these factors on the glacier changes. Simultaneously, a trend estimation of observed climatic data (1976/1985-2008) of three meteorological stations (Sangla, Rakcham, and Chitkul) using Mann Kendall test, Sen's Slope estimator and linear regression test revealed an increase in temperature and rainfall while a decline in snowfall. Importantly, the T-min has increased significantly at 95% confidence level during all the studied periods. The mean annual T-min and T-max indicated a rising trend at a rate of 0.076 and 0.071 degrees C a(-1). Thus, the changes in temperature and precipitation may be the major causes of accelerating the glacier ablation. The higher area changes (53.0 +/- 0.4%), of small glaciers <0.5 km(2) mark their sensitivity to climatic changes especially rising temperature. Under the warming climate, formation and progressive expansion of glacial lakes is expected because of the glacier recession in the basin. For instance, the Baspa Bamak Proglacial Lake at the snout of Baspa Bamak glacier has expanded continuously from 2000 onward.

TI  - Spaceborne Observations of the Diurnal Variation of Shortwave Aerosol Direct Radiative Effect at Top of Atmosphere Over the Dust-Dominated Arabian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ScaRaB payload onboard the low-inclination Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite has been making observations of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) for different local times (LTs) of the day over the tropics since October 2011. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the diurnal variation of the regional instantaneous aerosol direct radiative effect efficiency (IADREE) at TOA, which is otherwise not possible using the available long-term satellite observations carried out using similar sensors onboard polar sun-synchronous satellites. In this paper, the diurnal variations of the IADREE over the Arabian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean during June-September, when both these regions are engulfed by large-scale mineral dust plumes transported from the adjoining deserts, are investigated using collocated multiyear (2012-2014) observations of the MT-ScaRaB measured shortwave fluxes and MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth. The estimates of the IADREE made using the MT-ScaRaB data at 13:30 LT are found to be in agreement with those derived from the Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System data at this LT, at which the latter observations are carried out. The IADREE derived from the MT-ScaRaB shows diurnal peak value of -53 +/- 10 Wm(-2)tau(-1)(550) and -40 +/- 3 Wm(-2)tau(-1)(550) at solar zenith angle of similar to 40 degrees over the Arabian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Diurnal mean aerosol direct radiative effect efficiency at TOA during June-September is -22 +/- 4.5 Wm(-2)tau(-1)(550) over the Arabian Sea and -18 +/- 3.6 Wm(-2)tau(-1)(550) over the Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - It is well recognized that the incidence of breast cancer increases significantly with age. Despite this, older people remain under-represented in many clinical trials and their management relies on extrapolation of data from younger patients. Providing an aggressive intervention can be challenging, particularly in less fit older patients where a conservative approach is commonly perceived to be more appropriate. The optimal management of this population is unknown and treatment decision should be personalized. This review article will discuss several controversial issues in managing older adults with early breast cancer in a multidisciplinary setting, including the role of surgical treatment of the axilla in clinically node negative disease, radiotherapy after breast conservation surgery in low-risk tumours, personalizing adjuvant systemic therapy, and geriatric assessments in breast cancer treatment decisions.

TI  - RAPT: Rare Class Prediction in Absence of True Labels
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many real-world problems involve learning models for rare classes in situations where there are no gold standard labels for training samples but imperfect labels are available for all instances. In this paper, we present RAPT, a three step predictive modeling framework for classifying rare class in such problem settings. The first step of the proposed framework learns a classifier that jointly optimizes precision and recall by only using imperfectly labeled training samples. We also show that, under certain assumptions on the imperfect labels, the quality of this classifier is almost as good as the one constructed using perfect labels. The second and third steps of the framework make use of the fact that imperfect labels are available for all instances to further improve the precision and recall of the rare class. We evaluate the RAPT framework on two real-world applications of mapping forest fires and urban extent from earth observing satellite data. The experimental results indicate that RAPT can be used to identify forest fires and urban areas with high precision and recall by using imperfect labels, even though obtaining expert annotated samples on a global scale is infeasible in these applications.

TI  - Green garden snail, <i>Cantareus apertus</i>, as biomonitor and sentinel for integrative metal pollution assessment in roadside soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation was conceived to study, in a small scale field study, the potential of the green garden snail, Cantareus apertus, as biomonitor and sentinel for integrative metal pollution assessment in soils. For this purpose, we investigated the association between the trace metal (Cd, Pb, As, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) concentrations in soil, plants (Trifolium repens), and C. apertus depending on the distance (20, 150, and 700 m) from a main roadside in Tunisia as well as between metal concentrations and biomarkers of oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and neurotoxicity in C. apertus. Results revealed a clear association between the concentration of metals such as Ni, Cu, and Zn in snail digestive gland, both amongst them and with oxidative stress and neurotoxicity biomarkers recorded in the same organ. Interestingly, Ni, Pb, and Zn occurred at the highest concentration in soil, plant, and snails and the association appeared related to the immediacy of the roadside and the concentration of these three metals tended to decrease with distance from the roadside in the soil-plant-snail system. Conversely, Cd and Cu were bioaccumulated in plants and snails but their concentrations in soil were not high and did not show a decline in concentration with distance from the roadside. After PCA analysis, PC-01 (56% of the variance) represented metal bioaccumulation and associated toxic effects in snails in the presence of high levels of metal pollution (nearby the roadside) while PC-02 (35% of the variance) represented stress induced by moderate levels of metal pollution (at intermediate distances from the roadside). The four studied sites were clearly discriminated one from each other, depending on how they are affected by traffic pollution. In summary, this field study reveals that (a) C. apertus can be used as biomonitor for metal pollution in roadside soils and as sentinel for pollution effects assessment based on biochemical biomarkers; and (b) that oxidative stress and neurotoxicity biomarkers endow with a powerful biological tool for metal pollution biomonitoring in soils, especially in combination with chemical analysis of the soil-plant-snail transfer system. Moreover, this study provides some baseline data for future impact assessments concerning trace metal pollution in Tunisia.

TI  - Persistence of productive surface thermal fronts in the northeast Arabian Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we demonstrate the persistence of sea surface thermal fronts based on the frequency of Sea Surface Temperature gradient satellite data, at seasonal and non-seasonal cycles. Prominent thermal fronts were observed in the northeast Arabian Sea between the 50m bathymetry contour and continental self break (similar to 200 metre contour). A total of 45-75% of thermal fronts occurred at the annual timescales whereas 20-30% occurred at the semi-annual time-scales. Maximum frequency occurrence was observed in the coastal waters south and southwest of Saurashtra peninsula during February and March. Primary productivity co-varies with the frequency of the thermal fronts with a time-lag of 2-4 weeks. This outcome can help on timely and reliable prediction of biologically productive zones.

TI  - Correlation analysis between regional carbon monoxide and black carbon from satellite measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present and compare regional correlations between CO total column density (TCDco) from the data set of Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and high-absorbing BC dominant aerosol optical depth (AOD(Bc)) from the retrieval algorithm using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (MODIS-OMI algorithm, MOA). TCDco shows positive relationship to both fine -mode AOD (AOD(Fm)) and AODBc in general, but TCDco better correlates with AODBc than AODFm. This enhanced correlation between TCDco and AODBc appears more clearly during spring and summer. Correlation between TCDco and AODBc is exceptionally poor in Northern Africa where the BC dominated aerosols are frequently mixed with mineral dust particles from the Sahara. Another issue is also found in Southern Africa; the correlation between AODBc and TCDco in this region is not much higher than that between the AODFm and TCDco in spite of large occurrence of biomass burning and wildfire. This can be explained by the cloud perturbation near the source regions and dispersion effect due to the typical wind pattern. Correlations between AODBc and TCDco increase further when fire detected areas are only considered, but does not change much over the urban area. This difference clarifies the large contribution of burning events to the positive relationship between BC and CO. All findings in this study demonstrate a possible use of satellite CO product in evaluating the BC-dominated aerosol product from satellite remote sensing over the globe.

TI  - A solar radiation database for Chile
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chile hosts some of the sunniest places on earth, which has led to a growing solar energy industry in recent years. However, the lack of high resolution measurements of solar irradiance becomes a critical obstacle for both financing and design of solar installations. Besides the Atacama Desert, Chile displays a large array of "solar climates" due to large latitude and altitude variations, and so provides a useful testbed for the development of solar irradiance maps. Here a new public database for surface solar irradiance over Chile is presented. This database includes hourly irradiance from 2004 to 2016 at 90 m horizontal resolution over continental Chile. Our results are based on global reanalysis data to force a radiative transfer model for clear sky solar irradiance and an empirical model based on geostationary satellite data for cloudy conditions. The results have been validated using 140 surface solar irradiance stations throughout the country. Model mean percentage error in hourly time series of global horizontal irradiance is only 0.73%, considering both clear and cloudy days. The simplicity and accuracy of the model over a wide range of solar conditions provides confidence that the model can be easily generalized to other regions of the world.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Procedures
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Accurate staging of many cancers with no clinical evidence of lymph node involvement is often a critical component of the management of such cancers and is generally and historically accomplished by accurate pathological assessment of multiple nodes. Unfortunately, such assessment usually involves excision of the multiple nodes and can result in significant morbidities. Over the past half century, and particularly over the last quarter century, investigators have defined and refined the "sentinel lymph node(s)" concept and have developed and investigated sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures. Such procedures are designed to stage cancers primarily via assessment of the sentinel nodes of the cancers and to do so with limited risk of morbidities. For some cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, head-and-neck, penile), there are SLNB procedures that are used routinely. For other cancers, there are SLNB procedures being investigated that will yet prove successful and practical or successful but not practical or neither practical nor successful. In this review, SLNB procedures for breast, melanoma (adult and pediatric), head-and neck, gastrointestinal (gastric, esophageal, colon), genitourinary (penile, prostate), and gynecological (uterine, cervical, vulvar, ovarian) cancers are discussed, including results of significant clinical trials performed using such in the management of these various cancers.

TI  - Identification of C-Band Radio Frequency Interferences from Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose the use of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to provide a continuous and global monitoring of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) in C-band. We take advantage of the first 8-10 echo measures at the beginning of each burst, a 50-70 MHz wide bandwidth and a ground beam coverage of similar to 25 km (azimuth) by 70 km (range). Such observations can be repeated with a frequency better than three days, by considering two satellites and both ascending and descending passes. These measures can be used to qualify the same Sentinel-1 (S1) dataset as well as to monitor the availability and the use of radio frequency spectrum for present and future spaceborne imagers and for policy makers. In the paper we investigate the feasibility and the limits of this approach, and we provide a first Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) map with continental coverage over Europe.

TI  - Preoperative sentinel lymph node identification, biopsy and localisation using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in patients with breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided core biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) could identify metastatic nodes preoperatively and reduce the number of surgical SLN biopsies in patients with breast cancer and normal axillary B-mode ultrasound; and to establish whether CEUS SLN identification and localisation is a viable alternative to standard lymphatic mapping using isotope and blue dye.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of several electronic databases was performed and identified studies were assessed using QUADAS-2 for methodological quality. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for identification of nodal metastases were calculated.RESULTS: Eleven prospective studies and one retrospective study with 1,520 participants were included. The SLN identification and localisation rate for CEUS-guided skin marking was 70-100%, CEUS guided-wire localisation was 89-97%, and CEUS-guided iodine-125 (I-125) seed localisation was 60%. Across the four studies that evaluated preoperative CEUS-guided SLN biopsy, pooled sensitivity for identification of nodal metastases was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47-61) and pooled specificity 100% (95% CI: 99-100).CONCLUSION: CEUS is a promising technique for preoperative staging of the axilla. CEUS-guided core biopsy has the potential to identify nodal metastases in over half (54%) of patients with normal axillary B-mode ultrasound. CEUS-guided identification and localisation of the SLN may offer a viable alternative to standard lymphatic mapping using isotope and blue dye; however, further prospective studies with larger samples are warranted.

TI  - IR spectroscopy of synthetic glasses with Mercury surface composition: Analogs for remote sensing
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a study to provide ground-truth data for mid-infrared observations of the surface of Mercury with the MERTIS (Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer) instrument onboard the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission, we have studied 17 synthetic glasses. These samples have the chemical compositions of characteristic Hermean surface areas based on MESSENGER data.The samples have been characterized using optical microscopy, EMPA and Raman spectroscopy. Mid infrared spectra have been obtained from polished thin sections using Micro-FTIR, and of powdered size fractions of bulk material (0-25, 25-63, 93-125 and 125-250 gm) in the 2.5-18 pm range.The synthetic glasses display mostly spectra typical for amorphous materials with a dominating, single Reststrahlen Band (RB) at 9.5-10.7 pm. RB Features of crystalline forsterite are found in some cases at 9.5-10.2 pm, 10.4-11.2 pm, and at 11.9 pm. Dendritic crystallization starts at a MgO content higher than 23 wt.% MgO.The Reststrahlen Bands, Christiansen Features (CF), and Transparency Features (TF) shift depending on the SiO2 and MgO contents. Also a shift of the Christiansen Feature of the glasses compared with the SCFM (SiO2/(SiO2+CaO+FeO+MgO)) index is observed. This shift could potentially help distinguish crystalline and amorphous material in remote sensing data. A comparison between the degree of polymerization of the glass and the width of the characteristic strong silicate feature shows a weak positive correlation.A comparison with a high-quality mid-IR spectrum of Mercury shows some moderate similarity to the results of this study, but does not explain all features.

TI  - Assessment of hydrological response as a function of LULC change and climatic variability in the catchment of the Wular Lake, J&K, using geospatial technique
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to identify the relationship and effect of various hydrological processes on the Wular Lake ecosystem. The study focused on assessment of combined hydrological response of LULC change and climatic variability in the upper catchment of Wular Lake. Multi-temporal satellite data were used for assessment of temporal dynamics of the lake catchment. The spatio-temporal pattern of annual soil loss and sediment yield has been assessed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation approach and sediment delivery ratio adopted from USDA Soil Conservation Service in GIS environment. The runoff was estimated in the watershed using SCS curve number. The main impelling forces that led to the changes in land use/land cover in the catchment is mainly due to increased human activities, which ultimately leads to the increased erosion and sediment yield. The anticipated mean annual soil loss which was found 123.23 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 1992 increased to 942.52 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 2013. Similarly, estimated mean annual sediment yield also indicated an increase from 34.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 1992 to 233.4 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 2013. In addition, the decrease in rainfall from the last 35 years has led to the decline in runoff and consequent reduction in the surface water supply. The results of the present study indicate due to the changes in LULC and consequent hydrological changes like decreased run-off, increased erosion and sedimentation reduce the water holding capacity of lake day by day, thus leading to its deterioration.

TI  - In-vivo imaging of the sentinel vein using the near-infrared vascular imaging system in hallux valgus patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A high incidence of dorsomedial cutaneous nerve (DMCN) damage in hallux valgus surgery has been reported. Identification of the vein around 1st metatarsal head is reported to be helpful to reduce the DMCN damage during surgery. The near-infrared (NIR) vascular imaging system, the Vein-Viewer (R) Flex, projects the vein onto the skin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the difference of the vein course between normal and hallux valgus foot using the VeinViewer (R) Flex, and to validate that the DMCN was accompanied with its vein.Methods: Twenty-seven feet with the hallux valgus and 27 feet in healthy subjects were included. The vein was projected onto the skin at the metatarsal head by the VeinViewer (R) Flex. The distance between the vein and the mid-line of the metatarsal head was measured. The correlation of the distance and hallux valgus angle or 1-2 intermetatarsal angle (IMA) was analyzed. The vein depicted by the Vein-Viewer (R) Flex and operative findings was compared in 4 patients during surgery.Results: The vein in the hallux valgus patients shifted toward the dorsolateral side on the metatarsal bone head compared to that in healthy subjects. The distance from the midline of the 1st metatarsal bone to the vein in the hallux valgus (12.1 mm) was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (2.7 mm) (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the shift of the vein course toward dorsolateral and IMA. Surgical exploration revealed that the vein depicted by VeinViewer (R) Flex could be easily identified and the nerve was along with this vein in all 4 surgical cases.Conclusions: The vein in the hallux valgus patients shifted toward the dorsolateral on the metatarsal bone and it could be a landmark to identify DMCN. The NIR vascular imaging system would be useful to reduce the risk of nerve damage in great toe surgery. (C) 2017 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prevalence of use and perceptions of risk of novel and other alternative tobacco products among sexual minority adults: Results from an online national survey, 2014-2015
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]) populations experience disparities in cigarette use, but sparse evidence exists about novel and other alternative tobacco product use. In this study, we compared rates of novel and other alternative tobacco product use, risk perceptions, and worldview between LGB and heterosexual (HET) adults. An online survey administered in 2014-2015, using a weighted probability sample of 11,525 U.S. adults, assessed awareness of tobacco products; ever and current use of e-cigarettes, cigars, little cigars and cigarillos, and hookahs; perceptions of e-cigarettes; and worldview (individualism vs. communitarianism). Bivariate and adjusted multivariable analyses were performed to determine differences between LGB and HET groups. In the adjusted analyses, LGB adults were 1.5 times more likely to have ever used e-cigarettes (95% CI 1.2-1.9) and 1.9 times more likely to have ever used hookahs (95% CI 1.5-2.4) as compared to HET adults. A lower percentage of LGB adults, as compared to HET adults (16.7% vs. 19.2%), believed that exposure to vapors from e-cigarettes was "harmful" and reported that they "did not know" of any harm (35.1% vs. 39.8%). LGB were 20% less likely than were HET adults to endorse an individualistic worldview. These results suggest that a disparity exists, whereby LGB adults are more likely to have used e-cigarettes and hookahs. In addition, although vapor from e-cigarettes contains nicotine and other chemicals, LGB adults are less likely to perceive exposure to secondhand vapor as harmful. Tailored awareness campaigns and interventions are needed to convey the risks and curb use of these products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Empirical and Machine Learning Algorithms for Estimation of Coastal Water Quality Parameters
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal waters are one of the most vulnerable resources that require effective monitoring programs. One of the key factors for effective coastal monitoring is the use of remote sensing technologies that significantly capture the spatiotemporal variability of coastal waters. Optical properties of coastal waters are strongly linked to components, such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and suspended solids (SS) concentrations, which are essential for the survival of a coastal ecosystem and usually independent of each other. Thus, developing effective remote sensing models to estimate these important water components based on optical properties of coastal waters is mandatory for a successful coastal monitoring program. This study attempted to evaluate the performance of empirical predictive models (EPM) and neural networks (NN)-based algorithms to estimate Chl-a and SS concentrations, in the coastal area of Hong Kong. Remotely-sensed data over a 13-year period was used to develop regional and local models to estimate Chl-a and SS over the entire Hong Kong waters and for each water class within the study area, respectively. The accuracy of regional models derived from EPM and NN in estimating Chl-a and SS was 83%, 93%, 78%, and 97%, respectively, whereas the accuracy of local models in estimating Chl-a and SS ranged from 60-94% and 81-94%, respectively. Both the regional and local NN models exhibited a higher performance than those models derived from empirical analysis. Thus, this study suggests using machine learning methods (i.e., NN) for the more accurate and efficient routine monitoring of coastal water quality parameters (i.e., Chl-a and SS concentrations) over the complex coastal area of Hong Kong and other similar coastal environments.

TI  - Development of a spectral-pattern-analysis-based method for automated water body extraction using Landsat image data: A case study in central Vietnam and southern Laos
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body mapping is an important application of optical remote sensing. Methods for classifying water bodies using multispectral image data have been successfully developed for water resource monitoring and management. However, in most cases, these traditional methods provide only partial automation capabilities. In this study, we propose a new spectral-pattern-analysis-based (SPAB) method for water body extraction using simplified spectral patterns (SSPs). Simplified spectral patterns are a generalized transformation of spectral patterns from analogue to digital format, realized by nonrepetitive pairwise comparison of reflectance values between two bands. Simplified spectral patterns allow for the direct incorporation of spectral patterns into the recognition process. The advantage of this method compared to traditional methods is that the SPAB method allows automation of water body classification using an SSP database. In this study, we selected a mountainous region in central Vietnam and southern Laos as a study site. Four Landsat 8 OLI scenes from 2015 and four Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes from 2001 and 2002 were used. The results of our proposed method were compared with visual interpretation, normalized differential water index (NDWI) thresholding, and the Global Inland Water (GIW) dataset provided by the Global Land Cover Facility of the University of Maryland. It is concluded that the classification results of the SPAB method agree by more than 98.0% with NDWI results for Landsat 8 OLI images, and by more than 95.0% with the GIW dataset for Landsat 7 ETM+ images.

TI  - Landsat 8/OLI Two Bands Ratio Algorithm for Chlorophyll-A Concentration Mapping in Hypertrophic Waters: An Application to West Lake in Hanoi (Vietnam)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in inland waters, particularly hypertrophic lake waters in megacities, is a critically important environmental issue. To enable long-term Chl-a monitoring using Landsat series sensors, development of a Chl-a estimation algorithm for the new Landsat sensor is requisite. This study aims to identify the most accurate algorithm for Chl-a estimation in hypertrophic waters using Landsat 8 images and in situ Chl-a data from West Lake and nine other hypertrophic lakes in Hanoi (Vietnam's capital). The best estimation was obtained by the ratio of two reflectances at 562 and 483 nm, corresponding to the ratio of the OLI band 3 versus band 2, termed the GrB(2) algorithm. The GrB2 values using the reflectances of water samples and the Landsat images were correlated with the Chl-a by an exponential function (r(2) = 0.64 to 0.82), and the estimated Chl-a were verified by the smallness of standard error (smaller than 10%) and degree of conformity with recent fish-kill phenomena that commonly occur in those lakes in summer and early spring. Because the availability of GrB2 is limited to waters with low levels of inorganic suspended matter, its extension to waters with much higher levels requires further investigation.

TI  - Transformation of Landsat imagery into pseudo-hyperspectral imagery by a multiple regression-based model with application to metal deposit-related minerals mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing is superior to traditional multispectral remote sensing in detailed spectral information but has limited spatial and temporal coverage. Those limitations require an innovative technique that can simulate hyperspectral imagery from multispectral imagery with global coverage, continuous acquisition, and a small number of bands. For this, a combination of Hyperion and Landsat 7 ETM+ images is a representative target. The present study develops a new method, Pseudo-Hyperspectral Image Transformation Algorithm (PHITA), for transforming Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery into pseudo-Hyperion imagery using correlations between Landsat and Hyperion band reflectance data. Each correlation is defined as a multiple linear regression model selected through Bayesian model averaging, in which Hyperion and Landsat bands are dependent and predictor variables, respectively. The resultant pseudo-image has a number of high-quality Hyperion bands of the same scene size as a Landsat image. Through verification of transformation accuracy by statistical analyses and surface mineral mapping, the pseudo-Hyperion image was proven very similar to the original band reflectances, because of large Pearson's correlation coefficients (generally > 0.94), small RMS error (mostly < 0.016), high structural similarity, and similar appearance of the color composite image. Using a reference mineral map built from an AVIRIS image and field surveys as ground truth, an advantage of the pseudo-image is clarified for the Cuprite hydrothermal alteration area in the western United States. The identification and mapping accuracies of metal deposit-related minerals were high even in areas outside the original Hyperion scene. Featured absorptions were reconstructed in pseudo-reflectance spectra of the typical minerals in the area. The results can enhance the potential of a large Landsat-series dataset over the long term by transformation into pseudo-Hyperion images for global land surfaces.

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a staging procedure in patients with melanoma: A critical appraisal
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Worldwide, sentinel node (SN) biopsy for accurate staging is now part of the standard work-up of patients with melanomas >= 1.0 mm Breslow thickness, as it is for staging patients with breast cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging and surgical techniques have evolved to such a degree that a SN can be identified and removed in virtually every patient. Nevertheless, some opposition to a routine SN biopsy remains, perhaps due to a failure to appreciate the serious implications of incomplete or inaccurate staging. Guided by a critical appraisal of the available evidence, this review elucidates the definition of an SN, discusses the sensitivity and specificity of the information it provides, emphasises that it is a minor staging procedure that can lead to improved survival when followed by appropriate therapy, and explains the necessarily unconventional and complex design of the only randomised trial that addresses this subject. It also describes other benefits and risks of an SN biopsy and outlines its role in current melanoma management.

TI  - Relationships of S-Band Radar Backscatter and Forest Aboveground Biomass in Different Forest Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals respond to the interactions of microwaves with vegetation canopy scatterers that collectively characterise forest structure. The sensitivity of S-band (7.5-15 cm) backscatter to the different forest types (broadleaved, needleleaved) with varying aboveground biomass (AGB) across temperate (mixed, needleleaved) and tropical (broadleaved, woody savanna, secondary) forests is less well understood. In this study, Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS-I) radiative transfer model simulations showed strong volume scattering returns from S-band SAR for broadleaved canopies caused by ground/trunk interactions. A general relationship between AirSAR S-band measurements and MIMICS-I simulated radar backscatter with forest AGB up to nearly 100 t/ha in broadleaved forest in the UK was found. Simulated S-band backscatter-biomass relationships suggest increasing backscatter sensitivity to forest biomass with a saturation level close to 100 t/ha and errors between 37 t/ha and 44 t/ha for HV and VV polarisations for tropical ecosystems. In the near future, satellite SAR-derived forest biomass from P-band BIOMASS mission and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in combination with S-band UK NovaSAR-S and the joint NASA-ISRO NISAR sensors will provide better quantification of large-scale forest AGB at varying sensitivity levels across primary and secondary forests and woody savannas.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mammary carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells is uncommon, and its onset mechanism and malignancy are unknown. We report a case of mammary carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells. A 41-year-old woman noticed a lump in her left breast. Ultrasound sonography findings suggested breast cancer. A core needle biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Modified radicalmastectomy and sentinell ymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathologicalexamination revealed papillotubular carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells. Cells were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone, and negative for HER2. MIB-1 index was under 5%. The giant cells were generally associated with an inflammatory, fibroblastic, hyper-vascular stroma. The carcinomatous part of the lesion was most frequently a well-to moderately differentiated invasive ductalcarcinoma. Immunohistochemicaland ultrastructuralstudies suggested that the osteoclast-like giant cells were of stromalhistiocytic origin. To understand biochemicalfindings of this carcinoma, more case studies are required to be reported.

TI  - Significant decline in lymphatic filariasis associated with nationwide scale-up of insecticide-treated nets in Zambia.
T2  - Parasite epidemiology and control
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne disease, broadly endemic in Zambia, and is targeted for elimination by mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole and diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) to at-risk populations. Anopheline mosquitoes are primary vectors of LF in Africa, and it is possible that the significant scale-up of malaria vector control over the past decade may have also impacted LF transmission, and contributed to a decrease in prevalence in Zambia. We therefore aimed to examine the putative association between decreasing LF prevalence and increasing coverage of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) for malaria vector control, by comparing LF mapping data collected between 2003-2005 and 2009-2011 to LF sentinel site prevalence data collected between 2012 and 2014, before any anti-LF MDA was started. The coverage of ITNs for malaria was quantified and compared for each site in relation to the dynamics of LF. We found a significant decrease in LF prevalence from the years 2003-2005 (11.5% CI95 6.6; 16.4) to 2012-2014 (0.6% CI95 0.03; 1.1); at the same time, there was a significant scale-up of ITNs across the country from 0.2% (CI95 0.0; 0.3) to 76.1% (CI95 71.4; 80.7) respectively. The creation and comparison of two linear models demonstrated that the geographical and temporal variation in ITN coverage was a better predictor of LF prevalence than year alone. Whilst a causal relationship between LF prevalence and ITN coverage cannot be proved, we propose that the scale-up of ITNs has helped to control Anopheles mosquito populations, which have in turn impacted on LF transmission significantly before the scale-up of MDA. This putative synergy with vector control has helped to put Zambia on track to meet national and global goals of LF elimination by 2020.

TI  - The Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII): An inundation filter to flag flooded pixels and improve MODIS tidal marsh vegetation time-series analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.

TI  - Cytogenetic analysis of metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a rare and generally aggressive disease that accounts for less than 0.1% of all breast carcinomas. Although SCCs have distinct morphological features, their origin and cytogenetic profile are not well understood.Methods Five patients with SCC were studied. The tumor area that was predominantly composed of SCC components was macrodissected and DNA was extracted. In three cases, an invasive or noninvasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (NST) component was also present. NST-component DNA was also extracted. The tumor DNA was used for array comparative genomic hybridization analysis using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. The cytogenetic profile of the SCC components was compared with each other and with the paired NST component in three of the five cases.Results The cytogenetic profile of the SCC components indicated large intertumoral heterogeneity. There were between 2 and 160 copy number alterations per case, and no common copy number alterations were identified. The cytogenetic profiles of the paired SCC and NST components were similar but not identical. Although, in one case, a larger number of copy number aberrant regions were detected in the SCC component than the NST component. In this case, all the NST component aberrations were present in the SCC component. This implies that the SCC component originated from the NST component. There were no common SCC component-specific aberrations in the three NST-component cases.Conclusion Our results demonstrate the cytogenetic interand intratumoral heterogeneity of SCC of the breast. Our comparison of cytogenetic profiles indicated that the SCC component originated from the NST component in one case.

TI  - Simulating the Canopy Reflectance of Different Eucalypt Genotypes With the DART 3-D Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding suitable models of canopy reflectance in forward simulation mode is a prerequisite for their use in inverse mode to characterize canopy variables of interest, such as leaf area index (LAI) or chlorophyll content. In this study, the accuracy of the three-dimensional reflectance model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) was assessed for canopies of different genotypes of Eucalyptus, having distinct biophysical and biochemical characteristics, to improve the knowledge on how these characteristics are influencing the reflectance signal as measured by passive orbital sensors. The first step was to test the model suitability to simulate reflectance images in the visible and near infrared. We parameterized DART model using extensive measurements from Eucalyptus plantations including 16 contrasted genotypes. Forest inventories were conducted and leaf, bark, and forest floor optical properties were measured. Simulation accuracy was evaluated by comparing the mean top of canopy (TOC) bidirectional reflectance of DART with TOC reflectance extracted from a Pleiades very high resolution satellite image. Results showed a good performance of DART with mean reflectance absolute error lower than 2%. Intergenotype reflectance variability was correctly simulated, but the model did not succeed at catching the slight spatial variation for a given genotype, excepted when large gaps appeared due to tree mortality. The second step consisted of sensitivity analysis to explore which biochemical or biophysical characteristics influenced more the canopy reflectance between genotypes. Perspectives for using DART model in inversion mode in these ecosystems were discussed.

TI  - Performance of a Mobile Phone App-Based Participatory Syndromic Surveillance System for Acute Febrile Illness and Acute Gastroenteritis in Rural Guatemala
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With their increasing availability in resource-limited settings, mobile phones may provide an important tool for participatory syndromic surveillance, in which users provide symptom data directly into a centralized database.Objective: We studied the performance of a mobile phone app-based participatory syndromic surveillance system for collecting syndromic data (acute febrile illness and acute gastroenteritis) to detect dengue virus and norovirus on a cohort of children living in a low-resource and rural area of Guatemala.Methods: Randomized households were provided with a mobile phone and asked to submit weekly reports using a symptom diary app (Vigilant-e). Participants reporting acute febrile illness or acute gastroenteritis answered additional questions using a decision-tree algorithm and were subsequently visited at home by a study nurse who performed a second interview and collected samples for dengue virus if confirmed acute febrile illness and norovirus if acute gastroenteritis. We analyzed risk factors associated with decreased self-reporting of syndromic data using the Vigilant-e app and evaluated strategies to improve self-reporting. We also assessed agreement between self-report and nurse-collected data obtained during home visits.Results: From April 2015 to June 2016, 469 children in 207 households provided 471 person-years of observation. Mean weekly symptom reporting rate was 78% (range 58%-89%). Households with a poor (<70%) weekly reporting rate using the Vigilant-e app during the first 25 weeks of observation (n=57) had a greater number of children (mean 2.8, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.5, SD 1.3; risk ratio [RR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4), were less likely to have used mobile phones for text messaging at study enrollment (61%, 35/57 vs 76.7%, 115/150; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9), and were less likely to access care at the local public clinic (35%, 20/57 vs 67.3%, 101/150; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6). Parents of female enrolled participants were more likely to have low response rate (57.1%, 84/147 vs 43.8%, 141/322; RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9). Several external factors (cellular tower collapse, contentious elections) were associated with periods of decreased reporting. Poor response rate (<70%) was associated with lower case reporting of acute gastroenteritis, norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis, acute febrile illness, and dengue virus-associated acute febrile illness (P<.001). Parent-reported syndromic data on the Vigilant-e app demonstrated agreement with nurse-collected data for fever (kappa=.57, P<.001), vomiting (kappa=.63, P<.001), and diarrhea (kappa=.61, P<.001), with decreased agreement as the time interval between parental report and nurse home visit increased (<1 day: kappa=.65-.70;>= 2 days: kappa=.08-.29).Conclusions: In a resource-limited area of rural Guatemala, a mobile phone app-based participatory syndromic surveillance system demonstrated a high reporting rate and good agreement between parental reported data and nurse-reported data during home visits. Several household-level and external factors were associated with decreased syndromic reporting. Poor reporting rate was associated with decreased syndromic and pathogen-specific case ascertainment.

TI  - Remote sensing appraisal of Lake Chad shrinkage connotes severe impacts on green economics and socio-economics of the catchment area
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Chad commonly serves as a major hub of fertile economic activities for the border communities and contributes immensely to the national growth of all the countries that form its boundaries. However, incessant and multi-decadal drying via climate change pose greater threats to this transnational water resource, and adverse effects on ecological sustainability and socio-economic status of the catchment area. Therefore, this study assessed the extent of shrinkage of Lake Chad using remote sensing. Landsat imageries of the lake and its surroundings between 1987 and 2005 were retrieved from Global Land Cover Facility website and analysed using Integrated Land and Water Information System version 3.3 (ILWIS 3.3). Supervised classification of area around the lake was performed into various land use/land cover classes, and the shrunk part of its environs was assessed based on the land cover changes. The shrinkage trend within the study period was also analysed. The lake water size reduced from 1339.018 to 130.686 km(2) (4.08-3.39%) in 1987-2005. The supervised classification of the Landsat imageries revealed an increase in portion of the lake covered by bare ground and sandy soil within the reference years (13 490.8-17 503.10 km(2)) with 4.98% total range of increase. The lake portion intersected with vegetated ground and soil also reduced within the period (11 046.44-10 078.82 km(2)) with 5.40% (967.62 km(2)) total decrease. The shrunk part of the lake covered singly with vegetation increased by 2.74% from 1987 to 2005. The shrunk part of the lake reduced to sand and turbid water showed 5.62% total decrease from 1987 to 2005 and a total decrease of 1805.942 km(2) in area. The study disclosed an appalling rate of shrinkage and damaging influences on the hydrologic potential, eco-sustainability and socio-economics of the drainage area as revealed using ILWIS 3.3.

TI  - Patient Age and Tumor Subtype Predict the Extent of Axillary Surgery Among Breast Cancer Patients Eligible for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Trial Z0011
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial established the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for early-stage breast cancer patients with limited nodal disease undergoing lumpectomy. We examined the extent of axillary surgery among women eligible for Z0011 based on patient age and tumor subtype.Methods. Patients with cT1-2, cN0 breast cancers and one or two positive nodes diagnosed from 2009 to 2014 and treated with lumpectomy were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was defined as the removal of 1-5 nodes and ALND as the removal of 10 nodes or more. Tumor subtype was categorized as luminal, human epidermal growth factor 2-positive (HER2+), or triple-negative. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of receiving SLNB alone versus ALND.Results. The inclusion criteria were met by 28,631 patients (21,029 SLNB-alone and 7602 ALND patients). Patients 70 years of age or older were more likely to undergo SLNB alone than ALND (27.0% vs 20.1%; p < 0.001). The radiation therapy use rate was 89.4% after SLNB alone and 89.7% after ALND. In the multivariate analysis, the uptake of Z0011 recommendations increased over time (2014 vs 2009: odds ratio [OR] 13.02; p < 0.001). Younger patients were less likely to undergo SLNB alone than older patients (age < 40 vs >= 70: OR 0.59; p < 0.001). Patients with HER2+ (OR 0.89) or triple-negative disease (OR 0.79) (p < 0.001) were less likely to undergo SLNB alone than those with luminal subtypes.Conclusions. Among women potentially eligible for ACOSOG Z0011, the use of SLNB alone increased over time in all groups, but the extent of axillary surgery differed by patient age and tumor subtype.

TI  - Advancements in staging and imaging for penile cancer
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewWe review recent advancements in staging and imaging of penile cancer, including surveillance after therapy.Recent findingsFor cN0 patients, the sentinel lymph node biopsy is currently considered the preferred way for invasive staging. It has largely replaced other modalities such as staging inguinal lymphadenectomy. Its diagnostic value increases when combined with other staging modalities such as ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) or fluorodeoxyglucose-PET with computed tomography (PET/CT). In patients with palpably suspicious nodes (cNthorn), imaging is more useful. PET/CT has shown good accuracy in a limited number of small studies. US-FNAC can confirm nodal metastatic disease. A staging inguinal lymphadenectomy is of therapeutic value but is associated with significant morbidity. Omitting staging inguinal lymphadenectomy was recently described; one study showed well tolerated use of sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with intraoperative ultrasound-guided resection of suspicious nodes in cNthorn patients. Therapeutic inguinal lymphadenectomy was only performed in the 42% of groins with metastases confirmed by disorder. For M-staging, PET/CT has shown good sensitivity, and its role should be further evaluated. Follow-up and surveillance rely on physical examination and US-FNAC.SummaryOver the past decade, staging and treatment of penile cancer have become less invasive, while survival tends to improve.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Comparison of Agricultural Drought Indices from Moderate Resolution Satellite Soil Moisture Data over Northwest Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, a variety of agricultural drought indices have been developed using soil moisture (SM), or any of its surrogates, as the primary drought indicator. In this study, a comprehensive study of four innovative SM-based indices, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI), the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and the Soil Wetness Deficit Index (SWetDI), is conducted over a large semi-arid crop region in northwest Spain. The indices were computed on a weekly basis from June 2010 to December 2016 using 1-km satellite SM estimations from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and/or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The temporal dynamics of the indices were compared to two well-known agricultural drought indices, the atmospheric water deficit (AWD) and the crop moisture index (CMI), to analyze the levels of similarity, correlation, seasonality and number of weeks with drought. In addition, the spatial distribution and intensities of the indices were assessed under dry and wet SM conditions at the beginning of the growing season. The results showed that the SWDI and SMADI were the appropriate indices for developing an efficient drought monitoring system, with higher significant correlation coefficients (R approximate to 0.5-0.8) when comparing with the AWD and CMI, whereas lower values (R 0.3) were obtained for the SMDI and SWetDI.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node dissection using Tc-99m phytate in papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Various methods of sentinel Lymph node (SLN) biopsy in thyroid cancer have been introduced. Tc-99m phytate as a radiotracer has been successfully utilized for SLN biopsy in breast, cervix, and endometrial cancer. We assessed the feasibility of SLN dissection using Tc-99m phytate in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).Methods: Seventeen patients with PTC were prospectively enrolled. Ultrasound-guided peritumoral injection of 55.5 MBq Tc-99m phytate in 0.25-mL normal saline was performed. Preoperative single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECTj and intraoperative gamma-probe were used for SLN detection during operation.Results: Identification rate of SLNs was 70.6% (12 of 17) with SPECT, and 88.2% (15 of 17) with gamma-probe. Combined SPECT and gamma-probe had identification rates of 88.2% (15 of 17). Identification rates of SLNs in central LN compartments were 82.4% (14 of 17) and 41.2% (7 of 17) in lateral LN compartments. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the results of SLN biopsy were 91.6%, 100%, 88.4%, and 100%, respectively. Eight patients (47.1%) had metastasis in SLNs; all patients had SLN metastasis in the central compartment and 2 patients had SLN metastasis in both the central and lateral compartments.Conclusion: Combined SPECT and gamma-probe could detect SLNs with an 88.2% identification rate in PTC. SLN biopsy using Tc-99m phytate is technically feasible. Further investigation is warranted for clinical application of Tc-99m phytate in PTC.

TI  - Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data processing for aquatic science applications: Demonstrations and validations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A mission with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard was launched in 2015, initiating a new era in high-to-moderate-resolution (i.e., 10 to 60 m) imaging of Earth's resources. This manuscript describes the implementations of MSI processing into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) and provides qualitative and quantitative analyses of remote sensing reflectance products (Rrs), which are essential in the retrievals of near-surface concentrations of water constituents in aquatic systems. In situ validations and intercomparisons of MSI-derived 11 products with those derived from Landsat-8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) both indicated reasonable products in coastal/inland waters. Following vicarious calibrations using reference in situ water-leaving radiances, the overall absolute relative differences and the root mean squared differences (RMSD) found for the matchup analyses were, < 7% and < 0.0012 1/sr, respectively, for the blue and green bands. With preliminary indications of consistency with the OLI products and very good agreements with in situ data, a time-series plot of total suspended solids (TSS) product derived from both missions was produced and analyzed for an inland system. It is surmised that frequent moderate-to-high resolution R products from the combined Sentinel-2A (and 13) and Landsat-8 missions are now available to the science/user community for developing algorithms suited for coastal/inland waters. Nonetheless, further research needs to be dedicated to a) improving atmospheric corrections over bodies of waters rich in dissolved organic matter or suspended particles, b) mitigating the impact of haze-or sea surface-reflected solar radiations at low solar zenith angles, and c) minimizing image artifacts to maximize the use of multi-mission products.

TI  - Estimation and Prediction of Grassland Cover inWestern Mongolia Using MODIS-Derived Vegetation Indices
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices derived from satellite observations, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), are widely used for grassland monitoring and management around the globe. In this study we contrasted performance of NDVI and EVI metrics obtained from Aqua and Terra, the two satellite platforms carrying the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, for estimating grassland cover measured at ground level on ninety-two 1 x 1 km blocks distributed from semidesert to high montane grasslands in the Sailugem Range of western Mongolia, where overgrazing and overstocking of domestic livestock are concerns for pastureland management. We also explored utility of late spring (May) vegetation indices for forecasting vegetation cover at the peak of the growing season (July). Vegetation indices developed using MODIS 1-km monthly data (MOD13A3 and MYD13A3) were strongly related to on-the ground field estimates of the percentage of vegetation cover in July (74-85% variation explained), with second-order polynomial regressions demonstrating better fit to the data than first-order regressions, Aqua vegetation indices (VIs) explaining slightly more variance than Terra's VIs, and NDVI performing comparably to EVI for both Aqua and Terra. Both Aqua and Terra VIs for May were highly predictive of July vegetation cover (R-2 = 0.80-0.84). We conclude that monthly MODIS NDVI and EVI datasets can be useful for rangeland managers in western Mongolia to monitor and predict summer pasture conditions at the regional level, where science-based guidance on grazing policy and practices is much needed.

TI  - Secondary breast carcinoma after completely remitted chronic myeloid leukemia following targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a rare case of secondary breast carcinoma after chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a 56-year-old woman. The patient was treated with hydroxyurea and imatinib for CML and achieved complete remission (she has since been taking imatinib as the maintenance therapy). Four years later, the patient noticed a firm and painless lump in the left breast, which was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ based on a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. Simple resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy of the left breast were then performed. Pathological studies revealed a medium-grade intraductal carcinoma, with local infiltration associated with invasive micropapillary carcinoma. She received adjuvant endocrine therapy with imatinib after surgery. Breast cancer secondary to CML (treated with imatinib and completely remitted) is extremely rare. This report provides evidence to assist in the diagnosis and treatment for this rare manifestation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Historical and exact information about the land use/land cover change is very important for regional sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to determine the rapid changes in land use/land cover (LULC) pattern due to agriculture expansion, environmental calamities such as flood and government policies over Upper Narmada basin, India. Multi-temporal Landsat satellite images for years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015 were used to analyze and monitor the changes in LULC with an overall accuracy of more than 85%. Results revealed a potential decrease in natural vegetation (-9.52%) due to the expansion of settlement (+ 0.52%) and cropland (+ 9.43%) from 1990 to 2015. In the present study, Cellular Automata and Markov (CA-Markov), an integrated tool was used to project the short-term LULC map of year 2030. The projected LULC ( 2030) indicated the expansion of built-up area along with the cropland and degradation in the vegetation area. The outcomes from the study can help as a guiding tool for protection of natural vegetation and the management of the built-up area. Additionally, it will help in devising the strategies to utilize every bit of land in the study area for decision makers.

TI  - SAR-Based Vessel Velocity Estimation From Partially Imaged Kelvin Pattern
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be considered an operational asset for maritime monitoring applications. Well-assessed approaches exist for ship detection, validated in several maritime surveillance systems. However, measuring vessel velocity from detected single-channel SAR images of ships is in general difficult. This letter contributes to this problem by investigating the possibility of retrieving vessel velocity by wake analysis. An original method for velocity estimation is developed for calm sea (Beaufort scale 1-2) and applied over seven X-band SAR images, gathered by COSMO-SkyMed mission over the Gulf of Naples, Italy. The algorithm exploits the well-known relation between the wavelength of the waves composing the Kelvin pattern and the ship velocity. But the proposed approach extends the applicability of the existing wake-based techniques since it foresees evaluation of the wavelength along a generic direction in the Kelvin angle. Promising results have been achieved, which are in good agreement with those of more assessed techniques for ship velocity estimation in SAR images.

TI  - Procedure and Results of Geodynamic Monitoring in the Uzelga and Talgan Mining Areas in the South Ural
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The procedure and data of many years-long geodynamic monitoring of the ground surface displacements in the Uzelga and Talgan mining areas are presented. Despite similar geological conditions, the difference in the types of the protected objects on the ground surface commands different variants of the procedure for each deposit. Some points of reference surveying network and observation plugs are re-fixed using the satellite data, digital elevation meter and electronic tachometer, and characteristics of trends in modern geodynamic movement induced by a displacement trough are obtained. As a result of the implemented geodynamic activity assessment, vectors of general spatial displacements of observation plugs and curves of compression-tensions and shearing strains are determined. It is found that rock mass deformation has a discrete mosaic pattern. The conclusions are generalized, and the hypotheses are made on the further deformation of the ground surface.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of PET/CT and/or SLN mapping alone or in combination in cervical cancer patients.Data on stage IA1-IIA cervical cancer patients undergoing PET/CT and SLN mapping were retrospectively collected. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of PET/CT and SLN mapping, alone or in combination, in identifying cervical cancer patients with lymph node metastases were calculated.Sixty patients met the inclusion criteria. PET/CT showed a sensitivity of 68%, a specificity of 84%, a PPV of 61% and a NPV of 88% in detecting lymph nodal metastases. SLN mapping showed a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100% and a NPV of 97%. The combination of PET/CT and SLN mapping showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 86%, a PPV of 72% and a NPV of 100%. For patients with tumors of > 2 cm in diameter, the PET/CT showed a sensitivity of 68%, a specificity of 72%, a PPV of 61% and a NPV of 86%. SLN mapping showed a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100% and a NPV of 95%. The combination of PET/CT and SLN mapping showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 76%, a PPV of 72% and a NPV of 100%.PET/CT represents a "safety net" that helps the surgeon in identifying metastatic lymph nodes, especially in patients with larger tumors.

AB  - Taiwanese cultural critic Kuan-Hsing Chen has elaborated and promoted an Asia and the rest worldview for over a decade. His opus magnumAsia as Method argues for a paradigm shift to observe Asian reality with a de-imperialized, de-colonized, and de-Cold War mentality. The work has produced academic discussions among advocates and antagonists in social science and humanities. This article critically examines its main tenets and education scholars' reaction to them: whether Chen's deconstruction of the West and the rest offers a substantive and distinctive Asia-centric research methodology to the field of education in its content, pedagogy, and knowledge production.

AB  - The assessment of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections in cases of classic type of invasive lobular carcinoma (cILC) is considered unreliable, particularly in cases with minimal involvement, that is by either isolated tumor cells (pN0i+) or micrometastases (pN1mi). Although the impact of minimal SLN involvement has been shown to be insignificant in most clinical trials (even though cILC was either under-represented or not separated in the respective cohorts), the results of MIRROR trial did emphasize the need for additional therapy in cases with minimally involved SLN to ensure improved disease-free survival. We sought to study the role of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC) in evaluating SLN in cILC. A total of 582 cILC cases with SLN diagnosed over a 12-year period (2005 to 2016) were reviewed. In all, 394/582 (68%) cases had H&E (-)/CK(-) SLN. In total, 188/582 (32%) cases showed some degree of SLN involvement of which 143/582 (25%) cases had readily identifiable SLN involvement on H&E slides. Overall, 45/582 (7.7%) cases had H&E(-)/CK(+) SLN. The following data relate to the latter subset of 45 cases. Mean age of patients: 61 y (range: 32 to 86 y); right: 24 (53%), left: 21 (47%); multifocal and/or multicentric: 22 (49%); mean size: 2.0 cm (range: 0.25 to 4.4 cm); mean number of SLN: 2.5; mean number of involved SLN: 1.2; and cases with prior needle core or excisional biopsy: 45 (100%). CK(+) cells were identified in isolation or in loose clusters, either in subcapsular sinuses or nodal cortex or both. Overall, 30/45 (67%) showed <= 200 CK(+) cells (ie, pN0i+), and 15/45 (33%) showed > 200 CK(+) cells (ie, pN1mi). In total, 15/45 (33%) cases underwent axillary lymph node dissection, of which 4/45 (9%) cases were positive. cILC recurred in 3/45 (7%) cases. On statistical analyses, the number of CK(+) cells (<=/> 200) did not correlate with either axillary lymph node-positivity or with recurrence. Number of CK(+) cells (<=/> 200) readily distinguished pN0i+ from pN1mi based on AJCC's numerical criteria. CK(+) cells could be quantified in linear terms (ie, AJCC's size criteria of pN0i+ and pN1mi was applicable) in only 2 cases. On the basis of these findings, the use of CK-IHC staining should be considered for SLN in cases of cILC to ensure detection, and precise determination of extent, of involvement; however, the prognostic significance of this procedure would have to await results of additional studies with long-term follow-up.

TI  - The impact of armed conflict and forced migration on urban expansion in Goma: Introduction to a simple method of satellite-imagery analysis as a complement to field research
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of armed conflict on cities constitute a large field of research in both conflict studies and urban studies. The topic of urban expansion is also explored by the domain of remote sensing, a sub-branch of geoinformation science. Remote sensing researchers analyze the spatial development of cities in conflict and non-conflict environments using satellite imagery.However, a dialogue or collaboration between these disciplines is virtually non-existent in the scientific discourse, mainly due to stark differences in their methodologies - namely, intensive on-the-ground field research in the case of conflict and urban studies and highly elaborate computer-based analysis of remotely-gathered data in the case of remote sensing.We aim to demonstrate a simple and thus feasible approach for the use of satellite imagery by non experts of remote sensing, to add a spatio-temporal dimension to the results of in-depth field studies. We apply our approach to the city of Goma, in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is located at the center of protracted armed conflict that has raged for decades. With the support of local knowledge acquired during field visits, we visually analyze a time series of Landsat data and add our own results to those of existing research. Contextualizing the mapped results of Goma's urban expansion between 1986 and 2015, we show how urban growth is linked to particular waves of forced displacement caused by different stages of armed conflict and one particular natural disaster.

TI  - New insights on the 2012-2013 uplift episode at Fernandina Volcano (Galapagos)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We analysed the 2012-2013 uplift episode at Fernandina Volcano (Galapagos) through the inverse modeling of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) ground displacement field. The post-processing analysis of COSMO-SkyMed satellite data revealed that the uplift phenomenon can be divided in three distinctive intervals in which the displacement maintains a nearly constant deformation rate. We used both ascending and descending acquisitions to evaluate the vertical and the horizontal E-W components of the displacement field. The vertical displacement is strongly limited in a narrow region around the caldera rim, where the circumferential fissures that border the summit platform are localized and the E-W component of the horizontal displacement affects the external volcano flanks, up to the apron region. Moreover, we exploited the DInSAR time-series by performing a cross-correlation analysis: both vertical and E-W cross-correlated maps confirm that the observed uplift episode is related to the existence of a single active source, approximated as a pipe-like source. Indeed, our results, obtained through an inverse modeling approach by investigating different type of analytic sources, suggest the existence of an over pressurized pipe-like source, with a slight dip toward SE and located beneath the summit caldera region. The modeled geodetic source could represent the shallower part of an extended and deeper magmatic reservoir.

TI  - Burned Area Mapping in the Brazilian Savanna Using a One-Class Support Vector Machine Trained by Active Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire data (375 m spatial resolution) to automatically extract multispectral samples and train a One-Class Support Vector Machine for burned area mapping, and applied the resulting classification algorithm to 300-m spatial resolution imagery from the Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V). The active fire data were screened to prevent extraction of unrepresentative burned area samples and combined with surface reflectance bi-weekly composites to produce burned area maps. The procedure was applied over the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, validated with reference maps obtained from Landsat images and compared with the Collection 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area product (MCD64A1) Results show that the algorithm developed improved the detection of small-sized scars and displayed results more similar to the reference data than MCD64A1. Unlike active fire-based region growing algorithms, the proposed approach allows for the detection and mapping of burn scars without active fires, thus eliminating a potential source of omission error. The burned area mapping approach presented here should facilitate the development of operational-automated burned area algorithms, and is very straightforward for implementation with other sensors.

TI  - Comparison of Global Land Cover Datasets for Cropland Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable information on the spatial distribution of major crops is needed for detecting possible production deficits with the aim of preventing food security crises and anticipating response planning. In this paper, we compared some of the most widely used global land cover datasets to examine their comparative advantages for cropland monitoring. Cropland class areas are compared for the following datasets: FAO-GLCshare (FAO Global Land Cover Network), Geowiki IIASA-Hybrid (Hybrid global land cover map from the International Institute of Applied System Analysis), GLC2000 (Global Land Cover 2000), GLCNMO2008 (Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations), GlobCover, Globeland30, LC-CCI (Land Cover Climate Change Initiative) 2010 and 2015, and MODISLC (MODIS Land Cover product). The methodology involves: (1) highlighting discrepancies in the extent and spatial distribution of cropland, (2) comparing the areas with FAO agricultural statistics at the country level, and (3) providing accuracy assessment through freely available reference datasets. Recommendations for crop monitoring at the country level are based on a priority ranking derived from the results obtained from analyses 2 and 3. Our results revealed that cropland information varies substantially among the analyzed land cover datasets. FAO-GLCshare and Globeland30 generally provided adequate results to monitor cropland areas, whereas LC-CCI2010 and GLC2000 are less unsuitable due to large overestimations in the former and out of date information and low accuracy in the latter. The recently launched LC-CCI datasets (i.e., LC-CCI2015) show a higher potential for cropland monitoring uses than the previous version (i.e., LC-CCI2010).

TI  - What local people? Examining the Gallok mining conflict and the rights of the Sarni population in terms of justice and power
T2  - GEOFORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The global extraction of minerals is commonly located in areas populated by indigenous people; and while conflicts between multinational corporations and local activists and indigenous people are widespread today, the understanding of their dynamics are lacking. The Swedish government's encouragement to an expanding mining industry has caused resistance due to environmental and social implications, particularly its effect on Sarni reindeer husbandry. The resistance to a mine in Gallok is based on the belief that the right to decide about land use historically falls on the Sarni people, and the right to affect land use is detrimental for the survival of Sarni culture and reindeer husbandry. Although the conflict may be perceived as concerning access to natural resources, we argue that the perceived environmental conflict can be viewed as part of a larger struggle over social status and recognition. Data have been collected using qualitative methods such as observations, interviews and documents. The subsequent analysis relies on a meta-theoretical framework of justice as recognition using a typology of relations of power. Our findings suggest that relations of power constitute different categories of social actors. Stakeholders like the Sami population are subordinated to more dominant stakeholders such as the government, the company and media, who have 'more' power or 'different' kinds of power 'over' others. Through these asymmetric power relations, historicalstate-Sami relations are continuously reproduced within prevailing institutions, and also in this mining conflict. Interviewees from business and the municipality testified to the discourses driven by a neoliberal and profit-focused worldview. Challenging the neoliberal discourse, other stakeholders, namely civil society and Sami, expressed an alternative discourse based on a local, traditional, cultural, environmental and anti-neoliberal worldview.

TI  - Nature-based agricultural solutions: Scaling perennial grains across Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Modem plant breeding tends to focus on maximizing yield, with one of the most ubiquitous implementations being shorter-duration crop varieties. It is indisputable that these breeding efforts have resulted in greater yields in ideal circumstances; however, many fanned locations across Africa suffer from one or more conditions that limit the efficacy of modem short-duration hybrids. In view of global change and increased necessity for intensification, perennial grains and long-duration varieties offer a nature-based solution for improving farm productivity and smallholder livelihoods in suboptimal agricultural areas. Specific conditions where perennial grains should be considered include locations where biophysical and social constraints reduce agricultural system efficiency, and where conditions are optimal for crop growth. Using a time-series of remotely-sensed data, we locate the marginal agricultural lands of Africa, identifying suboptimal temperature and precipitation conditions for the dominant crop, i.e., maize, as well as optimal climate conditions for two perennial grains, pigeonpea and sorghum. We propose that perennial grains offer a lower impact, sustainable nature-based solution to this subset of climatic drivers of marginality. Using spatial analytic methods and satellite-derived climate information, we demonstrate the scalability of perennial pigeonpea and sorghum across Africa. As a nature-based solution, we argue that perennial grains offer smallholder fanners of marginal lands a sustainable solution for enhancing resilience and minimizing risk in confronting global change, while mitigating social and edaphic drivers of low and variable production.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of the Geoeffective Solar Event of 21 June 2015: Effects on the Magnetosphere, Plasmasphere, and Ionosphere Systems
T2  - SOLAR PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME) left the Sun on 21 June 2015 from active region (AR) NOAA 12371. It encountered Earth on 22 June 2015 and generated a strong geomagnetic storm whose minimum Dst value was -204 nT. The CME was associated with an M2-class flare observed at 01: 42 UT, located near disk center (N12 E16). Using satellite data from solar, heliospheric, and magnetospheric missions and ground-based instruments, we performed a comprehensive Sun-to-Earth analysis. In particular, we analyzed the active region evolution using ground-based and satellite instruments (Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), Hinode, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), covering Ha, EUV, UV, and X-ray data); the AR magnetograms, using data from SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI); the high-energy particle data, using the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) instrument; and the Rome neutron monitor measurements to assess the effects of the interplanetary perturbation on cosmic-ray intensity. We also evaluated the 1 -8 angstrom soft X-ray data and the similar to 1 MHz type III radio burst time-integrated intensity (or fluence) of the flare in order to predict the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event using the model developed by Laurenza et al. (Space Weather 7(4), 2009). In addition, using ground-based observations from lower to higher latitudes (International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) and European Quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array (EMMA)), we reconstructed the ionospheric current system associated with the geomagnetic sudden impulse (SI). Furthermore, Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) measurements were used to image the global ionospheric polar convection during the SI and during the principal phases of the geomagnetic storm. In addition, to investigate the influence of the disturbed electric field on the low-latitude ionosphere induced by geomagnetic storms, we focused on the morphology of the crests of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly by the simultaneous use of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, ionosondes, and Langmuir probes onboard the Swarm constellation satellites. Moreover, we investigated the dynamics of the plasmasphere during the different phases of the geomagnetic storm by examining the time evolution of the radial profiles of the equatorial plasma mass density derived from field line resonances detected at the EMMA network (1.5 < L < 6.5). Finally, we present the general features of the geomagnetic response to the CME by applying innovative data analysis tools that allow us to investigate the time variation of ground-based observations of the Earth's magnetic field during the associated geomagnetic storm.

TI  - The Optimal Treatment Plan to Avoid Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients Differs by Surgical Strategy and Tumor Subtype
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategies to reduce the likelihood of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) include application of Z0011 or use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Indications for ALND differ by treatment plan, and nodal pathologic complete response rates after NAC vary by tumor subtype. This study compared ALND rates for cT1-2N0 tumors treated with upfront surgery versus those treated with NAC.The ALND rates for cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients were compared by tumor subtype among women undergoing upfront surgery to NAC. Multivariable analysis with control for age, cT stage, and lymphovascular invasion, and stratification by subtype was performed.The study identified 1944 cancers in 1907 women who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with or without ALND (669 upfront breast-conserving surgeries [BCSs], 1004 upfront mastectomies, 271 NACs). Compared with the NAC group, the ALND rates in the BCS group were lower for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2(-)) tumors (15 vs 34%; p < 0.001). The ALND rates in the upfront mastectomy group were higher than in the NAC group for HER2(+) or TN tumors. In the multivariable analysis, receipt of NAC compared with upfront BCS remained significantly associated with higher odds of ALND in the ER/PR+ HER2(-) subtype (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; p < 0.001), whereas NAC versus upfront mastectomy remained significantly associated with lower odds of ALND in the HER2(+) and TN subtypes (HR for HER2(+), 0.19, p < 0.001; HR for TN, 0.25, p = 0.007).The study showed that ALND rates differ according to surgery type and tumor subtype secondary to differing ALND indications and nodal response to NAC. These factors can be used to personalize treatment planning to minimize ALND risk for patients with early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - PET-CT gamma probe-guided lymph node biopsy: a new diagnostic surgical approach
T2  - TUMORI
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Purpose: The higher sensitivity of new diagnostic tools makes it easier to detect relapse in asymptomatic stages when classic procedures of lymph node biopsies are difficult to perform. The aim of this article is to describe the combination of gamma probe and F-18-FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) images in combination with sentinel lymph node biopsy technique for detection of nonpalpable lymph nodes.Methods: After a dose of F-18-FDG was administered and PET-CT images that showed the location of suspected pathologic lymph nodes were obtained, transcutaneous localization of the lymph nodes with the highest captation of the tracer was done. The gamma probe was programmed to detect the radioactive signal from the F18, instead of the Tc99m that is usual in the sentinel node biopsy technique. Once the hottest point was detected, a short incision was made on this area, and suspicious nodes with the highest uptake registered by the gamma probe were localized and removed. After the surgical removal from the operating field, the surgical pieces stood positive to the gamma probe. Lymph node involvement, and subsequent relapse, was diagnosed before their clinical manifestation.Conclusions: This methodology confirms new horizons for the surgical approach of lymph node biopsies in patients with previous tumors with F-18-FDG avidity and suspicion of relapse.

TI  - On the Direct Calculation of Snow Water Balances Using Snow Cover Information
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel method for the direct determination of the snowmelt coefficient of widely used degree-day models, using only cumulated temperature and precipitation over the days of snow cover. We develop a proof of concept using (1) local measurements of precipitation, temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) at a set of well-monitored sites in the US, and (2) available time series of snow cover from satellite and gridded daily precipitation and daily average temperature for the study region of South Tyrol, in the Italian Alps. We demonstrate how the method can reproduce the snow water balance to an acceptable extent, critically depending on the accuracy of input precipitation and temperature, highlighting the importance of a reliable representation of weather forcing if the estimate has to be robust and representative. Although not always accurate at a point, our approach yields a SWE reasonably consistent with observations, and snowmelt flows compatible with measured streamflow. At the same time, the model allows an interpretation of discrepancies between observations and simulations to detect inconsistencies between snow cover and weather forcing. This method is in principle applicable for large-scale hydrological assessments thanks to the increasing global coverage of snow cover, precipitation and temperature data. As the only other type of observation available to calibrate models is often streamflow, the direct calibration of the snow component of a model using snow cover and weather forcing reduces the number of model processes and parameters to be calibrated with streamflow, and is expected to increase model robustness.

TI  - An easily implemented method to estimate impervious surface area on a large scale from MODIS time-series and improved DMSP-OLS nighttime light data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important for researchers and policy-makers to frequently update the amount and spatial distribution of impervious surface area (ISA) on earth, because the level of imperviousness not only indicates urbanization, but is also a key indicator of ecological conditions. In this study, we developed an easily implemented method for estimating the ISA percentage (ISA%) from vegetation index data obtained from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and nighttime light data obtained from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Line-scan System (DMSP-OLS). The proposed method consists of four major steps. First, a non-vegetation fraction map was generated from 16-day composited time-series MODIS normalized difference vegetation index data using the temporal mixture analysis method. Second, the enhanced-vegetation-index-adjusted nighttime light index (EANTLI) was used to overcome the saturation problem and blooming effects in the original DMSP-OLS data. Third, the relationship between ISA% and EANTLI was derived based on a statistical analysis of the non vegetation fraction image and the EANTLI image to obtain a preliminary ISA% map. Finally, the final ISA% map was obtained by selecting smaller values from the preliminary ISA% map and non vegetation fraction map for each pixel. The validation results showed that the developed method has promising accuracy for estimating the ISA% in our study area (mainly consisting of four Southeast Asian countries: Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), with a root mean square error value of 0.111, a systematic error value of 0.061, and a determination coefficient of 0.87. Another important finding is that there are two relationships between ISA% and improved nighttime light (i.e., EANTLI): the natural logarithmic function is suitable for ISA% values between 0% and 50%, and the quadratic polynomial function should be used for ISA% values larger than 50%. The developed method has high potential for application to the generation of global ISA% maps with frequent updates due to its easy implementation and the ready availability of input data.

TI  - Life stage specific predation of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (St(a)over-circlel) by generalist predators
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (St (a) over circlel) is an invasive pest of agriculture in the USA. Feeding damage from H. halys affects dozens of crops yet little is known about the community of predators which prey on H. halys in its invaded range. Ten taxa of predatory or omnivorous insects were evaluated for their capacity to consume eggs and nymphs of Halyomorpha halys in laboratory mesocosm experiments. Predators were collected from agricultural ecosystems in New Jersey, starved for 24-48 h, and then exposed to H. halys eggs, first instar, or second instar nymphs. Survivorship of control prey in predator-excluding containers within the arenas was compared to that of predator treatment groups to determine the effect of predator presence. Stage-specific differences in H. halys survivorship among life stages were observed for several predator taxa indicating stage-specific predation. Acrididae, Coccinella septempunctata (L.), Podisus maculiventris (Say) (nymphs and adults), and Tettigoniidae reduced the hatch rate of H. halys eggs. Hemipteran predators, including Nabis spp. and Reduviidae, reduced the survivorship of first instar nymphs. Similarly, Nabis spp. and P. maculiventris nymphs reduced the survivorship of second instar nymphs. Acrididae, Nabis spp., P. maculiventris nymphs, Reduviidae, and Tettigoniidae showed stage-specific tendencies in their consumption of H. halys. Morphological similarities between the immature stages of H. halys may facilitate predator suppression of these mobile stages. These results indicate that predation estimates that rely solely on sentinel egg masses may underestimate the impact of generalist predators on other H. halys life stages.

TI  - Spatial data analysis and application of evidential belief functions to shallow landslide susceptibility mapping at Mt. Umyeon, Seoul, Korea
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictive mapping of landslide occurrence at the regional scale was performed at Mt. Umyeon, in the southern part of Seoul, Korea, using an evidential belief function (EBF) model. To generate the landslide susceptibility map, approximately 90 % of 163 actual landslide locations were randomly selected as a training set, and about 10 % of them were used as a validation set. Spatial data sets relevant to landslide occurrence (topographic factors, hydrologic factors, forest factors, soil factors, and geologic factors) were analyzed in a geographic information system environment. In this study, landslide susceptibility was assessed on the basis of mass function assignment (belief, disbelief, uncertainty, and plausibility) and integration within a data-driven approach. The most representative of the resulting integrated susceptibility maps (the belief map) was validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. The verification result showed that the model had an accuracy of 74.3 % and a predictive accuracy of 88.1 %. The frequency ratio (FR) model was also used for comparison with the EBF model. Prediction and success rates of 72.1 and 85.9 % were achieved using the FR model. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing landslide location data. The EBF model was more accurate than the FR model for landslide prediction in the study area. The results of this study can be used to mitigate landslide-induced hazards and for land-use planning.

TI  - Outburst susceptibility assessment of moraine-dammed lakes in Western Himalaya using an analytic hierarchy process
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier retreat results in the formation and expansion, and sometimes outburst, of moraine-dammed lakes worldwide. Sudden outburst floods from such lakes have caused enormous damage to settlements and infrastructure located downstream. Such lakes located in the Himalayan region are highly prone to outburst floods due to climatic conditions and geotectonic settings. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat images from 2002-2014, digital elevation models (DEMs), geomorphic analysis and modelling were used to assess the changes in glacial lakes and the outburst susceptibility of moraine-dammed lakes in the Chandra-Bhaga basin of the north-western Indian Himalaya. An inventory of lakes was developed using satellite data, thematic maps and ground-based investigations for the Chandra-Bhaga basin. The total area of all glacial lakes (size >5000m(2)) increased by 47% from 2002 to 2014, with a pronounced increase of 57% for moraine-dammed lakes. Sixteen moraine-dammed lakes were identified and assessed for outburst susceptibility using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Forty-one reported glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) events from moraine-dammed lakes in Himalayan regions were analysed, culminating in the identification of 11 critical factors for assessing outburst susceptibility using the AHP, including those related to the lake area and change, surrounding terrain characteristics, dam geometry, regional seismicity and rainfall history. The past three GLOF events in the Himalayan region were used to validate the method and to classify moraine-dammed lakes as having very high, high, medium or low outburst susceptibility. Eight lakes classified as very high and high outburst susceptibility should be further investigated in detail. The proposed AHP-based approach is suitable for first-order identification of critical lakes for prioritising future detailed investigation and monitoring of moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the Himalayan region.

TI  - A Large-Scale Emulation System for Realistic Three-Dimensional (3-D) Forest Simulation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The realistic reconstruction and radiometric simulation of a large-scale three-dimensional (3-D) forest scene have potential applications in remote sensing. Although many 3-D radiative transfer models concerning forest canopy have been developed, they mainly focused on homogeneous or relatively small heterogeneous scenes, which are not compatible with the coarse-resolution remote sensing observations. Due to the huge complexity of forests and the inefficiency of collecting precise 3-D data of large areas, realistic simulation over large-scale forest area remains challenging, especially in regions of complex terrain. In this study, a large-scale emulation system for realistic 3-D forest Simulation is proposed. The 3-D forest scene is constructed from a representative single tree database (SDB) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. ALS data are used to extract tree height, crown diameter and position, which are linked to the individual trees in SDB. To simulate the radiometric properties of the reconstructed scene, a radiative transfer model based on a parallelized ray-tracing code was developed. This model has been validated with an abstract and an actual 3-D scene from the radiation transfer model intercomparison website and it showed comparable results with other models. Finally, a 1 km x 1 km scene with more than 100 000 realistic individual trees was reconstructed and a Landsat-like reflectance image was simulated, which kept the same spatial pattern as the actual Landsat 8 image.

TI  - Monitoring coal mine changes and their impact on landscape patterns in an alpine region: a case study of the Muli coal mine in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Muli coal mine is the largest open-cast coal mine in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it consists of two independent mining sites named Juhugeng and Jiangcang. It has received much attention due to the ecological problems caused by rapid expansion in recent years. The objective of this paper was to monitor the mining area and its surrounding land cover over the period 1976-2016 utilizing Landsat images, and the network structure of land cover changes was determined to visualize the relationships and pattern of the mining-induced land cover changes. In addition, the responses of the surrounding landscape pattern were analysed by constructing gradient transects. The results show that the mining area was increasing in size, especially after 2000 increased by 71.68 km(2)), and this caused shrinkage of the surrounding lands, including alpine meadow wet-land (53.44 km(2)), alpine meadow (6.28 km(2)) and water (6.24 km(2)). The network structure of the mining area revealed the changes in lands surrounding the mining area. The impact of mining development on landscape patterns was mainly distributed within a range of 16 km. Alpine meadow wetland was most affected in Juhugeng, while alpine meadow was most affected in Jiangcang. The results of this study provide a reference for the ecological assessment and restoration of the Muli coal mine land.

TI  - Annual dynamics of forest areas in South America during 2007-2010 at 50m spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South America has the largest tropical rainforests and the richest biodiversity in the world. It is challenging to map tropical forests and their spatio-temporal changes because forests are facing fragmentation from human activities (e.g., logging, deforestation), drought, and fire, as well as persistent clouds. Here we present a robust approach to map forests in South America during 2007-2010 and analyze the consistency and uncertainty among eight major forest maps in South America. Greenness-relevant MOD13Q1 NDVI and structure/biomassrelevant ALOS PALSAR time series data recorded 2007 through 2010 were coupled to identify and map forests at 50-m spatial resolution. Both area and spatial comparison were conducted to analyze the consistency and uncertainty of these eight forest maps. Annual 50-m PALSAR/MODIS forest maps were generated during 2007-2010 and the total forest area in South America was about 8.63 x 10(6) km(2) in 2010. Large differences in total forest area (8.2 x 10(6) km(2)-12.7 x 10(6) km(2)) existed among these forest products, especially in the forest edges, semi-humid tropical, and subtropical regions. Forest products generated under a similar forest definition had similar or even larger variation than those generated with contrasting forest definitions. We also find out that one needs to consider leaf area index as an adjusting factor and use much higher threshold values in the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) datasets to estimate forest cover areas. Analyses of PALSAR/MODIS forest maps in 2008/2009 showed a relatively small rate of loss (3.2 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)) in net forest cover, similar to that of FAO FRA (3.3 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)), but much higher annual rates of forest loss and gain. The rate of forest loss (0.195 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)) was higher than that of Global Forest Watch (0.081 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)). PALSAR/MODIS forest maps showed that more deforestation occurred in the unfragmented forest areas. Caution should be used when using the different forest maps to analyze forest loss and make policies regarding forest ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. The integration of PALSAR and MODIS images during 2007-2010 provides annual maps of forests in South America with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty.

TI  - Assessing the Three-North Shelter Forest Program in China by a novel framework for characterizing vegetation changes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNSFP) in China has been intensely invested for approximately 40 years. However, the efficacy of the TNSFP has been debatable due to the spatiotemporal complexity of vegetation changes. A novel framework was proposed for characterizing vegetation changes in the TNSFP region through Combining Trend and Temporal Similarity trajectory (COTTS). This framework could automatically and continuously address the fundamental questions on where, what, how and when vegetation changes have occurred. Vegetation trend was measured by a non-parametric method. The temporal similarity trajectory was tracked by the Jeffries-Matusita UM) distance of the inter-annual vegetation indices temporal profiles and modeled using the logistic function. The COTTS approach was applied to examine the afforestation efforts of the TNSFP using 500 m 8-day composites MODIS datasets from 2001 to 2015. Accuracy assessment from the 1109 reference sites reveals that the COTTS is capable of automatically determining vegetation dynamic patterns, with an overall accuracy of 90.08% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8688. The efficacy of the TNSFP was evaluated through comprehensive considerations of vegetation, soil and wetness. Around 45.78% areas obtained increasing vegetation trend, 2.96% areas achieved bare soil decline and 4.50% areas exhibited increasing surface wetness. There were 4.49% areas under vegetation degradation & desertification. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of efficacy of the TNSFP was revealed: great vegetation gain through the abrupt dynamic pattern in the semi-humid and humid regions, bare soil decline & potential efficacy in the semi-arid region and remarkable efficacy in functional region of Eastern Ordos.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of stage I NSCLC (≤3 cm) patients following segmentectomy are equivalent to lobectomy under analogous extent of lymph node removal: a PSM based analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Segmentectomy has the advantage of less complications, but might have less lymph node sampling and higher risk of recurrence. We aimed to compare treatment outcome between two surgical options, and explore the effect of regional lymph node removal on the prognostic difference.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (<= 3 cm in size) patients who underwent either segmentectomy, or lobectomy, collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, from 2003 to 2013. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS). We also collected data from Shandong Provincial Hospital as validation.Results: Ultimately 1,156 patients treated by segmentectomy and 17,748 patients treated by lobectomy from SEER database were included in the analysis. Overall, segmentectomy was inferior to lobectomy in terms of OS [hazard ratio (HR): 1.316 (1.186-1.461), P< 0.001] and LCSS [HR: 1.310 (1.142-1.504), P< 0.001]. When the removal of regional lymph nodes (LN) was taken into consideration, no significant difference was found in OS and LCSS, in any Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery layer (0, 1-3, more than 3, and biopsy/sentinel layer, all P> 0.05). After propensity score matching (PSM), there was no difference between segmentectomy and lobectomy in OS [HR: 1.081 (0.937-1.248), P= 0.286] and LCSS [HR: 1.039 (0.861-1.253), P= 0.692]. Only sex, age, histology, summary stage, differentiation, tumor size, and radiation still remained as independent prognostic factors for both OS and LCSS. For validation part, there was no significantly prognostic difference between lobectomy and sublobectomy group in overall (P= 0.132) and each regional LN removed layer (0, 1-3, more than 3 layers: all P> 0.05).Conclusions: Segmentectomy with proper lymph node resection or sampling could be a good alternative to lobectomy.

TI  - Feeding preference as a main determinant of microscale patchiness among terrestrial nematodes
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil biota are responsible for essential ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling and water retention. However, assessment of the condition of soil biota is hampered by an overwhelming level of diversity. With representatives in all trophic levels of the food web, nematode communities can be used as bioindicators. Accurate assessment of nematode assemblages requires insight into the distribution of specimens with distinct food preferences. With the availability of taxon-specific quantitative PCR assays, distribution patterns of multiple nematode groups can be investigated simultaneously. Here, microscale patchiness of 45 nematode taxa was studied on 12 sampling sites (each with four adjacent microplots) located on arable fields or semi-natural grasslands (system'), and on marine, river clay or sandy soils (soil type'). From each microplot, five composite samples were collected. Contrary to our expectations, an increase in the number of cores per composite sample did not result in more accurate measurements, and apparently the levels of microscale patchiness of the taxa are low compared to what has been reported for oligophagous plant-parasites. System and soil type did not affect microscale distribution. To investigate the level of patchiness in more detail, detection probability (DP) and variability of abundances were calculated. Common and widespread bacterivorous and fungivorous taxa had DP90%, confirming low level of microscale patchiness. With DPs of 40%-70%, predators and most omnivores showed degrees of local clustering. An overview of mean variabilities of abundances is presented that offers insight into how feeding preferences impact the microscale distribution both between and within trophic groups.

TI  - Low Expression of Estrogen Receptor-α and Progesterone Receptor in Human Breast Cancer Tissues Is Associated With High-Grade Human Cytomegalovirus Protein Expression
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms involved in initiation and progression of breast cancer (BC), the most common malignancy and second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, are largely unknown. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been detected in primary BC, sentinel lymph nodes, and brain metastases of BC patients. Here, we found HCMV DNA, RNA, and proteins in BC, and their prevalence was higher in advanced cancer. HCMV levels correlated inversely with estrogen (P = .02) and progesterone (P = .003) receptor expression. HER2 expression was also found to be decreased in HCMV-positive samples without reaching a level of statistical significance (P = .09). Our findings showing that high-grade expression of HCMV immediate-early protein correlated negatively with hormone receptor expression, suggest a role for HCMV in the development of hormone receptor-negative BC in subgroups of patients, possibly by hampering hormone receptor expression and forcing BC cells into a more aggressive and hormone-independent phenotype.Background: The underlying mechanisms for breast cancer (BC) are largely unknown. We investigated possible correlations between the expression levels of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins and established histopathological markers of BC, including expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, the progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively examined paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens of BC (n = 62), ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 19), and adjacent normal breast tissue (n = 42) for HCMV immediate-early protein (IE), HCMV late antigen, HCMV DNA and RNA, and investigated possible correlations between them and expression of ER-alpha, PgR, and HER2. Results: HCMV DNA and RNA were detected in all examined infiltrating BCs. High-grade positivity for HCMV-IE was detected in 77% of infiltrating BCs, 39% of ductal carcinomas in situ, and 7% of tumor-free breast tissue samples. HCMV expression correlated inversely with ER-alpha (P = .02) and PgR (P = .003) expression. HER2 expression was also reduced in HCMV-positive samples without reaching a level of statistical significance (P = .09). Conclusion: The negative correlation between high-grade expression HCMV-IE and hormone receptor expression suggests a role for HCMV in hormone receptor-negative BC tumors, possibly by forcing BC cells into a more aggressive phenotype.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of land use/land cover change and its prediction using CA-ANN model for southwestern coastal Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Change analysis of land use and land cover (LULC) is a technique to study the environmental degradation and to control the unplanned development. Analysis of the past changing trend of LULC along with modeling future LULC provides a combined opportunity to evaluate and guide the present and future land use policy. The southwest coastal region of Bangladesh, especially Assasuni Upazila of Satkhira District, is the most vulnerable to natural disasters and has faced notable changes in its LULC due to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic causes. The objectives of this study are to illustrate the temporal dynamics of LULC change in Assasuni Upazila over the last 27 years (i.e., between 1989 and 2015) and also to predict future land use change using CA-ANN (cellular automata and artificial neural network) model for the year 2028. Temporal dynamics of LULC change was analyzed, employing supervised classification of multi-temporal Landsat images. Then, prediction of future LULC was carried out by CA-ANN model using MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS. The analysis of LULC change revealed that the LULC of Assasuni had changed notably during 1989 to 2015. "Bare lands" decreased by 21% being occupied by other land uses, especially by "shrimp farms." Shrimp farm area increased by 25.9% during this period, indicating a major occupational transformation from agriculture to shrimp aquaculture in the study area during the period under study. Reduction in "settlement" area revealed the trend of migration from the Upazila. The predicted LULC for the year 2028 showed that reduction in bare land area would continue and 1595.97 ha bare land would transform into shrimp farm during 2015 to 2028. Also, the impacts of the changing LULC on the livelihood of local people and migration status of the Upazila were analyzed from the data collected through focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys. The analysis revealed that the changing LULC and the occupational shift from paddy cultivation to shrimp farming were related to each other. Around 31.3% of the total respondents stated that at least one of their family members had migrated. Climate-driven southwestern coastal people usually migrate from the vulnerable rural areas towards the nearest relatively safe city due to adverse effects of natural disasters. To control the unplanned development and reduce the internal migration in Assasuni and other coastal areas, a comprehensive land use management plan was suggested that would accommodate the diversified uses of coastal lands and eventually lessen the threats to the life and livelihood of the local people.

TI  - Developing a Random Forest Algorithm for MODIS Global Burned Area Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to develop a global burned area (BA) algorithm for MODIS BRDF-corrected images based on the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Two RF models were generated, including: (1) all MODIS reflective bands; and (2) only the red (R) and near infrared (NIR) bands. Active fire information, vegetation indices and auxiliary variables were taken into account as well. Both RF models were trained using a statistically designed sample of 130 reference sites, which took into account the global diversity of fire conditions. For each site, fire perimeters were obtained from multitemporal pairs of Landsat TM/ETM+ images acquired in 2008. Those fire perimeters were used to extract burned and unburned areas to train the RF models. Using the standard MD43A4 resolution (500 x 500 m), the training dataset included 48,365 burned pixels and 6,293,205 unburned pixels. Different combinations of number of trees and number of parameters were tested. The final RF models included 600 trees and 5 attributes. The RF full model (considering all bands) provided a balanced accuracy of 0.94, while the RF RNIR model had 0.93. As a first assessment of these RF models, they were used to classify daily MCD43A4 images in three test sites for three consecutive years (2006-2008). The selected sites included different ecosystems: Australia (Tropical), Boreal (Canada) and Temperate (California), and extended coverage (totaling more than 2,500,000 km(2)). Results from both RF models for those sites were compared with national fire perimeters, as well as with two existing BA MODIS products; the MCD45 and MCD64. Considering all three years and three sites, commission error for the RF Full model was 0.16, with an omission error of 0.23. For the RF RNIR model, these errors were 0.19 and 0.21, respectively. The existing MODIS BA products had lower commission errors, but higher omission errors (0.09 and 0.33 for the MCD45 and 0.10 and 0.29 for the MCD64) than those obtained with the RF models, and therefore they showed less balanced accuracies. The RF models developed here should be applicable to other biomes and years, as they were trained with a global set of reference BA sites.

TI  - Estimating Daily Global Evapotranspiration Using Penman-Monteith Equation and Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) is modeled globally for the period 2000-2013 based on the Penman-Monteith equation with radiation and vapor pressures derived using remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites. The ET for a given land area is based on four surface conditions: wet/dry and vegetated/non-vegetated. For each, the ET resistance terms are based on land cover, leaf area index (LAI) and literature values. The vegetated/non-vegetated fractions of the land surface are estimated using land cover, LAI, a simplified version of the Beer-Lambert law for describing light transition through vegetation and newly derived light extension coefficients for each MODIS land cover type. The wet/dry fractions of the land surface are nonlinear functions of LST derived humidity calibrated using in-situ ET measurements. Results are compared to in-situ measurements (average of the root mean squared errors and mean absolute errors for 39 sites are 0.81 mm day(-1) and 0.59 mm day(-1), respectively) and the MODIS ET product, MOD16, (mean bias during 2001-2013 is -0.2 mm day(-1)). Although the mean global difference between MOD16 and ET estimates is only 0.2 mm day(-1), local temperature derived vapor pressures are the likely contributor to differences, especially in energy and water limited regions. The intended application for the presented model is simulating ET based on long-term climate forecasts (e.g., using only minimum, maximum and mean daily or monthly temperatures).

TI  - Cramer-Rao Lower Bound Derivation and Performance Analysis for Space-Based SAR GMTI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper derives the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for a general multichannel spaceborne synthetic aperture radar system for ground moving-target indication and provides a theoretical analysis of across-track velocity estimation for RADARSAT-2 and a fictitious satellite. The signal model assumes a deterministic target signal in Gaussian clutter and noise. In estimation theory, the CRLB provides a lower bound on the achievable variance of any unbiased estimator. An estimator that achieves this bound is called efficient; however, there is no guarantee that an efficient estimator can be found. Nonetheless, the theoretical variance of the efficient estimator provides a good measure of the capability of the system and serves as a valuable system performance validation tool. Even if an efficient estimator cannot be found, for radar systems, the CRLB provides a necessary, but not sufficient design baseline for measurement parameters, such as the number of subapertures for transmit and receive, power levels, pulse-repetition frequency, and so on. CRLBs for a limited number of system configurations for RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X are presented by Cerutti-Maori et al. and Ender et al.; however, the complete analytical form of CRLB for a general system, which can be readily applied to an arbitrary antenna switching configuration, has not been previously derived.

TI  - Fusion of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Sparse and Low-Rank Component Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of diverse data captured over the same region makes it possible to develop multisensor data fusion techniques to further improve the discrimination ability of classifiers. In this paper, a new sparse and low-rank technique is proposed for the fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived features. The proposed fusion technique consists of two main steps. First, extinction profiles are used to extract spatial and elevation information from hyperspectral and LiDAR data, respectively. Then, the sparse and low-rank technique is utilized to estimate the low-rank fused features from the extracted ones that are eventually used to produce a final classification map. The proposed approach is evaluated over an urban data set captured over Houston, USA, and a rural one captured over Trento, Italy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed fusion technique outperforms the other techniques used in the experiments based on the classification accuracies obtained by random forest and support vector machine classifiers. Moreover, the proposed approach can effectively classify joint LiDAR and hyperspectral data in an ill-posed situation when only a limited number of training samples are available.

TI  - Fusion of Multi-Source Satellite Data and DEMs to Create a New Glacier Inventory for Novaya Zemlya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring glacier changes in remote Arctic regions are strongly facilitated by satellite data. This is especially true for the Russian Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR. The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2 km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62% by number) cover only 156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2) (3.3% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84%. In total, 41 glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8 km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35% (20%) of the area. For the smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of 3.4% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

TI  - Geospatial drivers of the groundwater δ<SUP>18</SUP>O isoscape in a temperate maritime climate (Republic of Ireland)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the concept of "isoscapes" has been used to describe spatiotemporal stable isotope distributions within natural environments including groundwater systems at multiple scales. This study presents an updated groundwater delta O-18 isoscape for the Republic of Ireland and describes the climatic and geological drivers influencing O-18 composition. In all, 142 geographically and geologically representative groundwater installations were sampled and analysed, in addition to 35 samples from six nested boreholes. Geospatially, Irish groundwater exhibits high delta O-18 values in southern and western coastal regions, becoming progressively depleted inland before reaching lowest measured values along the eastern coast, equating to a national groundwater delta O-18 profile range of approximately 3 parts per thousand. Groundwater delta O-18 composition is primarily driven by location with respect to orographically influenced rainfall deposition and annual precipitation volume, with a bias towards winter recharge. Results also demonstrate that local/regional (hydro)geological setting exerts a secondary influence on delta O-18 composition via infiltration and recharge mechanisms. "Flashy" groundwater systems (e.g. karst limestones) are more likely to exhibit seasonal groundwater delta O-18 patterns, whereas low productivity systems with high residence times (e.g. granites), tend to display a dampened composition to groundwater recharge and exhibit more temporally constant delta O-18 values. The derived delta O-18 isoscape enhances current understanding of what is a geologically distinct groundwater setting, whilst also potentially serving as a delta O-18 "sentinel" for continental Europe, with respect to both groundwater and precipitation, due to Ireland's geographic location.

AB  - A necessary activity for any SAR system is its calibration to establish the relation between radar measurements and geophysical parameters. During this process, all essential parameters of a SAR image are linked to their geophysical quantities. This includes the geolocation of the SAR image, its backscattering characteristics (in amplitude and in phase) and polarimetric information. The Microwaves and Radar Institute of the DLR has gained extensive experience in these calibration procedures during the last decades and has developed special methods and dedicated reference targets for spaceborne SAR system calibration. Through examples of calibration results obtained for different spaceborne SAR mission, the capabilities of the DLR SAR Calibration Center are presented.

TI  - Modeling and Simulation of Deciduous Forest Canopy and Its Anisotropic Reflectance Properties Using the Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) Tool
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of biophysical information from forest canopies using temporal analysis of multispectral and hyperspectral data can be significantly improved by understanding its anisotropic reflectance properties. However, limitations on the accessibility and data collection techniques in the field reduce the availability of high-resolution bidirectional reflectance measurements (BRDF) to a few datasets. These limitations can be mitigated in a virtual environment and this paper presents an approach to model the spectral BRDF of a forest canopy using the Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool. The three-dimensional geometries of the trees were modeled using forest inventory data and OnyxTree, while the spectral properties of the geometric elements were assigned based on the field collected spectra and PROSPECT inversion model. The DIRSIG tool was used as a virtual goniometer to measure the BRDF observations for varying sun-view geometries and a full hemispherical BRDF model was constructed by fitting the measurements to a semiempirical BRDF model. This paper discusses the methods involved in modeling the forest canopy scene, sensitivity of the radiative transfer, BRDF sampling and modeling strategies, model accuracy and its effect on real-world simulations. The model fit results indicate a root mean square error of less than 5% relative to the forests reflectance in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region. The simulated BRDF matched to within 2% of the Landsat-8 surface reflectance product in the red and NIR bands. The results can be used directly to evaluate BRDF modeling algorithms and the proposed method can be easily extended for other biomes.

TI  - A Fast Atmospheric Trace Gas Retrieval for Hyperspectral Instruments Approximating Multiple Scattering-Part 2: Application to XCO<sub>2</sub> Retrievals from OCO-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of the atmospheric dry-air column-average mole fraction of CO 2 (XCO2) based on hyperspectral measurements in appropriate near (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR)O-2 and CO2 absorption bands can help to answer important questions about the carbon cycle but the precision and accuracy requirements for XCO2 data products are demanding. Multiple scattering of light at aerosols and clouds can be a significant error source for XCO2 retrievals. Therefore, so called full physics retrieval algorithms were developed aiming to minimize scattering related errors by explicitly fitting scattering related properties such as cloud water/ice content, aerosol optical thickness, cloud height, etc. However, the computational costs for multiple scattering radiative transfer (RT) calculations can be immense. Processing all data of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) can require up to thousands of CPU cores and the next generation of CO2 monitoring satellites will produce at least an order of magnitude more data. For this reason, the Fast atmOspheric traCe gAs retrievaL FOCAL has been developed reducing the computational costs by orders of magnitude by approximating multiple scattering effects with an analytic solution of the RT problem of an isotropic scattering layer. Here we confront FOCAL for the first time with measured OCO-2 data and protocol the steps undertaken to transform the input data (most importantly, the OCO-2 adiances) into a validated XCO2 data product. This includes preprocessing, adaptation of the noise model, zero level offset correction, post-filtering, bias correction, comparison with the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) greenhouse gas flux inversion model, comparison with NASA's operational OCO-2 XCO2 product, and validation with ground based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) data. The systematic temporal and regional differences between FOCAL and the CAMS model have a standard deviation of 1.0 ppm. The standard deviation of the single sounding mismatches amounts to 1.1 ppm which agrees reasonably well with FOCAL's average reported uncertainty of 1.2 ppm. The large scale XCO2 patterns of FOCAL and NASA's operational OCO-2 product are similar and the most prominent difference is that FOCAL has about three times less soundings due to the inherently poor throughput (11%) of the MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) based cloud screening used by FOCAL's preprocessor. The standard deviation of the difference between both products is 1.1 ppm. The validation of one year (2015) of FOCAL XCO2 data with co-located ground based TCCON observations results in a standard deviations of the site biases of 0.67 ppm (0.78 ppm without bias correction) and an average scatter relative to TCCON of 1.34 ppm (1.60 ppm without bias correction).

Our aim is to compare an ultrasoundbased follow-up with a clinical follow-up.Patients and methods: Analysis of two prospectively collected cohorts of melanoma patients in stage IB-IIA from two tertiary referral centres in Barcelona (clinical-based follow-up [C-FU]) and Turin (ultrasound-based follow-up [US-FU]). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), disease-free interval (DFI), nodal metastasesfree survival (NMFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).Results: A total of 1149 patients in the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IB and IIA were included in this study, of which 554 subjects (48%) were enrolled for a C-FU, and 595 patients (52%) received a protocolised US-FU. The median age was 53.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41.5-65.2) with a median follow-up time of 4.14 years (IQR 1.2-7.6). During follow-up, 69 patients (12.5%) in C-FU and 72 patients (12.1%) in US-FU developed disease progression. Median time to relapse for the first metastatic site was 2.11 years (IQR 1.14-4.04) for skin metastases, 1.32 (IQR 0.57-3.29) for lymph node metastases and 2.84 (IQR 1.32-4.60) for distant metastases. The pattern of progression and the total proportion of metastases were not significantly different (P = .44) in the two centres. No difference in DFI, DMFS, NMFS and MSS was found between the two cohorts.Conclusion: Ultrasound-based follow-up does not increase the survival of melanoma patients in stage IB-IIA.

TI  - Spotted Wing Drosophila Prefer Low Hanging Fruit: Insights into Foraging Behavior and Management Strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, is an invasive insect that attacks ripe, small fruit such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. Little is known about its foraging ecology and current trapping methods and monitoring systems are ineffective at commercial scales. In semi-field studies, we evaluated adult alightment and ovipositional preference within and among raspberry plants using sentinel Tangletrap-coated and clean raspberry fruit, respectively, positioned within the exterior and interior plant canopy at four different heights (60, 85, 110 and 135 cm from the base) and conducted in field cages using sexually mature adults. Alightment of adults on Tangle-trap-coated fruit indicated a preference for fruit positioned at lower heights and/or interior locations based on significantly greater numbers being captured on sentinel sticky-coated berries at the two lowest heights. Oviposition in clean raspberry fruit also yielded a similar pattern. In mark-release-recapture studies conducted in the field, spotted wing drosophila prefer sentinel sticky fruit positioned on exterior rows as they alighted on these berries in significantly greater numbers than fruit at in the central portion of the plot. Likewise, in field trials with wild fly populations, infestations were significantly greater in edge rows compared with interior rows. Collectively, our results suggest that monitoring and behaviorally based management strategies may be more effective if they target adults foraging in the lower canopy of small fruit plants located on the crop perimeter.

TI  - Maize Cropping Systems Mapping Using RapidEye Observations in Agro-Ecological Landscapes in Kenya
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping systems information on explicit scales is an important but rarely available variable in many crops modeling routines and of utmost importance for understanding pests and disease propagation mechanisms in agro-ecological landscapes. In this study, high spatial and temporal resolution RapidEye bio-temporal data were utilized within a novel 2-step hierarchical random forest (RF) classification approach to map areas of mono- and mixed maize cropping systems. A small-scale maize farming site in Machakos County, Kenya was used as a study site. Within the study site, field data was collected during the satellite acquisition period on general land use/land cover (LULC) and the two cropping systems. Firstly, non-cropland areas were masked out from other land use/land cover using the LULC mapping result. Subsequently an optimized RF model was applied to the cropland layer to map the two cropping systems (2nd classification step). An overall accuracy of 93% was attained for the LULC classification, while the class accuracies (PA: producer's accuracy and UA: user's accuracy) for the two cropping systems were consistently above 85%. We concluded that explicit mapping of different cropping systems is feasible in complex and highly fragmented agro-ecological landscapes if high resolution and multi-temporal satellite data such as 5 m RapidEye data is employed. Further research is needed on the feasibility of using freely available 10-20 m Sentinel-2 data for wide-area assessment of cropping systems as an important variable in numerous crop productivity models.

TI  - Pelagic bioregionalisation using open-access data for better planning of marine protected area networks
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

TI  - Mapping of mangrove extent and zonation using high and low tide composites of Landsat data
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mangrove health and distribution requires reliable methods that can be undertaken rapidly and at a resolution that optimises costs and accuracy. The Landsat record has been used for this purpose, but its application has been limited by the capacity to provide accurate results that distinguish mangrove from adjoining communities. The Australian Geoscience Data Cube provides a framework for exploring the Landsat record from 1987 onwards, and as pre-processing has already been undertaken there are efficiencies gained using this resource. Using the Data Cube, we exploited the differential spectral signature of mangrove under high tide and low tide conditions at Darwin Harbour, Australia, a relatively stable mangrove ecosystem, using image composites that combined imagery corresponding to the highest 10% and lowest 10% of tides. By applying the automated RandomForest classification technique, we demonstrate the capacity to accurately determine the extent of mangrove zones. Classification identified five mangrove zones: (1) seaward margin dominated by Sonneratia alba, (2) Rhizophora zone dominated by Rhizophora stylosa, (3) tidal flat dominated by Ceriops tagal, (4) landward salt flat and (5) marginal hinterland. Image composites that included high and low tide images achieved the best outcomes with kappa co-efficient of 0.81 and overall accuracy of 82%.

TI  - Effectiveness of influenza vaccines in preventing severe influenza illness among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of test-negative design case-control studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Summary evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalized influenza is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting IVE against laboratory-confirmed hospitalized influenza among adults.Methods: We searched Pubmed (January 2009 to November 2016) for studies that used test-negative design (TND) to enrol patients hospitalized with influenza-associated conditions. Two independent authors selected relevant articles. We calculated pooled IVE against any and (sub) type specific influenza among all adults, and stratified by age group (18-64 and 65 years and above) using random-effects models.Results: We identified 3411 publications and 30 met our inclusion criteria. Between 2010-11 and 2014-15, the pooled seasonal IVE was 41% (95% CI: 34; 48) for any influenza (51% (95% CI: 44; 58) among people aged 18-64y and 37% (95% CI: 30; 44) among >= 65 years). IVE was 48% (95% CI: 37; 59), 37% (95% CI: 24; 50) and 38% (95% CI: 23; 53) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, A(H3N2) and B, respectively. Among persons aged >= 65 year, IVE against A(H3N2) was 43% (95% CI: 33; 53) in seasons when circulating and vaccine strains were antigenically similar and 14% (95% CI:-3; 30) when A(H3N2) variant viruses predominated.Conclusions: Influenza vaccines provided moderate protection against influenza-associated hospitalizations among adults. They seemed to provide low protection among elderly in seasons where vaccine and circulating A(H3N2) strains were antigenically variant. (C) 2017 The British Infection Association.

TI  - Beautiful Words: Enriching and Indigenizing Kwak'wala Revitalization through Understandings of Linguistic Structure
T2  - CANADIAN MODERN LANGUAGE REVIEW-REVUE CANADIENNE DES LANGUES VIVANTES
M3  - Article
AB  - British Columbia (BC), Canada, is home to 34 Indigenous languages, all of them classified as endangered. Considerable work is underway by First Nation communities to revitalize their languages. Linguists classify many of the languages of BC as polysynthetic, meaning that words are composed of many morphemes, or units of meaning. While strong fluent speakers and linguists who work with these languages have knowledge and appreciation of these units of meaning, those understandings are often not reflected in the approaches for teaching and learning BC languages. Drawing on examples from Kwak'wala, a language of coastal BC, we discuss how an Indigenized approach to language revitalization can recognize and respect the highly regarded ancestral origins and messages about identity that are reflected within the language. In developing understanding of the morphemes of the language, learners can grasp literal meanings and metaphors embedded in Kwak'wala words, leading to deeper understandings of Kwakwaka'wakw worldview and appreciation of the beauty of the language. In addition, learners can be supported to use morphemes as building blocks in their language learning. Rather than memorizing words and phrases, learners can be encouraged to listen for and use the morphemes they know to understand and produce new words and phrases.

TI  - The impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on land surface temperature in southwestern Romania
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is one of the most important parameters related to global warming. It depends mainly on soil type, discontinuous vegetation cover, or lack of precipitation. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between high LST, synoptic conditions and air masses trajectories, vegetation cover, and soil type in one of the driest region in Romania. In order to calculate the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index, five satellite images of LANDSAT missions 5 and 7, covering a period of 26 years (1986-2011), were selected, all of them collected in the month of June. The areas with low vegetation density were derived from normalized difference vegetation index, while soil types have been extracted from Corine Land Cover database. HYSPLIT application was employed to identify the air masses origin based on their backward trajectories for each of the five study cases. Pearson, logarithmic, and quadratic correlations were used to detect the relationships between land surface temperature and observed ground temperatures, as well as between land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index. The most important findings are: strong correlation between land surface temperature derived from satellite images and maximum ground temperature recorded in a weather station located in the area, as well as between areas with land surface temperature equal to or higher than 40.0 A degrees C and those with lack of vegetation; the sandy soils are the most prone to high land surface temperature and lack of vegetation, followed by the chernozems and brown soils; extremely severe drought events may occur in the region.

TI  - Estimating daily minimum, maximum, and mean near surface air temperature using hybrid satellite models across Israel
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological stations measure air temperature (Ta) accurately with high temporal resolution, but usually suffer from limited spatial resolution due to their sparse distribution across rural, undeveloped or less populated areas. Remote sensing satellite-based measurements provide daily surface temperature (Ts) data in high spatial and temporal resolution and can improve the estimation of daily Ta. In this study we developed spatiotemporally resolved models which allow us to predict three daily parameters: Ta Max (day time), 24 h mean, and Ta Min (night time) on a fine 1 km grid across the state of Israel. We used and compared both the Aqua and Terra MODIS satellites. We used linear mixed effect models, IDW (inverse distance weighted) interpolations and thin plate splines (using a smooth nonparametric function of longitude and latitude) to first calibrate between Ts and Ta in those locations where we have available data for both and used that calibration to fill in neighboring cells without surface monitors or missing Ts. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross validation (CV) was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with and without available Ts observations for both Aqua and Terra (CV Aqua R-2 results for min 0.966, mean 0.986, and max 0.967; CV Terra R-2 results for min 0.965, mean 0.987, and max 0.968). Our research shows that daily min, mean and max Ta can be reliably predicted using daily MODIS Ts data even across Israel, with high accuracy even for days without Ta or Ts data. These predictions can be used as three separate Ta exposures in epidemiology studies for better diurnal exposure assessment.

TI  - From psychic to somatic: notes on the reframing of the contemporary self
T2  - HISTORIA CIENCIAS SAUDE-MANGUINHOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This exploration of the shift from a psychological understanding of the self to a somatic/cerebral one centers on the duality between the Enlightened, rationalist worldview and the so-called Romantic worldview, characteristic of modern Western culture. The discussion seeks to show how physicalism draws support from a reframing of what L.F. Duarte has called a "relentless tension" between these two worldviews. It finds basis in examples where biotechnological interventions are linked to heavy affective, emotional investment in bodily experiences and puts forward the notion of a contemporary "vitalism," where the category "life" is understood as something that, while anchored in biological materialism, moves beyond it, meshing with fluid categories like happiness and well-being or with feelings and emotions that resist objective definition.

TI  - Predictive Factors for Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Nomogram for Predicting Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Samsung Medical Center (SMC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) nomogram was developed to predict the likelihood of additional positive non-sentinel lymph nodes. The SMC NAC nomogram could provide information to surgeons regarding whether to decide additional axillary lymph node dissection when the permanent biopsy revealed positive even though intraoperative sentinel lymph node was negative.Introduction: Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. With increasing numbers of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), issues concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC have emerged. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathologic features and developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases in patients with positive SLNs after NAC. A retrospective medical record review was performed of 140 patients who had had clinically positive ALNs at presentation, had a positive SLN after NAC on subsequent SLNB, and undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from 2008 to 2014. Results: On multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, pathologic T stage, lymphovascular invasion, SLN metastasis size, and number of positive SLN metastases were independent predictors for NSLN metastases (P < .05). The NAC nomogram was based on these 4 variables. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.791 for the NAC nomogram. In the internal validation of performance, the AUCs for the training and test sets were 0.801 and 0.760, respectively. The nomogram was validated in an external patient cohort, with an AUC of 0.705. Conclusion: The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram was developed to predict the likelihood of additional positive NSLNs. The Samsung Medical Center NAC nomogram could provide information to surgeons regarding whether to perform additional ALND when the permanent biopsy revealed positive findings, although the intraoperative SLNB findings were negative.

TI  - Summer and winter habitat suitability of Marco Polo argali in southeastern Tajikistan: A modeling approach.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We modeled summer and winter habitat suitability of Marco Polo argali in the Pamir Mountains in southeastern Tajikistan using these statistical algorithms: Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Tree, Maxent, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. Using sheep occurrence data collected from 2009 to 2015 and a set of selected habitat predictors, we produced summer and winter habitat suitability maps and determined the important habitat suitability predictors for both seasons. Our results demonstrated that argali selected proximity to riparian areas and greenness as the two most relevant variables for summer, and the degree of slope (gentler slopes between 0° to 20°) and Landsat temperature band for winter. The terrain roughness was also among the most important variables in summer and winter models. Aspect was only significant for winter habitat, with argali preferring south-facing mountain slopes. We evaluated various measures of model performance such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). Comparing the five algorithms, the AUC scored highest for Boosted Regression Tree in summer (AUC = 0.94) and winter model runs (AUC = 0.94). In contrast, Random Forest underperformed in both model runs.

T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS

CP  - International Conference on Information in Business and Technology Management (12BM)
CL  - MALAYSIA
AB  - For decades, the study and the understanding of public opinion has served as an important component in politics and policymaking especially in democratic societies. For a government to be truly democratic and responsive to the issues and problems that concerns the people, it has to understand the "pulse of the people." The rise of the Internet and social media and the availability of big data has created an exciting opportunity in exploring new knowledge and a new form of big data-driven public opinion. With the recent spate of unpredictability in global politics and surprising opinion poll survey results, big data could well serve as an important tool in complementing or even replacing traditional public opinion surveys as well as to better understand conversations and discussions in a more scientific manner in order to anticipating future events or crisis. This paper examines the political opinions and the extent of the representativeness of big data in the context of political opinions in social media. It argues that big data is capable of not merely to measure opinions and perceptions but more significantly the power to shape the society's worldview, perception of reality as well as forecasting future political trends.

TI  - Acid rock drainage in Nevado Pastoruri glacier area (Huascaran National Park, PerA): hydrochemical and mineralogical characterization and associated environmental implications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of acid rock drainage (ARD) was observed in an area of Nevado Pastoruri as a result of the oxidative dissolution of pyrite-rich lutites and sandstones. These ARDs are generated as abundant pyrite becomes exposed to atmospheric conditions as a result of glacier retreat. The proglacial zone contains lagoons, springs, streams and wetlands, scant vegetation, and intense fluvioglacial erosion. This work reports a comprehensive identification and the results of sampling of the lagoons and springs belonging to the microbasin, which is the headwaters of the Pachacoto River, as well as mapping results based on the hydrochemical data obtained in our study. The physical properties and water chemistry of 12 springs and 22 lagoons from the proglacial zone are also presented. Water springs are far from being chemically uniform, with pH and EC values ranging between 2.55-6.42 and 23-1110 mu S/cm respectively, which suggests a strong geologic control on water chemistry. Fe-SO4 (-2) concentrations confirm the intense process of pyrite oxidative dissolution. Many of the lagoons are affected by ARD, with low pH (similar to 3), and high EC (256-1092 mu S/cm) values when compared with unaffected lagoons (EC between 7 and 59 mu S/cm), indicating a high degree of mineralization. The affected lagoons show higher concentrations of SO4 (2-) and SiO2, and elements as Fe, Al, Mg, Mn, Zn, Co, and Ni, which are related to the alteration of pyrite and the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals. Schwertmannite-goethite appears to be the most important mineral phases controlling the Fe solubility at a pH of 2-3.5. Moreover, they act as a sorbent of trace elements (As, Sb, V, Pb, Zn, Cr), which is an efficient mechanism of natural attenuation. Despite of this, the water flowing out from the basin is acid (pH 3.1) and contains significant concentrations of Fe (0.98 mg/L) and Al (3.76 mg/L) that confer mineral acidity to water. The Pachacoto River located 5.5 km downstream from this point showed a strong natural attenuation, with a pH of 6.9 and low concentration of metals. This mitigating process is possible due to (i) the formation of precipitates that retain toxic elements and (ii) the mixing with natural waters that promote dilution, which favor the increase of pH until circumneutral conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an intricate event with large amount of intrinsic spectral, spatial and temporal inconsistency and it is naturally characterized by strapping assimilation in the red wavelengths and towering reflectance in the near infra-red (NIR) wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The image descriptions generating from various vegetation index like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) etc., from multispectral imagery be able to provide exclusive vegetation information about an area. Soil environment circumstances are considerable influence on partial canopy spectra and vegetation index. Consequently, it is significant to monitor the vegetation vitality changes with reverence to the soil background circumstances. The present study an appropriate remote sensing based algorithm, i.e. soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was selected. The investigation of vegetation vigor variations was done for dissimilar time sequence in the part of Andhra Pradesh State, India. The MODIS vegetation index images of 250m resolution are used. NDVI and NDWI images are derivative for red and black soil types and SAVI model was fashioned and executed in ERDAS IMAGINE platform. In SAVI equation, the soil accustomed factor 'L' was personalized with dissimilar values and multivariate SAVI images are derived for both red and black soil regions. In the an assortment of red soil regions, the SAVI with different 'L' values of 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and black soil region, the vegetation envelop is medium and SAVI with 'L' values of 0.3 and 0.4 fashioned fair result on variations of soil and vegetation reflectance over the crop period. The present study was done with the two types of soil regions and with accessible datasets. The psychoanalysis fraction of the study can be extended with multiple data sets and dissimilar seasons.

TI  - Fusing Microwave and Optical Satellite Observations to Simultaneously Retrieve Surface Soil Moisture, Vegetation Water Content, and Surface Soil Roughness
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty in surface soil roughness strongly degrades the performance of surface soil moisture (SSM) and vegetation water content (VWC) retrieval from passive microwave observations. This paper proposes an algorithm to objectively determine the surface soil roughness parameter of the radiative transfer model by fusing microwave and optical satellite observations. It is then demonstrated in a semiarid in situ observation site. The roughness correction of this new algorithm positively impacted the performance of SSM (root-mean-square error reduced from 0.088 to 0.070) and VWC retrieval from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Since this surface soil roughness correction may be transferrable to other microwave satellite retrieval algorithms such as those for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites, this new algorithm can contribute to many microwave earth surface observation satellite missions.

TI  - Global evaluation of a semiempirical model for yield anomalies and application to within-season yield forecasting
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the influence of weather on yield variability is decisive for agricultural management under current and future climate anomalies. We extended an existing semiempirical modeling scheme that allows for such quantification. Yield anomalies, measured as interannual differences, were modeled for maize, soybeans, and wheat in the United States and 32 other main producer countries. We used two yield data sets, one derived from reported yields and the other from a global yield data set deduced from remote sensing. We assessed the capacity of the model to forecast yields within the growing season. In the United States, our model can explain at least two-thirds (63%-81%) of observed yield anomalies. Its out-of-sample performance (34%-55%) suggests a robust yield projection capacity when applied to unknown weather. Out-of-sample performance is lower when using remote sensing-derived yield data. The share of weather-driven yield fluctuation varies spatially, and estimated coefficients agree with expectations. Globally, the explained variance in yield anomalies based on the remote sensing data set is similar to the United States (71%-84%). But the out-of-sample performance is lower (15%-42%). The performance discrepancy is likely due to shortcomings of the remote sensing yield data as it diminishes when using reported yield anomalies instead. Our model allows for robust forecasting of yields up to 2months before harvest for several main producer countries. An additional experiment suggests moderate yield losses under mean warming, assuming no major changes in temperature extremes. We conclude that our model can detect weather influences on yield anomalies and project yields with unknown weather. It requires only monthly input data and has a low computational demand. Its within-season yield forecasting capacity provides a basis for practical applications like local adaptation planning. Our study underlines high-quality yield monitoring and statistics as critical prerequisites to guide adaptation under climate change.

TI  - Interactive effects of temperature and habitat complexity on freshwater communities
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming can lead to increased growth of plants or algae at the base of the food web, which may increase the overall complexity of habitat available for other organisms. Temperature and habitat complexity have both been shown to alter the structure and functioning of communities, but they may also have interactive effects, for example, if the shade provided by additional habitat negates the positive effect of temperature on understory plant or algal growth. This study explored the interactive effects of these two major environmental factors in a manipulative field experiment, by assessing changes in ecosystem functioning (primary production and decomposition) and community structure in the presence and absence of artificial plants along a natural stream temperature gradient of 5-18 degrees C. There was no effect of temperature or habitat complexity on benthic primary production, but epiphytic production increased with temperature in the more complex habitat. Cellulose decomposition rate increased with temperature, but was unaffected by habitat complexity. Macroinvertebrate communities were less similar to each other as temperature increased, while habitat complexity only altered community composition in the coldest streams. There was also an overall increase in macroinvertebrate abundance, body mass, and biomass in the warmest streams, driven by increasing dominance of snails and blackfly larvae. Presence of habitat complexity, however, dampened the strength of this temperature effect on the abundance of macroinvertebrates in the benthos. The interactive effects that were observed suggest that habitat complexity can modify the effects of temperature on important ecosystem functions and community structure, which may alter energy flow through the food web. Given that warming is likely to increase habitat complexity, particularly at higher latitudes, more studies should investigate these two major environmental factors in combination to improve our ability to predict the impacts of future global change.

TI  - Generation of Radiometric, Phenological Normalized Image Based on Random Forest Regression for Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts have been made to detect both naturally occurring and anthropogenic changes to the Earth's surface by using satellite remote sensing imagery. There is a need to maintain the homogeneity of radiometric and phenological conditions to ensure accuracy in change detection, but images to assess long-term changes in time-series data that satisfy such conditions are difficult to obtain. For this reason, image normalization is essential. In particular, the normalizing compositive conditions require nonlinear modeling, and random forest (RF) techniques can be utilized for this normalization. This study employed Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper satellite images with temporal, radiometric and phenological differences, and obtained Radiometric Control Set Samples by selecting no-change pixels between the subject image and reference image using scattergrams. In the obtained no-change regions, RF regression was modeled, and normalized images were obtained. Next, normalization performance was evaluated by comparing the results against the following conventional linear regression methods: mean-standard deviation regression, simple regression, and no-change regression. The normalization performance of RF regression was much higher. In addition, for an additional usefulness evaluation in normalization, the normalization performance was compared with other nonlinear ensemble regressions, i.e. Adaptive Boosting regression and Stochastic Gradient Boosting regression, which confirmed that the normalization performance of RF regression was significantly higher. In other words, it was found to be highly useful for normalization when compared to other nonlinear ensemble regressions. Finally, as a result of performing change detection, normalized subject images generated by RF regression showed the highest accuracy, which indicated that the proposed method (where the image was normalized using RF regression) may be useful in change detection between multi-temporal image datasets.

TI  - A patch-based convolutional neural network for remote sensing image classification
T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of accurate land cover information over large areas is essential to the global environment sustainability; digital classification using medium-resolution remote sensing data would provide an effective method to generate the required land cover information. However, low accuracy of existing perpixel based classification methods for medium-resolution data is a fundamental limiting factor. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deep layers have achieved unprecedented improvements in object recognition applications that rely on fine image structures, they cannot be applied directly to medium-resolution data due to lack of such fine structures. In this paper, considering the spatial relation of a pixel to its neighborhood, we propose a new deep patch-based CNN system tailored for medium-resolution remote sensing data. The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of medium-resolution data; in particular, the system computes patch-based samples from multidimensional top of atmosphere reflectance data. With a test site from the Florida Everglades area (with a size of 771 square kilometers), the proposed new system has outperformed pixel-based neural network, pixel-based CNN and patch-based neural network by 24.36%, 24.23% and 11.52%, respectively, in overall classification accuracy. By combining the proposed deep CNN and the huge collection of medium-resolution remote sensing data, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.

AB  - The downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) plays a critical role in underwater light field. It determines the euphotic depth, and affects the distribution characteristics of phytoplankton and primary productivity. Based on in situ data collected from 4 cruise surveys in Lake Taihu during 2008-2013, both the variations and driving factors of K-d were analyzed, and an algorithm to estimate downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm for a variety of satellites' data was developed and validated. The results show that: (1) suspended particular inorganic matter is the decisive factor of K-d in Lake Taihu;(2) the algorithm of red. green band ratio is the most suitable for estimating K-d(490) in Lake Taihu (N = 72, R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.89 m(-1), MAPE = 21.58%);(3) with the simulated remote sensing reflectance of the main sensor bands such as MODIS/EOS, OLCI/Sentinel. 3, GOCI/COMS and MSI/Sentinel. 2, the red. green ratio algorithm to estimate K-d(490) was established for a variety of remote sensing sensors(N = 72, R-2 > 0.7, RMSE< 0.9 m(-1), MAPE<22.0%), and the validation was good as well(N = 37, R-2>0.7, RMSE< 0.9 m(-1), MAPE< 22.0%).

The validation results show that MODIS AODs from 10/3 km DT algorithm are comparable with those of the sun photometer, although there are slight overestimations. However, the DB algorithm substantially underestimates MODIS AODs when comparing with those of the sun photometer. Error analyses imply that the bias of surface reflectance estimation is the main error source for both algorithms. The cloud screening scheme of the DT algorithm is more effective than the DB algorithm. The cloud vicinity effect should be considered in the quality control processes for both of the algorithms. A sensitivity test suggests that in complex terrain area, like Chongqing, the collocation method in the validation of satellite products should be carefully selected according to local circumstances. When comparing the monthly mean AODs of MODIS products with sun photometer observations, it shows that the Terra MODIS AOD products are valid to represent the mean statuses in summer and autumn, but the monthly mean of Aqua MODIS AODs are limited in Chongqing.

TI  - Impervious Surface Change Mapping with an Uncertainty-Based Spatial-Temporal Consistency Model: A Case Study in Wuhan City Using Landsat Time-Series Datasets from 1987 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on the spatial-temporal change of impervious surfaces is important for quantifying the effects of rapid urbanization. Free access of the Landsat archive provides new opportunities for impervious surface mapping with fine spatial and temporal resolution. To improve the classification accuracy, a temporal consistency (TC) model may be applied on the original classification results of Landsat time-series datasets. However, existing TC models only use class labels, and ignore the uncertainty of classification during the process. In this study, an uncertainty-based spatial-temporal consistency (USTC) model was proposed to improve the accuracy of the long time series of impervious surface classifications. In contrast to existing TC methods, the proposed USTC model integrates classification uncertainty with the spatial-temporal context information to better describe the spatial-temporal consistency for the long time-series datasets. The proposed USTC model was used to obtain an annual map of impervious surfaces in Wuhan city with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from 1987 to 2016. The impervious surfaces mapped by the proposed USTC model were compared with those produced by the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and the TC model. The accuracy comparison of these results indicated that the proposed USTC model had the best performance in terms of classification accuracy. The increase of overall accuracy was about 4.23% compared with the SVM classifier, and about 1.79% compared with the TC model, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed USTC model in mapping impervious surfaces from long-term Landsat sensor imagery.

T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Due to the particularity of ginseng cultivation, the soil fertility of cultivated ginseng is seriously depleted, so that the cultivated ginseng land can not be reused in the short term, and the land area available for cultivating ginseng becomes less and less with the growth of ginseng cultivation time. Therefore, in order to effectively manage ginseng cultivation, and achieve the sustainable use of ginseng land, it is necessary to obtain accurate information on the distribution of ginseng planting space. In this study, the object-oriented classification method based on rule set was used to extract ginseng planting area based on the ZY-3 satellite data in Fusong county, Jilin province. Firstly, multi-scale segmentation of ZY-3 remote sensing image in the study area was made, and the optimal segmentation scale was determined on the basis of multi-scale segmentation results. Secondly, a spectral curve according to the different feature type samples was generated. The similarities and differences between ginseng plot and other types of surface features were analyzed, and a rule set based on the results of spectral analysis was established to achieve the final extraction. The results show that the object-oriented classification method based on rule set can effectively extract the ginseng planting plots in the study area, and solve the problem that the extraction result is broken compared with the traditional pixel-based classification method.

T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The herbs used as the material for traditional Chinese medicine are always planted in the mountainous area where the natural environment is suitable. As the mountain terrain is complex and the distribution of planting plots is scattered, the traditional survey method is difficult to obtain accurate planting area. It is of great significance to provide decision support for the conservation and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine resources by studying the method of extraction of Chinese herbal medicine planting area based on remote sensing and realizing the dynamic monitoring and reserve estimation of Chinese herbal medicines. In this paper, taking the Peucedanum praeruptorum planted area in Ningguo prefecture of Anhui province as an example, the multispectral remote sensing images that include Landsat-8 with a 30 m resolution and China-made GF-1 with a 16 m resolution were used as data source. Since the spectral characteristics of P. praeruptorum in the two periods are different from those of other crops, the changes of the images at two stages in the same year could be used to extract the P. praeruptorum planted area intercropped in cultivated land. Then the texture and spectral characteristics of young pecan trees were used to extract the P. praeruptorum planted area intercropped in woodland. The results showed that the extracted area of planted P. praeruptorum with the original imagery of 30 m spatial resolution and 16 m spatial resolution was 25 635.43,24 585.43 mu, respectively.

TI  - Minimal Clinical Impact of Intraoperative Examination of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Patients With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ An Opportunity for Improved Resource Utilization
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: There is little information regarding sentinel lymph node (SLN) frozen-section examination in patients with a history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We evaluated the usage, clinical impact, and pathology resources used for SLN cryosectioning in mastectomy cases with a DCIS history.Methods: Mastectomies with SLNs submitted from 2012 to 2013 at a tertiary care center were analyzed. Medicare reimbursement was used to estimate pathology health care expenditures of intraoperative frozen sections.Results: There was no difference in the rate of SLN frozen-section examination or parts submitted, total blocks frozen, total blocks submitted, or total SLNs identified per case between the DCIS (n = 139) and invasive (n = 369) groups. Nine patients with DCIS had SLN metastases (three macrometastases, two micrometastases, and four isolated tumor cells), all of which were examined by frozen section. Only the macrometastases were identified by cryosectioning, which led to two synchronous axillary lymph node dissections that did not yield any additional positive nodes. A total of $19,313 was spent for pathology per DCIS patient with surgical management affected, whereas only $1,019 was spent per invasive carcinoma patient affected.Conclusions: Decreasing SLN frozen-section use in patients with a history of DCIS represents an opportunity for pathology cost containment.

TI  - Regional severe particle pollution and its association with synoptic weather patterns in the Yangtze River Delta region, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional air pollution is significantly associated with dominant weather systems. In this study, the relationship between the particle pollution over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and weather patterns is investigated. First, the pollution characteristics of particles in the YRD are studied using in situ monitoring data (PM2.5 and PM10) in 16 cities and Terra/MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) products collected from December 2013 to November 2014. The results show that the regional mean value of AOD is high in the YRD, with an annual mean value of 0.71 +/- 0.57. The annual mean particle concentrations in the cities of Jiangsu Province all exceed the national air quality standard. The pollution level is higher in inland areas, and the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are 79 and 130 mu g m(-3), respectively, in Nanjing. The PM2.5 V PM10 ratios are typically high, thus indicating that PM2.5 is the overwhelmingly dominant particle pollutant in the YRD. The wintertime peak of particle concentrations is tightly linked to the increased emissions during the heating season as well as adverse meteorological conditions. Second, based on NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data, synoptic weather classification is conducted and five typical synoptic patterns are objectively identified. Finally, the synthetic analysis of meteorological fields and backward trajectories are applied to further clarify how these patterns impact particle concentrations. It is demonstrated that air pollution is more or less influenced by high-pressure systems. The relative position of the YRD to the anti-cyclonic circulation exerts significant effects on the air quality of the YRD. The YRD is largely influenced by polluted air masses from the northern and the southern inland areas when it is located at the rear of the East Asian major trough. The significant downward motion of air masses results in stable weather conditions, thereby hindering the diffusion of air pollutants. Thus, this pattern is quite favorable for the accumulation of pollutants in the YRD, resulting in higher regional mean PM10 (116.5 +/- 66.9 mu g m(-3)), PM2.5 (75.9 +/- 49.9 mu g m(-3)), and AOD (0.74) values. Moreover, this pattern is also responsible for the occurrence of most large-scale regional PM2.5 (70.4 %) and PM10 (78.3 %) pollution episodes. High wind speed and clean marine air masses may also play important roles in the mitigation of pollution in the YRD. Especially when the clean marine air masses account for a large proportion of all trajectories (i.e., when the YRD is affected by the cyclonic system or oceanic circulation), the air in the YRD has a lesser chance of being polluted. The observed correlation between weather patterns and particle pollution can provide valuable insight into making decisions about pollution control and mitigation strategies.

TI  - The long-term survival benefits of high and low ligation of inferior mesenteric artery in colorectal cancer surgery A review and meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The decision of ligation at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) or below the origin of the left colic artery (LCA) has remained a dilemma for surgeons in colorectal cancer surgery. The available studies are controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the predictive significance of high versus low ligation in colorectal cancer surgery.Methods: A literature search done using Medline, EMBASE, GoogleScholar, and references. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze the 5-year overall survival (OS) of the high and low ligation using hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We further analyzed 2 subgroups considering the level of lymph nodes (LNs) extension. That is IMA positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) LNs. Survival differences were analyzed.Results: A total of 3119 patients in 5 cohorts were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled HR results showed significant OS benefit of high ligation than low ligation (HR; 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89) in the "IMA +ve" group with 33% decreased risk, while there is no statistical significance in the "IMA -ve" (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.30-1.46) and the " all cases" group (HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.41-1.15).Conclusion: The pooled data showed high ligation of IMA has a better survival benefit for the patients with IMA positive LNs. It signifies high ligation should be recommended for the advanced cases or with the suspected high risk of IMA lymphatic metastasis. The limited number of articles demands future high-powered, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the further reliable conclusion.

TI  - Snowpack Density Retrieval Using Fully Polarimetric TerraSAR-X Data in the Himalayas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the development of a novel algorithm for deriving snowpack density over the snow-covered region of the Himalayas. The analysis utilizes fully polarimetric TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar data sets, field observations, and other ancillary information for the retrieval of snowpack density. The algorithm involves the development of a new generalized hybrid decomposition model. The generalized volume scattering parameter from the decomposition model is inverted for snow density estimation. A few field data measurements' campaigns were carried out, within near-real time of satellite passing over the area, to collect various parameters such as temperature, water content, and the density of the snowpack at varying depths. These field observations are further used for validation of the results obtained from the inversion algorithm. It is also found that the model-estimated snowpack density is highly congruent with the field-measured snowpack density. The mean absolute error of snowpack density, root-mean-square error, and index of agreement are found to be 9.9 kg/m(3), 10 kg/m(3), and 0.96, respectively, which are well within the acceptable range.

TI  - Accessing satellite imagery for disaster response through the International Charter: Lessons learned from the 2011 US Midwestern Floods
T2  - SPACE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Charter 'Space and Major Disasters' ("Charter") is a collaboration among Earth observation satellite owners and operators to provide remotely sensed (RS) data following natural and man-made disasters. Charter members provided post-flood and pre-flood or archived RS data after the April 2011 floods in the Midwestern US. These multispectral and RADAR images provided valuable information to end users" and first responders in the flood affected states for their planning and relief efforts. This effort was successful because of the process established by the Charter for soliciting requests, and acquiring and distributing data through a network of international and national agencies, and data vendors. This.paper describes the a) role played by the Charter to acquire and distribute RS data through six of its members, b) value of archived satellite data, c) need for image processing experts to process these near real-time data, and transfer them in a timely manner, and d) data acquisition and distribution policies of the Charter. Lessons learned from this response along with the policy recommendations will be helpful in future activations for maximizing the value of RS data and services provided by the Charter.

TI  - Fire activity in Borneo driven by industrial land conversion and drought during El Nino periods, 1982-2010
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rainforests, naturally resistant to fire when intact, are increasingly vulnerable to burning due to ongoing forest perturbation and, possibly, climatic changes. Industrial-scale forest degradation and conversion are increasing fire occurrence, and interactions with climate anomalies such as El Nino induced droughts can magnify the extent and severity of fire activity. The influences of these factors on fire frequency in tropical forests has not been widely studied at large spatio-temporal scales at which feedbacks between fire reoccurrence and forest degradation may develop. Linkages between fire activity, industrial land use, and El Nino rainfall deficits are acute in Borneo, where the greatest tropical fire events in recorded history have apparently occurred in recent decades. Here we investigate how fire frequency in Borneo has been influenced by industrial-scale agricultural development and logging during El Nino periods by integrating long-term satellite observations between 1982 and 2010 - a period encompassing the onset, development, and consolidation of its Borneo's industrial forestry and agricultural operations as well as the full diversity of El Nino events. We record changes in fire frequency over this period by deriving the longest and most comprehensive spatio-temporal record of fire activity across Borneo using AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) satellite data. Monthly fire frequency was derived from these data and modelled at 0.04 degrees resolution via a random-forest model, which explained 56% of the monthly variation as a function of oil palm and timber plantation extent and proximity, logging intensity and proximity, human settlement, climate, forest and peatland condition, and time, observed using Landsat and similar satellite data. Oil-palm extent increased fire frequency until covering 20% of a grid cell, signalling the significant influence of early stages of plantation establishment. Heighted fire frequency was particularly acute within 10 km of oil palm, where both expanding plantation and smallholder agriculture are believed to be contributing factors. Fire frequency increased abruptly and dramatically when rainfall fell below 200 mm month(-1), especially as landscape perturbation increased (indicated by vegetation index data). Logging intensity had a negligible influence on fire frequency, including on peatlands, suggesting a more complex response of logged forest to burning than appreciated. Over time, the epicentres of high-frequency fires expanded from East Kalimantan (1980's) to Central and West Kalimantan (1990's), coincidentally but apparently slightly preceding oil-palm expansion, and high-frequency fires then waned in East Kalimantan and occurred only in Central and West Kalimantan (2000's). After accounting for land-cover changes and climate, our model under-estimates observed fire frequency during ca. 1990-2002 and over-estimates it thereafter, suggesting that a multi-decadal shift to industrial forest conversion and forest landscapes may have diminished the propensity for high-frequency fires in much of this globally significant tropical region since ca. 2000.

TI  - Retrospective Observational Study of Atypical Winter Respiratory Illness Season Using Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance, England, 2014-15
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - During winter 2014-15. England experienced severe strains on acute health services. We investigated whether syndromic surveillance could contribute to understanding of the unusually high level of healthcare needs. We compared trends for several respiratory syndromic indicators from that winter to historical baselines. Cumulative and mean incidence rates were compared by winter and age group. All age influenza-like illness was at expected levels; however, severe asthma and pneumonia levels were above those expected. Across several respiratory indicators, cumulative incidence rates during 2014-15 were similar to those of previous years, but higher for older persons; we saw increased rates of acute respiratory disease, including influenza-like illness, severe asthma, and pneumonia, in the 65-74- and >= 75-year age groups. Age group-specific statistical algorithms may provide insights into the burden on health services and improve early warning in future winters.

TI  - Post-breeding densities, population sizes and lake size partitioning of loon species in western Chukotka, Russia
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Loons (family Gaviidae) breed in small ponds and lakes across Arctic landscapes and are high level predators in the lake ecosystems. As such, they may serve as sentinel species, warning humans of alterations in habitat and ecosystem integrity in a region that is undergoing vast change due to climate warming. Here, we characterized the abundance and habitat use of four arctic breeding species of loons in the plains and surrounding mountains of western Chukotka, Russia. Loon surveys were conducted on foot and by boat from 2009-2015. Loon species differed in their use of the four lacustrine habitat types within the study area. In yedoma habitat, the yellow-billed loon (Gavia. adamsii) was the most abundant (0.593 birds/km(2)); on fluvial plain habitat, Pacific loons (G. pacifica) outnumbered other loons (0.701 birds/km(2)); mountain valleys were inhabited similarly by pacifica (0.354 birds/km(2)) and red-throated loons (G.stellata; 0.307); and maritime tundra was used only by pacifica (1.13) and Arctic loons (G. arctica; 0.553). G. adamsii was not observed in mountain valleys or maritime tundra. Mountainous portions of rivers were predominantly occupied by stellata and pacifica, and lowland rivers by stellata, pacifica and arctica. There was a significant difference in the size of lakes occupied by the four congeners. The largest loon, adamsii, occupied the largest lakes (0.69 km(2)), 80% larger than lakes utilized by pacifica (0.39 km(2)) and arctica (0.38 km(2)), and 35 times larger than stellata (0.02 km(2)). Most lakes were occupied by a single loon species (125/162, 77.2%).

TI  - In-Season Crop Mapping with GF-1/WFV Data by Combining Object-Based Image Analysis and Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing accurate crop maps during the current growing season is essential for effective agricultural monitoring. Substantial efforts have been made to study regional crop distribution from year to year, but less attention is paid to the dynamics of composition and spatial extent of crops within a season. Understanding how crops are distributed at the early developing stages allows for the timely adjustment of crop planting structure as well as agricultural decision making and management. To address this knowledge gap, this study presents an approach integrating object-based image analysis with random forest (RF) for mapping in-season crop types based on multi-temporal GaoFen satellite data with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. A multiresolution local variance strategy was used to create crop objects, and then object-based spectral/textural features and vegetation indices were extracted from those objects. The RF classifier was employed to identify different crop types at four crop growth seasons by integrating available features. The crop classification performance of different seasons was assessed by calculating F-score values. Results show that crop maps derived using seasonal features achieved an overall accuracy of more than 87%. Compared to the use of spectral features, a feature combination of in-season textures and multi-temporal spectral and vegetation indices performs best when classifying crop types. Spectral and temporal information is more important than texture features for crop mapping. However, texture can be essential information when there is insufficient spectral and temporal information (e.g., crop identification in the early spring). These results indicate that an object-based image analysis combined with random forest has considerable potential for in-season crop mapping using high spatial resolution imagery.

TI  - Lymphatic invasion and the Shields index in predicting melanoma metastases
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Findings of the prognostic significance of lymphatic invasion are contradictory. To determine an as efficient cutaneous melanoma metastasis predictor as possible, Shields et al. created a new prognostic index. This study aimed to examine whether the lymphatic invasion analysis and the Shields index calculation can be used in predicting lymph node status in patients with cutaneous melanoma.Methods: Lymphatic invasion of 100 melanoma specimens was detected by dual immunohistochemistry staining for the lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 and melanoma cell S-100 protein. The Shields index was calculated as a logarithm by multiplying the melanoma thickness, square of peritumoural lymphatic vessel density and the number "2" for the present lymphatic invasion.Results: No statistically significant difference was observed between lymph node metastatic and nonmetastatic melanomas regarding the lymphatic invasion. Metastatic melanomas showed a significantly higher Shields index value than nonmetastatic melanomas (p = 0.00). Area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) proved that the Shields index (AUC = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.93, p = 0.00) was the most accurate predictor of lymph node status, followed by the melanoma thickness (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.86, p = 0.00) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85, p = 0.00), while lymphatic invasion was not successful in predicting (AUC = 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.67, p = 0.31). The Shields index achieved 81.3% sensitivity and 75% specificity (cut-off mean value).Conclusions: Our findings show that D2-40/S-100 immunohistochemical analysis of lymphatic invasion cannot be used for predicting the lymph node status, while the Shields index calculation predicts disease outcome more accurately than the melanoma thickness and AJCC staging.

TI  - Emerging Stress and Relative Resiliency of Giant Sequoia Groves Experiencing Multiyear Dry Periods in a Warming Climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative greenness and wetness of Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) groves and the surrounding Sierra Nevada, California forests were investigated using patterns in vegetation indices from Landsat imagery for the period 1985-2015. Vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index) and thus forest biomass in groves increased by about 6% over that 30year period, suggesting a 10% increase in evapotranspiration. No significant change in the surrounding nongrove forest was observed. In this period, local temperature measurements showed an increase of about 2.2 degrees C. The wetness of groves (normalized difference wetness index) showed no overall long-term trend but responded to changes in annual water-year precipitation and temperature. The long-term trends of grove greenness and wetness varied by elevation, with the lower rain-snow transition elevation zone (1,700-2,100m) marking a change from an increasing trend at lower elevations to a decreasing trend at higher elevations. The 2011-2015 drought brought an unprecedented drop in grove wetness, over 5 times the 1985-2010 standard deviation, and wetness in SEGI groves dropped 50% more than in nongrove areas. Overall, the wetness and greenness of SEGI groves showed a larger response to the warming climate and drought than nongrove areas. The influence of droughts on the wetness of SEGI groves reflected effects of both the multidecadal increase in forest biomass and the effects of warmer drought-year temperatures on the evaporative demand of current grove vegetation, plus sufficient regolith water storage of rain and snowmelt to sustain that vegetation through seasonal and multiyear dry periods.

TI  - Lymphatic Territories (Lymphosomes) in the Rat: An Anatomical Study for Future Lymphatic Research
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Understanding the precise anatomy in experimental animals is crucial for correct design of research projects. Rats are commonly used for scientific research in plastic surgery because of their availability in academic institutions, moderate cost, and sizable vessels for microsurgical procedures. In past publications about rat anatomy, lymphatic mapping has been limited and incomplete. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map the superficial lymphatic system in the rat.Methods: Twenty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography was used to identify the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Under general anaesthesia, indocyanine green was injected intradermally at multiple spots along the dorsal and medial midlines, front and hind paws, ears, and tail. The course of the lymphatic vessels was traced on the skin with a marker pen and photographed. The superficial lymphatic vessels in each rat were sketched on a graphic template and all of the templates were superimposed using graphics software to define the relationship between the lymphatic vessel and sentinel node.Results: Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography was able to demonstrate the superficial lymphatic vessels in the rat. Six groups of regional lymph node/s were identified and lymphatic pathways to those nodes delineated. The authors' lymphosome concept was successfully applied to the rat, with six lymphosomes identified.Conclusions: The authors succeeded in performing superficial lymphatic mapping in the rat. The authors' anatomical findings can provide further information about the lymphatic system in the normal state and promote understanding of pathologic changes generated by surgical manipulation for future studies.

TI  - Analysis of a quasi-three-point bending test for fabrics with friction and extensibility effect
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a theoretical bending model to investigate the quasi-three-point bending step of the comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY). The effect of the friction and extensibility of fabrics on the bending step of the CHES-FY is discussed based on the theoretical bending model in three cases, and bending parameters, including maximum bending force, linear fitting slope and bending work, are featured from the bending force-displacement curves of each case. Comparisons of the theoretical and experimental results were also conducted to validate the model. The results revealed that the friction effect tended to enhance the bending parameters of the bending force-displacement curve of the bending step, and the effect of the friction could be remarkable at low bending rigidity of samples. However, the effect of the extensibility of samples was almost negligible for the bending test of wear fabrics, as the maximal relative error was less than 11.7% for fabrics where the tensile elastic constant was higher than 0.1 N/cm.%. This work can also provide a theoretical guidance for improving the measurement accuracy of the three-point bending test.

TI  - An external compensation method for AMOLED using the concept of ramp-stop
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an external feedback method to compensate the device variation for active-matrix organic light-emitting diode. The pixel data current is controlled by ramping the gate voltage and converted to the sensed voltage V-sense in real time. When V-sense is equal to a preset voltage V-data, the switching block outputs the low potential to stop the ramping. Therefore, the gate voltage is locked at the value corresponding to the target data current. This circuit is implemented with three thin-film transistors in the active area and some functional blocks in driver integrated circuit (IC), namely, sentinel block, current-voltage converting block, and switching block. Unlike the other usual methods of external compensation requiring double number of connections between driver IC and glass, by using the common ramping signal and a simple circuit made on glass, the proposed method can be implemented with only one pin per column.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping crop patterns with remote sensing data is of great importance for agricultural production, food security and agricultural sustainability. In this paper, a hierarchical clustering method was proposed to map cropping frequency from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Indices (EVI) data and the spatial and temporal patterns of cropping frequency from 2001 to 2015 in Hubei Province of China were analyzed. The results are as follows: (1) The total double crop areas decreased slightly, while total single crop areas decreased significantly during 2001 and 2015; (2) The transfer between double crop and single crop was frequent in Hubei with about 11 similar to 15% croplands changed their cropping frequency every 5 years; (3) The crop system has obvious regional differentiation for their change trend at the county level.

TI  - Laparoscopic near-infrared fluorescent imaging as an alternative option for sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: A prospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To evaluate feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping by using near-infrared fluorescent imaging and indocyanine green (NIR/ICG) integrated laparoscopic system in clinically uterine-confined endometrial cancer.Materials and methods: Patients with clinically early-stage endometrial cancer were included in this prospective study. ICG was injected to the uterine cervix and NIR/ICG integrated laparoscopic system (Spies Full HD D-Light P ICG technology, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used during the operations. SLN and/or suspicious lymph nodes were resected. Side specific lymphadenectomy was performed when mapping was unsuccessful. Systematic lymphadenectomy was completed following SLN algorithm steps.Results: Seventy-one eligible patients were analyzed. The overall, unilateral and bilateral SLN detection rates were 95.7%, 18.3%, 77.4%, respectively. There were 8 (11.2%) patients with lymph node metastasis. One of them was isolated para-aortic node metastasis. Negative predictive value, sensitivity and false negative rate for detecting lymphatic spread were 98.4%, 87.5% and 1.5%, respectively.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node mapping can easily be performed with high accuracy by using NIR/ICG integrated conventional laparoscopic system in endometrial cancer and almost all lymphatic spread can be detected.

TI  - On-Orbit Line Spread Function Estimation of the SNPP VIIRS Imaging System From Lake Pontchartrain Causeway Bridge Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) instrument was launched on October 28, 2011 onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The VIIRS instrument is a whiskbroom system with 22 spectral and thermal bands split between 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands), five imagery resolution bands (I-bands), and a day-night band. In this study, we estimate the along-scan line spread function (LSF) of the I-bands and M-bands based on measurements performed on images of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway Bridge. In doing so, we develop a model for the LSF that closely matches the prelaunch laboratory measurements. We utilize VIIRS images co-geolocated with a Landsat TM image to precisely locate the bridge linear feature in the VIIRS images as a linear best fit to a straight line. We then utilize nonlinear optimization to compute the best fit equation of the VIIRS image measurements in the vicinity of the bridge to the developed model equation. From the found parameterization of the model equation, we derive the full-width at half-maximum as an approximation of the sensor field of view for all bands, and compare these on-orbit measured values with prelaunch laboratory results.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. There are limited data on the burden of disease posed by influenza in low-and middle-income countries. Furthermore, most estimates of influenza disease burden worldwide rely on passive sentinel surveillance at health clinics and hospitals that lack accurate population denominators.Methods. We documented influenza incidence, seasonality, health-system utilization with influenza illness, and vaccination coverage through active community-based surveillance in 4 ecologically distinct regions of Peru over 6 years. Approximately 7200 people in 1500 randomly selected households were visited 3 times per week. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from persons with influenza-like illness and tested for influenza virus by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results. We followed participants for 35 353 person-years (PY). The overall incidence of influenza was 100 per 1000 PY (95% confidence interval [CI], 97-104) and was highest in children aged 2-4 years (256/1000 PY [95% CI, 236-277]). Seasonal incidence trends were similar across sites, with 61% of annual influenza cases occurring during the austral winter (May-September). Of all participants, 44 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 42-46) sought medical care, 0.7 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 0.4-1.0) were hospitalized, and 1 person died (2.8/100 000 PY). Influenza vaccine coverage was 27% among children aged 6-23 months and 26% among persons aged >= 65 years.Conclusions. Our results indicate that 1 in 10 persons develops influenza each year in Peru, with the highest incidence in young children. Active community-based surveillance allows for a better understanding of the true burden and seasonality of disease that is essential to plan the optimal target groups, timing, and cost of national influenza vaccination programs.

TI  - Statistical landslide susceptibility assessment of the Mansehra and Torghar districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards greatly impact human life and the development of infrastructure, especially in poorer countries. To tackle this issue and develop sufficient strategies with which to assess hazards under local governing conditions, open-source approaches have been pursued in many aid development and technical cooperation projects. In this study, the landslide susceptibility of the Mansehra and Torghar districts is assessed within the framework of the multiphase German-Pakistani technical cooperation project "Georisk Assessment Northern Pakistan'' (GANP), which was initiated after the devastating Kashmir Earthquake occurred on October 8, 2005. This landslide susceptibility assessment is strongly aligned with an open data approach that utilizes free, accessible data and data sources. The landslide inventory was collected using high-resolution imagery provided by Google Earth. The landslide-controlling parameters were derived from a series of open access data, including published data, free and accessible satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat), and digital elevation models. A mid-level complexity statistical approach was used to assess relative landslide susceptibility patterns on a regional scale. Stepwise data integration with subsequent evaluation was then applied. The evaluation of the model quality was performed using receiver operation characteristic curves. The established workflow, which also incorporated sensitivity studies and an uncertainty assessment, produces reliable landslide susceptibility patterns that can be used for regional spatial planning.

TI  - Redefining priorities towards graded travel-related infectious disease research
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Our knowledge of the health problems and infections encountered by international travellers has evolved considerably in the past decades. The growth of global networks such as the GeoSentinel Surveillance network, TropNet Europe, EuroTravNet and networks based in North America have provided valuable information on the frequency of a wide array of travel-related diseases and accidents, including details on the destination of travel and trends over time. The information gained from these network studies has provided important data for the practice of travel medicine and in some instances for the development of practice guidelines. However, network data due to a lack of denominators usually cannot serve as a basis for a GRADE approach to guideline development. Although epidemiological network studies will continue to serve an important role in travel medicine we encourage an additional strong focus towards translational scientific research questions and towards the broader use of novel techniques to obtain more accurate epidemiological analyses to address the many unanswered questions in our field.

TI  - Evaluation of the SPOT/VEGETATION Collection 3 reprocessed dataset: Surface reflectances and NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - After the end of the 'Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre' (SPOT) VEGETATION (SPOT/VGT) mission in May/ 2014, the SPOT/VGT data archive, consisting of raw data coming from both the VEGETATION 1 (VGT1) and VEGETATION 2 (VGT2) instruments, was reprocessed, aiming at improved cloud screening and correcting for known artefacts such as the smile pattern in the VGT2 Blue band and the Sun-Earth distance bug in Top-of Atmosphere reflectance calculation, with the objective of improving temporal consistency. The aim of this paper is to inform the user community of the changes in and the evaluation of the new SPOT/VGT Collection 3 (VGTC-3). The evaluation of the reprocessing is based on (i) the relative comparison between SPOT/VGT Collection 2 (VGT-C2) and VGT-C3 surface reflectances and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (ii) consistency analysis between VGT1-C3 and VGT2-C3, and (iii) the comparison of the archive with external datasets from METOP/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and TERRA/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Surface reflectances are slightly higher after the reprocessing, with larger differences in July compared to January, caused by the corrected Sun-Earth distance modelling. For NDVI, the overall impact of the reprocessing is relatively small and differences show no seasonality. Trends in the differences over the years are related to changes in calibration coefficients. Systematic differences between VGT1-C3 and VGT2-C3 surface reflectance are well below 1%, with largest bias between VGT1 and VGT2 for the NIR band and the NDVI (VGT2 > VGT1, especially for larger NDVI values). Both the comparison with METOP/AVHRR (surface reflectance and NDVI) and TERRA/MODIS (NDVI) reveal trends over time: systematic bias between VGT2 and METOP/AVHRR tends to decrease over time, while comparison with TERRA/MODIS indicates an increasing bias between VGT2 and MODIS. VGT2 NDVI seems to be gradually evolving to slightly larger values, which is consistent with the change in overpass time of VGT2 and the different illumination conditions caused by the orbital drift of the sensor. Results demonstrate however the SPOT/VGT-C3 archive is more stable over time compared to the previous archive, although bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization is recommended in order to correct for bidirectional effects.

TI  - Albedo, Land Cover, and Daytime Surface Temperature Variation Across an Urbanized Landscape
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a key parameter controlling the local energy budget, and altering the albedo of built surfaces has been proposed as a tool to mitigate high near-surface temperatures in the urban heat island. However, most research on albedo in urban landscapes has used coarse-resolution data, and few studies have attempted to relate albedo to other urban land cover characteristics. This study provides an empirical description of urban summertime albedo using 30m remote sensing measurements in the metropolitan area around Boston, Massachusetts, relating albedo to metrics of impervious cover fraction, tree canopy coverage, population density, and land surface temperature (LST). At 30m spatial resolution, median albedo over the study area (excluding open water) was 0.152 (0.112-0.187). Trends of lower albedo with increasing urbanization metrics and temperature emerged only after aggregating data to 500m or the boundaries of individual towns, at which scale a -0.01 change in albedo was associated with a 29 (25-35)% decrease in canopy cover, a 27 (24-30)% increase in impervious cover, and an increase in population from 11 to 386km(-2). The most intensively urbanized towns in the region showed albedo up to 0.035 lower than the least urbanized towns, and mean mid-morning LST 12.6 degrees C higher. Trends in albedo derived from 500m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements were comparable, but indicated a strong contribution of open water at this coarser resolution. These results reveal linkages between albedo and urban land cover character, and offer empirical context for climate resilient planning and future landscape functional changes with urbanization.

AB  - A breast cancer with tumors smaller than or equal to 5mm in diameter is treated as a microscopic lesion and axially lymph node metastasis is considered to be rare. A 52-year-old female was found to have an abnormal shadow on mammography. An ultrasonography revealed a poorly defined and irregular shaped mass with calcification, 4mm in diameter, in the AC area of her left breast. We performed vacuum-assisted biopsy and diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Under a preoperative diagnosis of left breast cancer with cT1aN0M0, stage I , Luminal A like, we underwent partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The intraoperative consultation suggested sentinel lymph node metastasis and we therefore performed level II axillary lymph node dissection. The size of the tumor was 4mm and diagnosed with pT1a breast cancer. Histopathological diagnosis was papillotubular carcinoma. Radiotherapy was performed(total: 50 Gy)followed by endocrine therapy (tamoxifen). She is alive without recurrence and metastasis 5 years after surgery.

TI  - Thirty years of land use/cover change in the Caribbean: Assessing the relationship between urbanization and mangrove loss in Roatan, Honduras
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing biophysical and anthropogenic threats to Caribbean island ecosystems, relatively few studies have used remote sensing to estimate rates of land use/cover change (LUCC) for Caribbean Islands. Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatan, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (-19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island -wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development.

TI  - THE POSITIVIST UNIVERSALISM AND REPUBLICANISM OF THE YOUNG TURKS
T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores positivist universalism, one of the central aspects of contemporary approaches in political theory, through the study of the Young Turks' political thought. Current scholarship portrays the Young Turks as champions of a national cause, limited to overthrowing despotism and relaunching the Constitution of 1876 in the Ottoman Empire. This neglects their broader aim to guarantee peace, order, and progress, both at home and abroad, by adopting Comtean universal positivism, and it distorts their vision of society, politics, and history. From their base in Paris the Young Turks challenged the Eurocentric conception of universalism, suggesting a more egalitarian and comprehensive conception that has yet to be recognized. This article shows that, transcending the conventional boundaries between Western and non-Western political thought, the Young Turks' political ideology presents an early example of the formation of a modern, pluralist worldview, and that their core conceptions had a deep impact on the founding of Turkish republicanism.

TI  - Evaluation of SWAT simulated soil moisture at catchment scale by field measurements and Landsat derived indices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of soil moisture under different soils and crops at regional scale is a challenging task. Hence, such studies are limited by the availability of ground based measurements. The current study evaluates the spatial and temporal patterns of daily soil moisture simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the upper 30 cm of the soil profile with indirect soil moisture estimates from Landsat for 2016. The Thermal Vegetation Difference Index (TVDI), was calculated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the brightness temperature (BT) using Landsat images, from which regression models were trained by using field measurements from Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to calculate soil moisture. Two agricultural catchments namely, Gerdau and Wipperau in Germany were satisfactorily calibrated using SWAT for daily streamflow (1975-2000) with NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiency) >0.55 and PBIAS (Percent bias) <5.5%. The parameter uncertainty assessment during the irrigation season (Mar-Sept, 2016) for soil moisture revealed that the uncertainty band is narrow (p-factor = 0.57-0.83; r-factor= 0.52 - 1.3). Spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture from Landsat and SWAT were evaluated by using boxplots and absolute soil moisture difference maps. Results revealed that the overall spatial and temporal patterns of boxplots matched better for the dry period (correlation, r >= 0.90) compared to the wet period (r >= 0.57). The mean absolute difference between soil moisture from Landsat and SWAT ranged between 0.9-10% for most soils. In addition to it, the soil map was refined to match soil moisture patterns shown in Landsat images for one sandy soil, which further improved the mean absolute difference (1.06-6%). The current study provides an approach to use remotely sensed soil moisture for verifying hydrological modeling results and for optimizing the parameterization of soils, which may bridge the gap between global, regional and field studies in agricultural water management.

TI  - Melanoma Sequentially Suppresses Different DC Subsets in the Sentinel Lymph Node, Affecting Disease Spread and Recurrence
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma exerts immune-suppressive effects to facilitate tumor progression and metastatic spread. We studied these effects on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell subsets in 36 melanoma sentinel lymph node (SLN) from 28 stage I-III melanoma patients and determined their clinical significance. Four conventional DC subsets, plasmacytoid DCs, and CD4(+), CD8(+), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), were analyzed by flow cytometry. We correlated these data to clinical parameters and determined their effect on local and distant melanoma recurrence, with a median follow-up of 75 months. In stage I and II melanoma, increased Breslow thickness (i.e., invasion depth of the primary melanoma) was associated with progressive suppression of skin-derived migratory CD1a(+) DC subsets. In contrast, LN-resident DC subsets and T cells were only affected once metas-tasis to the SLN had occurred. In stage III patients, increased CD4: CD8 ratios in concert with the accumulation of Tregs resulted in decreased CD8: Treg ratios. On follow-up, lower frequencies of migratory DC subsets proved related to local melanoma recurrence, whereas reduced maturation of LN-resident DC subsets was associated with distant recurrence and melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, melanoma-mediated suppression of migratory DC subsets in the SLN precedes local spread, whereas suppression of LN-resident DC subsets follows regional spread and precedes further melanoma dissemination to distant sites. This study offers a rationale to target migratory as well as LN-resident DC subsets for early immunotherapeutic interventions to prevent melanoma recurrence and spread. (C) 2017 AACR.

TI  - Neurotropic melanoma: an analysis of the clinicopathological features, management strategies and survival outcomes for 671 patients treated at a tertiary referral center
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neurotropic cutaneous melanoma is a rare melanoma subtype that invades nerves and is often associated with desmoplastic melanoma. Limited data suggest that it has a greater propensity to recur locally, but it is unknown whether its behavior differs from that of other melanoma subtypes, including desmoplastic melanoma. We investigated clinicopathological predictors of outcome in a cohort of 671 patients with neurotropic melanoma to develop evidence-based management recommendations. Patients with primary neurotropic melanoma diagnosed from 1985 to 2013 were identified from the Melanoma Institute Australia database, along with a control cohort of 718 non-neurotropic melanoma patients. Features predictive of sentinel lymph node status, recurrence, melanoma-specific survival and response to adjuvant radiotherapy were sought. Neither local recurrence (hazard ratio: 1.28 (0.73-2.25) P = 0.39) nor melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.79 (0.55-1.15) P = 0.22) were significantly affected by the presence of neurotropism on multivariate analysis. However, there was a markedly reduced likelihood of sentinel node positivity (hazard ratio: 0.61 (0.41-0.89) P = 0.01) in neurotropic melanoma patients. Surgical margins >= 8 mm halved the recurrence risk compared with <2 mm margins (hazard ratio: 0.46 (0.31-0.68) P < 0.001). Additionally, in neurotropic melanoma patients with <8 mm margins, adjuvant radiotherapy halved the recurrence risk (hazard ratio: 0.48 (0.27-0.87) P = 0.02). This, the largest study of neurotropic melanoma reported to date, has demonstrated that the presence of neurotropism does not alter the risk of melanoma recurrence or survival but does reduce the likelihood of sentinel node positivity. For successful treatment of neurotropic melanoma, adequate excision margins are of paramount importance. However, when adequate margins cannot be achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence.

TI  - Remote Sensing of 2000-2016 Alpine Spring Snowline Elevation in Dall Sheep Mountain Ranges of Alaska and Western Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lowest elevation of spring snow (snowline) is an important factor influencing recruitment and survival of wildlife in alpine areas. In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal variability of alpine spring snowline across major Dall sheep mountain areas in Alaska and northwestern Canada. We used a daily MODIS snow fraction product to estimate the last day of 2000-2016 spring snow for each 500-m pixel within 28 mountain areas. We then developed annual (2000-2016) regression models predicting the elevation of alpine snowline during mid-May for each mountain area. MODIS-based regression estimates were compared with estimates derived using a Normalized Difference Snow Index from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance data. We also used 2000-2009 decadal climate grids to estimate total winter precipitation and mean May temperature for each of the 28 mountain areas. Based on our MODIS regression models, the 2000-2016 mean 15 May snowline elevation ranged from 339 m in the cold arctic class to 1145 m in the interior mountain class. Spring snowline estimates from MODIS and Landsat OLI were similar, with a mean absolute error of 106 m. Spring snowline elevation was significantly related to mean May temperature and total winter precipitation. The late spring of 2013 may have impacted some sheep populations, especially in the cold arctic mountain areas which were snow-covered in mid-May, while some interior mountain areas had mid-May snowlines exceeding 1000 m elevation. We found this regional (>500,000 km(2)) remote sensing application useful for determining the inter-annual and regional variability of spring alpine snowline among 28 mountain areas.

TI  - Staggered SAR: Performance Analysis and Experiments With Real Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing allows high-resolution imaging independent of weather conditions and sunlight illumination and is therefore very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the earth's surface. Conventional SAR systems are, however, limited in that a wide swath can only be imaged at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution. This limitation can be overcome by using systems with multiple receive subapertures displaced in along-track, but a very long antenna is required to map a wide swath. If a relatively short antenna with a single aperture in along-track is available, it is still possible to map a wide area: multiple subswaths can simultaneously be imaged using digital beamforming in elevation, but "blind ranges" are present between adjacent swaths, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting. Staggered SAR overcomes the problem of blind ranges by continuously varying the pulse repetition interval (PRI). A proper selection of the PRIs, together with moderate oversampling in azimuth, allows an accurate interpolation of the nonuniformly sampled raw data into a uniform grid, so that resampled data can then be focused with a conventional SAR processor. This approach thereby allows high-resolution imaging of a wide continuous swath without the need for a long antenna with multiple subapertures. In this paper, the performance of staggered SAR is thoroughly discussed and novel methods for the evaluation of the range and azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratios in staggered SAR are proposed. An L-band design example based on a reflector antenna with multiple feeds shows that outstanding ambiguity performance is obtained, provided that data are moderately oversampled in azimuth. As an additional benefit, the energy of range and azimuth ambiguities is spread over large areas: ambiguities therefore appear in the image as a noise-like disturbance rather than localized artifacts. The impact of staggered SAR operation on image quality is furthermore assessed with experiments using real data. As the first step, highly oversampled F-SAR airborne data have been used to generate equivalent staggered SAR data sets and to evaluate the performance for different oversampling factors and interpolation methods. Then, the radar instrument of the German satellite TerraSAR-X has been commanded to acquire data over the lake Constance in staggered SAR mode. Measurements on these data show very good agreement with predictions from simulations. Staggered SAR is currently being considered as the baseline acquisition mode for Tandem-L, a proposal for a polarimetric and interferometric spaceborne SAR mission to monitor dynamic processes on the earth's surface with unprecedented accuracy and resolution.

TI  - Cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation in an extreme high-risk patient
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Stroke during transcatheter aortic valve replacement is one of the most feared complications. New technologies have been developed, attempting to prevent cerebral embolization of thrombotic and calcific debris. We report a 78-year-old patient (EuroSCORE log 45.6%, STS Stroke Score 5.1%) with calcific aortic stenosis at particular risk for cerebrovascular accidents. The patient underwent transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the dual filter-based Claret Sentinel (TM) Device for cerebral protection. Claret Sentinel Device use was associated with capture of macroscopic debris. Postoperatively, no neurological deficits could be detected by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale.

TI  - An automatic detection of green tide using multi-windows with their adaptive threshold from Landsat TM/ETM plus image
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the atmospheric correction is a necessary preprocessing step of remote sensing image before detecting green tide, the introduced error directly affects the detection precision. Therefore, the detection method of green tide is presented from Landsat TM/ETM plus image which needs not the atmospheric correction. In order to achieve an automatic detection of green tide, a linear relationship (y =0.723x+0.504) between detection threshold y and subtraction x (x=lambda (nir)-lambda (red)) is found from the comparing Landsat TM/ETM plus image with the field surveys. Using this relationship, green tide patches can be detected automatically from Landsat TM/ETM plus image. Considering there is brightness difference between different regions in an image, the image will be divided into a plurality of windows (sub-images) with a same size firstly, and then each window will be detected using an adaptive detection threshold determined according to the discovered linear relationship. It is found that big errors will appear in some windows, such as those covered by clouds seriously. To solve this problem, the moving step k of windows is proposed to be less than the window width n. Using this mechanism, most pixels will be detected [n/k]x[n/k] times except the boundary pixels, then every pixel will be assigned the final class (green tide or sea water) according to majority rule voting strategy. It can be seen from the experiments, the proposed detection method using multi-windows and their adaptive thresholds can detect green tide from Landsat TM/ETM plus image automatically. Meanwhile, it avoids the reliance on the accurate atmospheric correction.

TI  - First Spaceborne SAR-GMTI Experimental Results for the Chinese Gaofen-3 Dual-Channel SAR Sensor
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, it is a challenging task to detect ground slow-moving targets against strong clutter background with limited spatial channels and restricted pulse repetition frequency (PRF). In this paper, we evaluate the image-based dual-channel SAR-ground moving target indication (SAR-GMTI) workflow for the Gaofen-3 SAR sensor and analyze the impact of strong azimuth ambiguities on GMTI when the displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) condition is not fully satisfied, which has not been demonstrated yet. An effective sliding window design technique based on system parameters analysis is proposed to deal with azimuth ambiguities and reduce false alarm. In the SAR-GMTI experiments, co-registration, clutter suppression, constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector, vector velocity estimation and moving target relocation are analyzed and discussed thoroughly. With the real measured data of the Gaofen-3 dual-channel SAR sensor, the GMTI capability of this sensor is demonstrated and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.

TI  - Linkage Analysis of Land Use/Cover Patterns and Hydro-Chemical Characteristics in Different Seasons in Ebinur Lake Watershed, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ebinur Lake Watershed, with its oases and deserts, is a typically arid and mountainous region on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountains. Along with ever increasing human activities, agricultural and domestic wastes have been directly discharged into river systems around the Watershed, which consequently poses a grave threat to the sustainable development of Xinjiang. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we have determined the relationships between land use/cover (LULC) and hydro-chemical characteristics during rainy and dry seasons in 2014. Spatial patterns of hydro-chemical characteristics as demonstrated by mineralization, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and SO42-, HCO3-, Cl-, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+ and K+ concentrations were examined in 113 sites. Since hydro-chemical characteristics were affected by LULC patterns, this study delineated six zones to analyze the distribution characteristics of hydro-chemical parameters and its relationship with LULC patterns. The results showed that, except for the pH, all variables demonstrated significant spatial differences during dry and rainy seasons. In addition, the relationships between water quality and LULC patterns indicated that the farmland, forest-grassland, water body and salinized land all affected hydro-chemical characteristics during both rainy and dry seasons. Especially, decreased rainfall, irrigation, surface runoff, the area of lake, etc. largely led to the increase in ion content, which had great influence on hydro-chemical characteristics parameters in dry season. Furthermore, we established several stepwise linear multiple regressions models. The results showed that pH, mineralization and Ca2+ were defined by forest-grassland, while the Cl- and Mg2+ were defined by salinized land during the rainy season. The pH and Na+ were estimated based on farmland, whereas Cl- and Ca2+ were estimated based on forest-grassland during the dry season. In conclusion, this research on the relationships between the spatial distribution of hydro-chemical characteristics in Ebinur Lake Watershed and LULC patterns will be significant for the sustainable management of the arid regions in northwest China.

TI  - Dynamics of forest landscape pattern in Changbai Mountain
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat remote sensing image data in 2004 and 2015, we analyzed the changes in spatial distribution, shape, landscape fragmentation and diversity of Changbai Mountain National Nature Reserve and four neighboring forestry bureaus. The results showed that landscape changes did not always differ between the reserve and the neighboring forestry bureaus. The shape of forest landscapes became more regular, and the coniferous forest area decreased, which was mostly converted to broad-leaved mixed forest areas from 2004 to 2015 in both the reserve and its neighboring forestry bureaus. The total forest area in the reserve was almost unchanged, while the forest area in the forestry bureaus was reduced by 7326 hm(2), which was mostly converted to cultivated lands, followed by bare, harvested and construction lands. Generally, the landscapes in the study area tended to become more fragmented, heterogeneous, and diverse from 2004 to 2015, which indicated strong effect of human disturbances. In addition, the landscape changes varied among the four forestry bureaus. For instance, the shape of forest landscapes in Baihe Forestry Bureau became more regular, and the degree of fragmentations decreased, while the other forestry bureaus, such as Quanyang and Songjianghe showed the opposite trend.

TI  - Trends and Variability in Aerosol Optical Depth over North China from MODIS C6 Aerosol Products during 2001-2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the variability and trend in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over North China using the latest MODIS/Terra C6 merged Dark Target/Deep Blue AOD monthly data at 550 nm from 2001 to 2016. The spatial distribution of the annual mean AOD was generally characterized by two prominent high-value centers located in the industrially and economically developed areas of the North China Plain and East China, and the dust aerosol-dominated areas of southern Xinjiang. The seasonally averaged AOD reached its maximum in spring (0.430 +/- 0.049), followed by summer (0.356 +/- 0.035) and winter (0.282 +/- 0.039), with the minimum occurring in autumn (0.219 +/- 0.022). There were notable long-term annual trends in AOD in different regions over North China during 2001-2016: a decreasing AOD trend was found in Qinghai Tibet (-0.015 +/- 0.010/decade), Northwest China (-0.059 +/- 0.013/decade at 99% confidence level), and the North China Plain (-0.007 +/- 0.021/decade), but a positive increasing trend was identified in northern Xinjiang (0.01 +/- 0.006/decade), southern Xinjiang (0.002 +/- 0.013/decade), East China (0.053 +/- 0.042/decade), and Northeast China (0.016 +/- 0.029/decade). Seasonal patterns in the AOD regional long-term trend were evident. The AODs in spring over all the study regions, except East China, exhibited a decreasing trend, with the maximum trend value observed in Northwest China (-0.099 +/- 0.029/decade at 99% confidence level); whereas AODs in autumn, except in Northwest China, showed an increasing trend, with the maximum trend value occurring in East China (0.073 +/- 0.038/decade). Geographically, we also examined the annual and seasonal spatial patterns of AOD trends over North China. The annual spatial trends in AOD revealed a dominance of positive trends in most regions over the whole of North China from 2001 to 2016, but especially in East and Northeast China (AOD trend value of about 0.16/decade); whereas a negative trend was observed over northern Inner Mongolia (AOD trend value of about -0.12/decade). In addition, seasonal spatial trend analyses indicated that a continual clear upward trend occurred in East China in the autumn and winter seasons during the study period, with the maximum average increase occurring in winter (about 0.20/decade).

TI  - The Iterative Reweighted Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Separating Structural Layovers in SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Layover scatterers of tall building structures can be separated by synthetic aperture radar tomography (SAR-tomo). An iterative reweighted L1 minimization (IRL1) has been applied to enhance the sparsity in a tomographic inversion, where the basis pursuit (BP) technique was adopted to search for the solution. However, the IRL1 with BP is highly time-consuming, which may prevent its real application to large-scale data sets. In this letter, we propose the iterative reweighted alternating direction method of multipliers (IR-ADMM) for fast SAR-tomo imaging. We demonstrate and validate the enhanced sparsity and fast convergence of our IR-ADMM algorithm with experiments using both simulated data and TerraSAR-X Stripmap images of tall urban buildings. The experimental results show that compared with conventional IR-BP, the IR-ADMM greatly reduces the computation time without substantial performance degradation.

TI  - Variation in vegetation greenness along China's land border
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fourteen countries share about 22000 km land border with China, but not much is known about the variation in vegetation in such a large diverse area. By employing the remotely-sensed vegetation indices the vegetation greenness along the border was discussed. Our results show that since the early 21st century, similar trends in vegetation greenness have occurred along most of China's border, but differences occurred on either side of the border. Along the border with North Korea and South Asian nations, greater increasing trend in vegetation greenness occurred inside China's border, suggesting that China's vegetation protection programs have been successful. Spatial and temporal variations in vegetation greenness trends were observed along China's border with Russia, Mongolia, and Central Asian nations. Vegetation variation was lower inside China, along the Russian border, and China's eastern border with Mongolia. Along most borders with Central Asian nations, rates of vegetation change inside China's border during the growing season were higher than the rates outside the border. The results suggest that social customs, resource exploitation patterns, and national environmental conservation programs may profoundly affect vegetation greenness.

TI  - Spectral-spatial destriping of hyperspectral image via correntropy based sparse representation and unidirectional Huber-Markov random fields
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WAVELETS MULTIRESOLUTION AND INFORMATION PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel destriping method for hyperspectral images. Most of the previous destriping methods regard only the corrupted subimage as an isolated image and fail to consider the high spectral correlation between the subimages in different bands. This may impede their performance of removing striping noises. The proposed method takes advantage of both spectral and spatial information to contribute to the process of striping noise reduction. Firstly, a correntropy-based sparse representation (CSR) model is utilized to learn the high spectral correlation between the subimages in different bands. Then the spatial information of the target subimage with striping noise is incorporated into the CSR model with a unidirectional Huber-Markov random field prior. We devise an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier type of algorithm to efficiently compute the destriped results. The experimental results on two real-world hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Destriping hyperspectral imagery via spectral-spatial low-rank representation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WAVELETS MULTIRESOLUTION AND INFORMATION PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we address the problem of removing striping noise in hyperspectral images (HSI). To this end, we develop a novel destriping method by taking advantage of the spectral and spatial information of the hyperspectral image simultaneously. To obtain satisfactory destriped results, our consideration is two-fold: (1) To model the spectral information of HSI, we utilize low-rank representation to exploit the low-rank property of HSI; (2) To incorporate the spatial information into our method, we adopt the Huber-Markov random field (HMRF) prior model to preserve the edge information of HSI while reducing the striping noise. Finally, we integrate the spectral and spatial model into a unified objective function. In addition, we also devise an effective optimization algorithm to minimize the objective function. The experimental results on real-world HSI data validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for destriping of HSI.

TI  - NMPE: A normalized metric for measuring generalized spatial distortion of multispectral panshapening fusion
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptivity is important in remote sensing image fusion because of the data-intensive and mass-driven processing platforms that call for reliable evaluation metrics to assess the runtime fusion procedure. Spatial distortion, including poor detail, visual disorder, or over-injection, has not been measured as effectively as in the spectral domain. A new metric, namely normalized mean potential energy (NMPE), is proposed in this paper to check the generalized spatial distortion of fused images by calculating the potential energy of marginal filtering distributions using information of high-order Markov random fields. NMPE is defined based on the GFoE model, which is a new high-order model that we built for remote sensing image applications. To incorporate the evaluation experience of human vision system into the GFoE model, the real zero-mean Gabor filters with multiple directions and scales are used as feature extractors, and the Gaussian scale mixture model as the expert function. The model parameters are trained from 200 images of the Berkeley segmentation dataset. Poor detail in a fused image tends to result in small NMPE evaluation with respect to small Gabor scales. Our observation shows that scale invariance exists only for "good" details, so we use large scales of Gabor functions to detect visual disorder. Over-injection is checked when the fused NMPE is much higher than 1. In the experimental procedure, satellite images from Quickbird, LandSat-7, and SPOT-5 were put to fusion with five popular methods to produce different images for visual and digital comparison. It can be concluded from the experiment that NMPE is in line with our subjective judgment to measure the pansharpening quality in terms of enhanced detail, visual distortion, and over-injection.

TI  - Cross-Comparative Analysis of GF-1 Wide Field View and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide field view (WFV) sensor on-board GF-1 satellite can acquire multi-spectral data with moderate spatial resolution, which holds great potential for monitoring the Earth's surface. This study assesses WFV data through cross-comparison of spectral band reflectances and vegetation indices with Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data. The four vegetation indices considered in this study are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the ratio vegetation index (RVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The R2 between the WFV and ETM+ data were 0.82, 0.89, 0.92, and 0.80 for the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands reflectance, and 0.90, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.91 for NDVI, EVI, RVI, and SAVI, respectively. The results displayed a high correlation between the spectral reflectances and vegetation indices of the two sensors' data, which indicated the reliability of the WFV data. Furthermore, the WFV data were better than the ETM+ data with regards to spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Is axillary surgery beneficial for patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, typically triple-negative, breast cancer reported to have a favorable prognosis and low rate of nodal metastasis. No consensus guidelines exist for axillary staging and treatment.Methods: We identified all patients with ACC evaluated at our institution from January 1994 to August 2016. Patient, tumor, and treatment variables were abstracted and analyzed.Results: We identified 20 pure ACCs (0.13% of all invasive breast cancers) with size range 0.2-4.8 cm, in 19 women, median age 59 years. Preoperative axillary ultrasound was normal in 10/13 women and suspicious in 3/13 who had a subsequent negative lymph node fine needle aspiration (FNA). Fifteen patients (75%) had sentinel lymph node surgery and were pathologically node-negative, while the remaining five had no axillary surgery. With 3.6 years median follow-up (range 0.2-38.6 years), three patients experienced an in-breast recurrence at 2, 16, and 17 years, respectively, while none recurred in regional nodes.Conclusions: We observed no cases of nodal metastasis in 20 consecutive cases of ACC of the breast. Preoperative axillary ultrasound with FNA of suspicious nodes accurately predicted pathologic nodal stage. These data suggest axillary surgery might be omitted safely in patients with pure ACC and a clinically negative axilla.

TI  - Indications and techniques for robotic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy with sentinel lymph. node mapping in gynecologic oncology
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery is the most common approach for the treatment of early-stage endometrial and cervical cancers in the US. Surgical staging requires pelvic and often aortic lymphadenectomy, depending on the primary tumor characteristics. Pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy procedures may also be indicated for debulking of larger metastases to improve disease control. The infra-renal basin is an important anatomic site of metastasis" from pelvic tumors, and robotic dissection techniques for this site have been described. In recent years, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been adopted into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines' surgical algorithm for uterine and cervical cancers. SLN mapping has higher sensitivity for the detection of nodal metastasis, despite removing fewer lymph nodes, and potentially reduces morbidities such as lower extremity lymphedema. This article reviews current robotic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy dissection techniques for endometrial and cervical cancers and discusses the recent integration of pelvic SLN mapping in the surgical algorithm.

TI  - Optimizing Cruising Routes for Taxi Drivers Using a Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the taxi route-planning literature has focused on driver strategies for finding passengers and determining the hot spot pick-up locations using historical global positioning system (GPS) trajectories of taxis based on driver experience, distance from the passenger drop-off location to the next passenger pick-up location and the waiting times at recommended locations for the next passenger. The present work, however, considers the average taxi travel speed mined from historical taxi GPS trajectory data and the allocation of cruising routes to more than one taxi driver in a small-scale region to neighboring pick-up locations. A spatio-temporal trajectory model with load balancing allocations is presented to not only explore pick-up/drop-off information but also provide taxi drivers with cruising routes to the recommended pick-up locations. In simulation experiments, our study shows that taxi drivers using cruising routes recommended by our spatio-temporal trajectory model can significantly reduce the average waiting time and travel less distance to quickly find their next passengers, and the load balancing strategy significantly alleviates road loads. These objective measures can help us better understand spatio-temporal traffic patterns and guide taxi navigation.

TI  - An Improved Rotation Forest for Multi-Feature Remote-Sensing Imagery Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-feature, especially multi-temporal, remote-sensing data have the potential to improve land cover classification accuracy. However, sometimes it is difficult to utilize all the features efficiently. To enhance classification performance based on multi-feature imagery, an improved rotation forest, combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a boosting naive Bayesian tree (NBTree), is proposed. First, feature extraction was carried out with PCA. The feature set was randomly split into several disjoint subsets; then, PCA was applied to each subset, and new training data for linear extracted features based on original training data were obtained. These steps were repeated several times. Second, based on the new training data, a boosting naive Bayesian tree was constructed as the base classifier, which aims to achieve lower prediction error than a decision tree in the original rotation forest. At the classification phase, the improved rotation forest has two-layer voting. It first obtains several predictions through weighted voting in a boosting naive Bayesian tree; then, the first-layer vote predicts by majority to obtain the final result. To examine the classification performance, the improved rotation forest was applied to multi-feature remote-sensing images, including MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery time series, MODIS Surface Reflectance products and ancillary data in Shandong Province for 2013. The EVI imagery time series was preprocessed using harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) to reduce the noise effects. The overall accuracy of the final classification result was 89.17%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.71, which outperforms the original rotation forest and other classifier ensemble results, as well as the NASA land cover product. However, this new algorithm requires more computational time, meaning the efficiency needs to be further improved. Generally, the improved rotation forest has a potential advantage in remote-sensing classification.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, joint inversions of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Global Position System (GPS) measurements are used to investigate the source parameters of four Mw > 5 events of the 2016-2017 Central Italy earthquake sequence. The results show that the four events are all associated with a normal fault striking northwest-southeast and dipping southwest. The observations, in all cases, are consistent with slip on a rupture plane, with strike in the range of 157 degrees to 164 degrees and dip in the range of 39 degrees to 44 degrees that penetrates the uppermost crust to a depth of 0 to 8 km. The primary characteristics of these four events are that the 24 August 2016 Mw 6.2 Amatrice earthquake had pronounced heterogeneity of the slip distribution marked by two main slip patches, the 26 October 2016 Mw 6.1 Visso earthquake had a concentrated slip at 3-6 km, and the predominant slip of the 30 October 2016 Mw 6.6 Norcia earthquake occurred on the fault with a peak magnitude of 2.5 m at a depth of 0-6 km, suggesting that the rupture may have reached the surface, and the 18 January 2017 Mw 5.7 Campotosto earthquake had a large area of sliding at depth 3-9 km. The positive static stress changes on the fault planes of the latter three events demonstrate that the 24 August 2016 Amatrice earthquake may have triggered a cascading failure of earthquakes along the complex normal fault system in Central Italy.

TI  - Evaluation of Five Commonly Used Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for Multi-Temporal Aboveground Forest Carbon Storage Estimation
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric conditions will lead to the distortion of the ground radiance or reflectance recorded by satellite sensors which inevitably hampers the successful regional scale aboveground carbon density quantification which is critical to the understanding of forest contribution to the regional carbon cycles. Hence, the appropriate algorithms of atmospheric correction are necessary. The objective of this paper was to assess the utility of radiation correction algorithms for estimating aboveground forest carbon storage with the multi-temporal Landsat remote images(TM/OLI) and quantify the carbon storage in a forest plantation, and five atmospheric correction methods, two absolute modeling methods (6S, FLAASH), two absolute image-based methods (IACM, QUAC), and one relative method (PIF) were compared. Forest carbon storage was estimated using the viable biomass empirical statistical models. Parameters for the regression equation were determined by analyzing the relationship between the data of the selected vegetation indices derived from Landsat images and the field-measured data (height and diameter) using data from different tree stands in study area. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the carbon storage of Pinus massoniana forest derived from multi-temporal remote sensing images, we acquired the forest subcompartment survey data in 1997, 2002 and 2006 and conducted several field surveys in 2010 and 2013. Consequently, we found that the surface reflectance of Pinus massoniana forest decreased evidently after atmospheric correction in visible band, but the surface reflectance in nearinfrared band and shortwave-infrared band, as well as NDVIs had a significant increase. And different atmospheric correction models had significant different effects on the estimation of the carbon storage of Pinus massoniana forest. By studying the correlation between the field-measured data, the IACM-corrected and 6S-corrected MNDVI data were most suitable for estimating the carbon storage of Pinus massoniana forest in the study area, with an exponential regression model appeared to have the highest degree of agreement and the lowest relative error with the measured data. In addition, we also found that the relative error of NDVIs of Pinus massoniana forest in multi-temporal remote sensing images decreasd 85.16% after PIF correction, and the estimation accuracy of the forest carbon storage was improved simultaneously. The results suggested that more attentions should be paid to choose the appropriate atmospheric correction when remote sensing images were applied to quantitative analyzing and information collecting in field. And relative radiometric correction of remote sensing images is quite an important preprocessing technique, which can significantly improve the precision of the estimated results, especially in multi-temporal remote sensing monitoring. This study also confirmed that the combination of IACM and PIF could preferably reduce the atmosphere effect, which would be suitable for multi-temporal forest carbon storage estimation and other related quantitative remote sensing researches.

TI  - Spatial upscaling of green aboveground biomass derived from MODIS-based NDVI in arid and semiarid grasslands
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of green aboveground biomass is important for sustainable use of grassland resources in arid and semiarid grasslands. Nevertheless, it is difficult to achieve spatial upscaling of green aboveground biomass estimation using traditional spatial upscaling methods in arid and semiarid grasslands due to its inherent heterogeneity. In the study, a new spatial upscaling algorithm was proposed to estimate green aboveground biomass in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia. The algorithm was successfully employed for spatial upscaling of green aboveground biomass estimation from MOD13Q1 NDVI (fine resolution) to MOD13A2 NDVI (coarse resolution) based on field measurements in the desert steppe. Results showed that, the correlation between distributed green aboveground biomass (obtained from fine resolution) and lumped green aboveground biomass (obtained from coarse resolution) was improved, and root mean squared error and relative error decreased after upscaling. Statistical analyses performing on the slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines between distributed green aboveground biomass and lumped green aboveground biomass demonstrated that, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the fitted line and the 1:1 line after upscaling, and there was significant difference (P < 0.05) between the fitted line and the 1:1 line before upscaling. These indicated that, lumped green aboveground biomass after upscaling was much closer to distributed aboveground green biomass than lumped green aboveground biomass before upscaling. The algorithm proposed in the study could play an important role in large-scale green aboveground biomass investigation in arid and semiarid grasslands. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection for malignant foot melanoma.
T2  - Asian journal of endoscopic surgery
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 39 year-old woman with malignant foot melanoma underwent wide excision of the primary tumor with a safety margin and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for the right inguinal lymph node. SLNB was positive and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed right iliac lymph node swelling. Positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the lymph nodes revealed abnormal uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). We performed a laparoscopic pelvic lymph node obturator, iliac lymph node) dissection. During the operation, several black lymph nodes were observed in the iliac lymph node. Pathologically, the iliac lymph node consisted of metastasized atypical melanocytes. This surgical method for pelvic lymph node dissection is not a standard procedure among institutions. There have been no reported cases of malignant melanoma with pelvic lymph node metastasis treated by laparoscopic surgery. However, due to the minimally invasive technique, this method is worth considering to be used for pelvic lymph node dissection in malignant melanoma as well as other cancers in the field of urology or gynecology.

AB  - Breast cancer in male is rare, accounting for 1%of all breast cancers.Among male breast cancers, noninvasive carcinoma is extremely rare.We experienced a case of noninvasive carcinoma of the breast in a male.A 72-year-old male was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of the tumor and blood secretion from the left nipple.Mammography revealed a highdensity mass.Ultrasound examination revealed low echoic mass at the E area, and it measured 1.5 cm.Core needle biopsy failed to provide a definitive diagnosis, and we performed an excisional biopsy of the tumor.The pathological diagnosis was noninvasive ductal carcinoma.He underwent a mastectomy without sentinel lymph node biopsy because the resection margin was positive.The patient received no adjuvant therapy and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful for 1 year.As there have been few reports on male noninvasive ductal carcinoma, we do not have evidence for indication of the sentinel lymph nodes and postoperative adjuvant therapy such as tamoxifen.We may confuse the treatment policy.

TI  - Land use change characteristics affected by water saving practices in Manas River Basin, China using Landsat satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics and influencing factors of land use change under arid conditions were studied in the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang Region, Northwest China. Landsat satellite images acquired in 1976, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015 over the study area were used as basic data. Land use change, the rate of change of land use, land use transfer and other aspects revealed the characteristics of land use change and related factors as influenced by water conditions in the basin. The results showed that: (1) Over nearly 50 years, land reclamation in the Manas River Basin resulted in the rapid expansion of an artificial oasis area, and promoted the process of ` oasis urbanization', and accelerated the development of the river basin economy. (2) In 2000, the popularization of drip irrigation under mulch technology led to the rapid growth of cultivated land and development land in the watershed. Meanwhile, the water table declined in the desert area of the lower reaches of the river basin, and the area occupied by sparse shrub forest and grassland decreased. (3) Before popularization of water-saving technology, woodland, grassland and development land transformed to cultivated land in the amounts of 93.46 km2, 2542.93 km(2) and 137.53 km(2), respectively, and woodland transformed in the amount of 189.64 km(2). After water-saving technology was popularized, woodland, grassland and development land were transformed into cultivated land in the amounts of 567.41 km(2), 1756.2 km(2) and 37.36 km(2), respectively. (4) The popularization of water-saving technology made the dynamic degree of cultivated land and development land more active, and further increased landscape fragmentation and landscape heterogeneity. The level of urbanization development, the level of economic development and the dry humidity of the basin became the main factors affecting the change of land use in the basin.

TI  - The mSCOPE model: A simple adaptation to the SCOPE model to describe reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis of vertically
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical heterogeneity of leaf biophysical and biochemical properties may have a large effect on the bidirectional reflectance and fluorescence of vegetation canopies. This has implications for the interpretation of remote sensing data. We developed a model for light interaction and energy balance in vegetation canopies in which leaf biophysical and biochemical properties vary in the vertical. The model mSCOPE is an extension of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which simulates spectral and bidirectional reflectance, fluorescence, and photosynthesis of vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies. The modelling of radiative transfer in mSCOPE is based on the classical SAIL theory. A solution to the radiative transfer equation for multi-layer canopies is given, which allows calculating top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance and the flux profile. The latter is used for the simulation of fluorescence emission and photosynthesis of every leaf through the leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect and a biochemical model. The radiative transfer of fluorescence in multi-layer canopies is solved numerically in mSCOPE to obtain TOC bidirectional fluorescence. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties on TOC reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis is demonstrated by different scenarios with customized vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf water content, and also with measured vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content in corn canopies. A preliminary validation of the reflectance calculating routine of mSCOPE is conducted by comparing measured and simulated TOC reflectance spectra of the corn canopies. We conclude that it is important to consider the vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties for the prediction of reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis. The model mSCOPE could serve as a tool to better understand vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies.

TI  - An improved temperature vegetation dryness index (iTVDI) and its applicability to drought monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the dry season during 2010-2012 over the whole Yunnan Province, an improved temperature vegetation dryness index (iTVDI), in which a parabolic dry-edge equation replaces the traditional linear dry-edge equation, was developed, to reveal the regional drought regime in the dry season. After calculating the correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, and standard deviation between the iTVDI and observed topsoil moisture at 10 and 20 cm for seven sites, the effectiveness of the new index in depicting topsoil moisture conditions was verified. The drought area indicated by iTVDI mapping was then compared with the drought-affected area reported by the local government. The results indicated that the iTVDI can monitor drought more accurately than the traditional TVDI during the dry season in Yunnan Province. Using iTVDI facilitates drought warning and irrigation scheduling, and the expectation is that this new index can be broadly applied in other areas.

TI  - Model elucidating the sources and formation mechanisms of severe haze pollution over Northeast mega-city cluster in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies on regional haze pollution over China come up in general with strong variability of main causes of heavy polluted episodes, in linkage with local specificities, sources and pollution characteristics. This paper therefore aims at elucidating the main specific sources and formation mechanisms of observed strong haze pollution episodes over 1-15 November 2015 in Northeast region considered as one of biggest megacity clusters in China. The Northeast China mega-city cluster, including Heilong Jiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, is adjacent to Russia in the north, Mongolian at the west, North Korea at east, and representing key geographical location in the regional and transnational air pollution issues in China due to the presence of heavy industries and intense economic activities. The present study, based on air quality monitoring, remote sensing satellite data and sensitivity experiments carried on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS), quantitatively assesses the impact of meteorological conditions and potential contributions from regional chemical transport, intensive energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning emissions to PM2.5 concentration variation. The results indicate strong inversion occurrence at lower atmosphere with weak near-surface wind speed and high relative humidity, leading to PM2.5 concentration increase of about 30-50%. Intensive energy combustion (plausibly for heating activities) and illegal emission also significantly enhance the overall PM2.5 accumulation by 100-200 mu g m(-3) (60-70% increase), against 75-100 mu g m(-3) from the biomass burning under the northeast-southwest transport pathway, corresponding to a contribution of 10-20% to PM2.5 concentration increase. Obviously, stagnant meteorological conditions, energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning are main drivers of strong haze formation and spatial distribution over Northeast China megacity cluster. In clear, much effort on emission abatement at both local and regional scales is still an urgent imperative to overcome current critical haze pollution. (C) 2017 The Authors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complex characteristics of dust and sparse ground-based monitoring stations, dust monitoring is facing severe challenges, especially in dust storm-prone areas. Aim at constructing a high-precision dust storm detection model, a pixel database, consisted of dusts over a variety of typical feature types such as cloud, vegetation, Gobi and ice/snow, was constructed, and their distributions of reflectance and Brightness Temperatures (BT) were analysed, based on which, a new Simplified Dust Detection Algorithm (SDDA) for the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (NPP VIIRS) is proposed. NPP VIIRS images covering the northern China and Mongolian regions, where features serious dust storms, were selected to perform the dust detection experiments. The monitoring results were compared with the true colour composite images, and results showed that most of the dust areas can be accurately detected, except for fragmented thin dusts over bright surfaces. The dust ground-based measurements obtained from the Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System (MICAPS) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument Aerosol Index (OMI Al) products were selected for comparison purposes. Results showed that the dust monitoring results agreed well in the spatial distribution with OMI AI dust products and the MICAPS ground-measured data with an average high accuracy of 83.10%. The SDDA is relatively robust and can realize automatic monitoring for dust storms.

TI  - Diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cT1/T2N0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cT1/T2N0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) patients. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was performed by searching the Embase and PubMed databases for English language articles published up to December 2016. The pooled overall sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to evaluate the diagnostic value of SLNB which used neck dissection or follow-up as a reference test. The Q test and I (2) statistic were used to assess the heterogeneity across the studies. Subgroup analyses were performed in consideration of higher contribution of different clinical characteristics on the SLNB diagnostic value. Begg's linear regression and Egger's regression tests were conducted to evaluate the publication bias. Thirty-five studies (with 1084 patients) were included. The pooled SLN detection rate was 98% (95% CI 97-100%). The pooled overall sensitivity and NPV of SLNB were 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97), respectively. The subgroup analyses demonstrated that higher extracted number of patients (n ae<yen> 30) from the included studies achieved a more stable NPV than lower number of patients. SLNB can effectively predict the status of regional lymph nodes in cT1/T2N0 TSCC patients. With high sensitivity and NPV, SLNB can guide the treatment of SLNB-positive patients with neck dissections and those with negative SLNBs with follow-ups in order to avoid unnecessary surgical morbidity.

TI  - Enhanced Resolution of Microwave Sounder Imagery through Fusion with Infrared Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The images acquired by microwave sensors are blurry and have low resolution. On the other hand, the images obtained using infrared/visible sensors are often of higher resolution. In this paper, we develop a data fusion methodology and apply it to enhance the resolution of a microwave image using the data from a collocated infrared/visible sensor. Such an approach takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the infrared instrument and the sensing accuracy of the microwave instrument. The model leverages sparsity in signals and is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing. We tested our method using a precipitation scene captured with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) microwave instrument and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared instrument and compared the results to simultaneous radar observations. We show that the data fusion product is better than the original AMSU-B and AVHRR observations across all statistical indicators.

TI  - Comparison of summer chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration in the South China Sea and the Arabian Sea using remote sensing data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Sea (SCS) and the Arabian Sea (AS) are both located roughly in the north tropical zone with a range of similar latitude (0A degrees-24A degrees N). Monsoon winds play similar roles in the upper oceanic circulations of the both seas. But the distinct patterns of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration are observed between the SCS and the AS. The Chl a concentration in the SCS is generally lower than that in the AS in summer (June-August); the summer Chl a concentration in the AS shows stronger interannual variation, compared with that in the SCS; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived data present higher atmospheric aerosol deposition and stronger wind speed in the AS. And it has also been found that good correlations exist between the index of the dust precipitation indicated by aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the Chl a concentration, or between wind and Chl a concentration. These imply that the wind and the dust precipitation bring more nutrients into the AS from the sky, the sub-layer or coast regions, inducing higher Chl a concentration. The results indicate that the wind velocity and the dust precipitation can play important roles in the Chl a concentration for the AS and the SCS in summer. However aerosol impact is weak on the biological productivity in the west SCS and wind-induced upwelling is the main source.

TI  - Assessment of WorldView-3 Data for Lithological Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite is a new sensor with high spectral resolution, which equips eight multispectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and additional eight bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR). In order to meet the requirements of large-scale geological mapping, this paper assessed WV-3 data for lithological mapping in comparison with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Operational Land Imager (OLI/Landsat-8) data. The study area is located in the Pobei area of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where bedrock outcrops are widely distributed. The whole experiment was divided into six steps: data pre-processing, visual interpretation of various lithological units, samples procedure, lithological mapping by a support vector machine algorithm (SVM), accuracy evaluation, and assessment. The results showed that the classification accuracy of WV-3 data was 87%, which kept 17% higher than that of ASTER data, 14% higher than that of OLI/Landsat-8 data, indicated that WV-3 data contained more diagnostic absorption features mainly thanks to its SWIR bands, and benefited by its high spatial resolution, as well. However, it also confirmed that there were some considerable flaws, such as the confusing identification of biotite-quartz schist. Overall, the WV-3 data is still the most promising data for geological applications currently.

AB  - Imaging studies are essential components of tumor diagnosis, staging, assessing tumor response to neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, and postoperative surveillance on completion of definitive treatment. Treatment of early-stage clinically node-negative oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is controversial. Approximately 3% of all head and neck tumors arise within the parotid gland and most often within the superficial lobe, lateral to the facial nerve; approximately 80% are benign and most are pleomorphic adenoma. In patients with dry eyes failing multiple other treatment modalities and facing ongoing pain and loss of vision, microvascular transplant of the submandibular gland is a viable option.

TI  - The 2015-2016 Ground Displacements of the Shanghai Coastal Area Inferred from a Combined COSMO-SkyMed/Sentinel-1 DInSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, ground deformation of the Shanghai coastal area is inferred by using the multiple-satellite Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (DInSAR) approach, also known as the minimum acceleration (MinA) combination algorithm. The MinA technique allows discrimination and time-evolution monitoring of the inherent two-dimensional components (i.e., with respect to east-west and up-down directions) of the ongoing deformation processes. It represents an effective post-processing tool that allows an easy combination of preliminarily-retrieved multiple-satellite Line-Of-Sight-projected displacement time-series, obtained by using one (or more) of the currently available multi-pass DInSAR toolboxes. Specifically, in our work, the well-known small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm has been exploited to recover LOS deformation time-series from two sets of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data relevant to the coast of Shanghai, collected from 2014 to 2017 by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and the Sentinel-1A (S1-A) sensors. The achieved results evidence that the Shanghai ocean-reclaimed areas were still subject to residual deformations in 2016, with maximum subsidence rates of about 30 mm/year. Moreover, the investigation has revealed that the detected deformations are predominantly vertical, whereas the east-west deformations are less significant.

TI  - Significance of satellite sign and spot sign in predicting hematoma expansion in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Hematoma expansion is related to poor outcome in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Recently, a non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) based finding, termed the 'satellite sign', was reported to be a novel predictor for poor outcome in spontaneous ICH. However, it is still unclear whether the presence of the satellite sign is related to hematoma expansion.Material and methods: Initial computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted within 6 h after ictus. Satellite sign on non-enhanced CT and spot sign on CTA were detected by two independent reviewers. The sensitivity and specificity of both satellite sign and spot sign were calculated. Receiver-operator analysis was conducted to evaluate their predictive accuracy for hematoma expansion.Results: This study included 153 patients. Satellite sign was detected in 58 (37.91%) patients and spot sign was detected in 38 (24.84%) patients. Among 37 patients with hematoma expansion, 22 (59.46%) had satellite sign and 23 (62.16%) had spot sign. The sensitivity and specificity of satellite sign for prediction of hematoma expansion were 59.46% and 68.97%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of spot sign were 62.16% and 87.07%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of satellite sign was 0.642 and the AUC of spot sign was 0.746. (P = 0.157).Conclusion: Our results suggest that the satellite sign is an independent predictor for hematoma expansion in spontaneous ICH. Although spot sign has the higher predictive accuracy, satellite sign is still an acceptable predictor for hematoma expansion when CTA is unavailable.

TI  - Absolute water storages in the Congo River floodplains from integration of InSAR and satellite radar altimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplains delay the transport of water, dissolved matter and sediments by storing water during flood peak seasons. Estimation of water storage over the floodplains is essential to understand the water balances in the fluvial systems and the role of floodplains in nutrient and sediment transport. However, spatio-temporal variations of water storages over floodplains are not well known due to their remoteness, vastness, and high temporal variability. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate absolute water storages over the floodplains by establishing relations between water depths (d) and water volumes (V) using 2-D water depth maps from the integration of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and altimetry measurements. We applied this method over the Congo River floodplains and modeled the d V relation using a power function (note that d V indicates relation between d and V, not d minus V), which revealed the cross-section geometry of the floodplains as a convex curve. Then, we combined this d V relation and Envisat altimetry measurements to construct time series of floodplain's absolute water storages from 2002 to 2011. Its mean annual amplitude over the floodplains ( 7,777 km(2)) is 3.86 0.59 km(3) with peaks in December, which lags behind total water storage (TWS) changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and precipitation changes from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) by about one month. The results also exhibit inter-annual variability, with maximum water volume to be 5.9 0.72 km(3) in the wet year of 2002 and minimum volume to be 2.01 0.63 km(3) in the dry year of 2005. The inter-annual variation of water storages can be explained by the changes of precipitation from TRMM.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy status is not the most powerful predictor of prognosis in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status has been advocated in several recently published articles as the single most valuable prognostic marker for melanoma, and of greater prognostic importance than more established parameters such as Breslow thickness. A careful examination of the evidence for these claims, however, indicates that they are not substantiated by the available data, are somewhat misleading and suggest misinterpretation of the statistical analysis of the papers to which they refer. We will examine the basis for these claims and show why they are invalid.

TI  - Interaction between Merkel cell carcinoma and the immune system: Pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.
T2  - Molecular and clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. It usually appears on the face and neck of elderly Caucasian people as a flesh-colored, erythematous or violaceous dome-shaped, non-tender nodule with a smooth surface. In immunocompromised patients with T-cell dysfunction, such as patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or solid organ transplant recipients, the incidence of this disease is markedly increased. This suggests a link between the development of MCC and the immune system. Merkel cell polyolmavirus (MCPyV) is clonally integrated into the majority of MCCs, suggesting its causative role in the pathogenesis of the majority of these tumors. Despite wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and eventually, adjuvant radiation therapy, which remains the first-line treatment for MCC, the identification of MCPyV has opened novel therapeutic insights. Novel therapeutic strategies could be to inhibit MCPyV oncoproteins and to stimulate immune responses against virus-infected tumor cells by immunostimulatory cytokines, including interferons and interleukin-2.

TI  - An application of tree species classification using high-resolution remote sensing image based on the rough set theory
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature extraction is an essential task in the classification of high-resolution remote sensing images, with the primary technique being the object-oriented classification method. Current research describes object-oriented classification methods by using remote sensing data, wherein how to reduce the redundant feature information to achieve good classification results is the most challenging problem. The high-resolution remote sensing image is characteristic of a large amount of data and high feature dimensions, which also exist particularly in the forestry remote sensing. Feature information redundancy can reduce the extraction accuracy and make the classification results worse. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a framework that uses the rough set theory and the membership function to establish the classification rule set. In our approach, we first select an optimal segmentation scale to segment the remote sensing image with multi-scale and apply the rough set theory to reduce the feature dimensions of objects. We then use the selected features to establish classification rule set and classify image objects. This paper also presents a detailed study of the proposed framework for species classification with ALOS images, wherein 13 most effective feature parameters are selected from 34 feature parameters of objects, such as band ratio, brightness value, and average gray value. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework, applied to classify tree species, achieves a classification accuracy of 80.4509%, which is an improvement over both the classification accuracy of 77.2408% achieved with the traditional supervised classification and that of 75.5068% achieved with the nearest neighbor classification. The research proves that the proposed framework can effectively take advantage of tree species information in remote sensing images, and provides an auxiliary means for forest resources investigation and monitoring.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index Expanded from Web of Science was carried out to provide insights into research activities and trends of the environmental monitoring from 1993 to 2012. Study emphases covered publication outputs, language, categories, journals, countries/territories, institutions, words, and hot issues. The results indicated that the annual output of environmental monitoring publications increased steadily. The environmental sciences and analytical chemistry were the two most common categories. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment published the most articles. The USA and the UK ranked in the top two in terms of all five indicators. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. The synthesized analysis by words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus provided important clues for hot issues. Researchers paid more attention on water environment monitoring than other environmental factors. The contaminants including organic contaminants, heavy metal, and radiation were most common research focuses, and the organic contaminants and heavy metal of the degree of concern were gradually rising. Sensor and biosensor played an important role in the field of environmental monitoring devices. In addition to conventional device detection method, the remote sensing, GIS, and wireless sensor networks were the mainstream environmental monitoring methods. The international organization, social awareness, and the countries' positive and effective political and policies promoted the published articles.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Global Remote Sensing Research during 2010-2015
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index Expanded published by Thomson Scientific was carried out to identify the research status and future trends of remote sensing (RS) during 2010-2015. The analysis revealed the institutional, national, spatio-temporal, and categorical patterns in remote sensing research both from the WP (whole publications) viewpoint and the HCP (highly-cited publications) viewpoint. Statistical analysis results showed that remote sensing research almost doubled during 2010-2015. Environmental sciences comprised the most attractive subject category among remote sensing research. The International Journal of Remote Sensing was the most productive journal, and Remote Sensing of Environment published the most HCP among the 31 distributed journals. The productive ranking of countries was led by the U.S. both from the WP viewpoint and the HCP viewpoint, and CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences) was the most productive institute both from the WP viewpoint and the HCP viewpoint with lower CPP (average number of citations per paper). Keyword analysis illustrated that model and algorithm research were the key points in RS during 2010-2015. RS data including Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) were the most frequently adopted, but the data usage of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and small satellites will be promoted in the future. With the development of data acquisition abilities, big data issues will become the challenges and hotspots of RS research, and new algorithms will continue to emerge.

TI  - An evaluation of monthly impervious surface dynamics by fusing Landsat and MODIS time series in the Pearl River Delta, China, from 2000 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have been attending increasingly to impervious surface dynamics to better understand the urbanization process and its impacts on urban environments. Previously, numerous studies have only estimated and mapped impervious surface dynamics at annual or decadal time scales. It is challenging to estimate impervious surface dynamics at a finer time scale, such as on a monthly scale, while using a single source of medium spatial resolution satellite imagery. However, urban infrastructure construction could cause changes in impervious surfaces in a short period of time. This paper aimed at developing a new methodology for evaluating monthly impervious surface dynamics by fusing Landsat and MODIS time series. The Pearl River Delta in China, is located in a humid subtropical region and was selected as the study area due to its dramatic urbanization in the past three decades. Available Landsat images with cloud cover < 90%, 7-Day MODIS NDVI 250 m smooth time series, and daily MODIS LST 1000 m time series from 2000 to 2015 were downloaded. These data were used to develop temporal features of land covers (i.e., monthly Landsat NDVI and LST time series) and to monitor impervious surface dynamics using semi-supervised time series fuzzy clustering method. The results showed the effectiveness of temporal features in differentiating land covers. Additionally, the average overall classification accuracy yielded reasonable accuracies (up to 89.36%). The proposed methodology has illustrated numerous, considerable advantages over previous methods. It has offered consistent maps of impervious surfaces on a monthly time scale as well as enhanced distinguishability of land covers with similar spectral characteristics. This study can be utilized to establish relationships between urban expansion, climate change, urban environment, population, and other socio-economic variables on a monthly basis. The study is also crucial for predicting the timing, duration, and density of ecological change for increased impervious surfaces.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Spatiotemporal Variations in Evapotranspiration over Northeast China during 1982-2010
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical process for the climate system and water cycles. However, the spatiotemporal variations in terrestrial ET over Northeast China over the past three decades calculated from sparse meteorological point-based data remain large uncertain. In this paper, a recently proposed modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor (MS-PT) algorithm was applied to estimate ET of Northeast China during 1982-2010. Validation results show that the square of the correlation coefficients (R-2) for the six flux tower sites varies from 0.55 to 0.88 (p < 0.01), and the mean root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.92 mm/d. The ET estimated by MS-PT has an annual mean of 441.14 +/- 18 mm/year in Northeast China, with a decreasing trend from southeast coast to northwest inland. The ET also shows in both annual and seasonal linear trends over Northeast China during 1982-2010, although this trend seems to have ceased after 1998, which increased on average by 12.3 mm per decade pre-1998 (p < 0.1) and decreased with large interannual fluctuations post-1998. Importantly, our analysis on ET trends highlights a large difference from previous studies that the change of potential evapotranspiration (PET) plays a key role for the change of ET over Northeast China. Only in the western part of Northeast China does precipitation appear to be a major controlling influence on ET.

TI  - An Evaluation of Four MODIS Collection 6 Aerosol Products in a Humid Subtropical Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely used to characterize the temporal variations and spatial distributions of atmospheric aerosols. In the present study, we evaluate the performance of four Terra and Aqua MODIS Collection 6 (C6) quality assured AOD products in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, a humid subtropical region. The 10 km AOD products retrieved by the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms, the merged DT/DB (DTDB) 10 km product, and the DT 3 km AOD product were obtained for 2006-2015. These products were compared with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, and with each other. The Terra- and Aqua-derived AODs are quantitatively similar. However, there are significant differences among the four AOD products. The DT 10 km product correlates more closely with AERONET AOD observations than does the DB 10 km product. The latter tends to underestimate the AOD, whereas the former typically overestimates it for highly urbanized areas. The DTDB 10 km product is mainly derived from the DT 10 km product; it does not provide a gap-filled data set, because valid DB 10 km retrievals are not included in the merged product even when DT 10 km retrievals are unavailable. Therefore, the DT/DB merging protocol should be improved. The DT 3 km AOD product closely mimics the DT 10 km product; however, it contains fewer data than the DT 10 km product over water-contaminated areas. In addition, although the quality assured AOD products are recommended for use in quantitative applications by the MODIS aerosol science team, the sampling frequency of these products is generally lower than 25%. Thus, the sampling issues of these products should be considered in humid subtropical areas.

TI  - A Strategy of Rapid Extraction of Built-Up Area Using Multi-Seasonal Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Band 10 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, studies have focused more attention on surface feature extraction using thermal infrared remote sensing (TIRS) as supplementary materials. Innovatively, in this paper, using three-date (winter, early spring, and end of spring) TIRS Band 10 images of Landsat-8, we proposed an empirical normalized difference of a seasonal brightness temperature index (NDSTI) for enhancing a built-up area based on the contrast heat emission seasonal response of a built-up area to solar radiation, and adopted a decision tree classification method for the rapidly accurate extraction of the built-up area. Four study areas, including one major experimental study area (Tangshan) and three verification areas (Minqin, Laizhou, and Yugan) in different climate zones, respectively, were used to empirically establish the overall strategy system, then we specified constrained conditions of this strategy. Moreover, we compared the NDSTI to the current built-up indices, respectively, for extracting the built-up area. The results showed that (1) the new index (NDSTI) exploited the seasonal thermal characteristic variation between the built-up area and other covers in the time series analysis, helping achieve more accurate built-up area extraction than other spectral indices; (2) this strategy could effectively realize rapid built-up area extraction with generally satisfied overall accuracy (over 80%), and was especially excellent in Tangshan and Laizhou; however, (3) it may be constrained by climate patterns and other surface characteristics, which need to be improved from the view of the results of Minqin and Yugan. In summary, the method developed in this study has the potential and advantage to extract the built-up area rapidly from the multi-seasonal thermal infrared remote sensing data. It could be an operative tool for long-term monitoring of built-up areas efficiently and for more applications of thermal infrared images in the future.

TI  - Biophysical and socioeconomic determinants of tea expansion: Apportioning their relative importance for sustainable land use policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea expansion, a typical process of regional land use and cover change (LUCC), has raised great concerns on regional sustainability. In this regard, exploring the determinants of tea expansion should provide critical implications for land use policy. It has been widely recognized that LUCC interacts nonlinearly with a set of determinants and their feedbacks should be rather complex. Policy makers are now facing the challenge to identify, apportion, and compare the determinants of regional tea expansion for designing more targeted political intervenes. Our paper utilizes a robust tool, the random forest (RF) regression in particular, to explore the determinants of tea expansion across two periods (1985-2007 and 2007-2016) in Anji County, a typical region of tea production in subtropical China. More specifically, tea is extracted from Landsat imageries and total tea cultivated area acts as the dependent variable. Exploratory variables include 38 potential determinants and these determinants are divided into two categories (biophysical and socioeconomic) at two levels (pixel and village). We obtain some similar findings, though the relative importance of determinants varies with the two periods. In general, biophysical determinants (e.g., topography, soil type, land use in the neighborhood) present greater relative importance than the socioeconomic determinants in both periods. In period 1985-2007, biophysical determinants at pixel level are more essential in governing tea expansion. In period 2007-2016, the relative importance of pixel level biophysical determinants is comparable with that of the village level determinants. Comparisons of the two periods indicate that relative importance of soil type and socioeconomic proximity becomes greater in period 2007-2016, while that of the total employees and non-agricultural population proportion becomes lower. Partial dependency plots are further drawn to visualize the marginal effect of each determinant. We finally propose three options for land use policy towards sustainability. Our study demonstrates that the RF regression is efficient for policy makers to understand the determinants of tea expansion with a nonlinear and complex nature.

TI  - Analysis of Dynamic Spatiotemporal Changes in Actual Evapotranspiration and Its Associated Factors in the Pearl River Basin Based on MOD16
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is an important part of the hydrological cycle, surface energy balance and global climate system. Due to spatial heterogeneity, the trends in actual evapotranspiration (ET) and its associated factors vary in different regions. Because direct measurements of ET are limited over large areas, remote sensing provides an efficient method of ET spatial analysis, and standard data products are available at the global scale. This study uses the monthly MOD16 ET dataset and daily meteorological data to analyze the dynamic spatiotemporal changes in ET and its associated factors in the Pearl River Basin (PRB) from 2000 to 2014. The results of the study are as follows. (1) Over time and space, annual ET exhibited a slight increasing trend from 2000 to 2014, with an average value of approximately 946.56 mm/a. ET considerably varied at the monthly and seasonal scales, and in July displayed the highest monthly ET of approximately 119.57 mm, accounting for 36.37% of the annual ET. (2) ET displayed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, the west was a low-ET region, and moderate and high ET values were interspersed in the central and eastern PRB. Moreover, the rate of change of ET ranged from -13.99 mm/a to 12.81 mm/a in space, and 46.25% of the basin exhibited an increasing trend. (3) Dynamic changes in ET were mainly associated with temperature and relative humidity (RH). Additionally, energy-related elements and wind speed were positively correlated with ET, and temperature was the most influential factor of ET in some months (February-March and September-November). RH was the most important factor in other months but negatively correlated with ET in June and July. Affected by the actual environmental condition, qualitative changes were observed in the correlation between RH and ET in different months. The positive and negative spatial correlations between ET and its associated factors changed in different regions and in different months, and the changes mainly occurred from northwest to southwest.

TI  - The online measured black carbon aerosol and source orientations in the Nam Co region, Tibet
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentrations were measured by an aethalometer (AE-31) in the Nam Co, central Tibet from 2010 to 2014. Different from previous filter-sampling studies (Ming et al., J Environ Sci 22(11):1748-1756, 2010; Zhao et al., Environ Sci Pollut Res 20:5827-5838, 2013), the first high-resolution online eBC measurement conducted in central Tibet is reported here, allowing to discuss the diurnal variations as well as seasonal variabilities of eBC. Average daily eBC concentration was 74 +/- 50 ng/m(3), reflecting a global background level. Meteorological conditions influenced eBC concentrations largely at seasonal scale, which are higher in February-May but lower in June-January. The highest eBC concentrations (greater than 210 ng/m(3)) were more associated with the W and WSW winds smaller than 6 m/s. The diurnal variations of eBC showed plateaus from 10:00 to 15:00 with seasonal variations, associated with local anthropogenic activities, such as indigenous Tibetan burning animal waste and tourism traffic. The PBLHs showed a co-variance with eBC concentrations, implicating close sources. The aerosol optical depths derived from the MODIS data over the Nam Co Observatory Station (NCOS)-included sub-area (30A degrees N-40A degrees N, 90A degrees E-100A degrees E) showed significant relationship with eBC concentrations. This suggests that nearby or short-distance sources other than long-distance transported pollutants could be important contributors to eBC concentrations at the NCOS, different from the conclusions suggested by previous studies.

TI  - Urban green effects on land surface temperature caused by surface characteristics: A case study of summer Beijing metropolitan region
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pace of urbanization in China has increased in recent decades. Accordingly, the urbanized area has expanded at a spectacular rate and the urban heat island (UHI) has intensified. Understanding the effects of the landscape pattern on the UHI is crucial for optimizing urban structure, which could mitigate the UHI. This study focused on green cover in an urban area. To investigate how the composition and configuration of urban green patches would affect their temperature in Beijing metropolitan region, China, especially the influence of the configuration of green patches on their cooling effect, the relationships between green surface temperature (GST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized compactness index (NCI) were investigated by regression analyses, and a method to quantify the cooling effect of greens derived from the urban cool island and green space cool island was proposed. The image from the Landsat Thermal Infrared Sensor was used to estimate GST, and three images from the GF-2 Panchromatic & Multispectral Camera were used to obtain NDVI and calculate NCI. Our results showed that both NDVI and NCI had negative relationships to GST in summer, but only NCI strongly influenced the spatial cooling effect of greens. The further exploration of the influence of NCI on the cooling effect showed the NCI was negatively correlated to the cooling effect, which indicated that, for a given area, more compact green patches reduce the extent of the cooling effect.

TI  - Analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of landscape patterns and hemeroby index of the Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, over the last 40 years.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are an important part of ecological systems. Wetlands not only provide the survival habitats and resources for plants, animals, and human but also are highly beneficial for the environment. In arid zones in particular, wetlands have received considerable scientific attention. The hemeroby index provides a measure of the magnitude to which the vegetation of an ecological environment deviates from the natural state as a consequence of human activities. It is beneficial to manage rationally for economic development in order to protect the ecological environment. The present study fills a gap in our understanding of the sustainable development of the wetland ecosystem in the Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. A hemeroby. type classification system for the Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve was established based on multiple datasets, including Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI image data obtained in 1972, 1998, 2007, and 2013. The study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of hemeroby and the landscape pattern response through hemeroby, landscape pattern, spatial patch, and GIS spatial analyses in the study area. The following results were obtained: (1) From 1972 to 2013, the ecological hemeroby degree for the Ebinur Lake wetland showed a relatively stable trend; however, there were marked changes in its spatial distribution. The distribution of the partially disturbed type of wetland has obviously changed. This indicates that the degree of naturalness of wetland vegetation is unstable and susceptible to human interference in this area. There was a high conversion rate of different hemeroby index (HI) types from 1972 to 2013. Dynamic changes in hemeroby degree are more likely to be attributed to natural, human, and policy. driven forces that result in a comprehensive effect. During the period 1972-2013, changes in natural factors (mean annual evaporation, temperature, and precipitation) and human factors (livestock, population, and GDP) led to change in the distribution of vegetation and Ebinur Lake area, which influenced the degree of naturalness of the ecological system. (2) During the period 1972-2013, there were significant increases in four landscape pattern indices, edge density (ED), mean shape index (MSI), area. weighted mean patch fractal dimension index (AWMPFD), and landscape division (DIVISION). However, in 2013, the regional landscape index was relatively stable. (3) High values of ED and AWMPFD were recorded for areas with a high HI. This shows that landscape patch fragmentation and complexity is higher in areas with a high HI, and that the degree of naturalness is unstable. Low values of patch fragmentation and complexity are mainly concentrated in areas with a low HI. This indicates that landscape pattern indices and the HI have good consistency and correlation with regard to spatial distribution. The HI was positively correlated with DIVISION, AWMPFD, MSI, Shannon's diversity index, patch richness density, and ED, in a decreasing order of influence. Evaluation of the ecological environment of the Ebinur Lake region provides a practical reference for the protection of the natural environment and resources, and will prove beneficial for the coordinated management of the environmental for sustainable development.

TI  - Potential of Estimating Surface Soil Moisture With the Triangle-Based Empirical Relationship Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a key state variable in controlling land surface energy balance and hydrological process. Based on the mechanism behind land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation index (VI) triangle space, an empirical relationship model has been proposed for SSM estimation with LST, NDVI, and surface albedo, and it has been applied in downscaling the coarse resolution microwave soil moisture product. In this paper, three soil moisture observation networks (REMEDHUS, MAQU, and MURRUMBIDGEE) were selected to evaluate the performance of this model at different climate and land cover conditions with in situ soil moisture measurements and Landsat satellite observations. According to the estimation results from different days for each network, it was found that the model was able to capture SSM variation with a satisfied accuracy [overall root-mean-squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.025 to 0.055 m(3)/m(3)], and the R-2 can reach 0.9 on some individual days. However, the performance has high daily variability with some poor ones. The reason is partly attributed to the high sensitivity of the coefficients of the model to the variation degrees of the input LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and SSM. Meanwhile, the spatial scale differences between the point measurement and satellite footprint observation are another important issue. To improve the model performance, a new relationship model was proposed by introducing the modified normalized difference water index, and the estimation results had a pronounced improvement (overall RMSE ranging from 0.021 to 0.049 m(3)/m(3)) compared with the previous model. The application effect of the proposed model showed that the model coefficient calibration accuracy greatly determined the uncertainty level of the estimation results.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Method Based on Relationship Between Objects of Cloud and Cloud-Shadow for Chinese Moderate to High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection of satellite imagery is very important for quantitative remote sensing research and remote sensing applications. However, many satellite sensors do not have enough bands for a quick, accurate, and simple detection of clouds. Particularly, the newly launched moderate to high spatial resolution satellite sensors of China, such as the charge-coupled device on-board the Chinese Huan Jing 1 (HJ-1/CCD) and the wide field of view (WFV) sensor on-board the Gao Fen 1 (GF-1), only have four available bands including blue, green, red, and near infrared bands, which are far from the requirements of most could detection methods. In order to solve this problem, an improved and automated cloud detection method for Chinese satellite sensors called object-oriented cloud and cloud-shadow matching method (OCM) is presented in this paper. It first modified the automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) method, which was developed for Landsat-7 data, to get an initial cloud map. The modified ACCA method is mainly based on threshold and different threshold settings produce different cloud maps. Subsequently, a strict threshold is used to produce a cloud map with high confidence and large amount of cloud omission and a loose threshold is used to produce a cloud map with low confidence and large amount of commission. Second, a corresponding cloud-shadow map is also produced using the threshold of near-infrared band. Third, the cloud maps and cloud-shadow map are transferred to cloud objects and cloud-shadow objects. Cloud and cloud-shadow are usually in pairs; consequently, the final cloud and cloud-shadow maps are made based on the relationship between cloud and cloud-shadow objects. The OCM method was tested using almost 200 HJ-1/CCD and GF-1/WFV images across China and the overall accuracy of cloud detection is close to 90%.

TI  - Mapping Radar Glacier Zones and Dry Snow Line in the Antarctic Peninsula Using Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface snowmelt causes changes in mass and energy balance, and endangers the stabilities of the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). The dynamic changes of the snow and ice conditions in the AP were observed by Sentinel-1 images with a spatial resolution of 40 m in this study. Snowmelt detected by the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) is used to study the relationship between summer snowmelt and winter synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter. Radar glacier zones (RGZs) classifications were conducted based on their differences in liquid snow content, snow grain size, and the relative elevations. We developed a practical method based on the simulations of a microwave scattering model to classify RGZs by using Sentinel-1 images in the AP. The summer snowmelt detected by SSM/I and Sentinel-1 data are compared between 2014 and 2015. The SSM/I-derived melting days is used to validate the winter dry snow line (DSL). RGZs derived from Sentinel-1 images suggest that snowmelt expanded from inland of the Larsen C Ice Shelf to the coastal area, whereas an opposite direction was found in the George VI Ice Shelf. The long melting season in the grounding zone of the Larsen C Ice Shelf may result from the adiabatically-dried fohn winds on the east side of the AP. As the uppermost limit of summer snowmelt, DSL was mapped based on the winter Sentinel-1 mosaic of the AP. Compared with the SSM/I-derived melting days, the winter DSL mainly distributed in the areas melted for one to three days in summer. DSL elevations on the Palmer Land increased from south to north.

TI  - Characterizing Drought and Flood Events over the Yangtze River Basin Using the HUST-Grace2016 Solution and Ancillary Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimation is important to evaluate the situation of the water resources over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). This study exploits the TWS observation from the new temporal gravity field model, HUST-Grace2016 (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), which is developed by a new low-frequency noise processing strategy. A novel GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) post-processing approach is proposed to enhance the quality of the TWS estimate, and the improved TWS is used to characterize the drought and flood events over the YRB. The HUST-Grace2016-derived TWS presents good agreement with the CSR (Center for Space Research) mascon solution as well as the PCR-GLOBWB (PCRaster Global Water Balance) hydrological model. Particularly, our solution provides remarkable performance in identifying the extreme climate events e.g., flood and drought over the YRB and its sub-basins. The comparison between GRACE-derived TWS variations and the MODIS-derived (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) inundated area variations is then conducted. The analysis demonstrates that the terrestrial reflectance data can provide an alternative way of cross-comparing and validating TWS information in Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and 0.70, respectively. In contrast, the correlation is only 0.10 for Tai Lake, indicating the limitation of cross-comparison between MODIS and GRACE data. In addition, for the first time, the NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) vertical velocity data is incorporated with GRACE TWS in the exploration of the climate-induced hydrological activities. The good agreement between non-seasonal NCEP/NCAR vertical velocities and non-seasonal GRACE TWSs is found in flood years (2005, 2010, 2012 and 2016) and drought years (2006, 2011 and 2013). The evidence shown in this study may contribute to the analysis of the mechanism of climate impacts on the YRB.

TI  - Sentinel Modular Program for Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Analyses <i>Application to Glyburide</i>, <i>Glipizide</i>, <i>and Serious Hypoglycemia</i>
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel is a program sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration to monitor the safety of medical products. We conducted a cohort assessment to evaluate the ability of the Sentinel Propensity Score Matching Tool to reproduce in an expedited fashion the known association between glyburide (vs. glipizide) and serious hypoglycemia. Thirteen data partners who contribute to the Sentinel Distributed Database participated in this analysis. A pretested and customizable analytic program was run at each individual site. De-identified summary results from each data partner were returned and aggregated at the Sentinel Operations Center. We identified a total of 198,550 and 379,507 new users of glyburide and glipizide, respectively. The incidence of emergency department visits and hospital admissions for serious hypoglycemia was 19 per 1000 personyears (95% confidence interval = 17.9, 19.7) for glyburide users and 22 (21.6, 22.7) for glipizide users. In cohorts matched by propensity score based on predefined variables, the hazard ratio (HR) for glyburide was 1.36 (1.24, 1.49) versus glipizide. In cohorts matched on a high-dimensional propensity score based on empirically selected variables, for which the program ran to completion in five data partners, the HR was 1.49 (1.31, 1.70). In cohorts matched on propensity scores based on both predefined and empirically selected variables via the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm (the same five data partners), the HR was 1.51 (1.32, 1.71). These findings are consistent with the literature, and demonstrate the ability of the Sentinel Propensity Score Matching Tool to reproduce this known association in an expedited fashion.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment on Multiple Timescale Features and Dynamics of Sea Surface Suspended Sediment Concentration Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind-waves, tidal currents, and some other dynamic factors dominate the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) variations in shallow seas and it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the effects of individual dynamic factors on SSC modulation. This work used the long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the high temporal-resolution Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) remote sensing data to quantify the sea surface SSC variations on multiple timescales (intratidal, spring-neap, seasonal, and long-term timescales) in the Bohai Sea, and further quantitatively evaluated the effects of corresponding dynamic factors on the SSC modulation. The results indicated that the monsoon associated wind-waves and stratification played the most important role in modulating SSC, with seasonal SSC variation of 8.1 mg/L in the Bohai Sea. The intratidal current variations played the secondary important role, causing SSC variation of 5.8 mg/L. The spring-neap tidal current variations led to SSC variation of 3.1 mg/L in the Bohai Sea. In the long run (2003-2014), the SSC of the Bohai Sea decreased slightly with SSC variation of 2.8 mg/L (decline rate: 0.23 mg/L/year), which may be caused by the weakening wind, decreasing sediment load from the Yellow River or the massive reclamation in recent decades. Probably due to the topography, sea bed sediment grain size and river plume, SSC variations in the southern Bohai Sea were more pronounced than those in the northern Bohai Sea.

TI  - A Fast Cloud Detection Algorithm Applicable to Monitoring and Nowcasting of Daytime Cloud Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Japanese geostationary satellite Himawari-8 provides two more visible, three more near-infrared, and six more infrared channels than the only one visible and four infrared channels available from the previous geostationary imager instruments. By taking advantage of AHI's newly added channels 1, 3, and 4 with wavelengths centered at 0.46, 0.64, and 0.86 mu m, respectively, a fast cloud detection algorithm is developed. Since the spectral differences of the reflectance between any two of AHI's channels 1, 3, and 4 over clouds are smaller than those over land and ocean, a visible-based cloud index (VCI) for daytime cloud detection can thus be defined by the root mean square of the three differences between any two of these three channels. An AHI pixel is identified as cloudy if the VCI is smaller than a threshold, which has different values over ocean and land. Cloud detection is further adjusted by a bias correction using AHI channels 7 and 13. The average accuracy of the proposed simple cloud detection is comparable with those obtained from a more complicated cloud mask algorithm involving not only more channels but also model simulations. It is also found that the bias correction is needed mostly over cirrus clouds and Gobi.

TI  - Thermal Remote Sensing for Moisture Content Monitoring of Mine Tailings: Laboratory Study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining produces massive volumes of mine tailings that are deposited into large-scale mine tailings impoundments. A key environmental objective of managing these large impoundments is mitigating fugitive dust emissions by monitoring and controlling moisture, because moisture directly affects the tailings' strength and the ability to apply dust control measures using motorized equipment. Therefore, understanding the spatial and temporal variations in moisture content for surface tailings is critical for characterizing dust susceptibility and trafficability. Remote sensing has been proven to be a useful tool for similar applications. This study utilized laboratory testing conducted on iron mine tailings to verify that: (1) a relationship exists between moisture content and strength for the surface of mine tailings, and (2) thermal remote sensing can be used to infer spatial variations in moisture content for surface tailings. Multivariate regressions were developed to identify the critical remote sensing and climatic variables and evaluate their influence in remotely measured moisture content. For tailings samples collected from two different North American iron mines, regressions using sample temperature and ambient humidity were able to predict surface moisture content (R-2 > 0.9).

TI  - Associations between meteorological parameters and influenza activity in a subtropical country: Case of five sentinel sites in Yaounde-Cameroon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is associated with highly contagious respiratory infections. Previous research has found that influenza transmission is often associated with climate variables especially in temperate regions. This study was performed in order to fill the gap of knowledge regarding the relationship between incidence of influenza and three meteorological parameters (temperature, rainfall and humidity) in a tropical setting. This was a retrospective study performed in Yaounde-Cameroon from January 2009 to November 2015. Weekly proportions of confirmed influenza cases from five sentinel sites were considered as dependent variables, whereas weekly values of mean temperature, average relative humidity and accumulated rainfall were considered as independent variables. A univariate linear regression model was used in determining associations between influenza activity and weather covariates. A time-series method was used to predict on future values of influenza activity. The data was divided into 2 parts; the first 71 months were used to calibrate the model, and the last 12 months to test for prediction. Overall, there were 1173 confirmed infections with influenza virus. Linear regression analysis showed that there was no statistically significant association observed between influenza activity and weather variables. Very weak relationships (-0.1 < r < 0.1) were observed. Three prediction models were obtained for the different viral types (overall positive, Influenza A and Influenza B). Model 1 (overall influenza) and model 2 (influenza A) fitted well during the estimation period; however, they did not succeed to make good forecasts for predictions. Accumulated rainfall was the only external covariate that enabled good fit of both models. Based on the stationary R-2, 29.5% and 41.1% of the variation in the series can be explained by model 1 and 2, respectively. This study laid more emphasis on the fact that influenza in Cameroon is characterized by year-round activity. The meteorological variables selected in this study did not enable good forecast of future influenza activity and certainly acted as proxies to other factors not considered, such as, UV radiation, absolute humidity, air quality and wind.

TI  - A comparative study of digital PCR and real-time qPCR for the detection and quantification of HPV mRNA in sentinel lymph nodes of cervical cancer patients.
T2  - BMC research notes
M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Qualitative analyses showed that the presence of HPV mRNA in sentinel lymph nodes of cervical cancer patients with pN0 status is associated with significantly decreased recurrence free survival. To further address the clinical potential of the strategy and to define prognostic threshold levels it is necessary to use a quantitative assay. Here, we compare two methods of quantification: digital PCR and standard quantitative PCR.METHODS: Serial dilutions of 5ng-5pg RNA (≙ 500-0.5 cells) of the cervical cancer cell line SiHa were prepared in 5g RNA of the HPV-negative human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Clinical samples consisted of 10 sentinel lymph nodes with varying HPV transcript levels. Reverse transcription of total RNA (5g RNA each) was performed in 100l and cDNA aliquots were analyzed by qPCR and dPCR. Digital PCR was run in the RainDrop Digital PCR system (RainDance Technologies) using a probe-based detection of HPV E6/E7 cDNA PCR products with 11l template. qPCR was done using a Rotor Gene Q 5plex HRM (Qiagen) amplifying HPV E6/E7 cDNA in a SYBR Green format with 1l template.RESULTS: For the analysis of both, clinical samples and serial dilution samples, dPCR and qPCR showed comparable sensitivity. With regard to reproducibility, both methods differed considerably, especially for low template samples. Here, we found with qPCR a mean variation coefficient of 126% whereas dPCR enabled a significantly lower mean variation coefficient of 40% (p=0.01). Generally, we saw with dPCR a substantial reduction of subsampling errors, which most likely reflects the large cDNA amounts available for analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to real-time PCR, dPCR shows higher reliability. Thus, our HPV mRNA dPCR assay holds promise for the clinical evaluation of occult tumor cells in histologically tumor-free lymph nodes in future studies.

TI  - Arctic Mackenzie Delta channel planform evolution during 1983-2013 utilising Landsat data and hydrological time series
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic deltas, such as the Mackenzie Delta, are expected to face major climate change and increased human influence in the near future. Deltas are characterised by highly dynamic fluvial processes, and changing climate will cause considerable evolution of the riverine environment. The changes are difficult to predict with existing knowledge and data. This study quantified channel planform change of the Mackenzie Delta (1983-2013), analysing its temporal and spatial patterns. We addressed the main obstacle of research on large remote areas, the lack of data, by developing a unique work flow that utilised Landsat satellite imagery, hydrological time series, remote sensing-based change analysis, and automatic vectorisation of channels. Our results indicate that the Mackenzie Delta experienced constant evolution but at a highly varying rate over the 30years. The study demonstrates that the magnitude and duration of flood peaks and the presence of spring ice breakup floods determine the rate of Arctic delta planform change. Changing winter conditions and spring flood magnitudes may therefore affect the stability of Arctic deltas. However, no clear trends towards decreased recurrence or magnitude of spring floods or increased instability of the delta plain have yet been observed in the Mackenzie Delta. The delta plain was most dynamic at the beginning and at the end of the examined period, corresponding to intense flooding, whereas the rates of change were subtle during the low-flood period 1994-2007. The largest changes have occurred along the wide Middle Channel and in the outermost delta. Relative to their size, however, smaller meandering channels have been highly dynamic. Hotspots of change in the delta plain are located in anastomosing and braiding channel segments and, at the local scale, in point bars and cut-banks along meandering channels. Our study describes how Landsat satellite data can be utilised for advancing fluvial geomorphological research in remote areas. However, cloudiness in the delta restricts production of dense time series with simultaneous coverage of the whole area and requires manual preprocessing.

TI  - Retrievals of all-weather daytime land surface temperature from FengYun-2D data
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the interaction of the land-atmosphere system. Nevertheless, on the regional scale, the actual weather is cloudy for half a year in most regions. Therefore, receiving all-weather LST from thermal-infrared remote sensing is necessary and urgent. In this paper, an approach with multi-temporal and spatial neighboring-pixels in combination with diurnal solar radiation and surface temperature evolution is proposed to estimate daytime all-weather LST using FY-2D data. Evaluation of the accuracy of the algorithm is performed against the simulated data and the in situ measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and estimated LSTs under cloud-free conditions is approximately 1.84 K for the simulated data, while the RMSE of LST under cloud-free conditions varies from 3.42 to 5.1 K for the in situ measurement, and RMSE of LST under cloudy sky is approximately 7 K. The results indicate that the new algorithm is practical for retrieving the daytime all-weather LST at high-temporal resolution without any auxiliary field measurement, although some uncertainties exist.

TI  - On the Short-term Grounding Zone Dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, Observed With COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using radar satellite data from the Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation and the German TanDEM-X formation, we present comprehensive measurements of the biweekly grounding line dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, from August to December 2015. The 1 day repeat cycle of CSK reveals tidally induced, grounding line migration on the scale of kilometers and extensive seawater intrusion within the grounding zone, which significantly exceeds that predicted for a stiff bed but are consistent with that calculated for a deformable bed. The deformable bed also explains the continuous draining/filling of subglacial lakes proximal to the grounding line. After correction for oceanic tides, we estimate a retreat rate for 2011-2015 of 0.3 km/yr at the glacier center and 0.5 km/yr on the sides, which is 3 times slower than for 1994-2011 (1.2 km/yr at the center). We attribute the decrease in retreat rate to colder ocean conditions in 2012-2013 relative to 2000-2011.Plain Language Summary Using short-term repeat satellite data from the Italian CSK constellation, we document significant tidal migration of the junction between ice and the ocean on the Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, which is the largest contributor to sea level rise from Antarctica. The results imply that the junction is not fixed but corresponds to a zone several kilometers wide where ocean water melts ice from below. At present, numerical models of ice flow do not account for a flush zone. The existence of a flush zone should make the glacier more prone to retreat in response to warmer ocean waters.

TI  - Estimation of both optical and nonoptical surface water quality parameters using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and statistical techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional surface water quality assessment is costly, labor intensive, and time consuming; however, remote sensing has the potential to assess surface water quality because of its spatiotemporal consistency. Therefore, estimating concentrations of surface water quality parameters (SWQPs) from satellite imagery is essential. Remote sensing estimation of nonoptical SWQPs, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen (DO), has not yet been performed because they are less likely to affect signals measured by satellite sensors. However, concentrations of nonoptical variables may be correlated with optical variables, such as turbidity and total suspended sediments, which do affect the reflected radiation. In this context, an indirect relationship between satellite multispectral data and COD, BOD, and DO can be assumed. Therefore, this research attempts to develop an integrated Landsat 8 band ratios and stepwise regression to estimate concentrations of both optical and nonoptical SWQPs. Compared with previous studies, a significant correlation between Landsat 8 surface reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs was achieved and the obtained coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.85. These findings demonstrated the possibility of using our technique to develop models to estimate concentrations of SWQPs and to generate spatiotemporal maps of SWQPs from Landsat 8 imagery.

TI  - Lateral Boundary of Cirrus Cloud from CALIPSO Observations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the thinness and small scale of cirrus clouds, its lateral boundary may be missed by conventional passive remote-sensing techniques and climate models. Here, using satellite observations in June-August from 2006 to 2011, a global dataset for the cirrus cloud lateral boundary (CCLB) was established. The results indicate that the optical properties, such as the lidar backscatter, the depolarization ratio and the optical depth, sharply decrease from cloudy regions to clear-sky regions. There are significant regional differences in optical properties and height and thickness of the CCLB. Based on a quantitative estimation, the strongest longwave warming effects (> 0.3 W m(-2)) are found near the Equator and over tropical continents. The global average longwave warming effect of the CCLB is at least 0.07 W m(-2), which is much larger than some of the radiative forcings considered in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Specifically, the CCLB in traditional "clear-sky" region may be totally missed by current models and IPCC reports, which contributes 28.25% (similar to 0.02 W m(-2)) of the whole CCLB radiative effect, twice greater than contrail effect. It is recommended that the CCLB effect should be taken account in future climate models and the next IPCC reports.

TI  - Leveraging intercalibration techniques to support stray-light removal from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch in 2013, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat 8 has exhibited artifacts in its image data that can be attributed to stray-light. A 3-year effort was initiated to develop a stray-light correction algorithm to support TIRS calibration. A methodology was developed to predict the additional (stray-light) signal on each detector from an estimate of the stray-light source locations in the sensor's out-of-field area. The initial version of the algorithm estimated the magnitude of out-of-field radiance sources through the use of geostationary wide-field thermal band imagers. However, this methodology necessitated a strong effort to cross calibrate the two sensors. Ultimately, a variation of the algorithm was implemented operationally into the United States Geological Survey ground system that utilizes image data from TIRS itself as an estimate of the out-of-field stray-light sources. This paper highlights the intercalibration techniques investigated while developing the stray-light correction algorithm. The impact of differing view-angles, spectral responses, and collection times on at-sensor radiance was considered to assess the feasibility of using data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite geostationary instruments to estimate the out-of-field stray-light radiance incident on the TIRS detectors. Results of the studies presented here illustrate the complexities associated with intercalibration in the thermal and provide justification for the current form of the TIRS stray-light correction algorithm.

TI  - Development of Algorithm for Discriminating Hydrometeor Particle Types With a Synergistic Use of CloudSat and CALIPSO
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a method for classifying hydrometeor particle types, including cloud and precipitation phase and ice crystal habit, by a synergistic use of CloudSat/Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)/Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). We investigated how the cloud phase and ice crystal habit characterized by CALIOP globally relate with radar reflectivity and temperature. The global relationship thus identified was employed to develop an algorithm for hydrometeor type classification with CPR alone. The CPR-based type classification was then combined with CALIPSO-based type characterization to give CPR-CALIOP synergy classification. A unique aspect of this algorithm is to exploit and combine the lidar's sensitivity to thin ice clouds and the radar's ability to penetrate light precipitation to offer more complete picture of vertically resolved hydrometeor type classification than has been provided by previous studies. Given the complementary nature of radar and lidar detections of hydrometeors, our algorithm delivers 13 hydrometeor types: warm water, supercooled water, randomly oriented ice crystal (3D-ice), horizontally oriented plate (2D-plate), 3D-ice + 2D-plate, liquid drizzle, mixed-phase drizzle, rain, snow, mixed-phase cloud, water + liquid drizzle, water + rain, and unknown. The global statistics of three-dimensional occurrence frequency of each hydrometeor type revealed that 3D-ice contributes the most to the total cloud occurrence frequency (53.8%), followed by supercooled water (14.3%), 2D-plate (9.2%), rain (5.9%), warm water (5.7%), snow (4.8%), mixed-phase drizzle (2.3%), and the remaining types (4.0%). This hydrometeor type classification provides observation-based insight for climate model diagnostics in representation of cloud phase and their microphysical characteristics.

TI  - Magnetic structure of the mixed antiferromagnet NdMn<sub>0.8</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic structure of the mixed antiferromagnet NdMn0.8Fe0.2O3 was resolved. Neutron powder diffraction data definitively resolve the Mn sublattice with a magnetic propagation vector k = (000) and with the magnetic structure (A(x), F-y, G(z)) for 1.6 K < T < T-N (approximate to 59 K). The Nd sublattice has a (0, f(y),0) contribution in the same temperature interval. The Mn sublattice undergoes a spin-reorientation transition at T-1 approximate to 13 K while the Nd magnetic moment abruptly increases at this temperature. Powder x-ray diffraction shows a strong magnetoelastic effect at T-N but no additional structural phase transitions from 3 to 300 K. Density functional theory calculations confirm the magnetic structure of the undoped NdMnO3 as part of our analysis. Taken together, these results show that the magnetic structure of the Mn sublattice in NdMn0.8Fe0.2O3 is a combination of the Mn and Fe parent compounds, but the magnetic ordering of the Nd sublattice spans a broader temperature interval than in the case of NdMnO3 and NdFeO3. This result is a consequence of the fact that the Nd ions do not order independently, but via polarization from the Mn/Fe sublattice.

TI  - Refined Use of Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Snapshots to Constrain Biomass Burning Emissions in the GOCART Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulations of biomass burning (BB) emissions in global chemistry and aerosol transport models depend on external inventories, which provide location and strength for BB aerosol sources. Our previous work shows that to first order, satellite snapshots of aerosol optical depth (AOD) near the emitted smoke plume can be used to constrain model-simulated AOD, and effectively, the smoke source strength. We now refine the satellite-snapshot method and investigate where applying simple multiplicative emission adjustment factors alone to the widely used Global Fire Emission Database version 3 emission inventory can achieve regional-scale consistency between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD snapshots and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model. The model and satellite AOD are compared globally, over a set of BB cases observed by the MODIS instrument during the 2004, and 2006-2008 biomass burning seasons. Regional discrepancies between the model and satellite are diverse around the globe yet quite consistent within most ecosystems. We refine our approach to address physically based limitations of our earlier work (1) by expanding the number of fire cases from 124 to almost 900, (2) by using scaled reanalysis-model simulations to fill missing AOD retrievals in the MODIS observations, (3) by distinguishing the BB components of the total aerosol load from background aerosol in the near-source regions, and (4) by including emissions from fires too small to be identified explicitly in the satellite observations. The small-fire emission adjustment shows the complimentary nature of correcting for source strength and adding geographically distinct missing sources. Our analysis indicates that the method works best for fire cases where the BB fraction of total AOD is high, primarily evergreen or deciduous forests. In heavily polluted or agricultural burning regions, where smoke and background AOD values tend to be comparable, this approach encounters large uncertainties, and in some regions, other model-or measurement-related factors might contribute significantly to model-satellite discrepancies. This work sets the stage for a larger study within the Aerosol Comparison between Observations and Models (AeroCOM) multimodel biomass burning experiment. By comparing multiple model results using the refined technique presented here, we aim to separate BB inventory from model-specific contributions to the remaining discrepancies.Plain Language Summary We compare aerosol optical depth (variable describing amount and optical characteristics of particles in the air) of open fire smoke, simulated by the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) global aerosol model, and the same property observed by the satellite-borne MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument. We investigate if errors in the amount of biomass burning emissions (smoke) are the main reason for discrepancies between modeled and simulated aerosol optical depth. Our analysis shows that in some world regions, missing emission amount is the most important factor, whereas in other regions, small fire sources, unaccounted for in the emission inventories are more important contributors to the discrepancy. And in yet the other regions, more factors must be considered, such as model configuration or regional atmospheric dynamics or meteorological conditions to explain the difference between model and satellite. The novelty of this work includes the new method for separating background from smoke in the MODIS observations of biomass burning events. It also presents an extensive data set of almost 900 smoke cases for the use in global modeling studies. A new look at the contribution of small fires to model-satellite comparison, and stratification of regions with different important BB-related factors, show future directions for BB research.

TI  - <i>JAK2</i> aberrations in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - JAK2 abnormalities may serve as target for precision medicines in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). In the current study we performed a screening for JAK2 mutations and translocations, analyzed the clinical outcome and studied the efficacy of two JAK inhibitors in primary BCP-ALL cells. Importantly, we identify a number of limitations of JAK inhibitor therapy.JAK2 mutations mainly occurred in the poor prognostic subtypes BCR-ABL1-like and non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other (negative for sentinel cytogenetic lesions). JAK2 translocations were restricted to BCR-ABL1-like cases. Momelotinib and ruxolitinib were cytotoxic in both JAK2 translocated and JAK2 mutated cells, although efficacy in JAK2 mutated cells highly depended on cytokine receptor activation by TSLP. However, our data also suggest that the effect of JAK inhibition may be compromised by mutations in alternative survival pathways and microenvironment-induced resistance. Furthermore, inhibitors induced accumulation of phosphorylated JAK2(Y1007), which resulted in a profound re-activation of JAK2 signaling upon release of the inhibitors. This preclinical evidence implies that further optimization and evaluation of JAK inhibitor treatment is necessary prior to its clinical integration in pediatric BCP-ALL.

TI  - The effects of different footprint sizes and cloud algorithms on the top-of-atmosphere radiative flux calculation from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Only one Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument is onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and it has been placed in cross-track mode since launch; it is thus not possible to construct a set of angular distribution models (ADMs) specific for CERES on NPP. Edition 4 Aqua ADMs are used for flux inversions for NPP CERES measurements. However, the footprint size of NPP CERES is greater than that of Aqua CERES, as the altitude of the NPP orbit is higher than that of the Aqua orbit. Furthermore, cloud retrievals from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which are the imagers sharing the spacecraft with NPP CERES and Aqua CERES, are also different. To quantify the flux uncertainties due to the footprint size difference between Aqua CERES and NPP CERES, and due to both the footprint size difference and cloud property difference, a simulation is designed using the MODIS pixel-level data, which are convolved with the Aqua CERES and NPP CERES point spread functions (PSFs) into their respective footprints. The simulation is designed to isolate the effects of footprint size and cloud property differences on flux uncertainty from calibration and orbital differences between NPP CERES and Aqua CERES. The footprint size difference between Aqua CERES and NPP CERES introduces instantaneous flux uncertainties in monthly gridded NPP CERES measurements of less than 4.0 Wm(-2) for SW (shortwave) and less than 1.0Wm(-2) for both daytime and nighttime LW (longwave). The global monthly mean instantaneous SW flux from simulated NPP CERES has a low bias of 0.4Wm(-2) when compared to simulated Aqua CERES, and the root-mean-square (RMS) error is 2.2Wm(-2) between them; the biases of daytime and nighttime LW flux are close to zero with RMS errors of 0.8 and 0.2Wm(-2). These uncertainties are within the uncertainties of CERES ADMs. When both footprint size and cloud property (cloud fraction and optical depth) differences are considered, the uncertainties of monthly gridded NPP CERES SW flux can be up to 20Wm(-2) in the Arctic regions where cloud optical depth retrievals from VIIRS differ significantly from MODIS. The global monthly mean instantaneous SW flux from simulated NPP CERES has a high bias of 1.1Wm(-2) and the RMS error increases to 5.2Wm(-2). LW flux shows less sensitivity to cloud property differences than SW flux, with uncertainties of about 2Wm(-2) in the monthly gridded LW flux, and the RMS errors of global monthly mean daytime and nighttime fluxes increase only slightly. These results highlight the importance of consistent cloud retrieval algorithms to maintain the accuracy and stability of the CERES climate data record.

TI  - Multisource Data-Based Integrated Agricultural Drought Monitoring in the Huai River Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought monitoring is critical for early warning of drought hazard. This study attempted to develop an integrated remote sensing drought monitoring index (IRSDI), based on meteorological data for 2003-2013 from 40 meteorological stations and soil moisture data from 16 observatory stations, as well as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data using a linear trend detection method, and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index. The objective was to investigate drought conditions across the Huai River basin in both space and time. Results indicate that (1) the proposed IRSDI monitors and describes drought conditions across the Huai River basin reasonably well in both space and time; (2) frequency of drought and severe drought are observed during April-May and July-September. The northeastern and eastern parts of Huai River basin are dominated by frequent droughts and intensified drought events. These regions are dominated by dry croplands, grasslands, and highly dense population and are hence more sensitive to drought hazards; (3) intensified droughts are detected during almost all months except January, August, October, and December. Besides, significant intensification of droughts is discerned mainly in eastern and western Huai River basin. The duration and regions dominated by intensified drought events would be a challenge for water resources management in view of agricultural and other activities in these regions in a changing climate.Plain Language Summary Drought hazard is disastrous but is little understood due to complicated influencing factors for drought development and monitor. This study presents a newly proposed integrated drought monitoring model which put multisource data into consideration such as meteorological data, soil moisture, and remote sensing data as well. This newly developed drought monitoring model can monitor drought in an ideal way, involving agricultural drought and meteorological drought. Therefore, the newly developed integrated drought monitoring model can greatly improve the drought monitoring practice in a changing climate and be helpful for human mitigation to drought hazards.

TI  - Influence of main forcing affecting the Tagus turbid plume under high river discharges using MODIS imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of river discharge, wind and tide on the extension and variability of the Tagus River plume was analyzed from 2003 to 2015. This study was performed combining daily images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor located onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Composites were generated by averaging pixels with the same forcing conditions. River discharge shows a strong relation with the extension of the Tagus plume. The plume grows with the increasing river discharge and express a two day lag caused by the long residence time of water within the estuary. The Tagus turbid plume was found to be smaller under northerly and easterly winds, than under southerly and westerly winds. It is suggested that upwelling favoring winds provoke the offshore movement of the plume material with a rapidly decrease in turbidity values whereas downwelling favoring winds retain plume material in the north coast close to the Tagus mouth. Eastern cross-shore (oceanward) winds spread the plume seaward and to the north following the coast geometry, whereas western cross-shore (landward) winds keep the plume material in both alongshore directions occupying a large part of the area enclosed by the bay. Low tides produce larger and more turbid plumes than high tides. In terms of fortnightly periodicity, the maximum plume extension corresponding to the highest turbidity is observed during and after spring tides. Minimum plume extension associated with the lowest turbidity occurs during and after neap tides.

TI  - The Edinburgh Consensus: preparing for the advent of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Context: This commentary discusses the implications of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease which seem likely to appear in the next few years and results from a meeting of British experts in neurodegenerative diseases in Edinburgh. The availability of such treatments would help change public and professional attitudes and accelerate engagement with the prodromal and preclinical populations who might benefit from them. However, this would require an updated understanding of Alzheimer's disease, namely the important distinction between Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's dementia.Consensus: Since treatments are likely to be most effective in the early stages, identification of clinically relevant brain changes (for example, amyloid burden using imaging or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers) will be crucial. While current biomarkers could be useful in identifying eligibility for new therapies, trial data are not available to aid decisions about stopping or continuing treatment in clinical practice. Therefore, effective monitoring of safety and effectiveness when these treatments are introduced into clinical practice will be necessary to inform wide-scale use. Equity of access is key but there is a tension between universal access for everyone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and specifying an eligible population most likely to respond. We propose the resources necessary for an optimal care pathway as well as the necessary education and training for primary and secondary care.Conclusion: The majority of current services in the UK and elsewhere would not be able to accommodate the specialist investigations required to select patients and prescribe these therapies. Therefore, a stepped approach would be necessary: from innovating sentinel clinical-academic centres that already have capacity to deliver the necessary phase IV trials, through early adoption in a hub and spoke model, to nationwide adoption for true equity of access. The optimism generated by recent and anticipated developments in the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease presents a great opportunity to innovate and adapt our services to incorporate the next exciting development in the field of dementia.

TI  - A comparative study of multiple clinical enterovirus 71 isolates and evaluation of cross protection of inactivated vaccine strain FY-23 K-B in vitro
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease, which mostly affects infants and children and leads to severe neurological diseases. Vaccination offers the best option for disease control. We have screened the virus strain FY-23 K-B, which is used as an inactivated vaccine strain. An important issue in the development of vaccines is whether they provide cross protection against all other strains.Methods: We collected and identified 19 clinical EV71 isolates from mainland China, which all belong to the C4 genotype. We established growth curves of the strains in Vero cells, performed genetic analysis, and evaluated the cross protection efficacy through neutralizing assays using antisera from a rabbit, monkey and adult human immunized with the FY-23 K-B vaccine strain.Results: The antisera showed broad cross protection among the C4 subgroup strains and homotype strain. Neutralizing indexes (NIs) among the isolates and homotype strain of antisera varied between 56.2-1995.3 for rabbit, 17.8-42,169.7 for monkey and 31.6-17,782.8 for human, whereas NIs against Coxsackievirus A16 or other enteroviruses were below 10.Conclusions: These results suggested that FY-23 K-B used as an antigen could elicit broad spectrum neutralizing antibodies with cross protective efficacy among C4 genotype strains.

TI  - Conservation of reef manta rays (<i>Manta alfredi</i>) in a UNESCO World Heritage Site: Large-scale island development or sustainable tourism?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A large reef manta ray (Manta alfredi) aggregation has been observed off the north Sudanese Red Sea coast since the 1950s. Sightings have been predominantly within the boundaries of a marine protected area (MPA), which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2016. Contrasting economic development trajectories have been proposed for the area (small-scale ecotourism and large-scale island development). To examine space-use, Wildlife Computers (R) SPOT 5 tags were secured to three manta rays. A two-state switching Bayesian state space model (BSSM), that allowed movement parameters to switch between resident and travelling, was fit to the recorded locations, and 50% and 95% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) home ranges calculated. A total of 682 BSSM locations were recorded between 30 October 2012 and 6 November 2013. Of these, 98.5% fell within the MPA boundaries; 99.5% for manta 1, 91.5% for manta 2, and 100% for manta 3. The BSSM identified that all three mantas were resident during 99% of transmissions, with 50% and 95% KUD home ranges falling mainly within the MPA boundaries. For all three mantas combined (88.4%), and all individuals (manta 1-92.4%, manta 2-64.9%, manta 3-91.9%), the majority of locations occurred within 15 km of the proposed large-scale island development. Results indicated that the MPA boundaries are spatially appropriate for manta rays in the region, however, a close association to the proposed large-scale development highlights the potential threat of disruption. Conversely, the focused nature of spatial use highlights the potential for reliable ecotourism opportunities.

TI  - Expansion of oil palm and other cash crops causes an increase of the land surface temperature in the Jambi province in Indonesia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is currently one of the regions with the highest transformation rate of land surface worldwide related to the expansion of oil palm plantations and other cash crops replacing forests on large scales. Land cover changes, which modify land surface properties, have a direct effect on the land surface temperature (LST), a key driver for many ecological functions. Despite the large historic land transformation in Indonesia toward oil palm and other cash crops and governmental plans for future expansion, this is the first study so far to quantify the impacts of land transformation on the LST in Indonesia. We analyze LST from the thermal band of a Landsat image and produce a high-resolution surface temperature map (30 m) for the lowlands of the Jambi province in Sumatra (Indonesia), a region which suffered large land transformation towards oil palm and other cash crops over the past decades. The comparison of LST, albedo, normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) between seven different land cover types (forest, urban areas, clear-cut land, young and mature oil palm plantations, acacia and rubber plantations) shows that forests have lower surface temperatures than the other land cover types, indicating a local warming effect after forest conversion. LST differences were up to 10.1 +/- 2.6 degrees C (mean +/- SD) between forest and clear-cut land. The differences in surface temperatures are explained by an evaporative cooling effect, which offsets the albedo warming effect.Our analysis of the LST trend of the past 16 years based on MODIS data shows that the average daytime surface temperature in the Jambi province increased by 1.05 degrees C, which followed the trend of observed land cover changes and exceeded the effects of climate warming. This study provides evidence that the expansion of oil palm plantations and other cash crops leads to changes in biophysical variables, warming the land surface and thus enhancing the increase of the air temperature because of climate change.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Preserving gastric function and improving quality of life (QOL) is the tendency of surgery for early gastric cancer. Function preserving gastrectomy (FPG) is applied to modify the extent of surgery and to achieve better quality of life at the premise of radical resection. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy is the most favorable approach of FPG with oncological safety, which can improve nutritional status and QOL via preserving pylorus and vagal nerve. Proximal gastrectomy is widely accepted as FPG for early upper 1/3 gastric cancer. However, the most optimal way of anastomosis is not yet solved. Sentinel node navigation is currently the most accurate approach for intraoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis, which stimulates the development of many kinds of FPG procedures for individual treatment. Nevertheless, more efforts should be made to reduce false negative rate of sentinel node biopsy. Herein we discuss the valuation and prospect of FPG.

TI  - Assessment of evolution and risks of glacier lake outbursts in the Djungarskiy Alatau, Central Asia, using Landsat imagery and glacier bed topography modelling
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the abundance and area of mountain lakes in the Djungarskiy (Jetysu) Alatau between 2002 and 2014 were investigated using Landsat imagery. The number of lakes increased by 6.2% from 599 to 636 with a growth rate of 0.51% a(-1). The combined areas were 16.26 +/- 0.85 to 17.35 +/- 0.92 km(2) respectively and the overall change was within the uncertainty of measurements. Fifty lakes, whose potential outburst can damage existing infrastructure, were identified. The glacier bed topography version 2 (GlabTop2) model was applied to simulate ice thickness and subglacial topography using glacier outlines for 2000 and SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model) as input data achieving realistic patterns of ice thickness. A total of 513 overdeepenings in the modelled glacier beds, presenting potential sites for the development of lakes, were identified with a combined area of 14.7 km(2). Morphometric parameters of the modelled overdeepenings were close to those of the existing lakes. A comparison of locations of the overdeepenings and newly formed lakes in the areas deglacierized in 2000-2014 showed that 67% of the lakes developed at the sites of the overdeepenings. The rates of increase in areas of new lakes correlated with areas of modelled overdeepenings. Locations where hazardous lakes may develop in the future were identified. The GlabTop2 approach is shown to be a useful tool in hazard management providing data on the potential evolution of future lakes.

TI  - Framing the future of privacy: citizens' metaphors for privacy in the coming digital society
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FUTURES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Privacy is one of the pressing issues of the digital age. New technologies and surveillance practices continuously present new privacy threats. This paper reports an exploratory qualitative study on non-experts' metaphors for privacy in future society using focus group material from three countries: Finland, Germany and Israel. Using thematic analysis, four metaphorical frames for privacy are constructed: 'dodo', 'hemline', 'savings' and 'foundations of our home'. The frames are analysed using the causal layered analysis method to uncover their systemic and worldview components. Taken together, the metaphorical frames highlight two key concerns of individuals: their struggle for control over a dominating future, on the one hand, and the problem of trust in collective means of privacy protection, on the other hand. The article concludes that the views of non-experts need to be included in broad societal discussion about a desirable future society and the role of privacy in that society. This discussion needs to seriously consider systemic interconnections that challenge privacy as well as the whole ecosystem of metaphorical frames for privacy.

TI  - Data Descriptor: A global moderate resolution dataset of gross primary production of vegetation for 2000-2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Accurate estimation of the gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial vegetation is vital for understanding the global carbon cycle and predicting future climate change. Multiple GPP products are currently available based on different methods, but their performances vary substantially when validated against GPP estimates from eddy covariance data. This paper provides a new GPP dataset at moderate spatial (500 m) and temporal (8-day) resolutions over the entire globe for 2000-2016. This GPP dataset is based on an improved light use efficiency theory and is driven by satellite data from MODIS and climate data from NCEP Reanalysis II. It also employs a state-of-the-art vegetation index (VI) gap-filling and smoothing algorithm and a separate treatment for C3/C4 photosynthesis pathways. All these improvements aim to solve several critical problems existing in current GPP products. With a satisfactory performance when validated against in situ GPP estimates, this dataset offers an alternative GPP estimate for regional to global carbon cycle studies.

TI  - CHRODIS criteria applied to the MASK (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK) Good Practice in allergic rhinitis: a SUNFRAIL report
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A Good Practice is a practice that works well, produces good results, and is recommended as a model. MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel Network (MASK), the new Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative, is an example of a Good Practice focusing on the implementation of multi-sectoral care pathways using emerging technologies with real life data in rhinitis and asthma multi-morbidity. The European Union Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (JA-CHRODIS) has developed a checklist of 28 items for the evaluation of Good Practices. SUNFRAIL (Reference Sites Network for Prevention and Care of Frailty and Chronic Conditions in community dwelling persons of EU Countries), a European Union project, assessed whether MASK is in line with the 28 items of JA-CHRODIS. A short summary was proposed for each item and 18 experts, all members of ARIA and SUNFRAIL from 12 countries, assessed the 28 items using a Survey Monkey-based questionnaire. A visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (strongly disagree) to 100 (strongly agree) was used. Agreement equal or over 75% was observed for 14 items (50%). MASK is following the JA-CHRODIS recommendations for the evaluation of Good Practices.

TI  - Genome-wide profiling of transcribed enhancers during macrophage activation
T2  - EPIGENETICS & CHROMATIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Macrophages are sentinel cells essential for tissue homeostasis and host defence. Owing to their plasticity, macrophages acquire a range of functional phenotypes in response to microenvironmental stimuli, of which M(IFN-.(gamma) and M(IL-4/ IL-13) are well known for their opposing pro-and anti-inflammatory roles. Enhancers have emerged as regulatory DNA elements crucial for transcriptional activation of gene expression.Results: Using cap analysis of gene expression and epigenetic data, we identify on large-scale transcribed enhancers in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages, their time kinetics, and target protein-coding genes. We observe an increase in target gene expression, concomitant with increasing numbers of associated enhancers, and find that genes associated with many enhancers show a shift towards stronger enrichment for macrophage-specific biological processes. We infer enhancers that drive transcriptional responses of genes upon M(IFN-gamma) and M(IL-4/ IL-13) macrophage activation and demonstrate stimuli specificity of regulatory associations. Finally, we show that enhancer regions are enriched for binding sites of inflammation-related transcription factors, suggesting a link between stimuli response and enhancer transcriptional control.Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into genome-wide enhancer-mediated transcriptional control of macrophage genes, including those implicated in macrophage activation, and offers a detailed genome-wide catalogue of transcribed enhancers in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages.

TI  - Paget's Breast Disease: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Paget's disease of the breast is a rare cancer. This typical clinical case illustrates the different epidemiological, clinical, histological, therapeutic, and evolving aspects of the disease. We report a case of Paget's disease in a 43-year-old woman who presented eczema of the nipple. Mammography and ultrasounds did reveal a lesion in situ. The patient was scheduled for mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. She had chosen a radical bilateral surgery. The histological diagnosis was Paget's disease of the breast with a carcinoma in situ. There was no metastasis in either of the sentinel nodes. Paget's disease must be considered with the presence of a persistent eczematous involvement of the nipple, which does not respond to local treatment. Ultrasounds, mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging can allow searching an underlying cancer and guiding the surgical management. There is no evidence at this time that one of the two surgical techniques (conservative or mastectomy) would improve survival. The prognosis depends on the presence of a palpable mass and the invasiveness of the cancer.

TI  - Transcriptomic response of the Antarctic pteropod <i>Limacina helicina antarctica</i> to ocean acidification
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ocean acidification (OA), a change in ocean chemistry due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2 into surface oceans, challenges biogenic calcification in many marine organisms. Ocean acidification is expected to rapidly progress in polar seas, with regions of the Southern Ocean expected to experience severe OA within decades. Biologically, the consequences of OA challenge calcification processes and impose an energetic cost.Results: In order to better characterize the response of a polar calcifier to conditions of OA, we assessed differential gene expression in the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica. Experimental levels of pCO(2) were chosen to create both contemporary pH conditions, and to mimic future pH expected in OA scenarios. Significant changes in the transcriptome were observed when juvenile L.h. antarctica were acclimated for 21 days to low-pH (7.71), mid-pH (7.9) or high-pH (8.13) conditions. Differential gene expression analysis of individuals maintained in the low-pH treatment identified down-regulation of genes involved in cytoskeletal structure, lipid transport, and metabolism. High pH exposure led to increased expression and enrichment for genes involved in shell formation, calcium ion binding, and DNA binding. Significant differential gene expression was observed in four major cellular and physiological processes: shell formation, the cellular stress response, metabolism, and neural function. Across these functional groups, exposure to conditions that mimic ocean acidification led to rapid suppression of gene expression.Conclusions: Results of this study demonstrated that the transcriptome of the juvenile pteropod, L.h. antarctica, was dynamic and changed in response to different levels of pCO(2). In a global change context, exposure of L.h. antarctica to the low pH, high pCO(2) OA conditions resulted in a suppression of transcripts for genes involved in key physiological processes: calcification, metabolism, and the cellular stress response. The transcriptomic response at both acute and longer-term acclimation time frames indicated that contemporary L.h. antarctica may not have the physiological plasticity necessary for adaptation to OA conditions expected in future decades. Lastly, the differential gene expression results further support the role of shelled pteropods such as L.h. antarctica as sentinel organisms for the impacts of ocean acidification.

TI  - Community analysis of the abundance and diversity of mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) in three European countries at different latitudes
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies on mosquito species diversity in Europe often focus on a specific habitat, region or country. Moreover, different trap types are used for these sampling studies, making it difficult to compare and validate results across Europe. To facilitate comparisons of trapping sites and community analysis, the present study used two trap types for monitoring mosquito species diversity in three habitat types for three different countries in Europe.Methods: Mosquitoes were trapped using Biogents Sentinel (BGS), and Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus (MMLP) traps at a total of 27 locations in Sweden, the Netherlands and Italy, comprising farm, peri-urban and wetland habitats. From July 2014 to June 2015 all locations were sampled monthly, except for the winter months. Indices of species richness, evenness and diversity were calculated, and community analyses were carried out with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) techniques.Results: A total of 11,745 female mosquitoes were trapped during 887 collections. More than 90% of the mosquitoes belonged to the genera Culex and Aedes, with Culex pipiens being the most abundant species. The highest mosquito diversity was found in Sweden. Within Sweden, species diversity was highest in wetland habitats, whereas in the Netherlands and Italy this was highest at farms. The NMDS analyses showed clear differences in mosquito communities among countries, but not among habitat types. The MMLP trapped a higher diversity of mosquito species than the BGS traps. Also, MMLP traps trapped higher numbers of mosquitoes, except for the genera Culex and Culiseta in Italy.Conclusions: A core mosquito community could be identified for the three countries, with Culex pipiens as the most abundant species. Differences in mosquito species communities were more defined by the three countries included in the study than by the three habitat types. Differences in mosquito community composition across countries may have implications for disease emergence and further spread throughout Europe. Future research should, therefore, focus on how field data of vector communities can be incorporated into models, to better assess the risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks.

TI  - Primary small cell carcinoma of the breast: a case report.
T2  - Journal of medical case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine breast cancer is a rare entity that was defined in 2003 by the World Health Organization as a separate breast cancer subtype. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine breast cancer requires the presence of neuroendocrine features in at least 50% of malignant cells, the exclusion of non-mammary primary tumors, as well as the presence of an in situ component in breast histology. The treatment and prognosis of neuroendocrine breast cancer are still not well established. Small cell carcinoma of the breast is a subtype of neuroendocrine cancer, resembling small cell carcinoma of the lung. It has a very poor prognosis and warrants treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report the case of a 47-year-old white woman with a left breast mass that was found to be an early-stage, high-grade small cell carcinoma of the breast. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging excluded any other primary disease. Our patient underwent a left total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and received cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Our patient remains free of disease to date.CONCLUSIONS: This case report sheds light on a rarely described disease and provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is a well-defined histologic subtype of breast cancer. Small cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare subtype of neuroendocrine breast cancer. Due to the rarity of this entity, prognosis has still not been well established, and treatment has not been standardized, cisplatin-based treatment has been used in this case similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung.

TI  - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) tracks 2-3 peta-gram increase in carbon release to the atmosphere during the 2014-2016 El Nino
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The powerful El Nino event of 2015-2016 - the third most intense since the 1950s - has exerted a large impact on the Earth's natural climate system. The column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) observations from satellites and ground-based networks are analyzed together with in situ observations for the period of September 2014 to October 2016. From the differences between satellite (OCO-2) observations and simulations using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model, we estimate that, relative to the mean annual fluxes for 2014, the most recent El Nino has contributed to an excess CO2 emission from the Earth's surface (land + ocean) to the atmosphere in the range of 2.4 +/- 0.2 PgC (1 Pg = 10(15) g) over the period of July 2015 to June 2016. The excess CO2 flux is resulted primarily from reduction in vegetation uptake due to drought, and to a lesser degree from increased biomass burning. It is about the half of the CO2 flux anomaly (range: 4.4-6.7 PgC) estimated for the 1997/1998 El Nino. The annual total sink is estimated to be 3.9 +/- 0.2 PgC for the assumed fossil fuel emission of 10.1 PgC. The major uncertainty in attribution arise from error in anthropogenic emission trends, satellite data and atmospheric transport.

TI  - Semi-field assessment of the BG-Malaria trap for monitoring the African malaria vector, <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Odour-baited technologies are increasingly considered for effective monitoring of mosquito populations and for the evaluation of vector control interventions. The BG-Malaria trap (BGM), which is an upside-down variant of the widely used BG-Sentinel trap (BGS), has been demonstrated to be effective to sample the Brazilian malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi. We evaluated the BGM as an improved method for sampling the African malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis. Experiments were conducted inside a large semi-field cage to compare trapping efficiencies of BGM and BGS traps, both baited with the synthetic attractant, Ifakara blend, supplemented with CO2. We then compared BGMs baited with either of four synthetic mosquito lures, Ifakara blend, Mbita blend, BG-lure or CO2, and an unbaited BGM. Lastly, we compared BGMs baited with the Ifakara blend dispensed via either nylon strips, BG cartridges (attractant-infused microcapsules encased in cylindrical plastic cartridge) or BG sachets (attractant-infused microcapsules encased in plastic sachets). All tests were conducted between 6P.M. and 7A.M., with 200-600 laboratory-reared An. arabiensis released nightly in the test chamber. The median number of An. arabiensis caught by the BGM per night was 83, IQR:(73.5-97.75), demonstrating clear superiority over BGS (median catch = 32.5 (25.25-37.5)). Compared to unbaited controls, BGMs baited with Mbita blend caught most mosquitoes (45 (29.5-70.25)), followed by BGMs baited with CO2 (42.5 (27.5-64)), Ifakara blend (31 (9.25-41.25)) and BG lure (16 (4-22)). BGM caught 51 (29.5-72.25) mosquitoes/night, when the attractants were dispensed using BG-Cartridges, compared to BG-Sachet (29.5 (24.75-40.5)), and nylon strips (27 (19.25-38.25)), in all cases being significantly superior to unbaited controls (p < 000.1). The findings demonstrate potential of the BGM as a sampling tool for African malaria vectors over the standard BGS trap. Its efficacy can be optimized by selecting appropriate odour baits and odour-dispensing systems.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor 4 Is Essential for the Expression of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate-Dependent Asthma-Like Disease in Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels significantly increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of asthmatic patients following segmental allergen challenge and this increase well correlates with pulmonary inflammation. Epidemiological, genetic, clinical, and experimental data indicate a potential for the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to initiate and exacerbate allergic airway diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of TLR4 in S1P-dependent asthma-like disease in mice. BALB/c or TLR4 defective (C3H/HeJ) mice received S1P (10 ng/mouse), LPS (0.1 mu g/mouse) or S1P + LPS. Furthermore, S1Ptreated BALB/c mice were injected with the purified rabbit anti-TLR4 antibody (10 mu g/mouse). S1P administration induced airway hyperreactivity and pulmonary inflammation associated to an increase in the percentage of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages into the lung of BALB/c mice. These effects were coupled to a reduction of DCs in the mediastinic lymph node. All these S1P-mediated effects were absent in TLR4 defective mice or reversed by treatment with a purified rabbit anti-TLR4 antibody. Confocal analysis of pulmonary sections showed a significant increase in TLR4(+) cells and a similar presence of S1P(1) and TLR4 following S1P challenge. Accordingly, the immunoprecipitation evidenced an increased S1P(1)/TLR4 interaction. In conclusion, our findings suggest that a functional interaction between S1P(1) and TLR4 leads to an enhanced allergic inflammatory response. Thus, S1P pathway contributes to the sentinel role played by innate immunity providing new targets for prevention and treatment of allergic airway diseases.

AB  - Advanced spaceborn thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) has fine spectral bands in short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The purpose behind the study is to explore the potential of ASTER for litho-logical and minerals detection; in comparison with Landsat-ETM+ Khaira Murat range (KMR) of Gali Jagir area, district Attock was selected as a test site; enriched with industrial minerals of the Eocene age. Maximum likelihood classification was applied on Landsat-ETM+ and ASTER images. Maximum likelihood classification on ASTER satellite image exhibits better discrimination among various lithologies as compared to Landsat-ETM+. Classified image of ASTER showed a correlation coefficient of 0.6 with the geological survey of Pakistan's map while a classified image of Landsat-ETM+ exhibited a correlation of only 0.43. Landsat-ETM+ and ASTER satellite images were further investigated for minerals detection. Landsat-ETM+ band ratio detected clay. ASTER SWIR band ratios detected various clay and carbonate minerals. X'PertPRO diffractometer and differential thermal analysis of field samples verified the detected minerology. The results suggest that ASTER can be successfully used for litho-logical and minerals mapping of less-examined areas. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Stable and accurate methods for identification of water bodies from Landsat series imagery using meta-heuristic algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of water extents in Landsat images is challenging due to surfaces with similar reflectance Landsat images were selected from various environmental regions in Iran. Training of the algorithms was performed using 40 water pixels and 40 nonwater pixels in operational land imager images of Chitgar Lake (one of the study regions). Moreover, high-resolution images from Google Earth were digitized to evaluate the results. Two approaches were considered: index-based and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. In the first approach, nine common water spectral indices were investigated. AI algorithms were utilized to acquire coefficients of optimal band combinations to extract water extents. Among the AI algorithms, the artificial neural network algorithm and also the ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) meta-heuristic algorithms were implemented. Index-based methods represented different performances in various regions. Among AI methods, PSO had the best performance with average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 93% and 98%, respectively. The results indicated the applicability of acquired band combinations to extract accurately and stably water extents in Landsat imagery.

TI  - Analysis of streamflow response to land use and land cover changes using satellite data and hydrological modelling: case study of Dinder and Rahad tributaries of the Blue Nile (Ethiopia-Sudan)
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) and their implication on surface hydrology of the Dinder and Rahad basins (D&R, approximately 77 504 km(2)) is vital for the management and utilization of water resources in the basins. Although there are many studies on LULCC in the Blue Nile Basin, specific studies on LULCC in the D&R are still missing. Hence, its impact on streamflow is unknown. The objective of this paper is to understand the LULCC in the Dinder and Rahad and its implications on streamflow response using satellite data and hydrological modelling. The hydrological model has been derived by different sets of land use and land cover maps from 1972, 1986, 1998 and 2011. Catchment topography, land cover and soil maps are derived from satellite images and serve to estimate model parameters. Results of LULCC detection between 1972 and 2011 indicate a significant decrease in woodland and an increase in cropland. Woodland decreased from 42 to 14% and from 35 to 14% for Dinder and Rahad, respectively. Cropland increased from 14 to 47% and from 18 to 68% in Dinder and Rahad, respectively. The model results indicate that streamflow is affected by LULCC in both the Dinder and the Rahad rivers. The effect of LULCC on streamflow is significant during 1986 and 2011. This could be attributed to the severe drought during the mid-1980s and the recent large expansion in cropland.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance assessment in bacteria isolated in migratory Passeriformes transiting through the Metaponto territory (Basilicata, Italy)
T2  - AVIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Wild birds are considered to be reservoirs of human enteric pathogens and vectors of antimicrobial resistance dissemination in the environment. During their annual migration, they play a potential role in the epidemiology of human associated zoonoses. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of microorganisms found in the cloaca of common European passerines.Methods: One hundred and twenty-one cloacal swabs were collected during a monitoring program of migratory birds in the Forest Reserve for Protection "Metaponto" (Basilicata, Italy). All samples were cultured using standard bacteriological methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing (agar disk diffusion test) of isolated strains was performed.Results: The bacteriological analysis produced 122 strains belonging to 18 different species. The most commonly isolated species were Enterobacter cloacae and Providencia rettgeri (21 strains, 17.2%). Potentially pathogenic species including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas spp. have also been identified. Isolates showed significant frequencies of antimicrobial resistance. The highest frequency of resistance was observed against amoxicillin (n = 79, 64.8%); ampicillin (n = 77, 63.1%); rifampicin (n = 75, 61.5%); amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 66, 54.1%). Thirty-one strains (25.4%) showed resistance to imipenem and 8 (6.6%) to meropenem.Conclusions: Migratory birds play an important role in the ecology, circulation and dissemination of potentially pathogenic antimicrobial resistant organisms. They can therefore be considered sentinel species and environmental health indicators. Our results suggest that the integration of epidemiological surveillance networks during ringing campaigns of wild species can be an effective tool to study this phenomenon.

TI  - Chemical Feedback From Decreasing Carbon Monoxide Emissions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes in the burden and growth rate of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been the focus of several recent studies but still lacks scientific consensus. Here we investigate the role of decreasing anthropogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emissions since 2002 on hydroxyl radical (OH) sinks and tropospheric CH4 loss. We quantify this impact by contrasting two model simulations for 2002-2013: (1) a Measurement of the Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO reanalysis and (2) a Control-Run without CO assimilation. These simulations are performed with the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry of the Community Earth System Model fully coupled chemistry climate model with prescribed CH4 surface concentrations. The assimilation of MOPITT observations constrains the global CO burden, which significantly decreased over this period by similar to 20%. We find that this decrease results to (a) increase in CO chemical production, (b) higher CH4 oxidation by OH, and (c) similar to 8% shorter CH4 lifetime. We elucidate this coupling by a surrogate mechanism for CO-OH-CH4 that is quantified from the full chemistry simulations.

TI  - Estimating morning change in land surface temperature from MODIS day/night observations: Applications for surface energy balance modeling
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of land surface temperature (LST) are crucial for the monitoring of surface energy fluxes from satellite. Methods that require high temporal resolution LST observations (e.g., from geostationary orbit) can be difficult to apply globally because several geostationary sensors are required to attain near-global coverage (60 degrees N to 60 degrees S). While these LST observations are available from polar-orbiting sensors, providing global coverage at higher spatial resolutions, the temporal sampling (twice daily observations) can pose significant limitations. For example, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model, used for monitoring evapotranspiration and drought, requires an observation of the morning change in LSTa quantity not directly observable from polar-orbiting sensors. Therefore, we have developed and evaluated a data-mining approach to estimate the midmorning rise in LST from a single sensor (two observations per day) of LST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua platform. In general, the data-mining approach produced estimates with low relative error (5 to 10%) and statistically significant correlations when compared against geostationary observations. This approach will facilitate global, near-real-time applications of ALEXI at higher spatial and temporal coverage from a single sensor than currently achievable with current geostationary data sets.

TI  - Observed Covariations of Aerosol Optical Depth and Cloud Cover in Extratropical Cyclones
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth and total cloud cover retrievals, CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud profiles, and a database of extratropical cyclones and frontal boundary locations, relationships between changes in aerosol optical depth and cloud cover in extratropical cyclones occurring over Northern Hemisphere oceans are examined. A reanalysis data set is used to constrain column water vapor and ascent strength in the cyclones in an attempt to distinguish their impact on cloud cover from the effect of changes in aerosol loading. The results suggest that high aerosol optical depth cyclones exhibit larger middle- and high-level cloud cover than their low aerosol optical depth counterparts. However, the opposite behavior is found for low-level cloud cover. These relationships are found to depend on the large-scale environment, in particular the column water vapor and vertical motion. Despite the inability of the observations to provide a causal physical link between aerosol load and cloud cover, these results can help to constrain and evaluate model simulations.

TI  - Highly temporally resolved response to seasonal surface melt of the Zachariae and 79N outlet glaciers in northeast Greenland
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal response to surface melting of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream outlets, Zachariae and 79N, is investigated using new highly temporally resolved surface velocity maps for 2016 combined with numerical modeling. The seasonal speedup at 79N of 0.15km/yr is suggested to be driven by a decrease in effective basal pressure induced by surface melting, whereas for Zachariae its 0.11km/yr seasonal speedup correlates equally well with the breakup of its large ice melange. We investigate the influence 76km long floating tongue at 79N, finding it provides little resistance and that most of it could be lost without impacting the dynamics of the area. Furthermore, we show that reducing the slipperiness along the tongue-wall interfaces produces a velocity change spatially inconsistent with the observed seasonal speedup. Finally, we find that subglacial sticky spots such as bedrock bumps play a negligible role in the large-scale response to a seasonally enhanced basal slipperiness of the region.Plain Language Summary The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream may potentially contribute significantly to near-term sea level rise and is one of the lesser studied Greenlandic systems, partly due to its remoteness. We present a new high temporally resolved velocity data set derived from Sentinel 1-A which allows capturing changes on a seasonal timescale, a feature which only the newest generation satellites now permit. We show how surface melting may be linked to the observed seasonal velocity changes, giving important insights into the possible future (range of) behavior and sensitivity of the ice stream outlets to atmospheric changes. In addition, we present a detailed study of possible moderating factors on the seasonal velocity response. In particular, we find that (i) the large ice melange in front of the Zachariae outlet might be dampening the outlet's response, (ii) small-scale subglacial topographical bumps (sticky spots) exert very limited control on the flow, and (iii) the 76km long floating tongue of the 79N outlet is largely a passive feature, suggesting that most of it (approximate to 80%) could be lost without effecting the outlet's contribution to near-term sea level rise. This has broad implications for assessing the future mass loss of ice sheets since it points to the importance of studying every major calving event individually.

TI  - Estimating Daily Evapotranspiration From Remotely Sensed Instantaneous Observations With Simplified Derivations of a Theoretical Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key components in global hydrological cycle and energy budget on Earth. This paper designs a theoretical relationship between daily and instantaneous ETs with a multiplication of multiple fractions through a mathematical derivation of the physics-based Penman-Monteith equation and further develops five methods for converting remotely sensed instantaneous ET to daily values, one of which is equivalent to the conventional constant evaporative fraction (EF) method. The five methods are then evaluated and intercompared using long-term ground-based eddy covariance system-measured half-hourly latent heat flux (LE) and three groups of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based instantaneous LE data sets collected from April 2009 to late October 2011 at the Yucheng station. Overall, the constant decoupling factor (R-c) method, the constant surface resistance (R-c) method, and the constant ratio of surface resistance to aerodynamic resistance (R-c/R-a) method could produce daily LE estimates that are in reasonably good agreement with the ground-based eddy covariance measurements, whereas the constant EF method and the constant Priestley-Taylor parameter (R-a) method underestimate the daily LE with larger biases and root-mean-square errors. The former three methods are of more solid physical foundation and can effectively capture the effect of temporally variable meteorological factors on the diurnal pattern of surface ET. They provide good alternatives to the nowadays commonly applied methods for the conversion of remotely sensed instantaneous ET to daily values.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Deep Blue Aerosol Algorithm in Desert Region of East Asia: Ground Validation and Intercomparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundant dust particles from widespread deserts in East Asia play a significant role in regional climate and air quality. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) aerosol retrievals in desert regions of East Asia using ground-based observations over eight sites of the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET). Different from their well-characterized performance in urban and cropland areas around the globe, DB aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals exhibit underestimation across the deserts in East Asia. We found that 38%-96% of satellite values fall out of an expected-error envelope of (0.05+20%AOD(CARSNET)), with the worst performance in Taklimakan Desert. In particular, DB retrievals erroneously give a nearly constant low values of 0.05 in Taklimakan Desert when AOD is below 0.5, which does not match with variation of moderate dust plumes. Comparison with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer AOD shows that a similar underestimation is prevalent over the extensive deserts. Inversion of sky light measurements show that single scattering albedos of the yellow dust in East Asia are mostly below 0.9 at 440nm, much lower than the whiter and "redder" dust models applied in the DB algorithm. On the other hand, overestimation of surface reflectance dominantly contributes to the significant low constant AOD values in MODIS DB retrievals in Taklimakan Desert. These large biases, however, can be substantially reduced by considering unique characteristics of aerosols and surface over the arid regions in East Asia.

TI  - Effects of Australian Summer Monsoon on Sea Surface Temperature Diurnal Variation Over the Australian North-Western Shelf
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Five-year (2010 to 2014) sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer are used to study the effects of the Australian summer monsoon on SST diurnal variation (DV) over the Australian northwestern shelf (NWS, defined as 105 degrees E-125 degrees E, 25 degrees S-10 degrees S). Strong DV events identified with amplitude of 0.5-2K were observed over the NWS. A double-peak seasonal pattern of DV is obtained, with the strongest DV occurring in February/March and October/November. This seasonal DV pattern over the NWS is largely due to the Australian summer monsoon, which reduces the easterly trade wind during the summer monsoonal period, favoring the development of SST DV. Since the monsoon region is distributed globally in the tropical oceans, in the western and eastern North Pacific, as well as in the southern Indian Ocean, we anticipate that strong SST DV may also exist in these parts of coastal oceans.Plain Language Summary five-year (2010 to 2014) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data have been used to study the effects of the Australian monsoon on SST diurnal variation (DV) events over the Australian northwestern shelf (NWS).

TI  - Higher-order Network Analysis of Fine Particulate Matter (<i>PM</i><sub>2.5</sub>) Transport in China at City Level
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Specification of PM2.5 transmission characteristics is important for pollution control and policymaking. We apply higher-order organization of complex networks to identify major potential PM2.5 contributors and PM2.5 transport pathways of a network of 189 cities in China. The network we create in this paper consists of major cities in China and contains information on meteorological conditions of wind speed and wind direction, data on geographic distance, mountains, and PM2.5 concentrations. We aim to reveal PM2.5 mobility between cities in China. Two major conclusions are revealed through motif analysis of complex networks. First, major potential PM2.5 pollution contributors are identified for each cluster by one motif, which reflects movements from source to target. Second, transport pathways of PM2.5 are revealed by another motif, which reflects transmission routes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply higher-order network analysis to study PM2.5 transport.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Various double sampling methods using both target and auxiliary variables have been developed over many years for use in natural resource inventory.Methods: Simulations of inventory were carried out using four different ratio estimators and model-assisted estimation in each of five rather different example forest populations. Estimates of population means and their standard errors from each of these methods were compared with those obtained using simple random sampling.Results: With all five double sampling estimators, bias in estimates of means and standard errors (the latter estimated analytically or through bootstrapping) was generally small and consistent with theoretical expectations. Their efficiency increased as either the first- or second-phase sample sizes increased. All were more efficient than estimates obtained using simple random sampling as long as there was some positive level of correlation between the target and auxiliary variable. However, none of the double sampling estimators was more efficient than any of the others.Conclusions: For many forest inventory tasks, users may well be able to use whichever of the estimators is most convenient to their purpose. However, model-assisted estimation has application in a wider range of circumstances than the other methods, which perhaps recommends it for general use.

TI  - A Universal <i>T<sub>s</sub></i>-VI Triangle Method for the Continuous Retrieval of Evaporative Fraction From MODIS Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The triangle method based on the spatial relationship between remotely sensed land surface temperature (T-s) and vegetation index (VI) has been widely used for the estimates of evaporative fraction (EF). In the present study, a universal triangle method was proposed by transforming the T-s-VI feature space from a regional scale to a pixel scale. The retrieval of EF is only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale, regardless of the T-s-VI configuration over the spatial domain. The boundary conditions of each pixel are composed of the theoretical dry edge determined by the surface energy balance principle and the wet edge determined by the average air temperature of open water. The universal triangle method was validated using the EF observations collected by the Energy Balance Bowen Ratio systems in the Southern Great Plains of the United States of America (USA). Two parameterization schemes of EF were used to demonstrate their applicability with Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the whole year 2004. The results of this study show that the accuracy produced by both of these two parameterization schemes is comparable to that produced by the traditional triangle method, although the universal triangle method seems specifically suited to the parameterization scheme proposed in our previous research. The independence of the universal triangle method from the T-s-VI feature space makes it possible to conduct a continuous monitoring of evapotranspiration and soil moisture. That is just the ability the traditional triangle method does not possess.

TI  - Inventory and recently increasing GLOF susceptibility of glacial lakes in Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic changes alter the climate system, leading to a decrease of glacier mass volumes and swelling glacial lakes. This study provides a new inventory of glacial and high-altitude lakes for Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya, and evaluates the susceptibility of lakes to Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). By using satellite data of high spatial resolution (5 m), we obtain 1104 glacial and high-altitude lakes with total area 30.498 km(2), of which 472 have an area > 0.01 km(2). Applying pre-defined GLOF susceptibility criteria on these 472 lakes yields 21 lakes susceptible to GLOF, which all increased in area from 1972-2015. Using Analytic Hierarchy Processes (AHP), the pairwise comparison matrix further reveals that 5 of these glacial lakes have low, 14 have medium and 2 have high GLOF susceptibility. Especially these 16 glacial lakes with high and medium GLOF susceptibility may threaten downstream communities and infrastructure and need further attention.

TI  - Correlation Analysis of the Urban Heat Island Effect and Its Impact Factors in China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs), which are urban areas with higher surface or air temperatures than surrounding rural areas, can further enhance the heat stress already exacerbated by global warming. This poses great challenges to human health and sustainable development. China has been burdened with heavy air pollution in recent years, and the effect of haze pollution on UHIs is still far less well understood. This study investigated the spatial variations of daytime, nighttime, and seasonal surface UHI effects in China during 2003-2013, based on MODIS land surface temperature data, and analyzed the correlations between the UHI effect and its impact factors from both biophysical and biochemical perspectives. Our results show that MODIS-derived annual nighttime UHI effect (3.4 K +/- 0.2 K, mean +/- 1 s.e.) is higher than the annual mean daytime UHI effect (2.1 K +/- 0.3 K). The daytime UHI effect is strongest in summer and weakest in winter but contrasts with the seasonal variation characteristics of nighttime UHI effect. During daytime, UHI effects in humid and semi-humid regions are much more obvious than those in semi-arid/arid regions; during nighttime, the UHI effect in semi-humid and semi-arid/arid regions is much stronger than that in humid regions. A Daytime Urban Cool Island effect exists in semi-arid/arid regions during spring, autumn, and winter seasons. Population, vegetation activity, and irrigation are three factors controlling annual mean daytime UHI effect. The nighttime UHI is significantly influenced by latitude, albedo, precipitation, and aerosol concentrations. We provide evidence for a long-held hypothesis that the biogeochemical effect of urban aerosols is an important contributor to the UHI effect. The important role played by rural background environment in calculating the UHI effect is further discussed in terms of surface aerodynamic roughness and the contrast in albedo between urban and rural areas. Mitigation of haze pollution has a co-benefit of reducing the UHI effect and heat stress for urban dwellers. It is also conducive to reducing negative impacts of regional and global climate change.

TI  - Numerical modeling of possible lower ionospheric anomalies associated with Nepal earthquake in May, 2015
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present perturbations due to seismo-ionospheric coupling processes in propagation characteristics of sub-ionospheric Very Low Frequency (VLF) signals received at Ionospheric & Earthquake Research Centre (IERC) (Lat. 22.50 degrees N, Long. 87.48 degrees E), India. The study is done during and prior to an earthquake of Richter scale magnitude M = 7.3 occurring at a depth of 18 km at southeast of Kodari, Nepal on 12 May 2015 at 12:35:19 IST (07:05:19 UT). The recorded VLF signal of Japanese transmitter JJI at frequency 22.2 kHz (Lat. 32.08 degrees N, Long. 130.83 degrees E) suffers from strong shifts in sunrise and sunset terminator times towards nighttime starting from three to four days prior to the earthquake. The signal shows a similar variation in terminator times during a major aftershock of magnitude M = 6.7 on 16 May, 2015 at 17:04:10 IST (11:34:10 UT). These shifts in terminator times is numerically modeled using Long Wavelength Propagation Capability (LWPC) Programme. The unperturbed VLF signal is simulated by using the day and night variation of reflection height (h') and steepness parameter (beta) fed in LWPC for the entire path. The perturbed signal is obtained by additional variation of these parameters inside the earthquake preparation zone. It is found that the shift of the terminator time towards nighttime happens only when the reflection height is increased. We also calculate electron density profile by using the Wait's exponential formula for specified location over the propagation path. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Male and female face of Machiavellianism: Opportunism or anxiety?
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between Machiavellianism and emotion management features is highly debated. In our study we try to clarify the controversial findings by highlighting the role of gender differences. Three studies with different (undergraduate and employed) participants were conducted to investigate gender differences in Machiavellianism-related personality characteristics. We used different measures of Machiavellianism and explored their connection with temperament and character traits (Study 1), with scales of six-factor (HEXACO) model of personality (Study 2), and with different types of psychopathy and narcissism (Study 3). Our results show that there are gender differences in the connection of Machiavellianism and other personality traits, and that most of the differences were found in the field of emotion management. We found that women's Machiavellian ism scores were correlated with harm avoidant, anxious, vulnerable, hypersensitive features, while Machiavellianism among men was associated with risk taking, self-confidence, and an opportunistic worldview.

TI  - Serological diagnosis of <i>Taenia solium</i> in pigs: No measurable circulating antigens and antibody response following exposure to <i>Taenia saginata</i> oncospheres
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis is a zoonosis included in the WHO's list of neglected tropical diseases. Accurate diagnostic tools for humans and pigs are needed to monitor intervention outcomes. Currently used diagnostic tools for porcine cysticercosis all have drawbacks. Serological tests are mainly confronted with problems of specificity. More specifically, circulating antigen detecting tests cross-react with Taenia hydatigena and the possibility of transient antigens as a result of aborted infections is suspected. Furthermore, the hypothesis has been raised that hatched ingested eggs of other Taenia species may lead to a transient antibody response or to the presence of circulating antigen detectable by serological tests used for porcine cysticercosis. Here we describe the results of a study that consisted of oral administration of Taenia saginata eggs to five piglets followed by serological testing during five weeks and necropsy aiming at studying possible cross reactions in serological tests used for porcine cysticercosis. The infectivity of the eggs was verified by in vitro hatching and by experimental infection of a calf. One piglet developed acute respiratory disease and died on day 6 post infection. The remaining four piglets did not show any clinical signs until euthanasia. None of the serum samples from four piglets collected between days 0 and 35 post infection gave a positive reaction in the B158/B60 Ag-ELISA and in a commercial Western blot for antibody detection. In conclusion, this study showed that experimental exposure of four pigs to T. saginata eggs did not result in positive serologies for T. solium. These results may help interpreting serological results in monitoring of T. solium control programmes.

TI  - High solar photovoltaic penetration in the absence of substantial wind capacity: Storage requirements and effects on capacity adequacy
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is increasing in many countries, with significant implications for the adequacy and operation of power systems. This work considers the Nord bidding zone within Italy, which hosts 7.7 GW of PV and almost no wind power. We simulate the implications of different PV penetration levels on the need for firm generation capacity and on ramping requirements over one to several hours. We compare ten years of synthetic hourly PV generation series derived from CM-SAF SARAH satellite data and observed load. The analysis also provides insights into the storage capacity required to smooth residual load over different time horizons. Results show that without storage (i) the penetration of PV in the region does not sensibly reduce the need for firm generation; (ii) the marginal contribution of PV to meet power demand decreases with its penetration; and (iii) high penetrations lead to larger and more frequent ramps, although extreme ramp rates do not last more than 1 h. The availability of storage significantly alters these results, but large storage capacities are required. Smoothing net load by a few hours requires 2-7 GWh of storage per GW of PV installed.

TI  - Double disparities in the health care for people with schizophrenia of an ethnic-national minority
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies have shown health care disparities among persons of minority status, including in countries with universal health care. Yet, a dearth of studies have addressed disparities resulting from the combined effect of two minority status groups: severe mental illness and ethnic-national sector filiation. This study aimed to compare the differential health care of Jewish-and Arab-Israelis with schizophrenia in a country with a universal health insurance.Method: This study builds on a large case-control epidemiological sample (N = 50,499) of Jewish- (92.9%) and Arab-Israelis (7.1%) service users with (n = 16,833) and without schizophrenia (n = 33,666). Health services records were collected in the years 2000-2009. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) served as sentinel diseases. We compared annual number of LDL tests and visits to specialists in the entire sample, Hemoglobin-A1C test among people diagnosed with diabetes, and cardiac surgical interventions for those diagnosed with CVD.Results: Service users with schizophrenia were less likely to meet identical indexes of care as their study counterparts: 95% of cholesterol tests (p < .001), and 92% visits to specialists (p < .001). These differences were greater among Arab-compared to Jewish-Israelis. Annual frequency of Hemoglobin-A1C test among people diagnosed with diabetes was lower (94%) in people with schizophrenia (p < 0.01), but no ethnic-national differences were identified. Among service users with CVD less surgical interventions were done in people with schizophrenia (70%) compared to their counterparts, with no ethnic-national disparities.Conclusions: In Israel, service users with schizophrenia fail to receive equitable levels of medical and cardiac surgical care for CVD and regular laboratory tests for diabetes. Although disparities in some health indicators were enhanced among Arab-Israelis, schizophrenia was a greater source of disparities than ethnic-national filiation.

TI  - Comparison of different satellite bands and vegetation indices for estimation of soil organic matter based on simulated spectral configuration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter content (SOM) is an important indicator of soil productivity that governs biological, chemical, and physical processes in the soil environment. Previous studies have shown that remote sensing data provide useful information for SOM estimation in different soil types. However, no studies have estimated SOM based on simulated spectral configurations of different satellite sensors. Further study is required to investigate whether SOM estimation accuracy can be improved by combining data from different satellite sensors and developing appropriate algorithms. Therefore, this study investigated new methods for SOM estimation with the following three objectives: (1) analyze the reflectance changes of simulated bands for different SOMs using the spectral response function of various satellite sensors; (2) develop optimal difference index (ODI), optimal ratio index (ORI), optimal normalized vegetation difference index (ONDVI), and optimal enhanced vegetation index (OEVI) algorithms for estimating SOM based on simulated band reflectance; (3) evaluate all bands, ODI, ORI, ONDVI, and OEVI for all simulated bands derived from the data of each satellite, and then combine the simulated data to estimate SOM using the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The OEVI analysis of simulated WorldView-2 data provided the best SOM estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.43 and RMSE = 2.62%). The OEVI and ODI algorithms provided better estimation accuracy of SOM from the different simulated satellite data than the ORI and ONDVI algorithms. The best estimation accuracy of SOM was achieved using the PSO-SVM algorithm and simulated WorldView-2 data (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.66%, and AIC = 99.62). Combination of simulated bands 4-9 of ASTER data and all bands, ODI, ORI, ONDVI, and OEVI of WorldView-2 data provided optimum SOM estimation results (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.41%, AIC = 82.86). The results indicate that a combination of different satellite data and the PSO-SVM algorithm significantly improves the estimation accuracy of SOM.

TI  - Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) susceptibility gene <i>PLEKHA7</i> encodes a novel Rac1/Cdc42 GAP that modulates cell migration and blood-aqueous barrier function
T2  - HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PLEKHA7, a gene recently associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), encodes an apical junctional protein expressed in components of the blood aqueous barrier (BAB). We found that PLEKHA7 is down-regulated in lens epithelial cells and in iris tissue of PACG patients. PLEKHA7 expression also correlated with the C risk allele of the sentinel SNP rs11024102 with the risk allele carrier groups having significantly reduced PLEKHA7 levels compared to non-risk allele carriers. Silencing of PLEKHA7 in human immortalized non-pigmented ciliary epithelium(h-iNPCE) and primary trabecular meshwork cells, which are intimately linked to BAB and aqueous humor outflow respectively, affected actin cytoskeleton organization. PLEKHA7 specifically interacts with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, and the activation status of the two small GTPases is linked to PLEKHA7 expression levels. PLEKHA7 stimulates Rac1 and Cdc42 GTP hydrolysis, without affecting nucleotide exchange, identifying PLEKHA7 as a novel Rac1/Cdc42 GAP. Consistent with the regulatory role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in maintaining the tight junction permeability, silencing of PLEKHA7 compromises the paracellular barrier between h-iNPCE cells. Thus, downregulation of PLEKHA7 in PACG may affect BAB integrity and aqueous humor outflow via its Rac1/Cdc42 GAP activity, thereby contributing to disease etiology.

TI  - Response of evapotranspiration to changes in land use and land cover and climate in China during 2001-2013
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface evapotranspiration (ET) is a central component of the Earth's global energy balance and water cycle. Understanding ET is important in quantifying the impacts of human influences on the hydrological cycle and thus helps improving water use efficiency and strengthening water use planning and watershed management. China has experienced tremendous land use and land cover changes (LUCC) as a result of urbanization and ecological restoration under a broad background of climate change. This study used MODIS data products to analyze how LUCC and climate change affected ET in China in the period 2001-2013. We examined the separate contribution to the estimated ET changes by combining LUCC and climate data. Results showed that the average annual ET in China decreased at a rate of -0.6 mm/yr from 2001 to 2013. Areas in which ET decreased significantly were mainly distributed in the northwest China, the central of southwest China, and most regions of south central and east China. The trends of four climatic factors including air temperature, wind speed, sunshine duration, and relative humiditywere determined, while the contributions of these four factors to ETwere quantified by combining the ET and climate datasets. Among the four climatic factors, sunshine duration and wind speed had the greatest influence on ET. LUCC data from 2001 to 2013 showed that forests, grasslands and croplands in China mutually replaced each other. The reduction of forests hadmuch greater effects on ET than change by other land cover types. Finally, through quantitative separation of the distinct effects of climate change and LUCC on ET, we conclude that climate change was the more significant than LULC change in influencing ET in China during the period 2001-2013. Effective water resource management and vegetation-based ecological restoration efforts in China must consider the effects of climate change on ET and water availability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping daily evapotranspiration based on spatiotemporal fusion of ASTER and MODIS images over irrigated agricultural areas in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of daily evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for allocating and managing water resources in irrigated agricultural areas in arid regions. In this study, continuous daily ET at a 90-m spatial resolution was estimated using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) by fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with high temporal resolution and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) images with high spatial resolution. The spatiotemporal characteristics of these sensors were obtained using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). The performance of this approach was validated over a heterogeneous oasis-desert region covered by cropland, residential, woodland, water, Gobi desert, sandy desert, desert steppe, and wetland areas using in situ observations from automatic meteorological systems (AMS) and eddy covariance (EC) systems in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. The error introduced during the data fusion process based on STARFM is within an acceptable range for predicted LST at a 90-m spatial resolution. The surface energy fluxes estimated using SEBS based on predicted remotely sensed data that combined the spatiotemporal characteristics of MODIS and ASTER agree well with the surface energy fluxes observed using EC systems for all land cover types, especially for vegetated area with MAP values range from 9% to 15%, which are less than the uncertainty (18%) of the observed lambda E in this study area. Time series of daily ET modelled from SEBS were compared to that modelled from PT-JPL (one of Satellite-based Priestley-Taylor ET model) and observations from EC systems. SEBS performed generally better than PT-JPL for vegetated area, especially irrigated cropland with bias, RMSE, and MAP values of 0.29 mm/d, 0.75 mm/d, 13% at maize site, -0.33 mm/d, 0.81 mm/d, and 14% at vegetable sites.

TI  - Conservation and relative habitat suitability for an arboreal mammal associated with old forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Contraction of native old forest can limit occurrence of old forest associated species, especially species with limited vagility. Patterns of size and distribution of remaining patches of old forest along with forest disturbance and what replaces old forest can influence whether species adapt or perish after forest loss. The arboreal red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) is a small arvicoline rodent that is associated with old coniferous forest and typically emigrates short distances. Since 1911, old forest (>= 80 years old) in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range has been reduced by >80%, primarily due to large stand replacing wildfires, timber harvest, and subsequent conversion to young forest (<80 years old). In 2011, the tree vole population in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range was listed as a candidate species as a distinct population segment under the United States Endangered Species Act, primarily due to habitat loss. We examined the contribution of current and historical (early 20th century) old forest cover, and recent disturbances (1984-2012) on relative habitat suitability for tree voles using light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat imagery, and machine learning. We used a step -wise variable removal procedure to build a parsimonious model and to rank contribution of variables in our final model. We further described the configuration of large patches of old forest using metrics of amount and distance from patch for historical, current, two forest loss scenarios, and two forest restoration scenarios within our study area. Red tree vole relative habitat suitability was positively correlated with current old forest cover at the local scale and negatively correlated with distance from large patches of current old forest. Landscape context, specifically proximity to old forest and absence of recent disturbance contributed most to relative habitat suitability of young forest matrix. If old forest contracted to only reserves on federal lands, amount would decrease from 10.9% to 9.5% and be spatially clumped with an increase in average distance to nearest patch from 3.1 km to 11.1 km. Alternatively, a random addition of patches equivalent to a 1.4% increase in amount, would reduce distance to nearest patch to 1.8 km. Given the history of large historical wildfires in the Oregon Coast Range, restoration of even a small amount of old forest throughout the study area would likely enhance connectivity and resiliency of red tree vole populations in the event of large-scale loss of old forest.

TI  - ICESat-derived lithospheric flexure as caused by an endorheic lake's expansion on the Tibetan Plateau and the comparison to modeled flexural responses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial and rapid expansion beginning in the late 1990s of Siling Co, the largest endorheic lake on the central Tibetan Plateau (TP), has caused a measurable lithospheric deflection in the region adjacent to the lake. Current broad-scale measuring of this flexural response is mainly derived from InSAR processing techniques or time-consuming field campaigns. The rheological constraints of the lithosphere from the underlying lithospheric response to large lake loads in this region are not well understood. This paper highlights a more efficient spaceborne LiDAR remote sensing technique to measure the deflection in the vicinity of Siling Co and to investigate the mechanisms of the observed lithospheric response in order to garner a better understanding of the local rheology. A lake-adjacent deflection rate and Siling Co water load variations are calculated utilizing the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and the joint NASA/USGS Landsat series of Earth observing satellites. A downward deflection rate of similar to 5.6 mm/yr for the first 4 km of lake-adjacent land is calculated from the GLAS instrument, and this response is compared to the flexural outputs from a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, elastic, and isotropic (SNREI) Earth model in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the lithospheric response to the rapid increase of Siling Co loads. The modeled elastic response is similar to 6.9 times lower than the GLAS derived flexure, thereby providing further evidence that a purely elastic lithospheric response cannot explain the deflection in this region. The relationship between the modeled elastic response and the GLAS derived flexure is applied to a long-term lake load change dataset to create the longest-running flexural response curve as caused by the last similar to 40 years of Siling Co load variations, and these results show an accumulated lake-adjacent flexure of similar to 12.6 cm from an overall lake load increase of 25.9 Gt. Our findings help to provide a better understanding of the lithospheric response to the recent expansion of Siling Co by introducing a new spaceborne laser altimeter derived technique to measure surface deformation caused by an extreme case of hydrologic loading.

TI  - Carbon sources and sinks of North America as affected by major drought events during the past 30 years
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The North American (NA) terrestrial biosphere has been a long-term carbon sink but impacts of climate extremes such as drought on ecosystem carbon exchange remain largely uncertain. Here, changes in biospheric carbon fluxes with recent climate change and impacts of the major droughts of the past 30 years on continental carbon cycle across NA were studied using a comprehensive mathematical process model, ecosys. In test of these model responses at continental scale, the spatial anomalies in modeled leaf area indices, fully prognostic in the model, from long-term (1980-2010) means during major drought events in 1988 and 2002 agreed well with those in AVHRR NDVI (R-2 = 0.84 in 1988, 0.71 in 2002). Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) modeled across NA declined by 92% (0.50 Pg C yr(-1)) and 90% (0.49 Pg C yr(-1)) from the long-term mean (+0.54 Pg C yr(-1)), in 1988 and 2002 respectively. These significant drops in NEP offset 28% of the carbon gains modeled over the last three decades. Although the long-term average modeled terrestrial carbon sink was estimated to offset similar to 30% of the fossil fuel emissions of NA, only 0.03% and 3.2% were offset in 1988 and 2002 leaving almost all fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. These major drought events controlled much of the continental-scale interannual variability and mainly occurred in parts of the Great Plains, southwest US and northern Mexico. Although warming in northern ecosystems caused increasing carbon sinks to be modeled as a result of greater gross primary productivity with longer growing seasons, elsewhere in the continent frequent drought events of the past 30 years reduced carbon uptake and hence net carbon sinks of the NA.

TI  - Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw6.3 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake of seismic moment magnitude (Mw)6.3 occurred in southern Taiwan on February 6th, 2016. In this paper, we use differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technology and data from the Sentinel-1A(S-1A)/IW radar satellite to estimate the coseismic deformation of this event. On the basis of ascending data, InSAR analysis reveals a circle-like uplift area, 45 km in diameter, 20 km northwest of the epicenter, that has a maximum line of sight (LOS) displacement of 12 cm. South and east of this uplift area, minor subsidence occurred, while descending data indicated uplift in the west and sink in the east, with maximum values of 8.0 cm and 6.0 cm, respectively. Displacements are continuously distributed across the entire deformed region, implying that the seismogenic fault did not pierce the Earth's surface. Based on these InSAR displacements coupled with GPS observations, we inverted the distribution of source slip using an elastic half-space fault model both separately and jointly. Four kinds of inversion results consistently show a slip concentration to the northwest of the epicenter, with maximum slip in the range 0.35-0.55 m confined to depths of 6-15 km in the crust. The source fault is dominated by thrust with left-lateral strike slip; joint inversion using InSAR ascending and. descending data, as well as GPS data, resulted in maximum slip of 0.44 m, within the range determined by separate inversions. Inversion results show that this was a Mw6.25 earthquake, consistent with measurements collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

TI  - Assessment of the SWAT model to simulate a watershed with limited available data in the Pampas region, Argentina
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products since the 1990s. The Carcarana River Lower Basin (CRLB), a cropland of the Pampas region supplied by extensive rainfall, is located in an area with few streamgauging and other hydrologic/water-quality stations. Therefore, limited hydrologic data are available resulting in limited water-resources assessment. This work explores the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to the CRLB in the Santa Fe province of the Pampas region. The analysis of field and remote-sensing data characterizing hydrology, water quality, soil types, land use/land cover, management practices, and crop yield, guarantee a comprehensive SWAT modeling approach. A combined manual and automated calibration and validation process incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed using information concerning interior watershed processes. Eleven N/P fertilizer rates are selected to simulate the impact of N fertilizer on crop yield, plant uptake, as well as runoff and leaching losses. Different indices (partial factor productivity, agronomic efficiency, apparent crop recovery efficiency of applied nutrient, internal utilization efficiency, and physiological efficiency) are considered to assess nitrogen-use efficiency. The overall quality of the fit is satisfactory considering the input data limitations. This work provides, for the first time in Argentina, a reliable tool to simulate yield response to soil quality and water availability capable to meet defined environmental targets to support decision making on planning public policies and private activities on the Pampas region.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Colorectal Cancer - First Experience.
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second commonest cancer in women, the third in men, being the fourth commonest cause of cancer death. The most important factor for prognosis and staging in CRC patients is the status of the regional lymph nodes (LN).AIM: To implement the method for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in CRC patients using radiocolloid, and test its detection rate, sensitivity, accuracy, negative predictive value and the possibility for upstaging.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 40 CRC patients, age 63 ± 14 years, without LNs detected on CT or MRI. SLN detection was performed after endoscopically peri- and intratumoral injection of 99mTc-SENTISCINT. All patients underwent resection with systemic lymphadenectomy, and the SLNs were detected ex vivo. Pathohistology was performed to all resected LNs.RESULTS: The identification rate was 95%, the accuracy of the procedure was 92.1%, the negative predictive value was 86.95%, the sensitivity was 83.3%, and the upstage was 22.5%.CONCLUSION: Identification of SLNs in CRC patients with this method is possible and the detection rate, negative predictive value, accuracy and sensitivity are reliable. We expect to contribute in the upstaging of stage II CRC patients and the selection of appropriate oncology treatment protocols.

TI  - Plasma blobs associated with plasma bubbles observed in the Brazilian sector
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present a case of plasma blobs associated with plasma bubbles which were observed by emission of OI 630.0 nm airglow, using ground-based (all-sky images) and DMSP-F15 satellite data on 23 February 2007, over a low latitude station Sao Jose dos Campos (SJC) (23.21 degrees S, 45.86 degrees W; dip latitude 18.3 degrees S) in the Brazilian sector. We calculated the zonal drift velocities of the plasma bubble and plasma blobs, and the longitudinal drift of the blobs that occurred that night using the linearization method presented by Pimenta et al. (2001). The north/south and east/west extensions of plasma blobs have also been estimated. The mean velocity of the plasma bubble is found to be 74 +/- 8 m/s and the plasma blob zonal drift is 61 +/- 6 m/s. The average velocity of the longitudinal drift of the plasma blob was 85 +/- 13 m/s and the analyzed blobs had the mean north/south extension of 591 km and east/west extension of 328 and 263 km.

TI  - One Step Surgery for Cutaneous Melanoma: "We Cannot Solve Our Problems with the Same Thinking We Used When We Created Them?"
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - One step melanoma surgery is, in fact, an innovative combined method for diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous melanoma (at the same time). The methodology allows an accurate assessment of the actual status of the affected patients by 1) clinical status, dermatoscopy, high-frequent ultrasonography (HFUS) of the pigmented lesion (eventually in combination with normal lymph nodes ultrasonography), followed by a single surgical intervention. Within this intervention, the primary tumour is removed with the appropriate surgical field, with or without parallel detection and draining lymph node biopsy (depending on the established tumour thickness). Removal of the lymph node may, in turn, be associated with or without locoregional lymphadenectomy, which is determined by its macroscopic appearance, established intraoperatively or after the histopathological evaluation. The methodology is sparing, innovative, easy to apply, tested in its functionality and logically justified. For an unknown reason, this methodology is not applicable in melanoma treatment's guidelines in Europe and America. In Bulgaria and France, however, there are centres and hospitals that apply the technique mentioned above with enormous results, in particular in Bulgaria, the methodology is getting more and more improved to the current moment. Based on the above, as well as on the scant experience, we may share the opinion that the current melanoma treatment's guidelines need major corrections in their recommendations, which are not optimal for patients due to the following facts: (1) the adverse effects on patients as a result of the necessity of at least 2 surgical interventions; (2) the frequent occurrence of changes in the lymph flow after the primary excision; (3) the frequent non-obtaining of the suggested in the guidelines terms for re-excisions with or without sentinel lymph node removal; and (4) the creation of additional financial difficulties for the patients in the framework of two unneeded hospitalizations.

TI  - Rapid drawdown of Antarctica's Wordie Ice Shelf glaciers in response to ENSO/Southern Annular Mode-driven warming in the Southern Ocean
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we investigate the largest acceleration in ice flow across all of Antarctica between similar to 2008 InSAR and 2014 Landsat velocity mappings. This occurred in glaciers that used to feed into the Wordie Ice Shelf on the west Antarctic Peninsula, which rapidly disintegrated in similar to 1989. Between 2008 and 2014, these glaciers experienced at least a threefold increase in surface elevation drawdown relative to the 2002-2008 time period. After similar to 20 yrs of relative stability, it is unlikely that the ice shelf collapse played a role in the large response. Instead, we find that the rapid acceleration and surface drawdown is linked to enhanced melting at the ice-ocean boundary, attributable to changes in winds driven by global atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), linking changes in grounded ice to atmospheric-driven ocean warming.

T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - PM10 samples were collected at the top of Jiuxian Mountain in Fujian Province from March 2011 to January 2012 and were analyzed for inorganic water-soluble ions and dicarboxylic acids to investigate their seasonal variations and sources. The results showed that PM10 and its associated species exhibited much higher levels in the spring than those in other seasons but the total contribution of the nine species of dicarboxylic acids to PM10 (0.51% +/- 0.41%) was significantly lower than that of the water-soluble ions (18.07% +/- 8.73%). The water-soluble ions were characterized by the highest concentrations of SO42- and NO3-, followed by Na+ and NH4+. Significant positive correlations were observed between cation and anion equivalents, as well as between NH4+ and SO42- or NO3- equivalents. Individual dicarboxylic acid showed a monotonically decreasing trend with increasing carbon number in which oxalic acid accounted for approximately 75% of the total dicarboxylic acids. Characteristic ratios of malonic acid to succinic acid and adipic acid to azelaic acid, MODIS fire spots, and backward trajectories showed that dicarboxylic acids mainly originated from secondary reactions in the atmosphere and that the direct contributions of open biomass burning to dicarboxylic acid concentrations were negligible.

TI  - Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world's tropical forests are a net carbon source of 425.2 +/- 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year(-1)). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 +/- 80.2 Tg C year(-1) and gains of 436.5 +/- 31.0 Tg C year(-1). Gains result from forest growth; losses result from deforestation and from reductions in carbon density within standing forests (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.

TI  - Vegetation classification of <i>Coffea</i> on Hawaii Island using WorldView-2 satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee is an important crop in tropical regions of the world; about 125 million people depend on coffee agriculture for their livelihoods. Understanding the spatial extent of coffee fields is useful for management and control of coffee pests such as Hypothenemus hampei and other pests that use coffee fruit as a host for immature stages such as the Mediterranean fruit fly, for economic planning, and for following changes in coffee agroecosystems over time. We present two methods for detecting Coffea arabica fields using remote sensing and geospatial technologies on WorldView-2 high-resolution spectral data of the Kona region of Hawaii Island. The first method, a pixel-based method using a maximum likelihood algorithm, attained 72% producer accuracy and 69% user accuracy (68% overall accuracy) based on analysis of 104 ground truth testing polygons. The second method, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method, considered both spectral and textural information and improved accuracy, resulting in 76% producer accuracy and 94% user accuracy (81% overall accuracy) for the same testing areas. We conclude that the OBIA method is useful for detecting coffee fields grown in the open and use it to estimate the distribution of about 1050 hectares under coffee agriculture in the Kona region in 2012.

TI  - Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage using two-dose or three-dose schedule criteria
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In October 2016, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendation to include a 2-dose schedule for U.S. adolescents initiating the vaccine series before their 15th birthday. We analyzed records for >4 million persons aged 9-17 years receiving any HPV vaccine by the end of each quarter during January 1, 2014-September 30, 2016 from six Immunization Information Systems Sentinel Sites, and reclassified HPV vaccination up-to-date coverage according to the updated recommendations. Compared with HPV vaccination up-to-date coverage by the 3-dose schedule only, including criteria for either a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule increased up-to-date coverage in 11-12, 13-14, and 15-17 year-olds by 4.5-8.5 percentage points. The difference between 3 dose up-to-date coverage and 2- or 3-dose up-to-date coverage was greatest in late 2016. These data provide baseline HPV vaccination coverage using current ACIP recommendations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced sea surface temperature due to kelp canopies
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of kelp canopies in the surface oceanic layer modifies the vertical distribution of solar radiation in the water column and thus the sea surface temperature (SST). We examined the modification of SST due to kelp using observational data and a 1-D mixed layer model. The observational data included SST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from Landsat 8 images from 2013 and 2014. Data analysis showed that SST in kelp forests is consistently higher than that in the ambient kelp-free waters and that the magnitude of SST increases with the increasing mean NDVI with a median value of (mean +/- SD) + 2.7 +/- 1.4 degrees C and a maximum asymptotic value of + 5.4 degrees C for an NDVI of 0.80. Using the mixed layer model, the effect of kelp on the vertical attenuation of solar radiation was simulated with an extinction depth derived from published field data. The model successfully captured the observed trend of increasing SST with NDVI. Analysis of the model result indicated that the increased absorption of solar heat caused by kelp changes the distribution of solar heating in the water column which enhances SST but leaves deeper temperatures relatively unaffected. Increased SST leads to a shallower upper mixed layer depth (MLD) and enhances the heat flux from ocean to atmosphere. However, SST in kelp areas may significantly drop below values in kelp-free waters due to strong vertical mixing events. Our study emphasizes the importance of kelp beds in regulating heat flux in coastal areas. While the model in this preliminary study captured some of the dynamics, the scatter of the SST observations for all NDVI values remains problematic. More in situ data-kelp concentrations, ocean current, and mixing strengths-and contemporaneous observations of NDVI would be valuable to determine if the scatter of SST about the empirical fit and model predictions could be reduced.

A two polarization combination of RISAT-1 backscatter, namely ratio (HH/HV) and difference (HH-HV), significantly enhanced the backscatter difference between rice and nonrice categories. With these inputs, a QUEST decision tree (DT) classifier is successfully employed to extract the spatial distribution of rice crop areas. The results showed the optimal polarization combination to be HH along with HH/HV and HH-HV for rice crop mapping with an accuracy of 88.57%. Results were further compared with a Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) optical sensor-derived rice crop map. Spatial agreement of almost 90% was achieved between outputs produced from Landsat-8 OLI and RISAT-1 data. The simplicity of the approach used in this work may serve as an effective tool for rice crop mapping. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Climate change-induced increases in precipitation are reducing the potential for solar ultraviolet radiation to inactivate pathogens in surface waters
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is accelerating the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to inland and coastal waters through increases in precipitation, thawing of permafrost, and changes in vegetation. Our modeling approach suggests that the selective absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) by DOM decreases the valuable ecosystem service wherein sunlight inactivates waterborne pathogens. Here we highlight the sensitivity of waterborne pathogens of humans and wildlife to solar UV, and use the DNA action spectrum to model how differences in water transparency and incident sunlight alter the ability of UV to inactivate waterborne pathogens. A case study demonstrates how heavy precipitation events can reduce the solar inactivation potential in Lake Michigan, which provides drinking water to over 10 million people. These data suggest that widespread increases in DOM and consequent browning of surface waters reduce the potential for solar UV inactivation of pathogens, and increase exposure to infectious diseases in humans and wildlife.

TI  - Three-Dimensional SERS Substrates Formed with Plasmonic Core-Satellite Nanostructures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate three-dimensional surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates formed by accumulating plasmonic nanostructures that are synthesized using a DNA-assisted assembly method. We densely immobilize Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on polymer beads to form core-satellite nanostructures for detecting molecules by SERS. The experimental parameters affecting the AuNP immobilization, including salt concentration and the number ratio of the AuNPs to the polymer beads, are tested to achieve a high density of the immobilized AuNPs. To create electromagnetic hot spots for sensitive SERS sensing, we add a Ag shell to the AuNPs to reduce the interparticle distance further, and we carefully adjust the thickness of the shell to optimize the SERS effects. In addition, to obtain sensitive and reproducible SERS results, instead of using the core-satellite nanostructures dispersed in solution directly, we prepare SERS substrates consisting of closely packed nanostructures by drying nanostructure-containing droplets on hydrophobic surfaces. The densely distributed small and well-controlled nanogaps on the accumulated nanostructures function as three-dimensional SERS hot spots. Our results show that the SERS spectra obtained using the substrates are much stronger and more reproducible than that obtained using the nanostructures dispersed in solution. Sensitive detection of melamine and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) are achieved using the SERS substrates.

TI  - Snow cover dynamics in Andean watersheds of Chile (32.0-39.5 °S) during the years 2000-2016
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Andean watersheds present important snowfall accumulation mainly during the winter, which melts during the spring and part of the summer. The effect of snowmelt on the water balance can be critical to sustain agriculture activities, hydropower generation, urban water supplies and wildlife. In Chile, 25% of the territory between the region of Valparaiso and Araucana comprises areas where snow precipitation occurs. As in many other difficult-to-access regions of the world, there is a lack of hydrological data of the Chilean Andes related to discharge, snow courses, and snow depths, which complicates the analysis of important hydrological processes (e.g. water availability). Remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to enhance the assessment and monitoring of the spatial and temporal variability of snow characteristics, such as the snow cover area (SCA) and snow cover dynamic (SCD). With regards to the foregoing questions, the objective of the study is to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the SCA at five watersheds (Aconcagua, Rapel, Maule, Biobio and Tolten) located in the Chilean Andes, between latitude 32.0 and 39.5 degrees S, and to analyse its relationship with the precipitation regime/pattern and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Those watersheds were chosen because of their importance in terms of their number of inhabitants, and economic activities depending on water resources. The SCA area was obtained from MOD10A2 for the period 2000-2016, and the SCD was analysed through a number of statistical tests to explore observed trends. In order to verify the SCA for trend analysis, a validation of the MOD10A2 product was done, consisting of the comparison of snow presence predicted by MODIS with ground observations. Results indicate that there is an overall agreement of 81 to 98% between SCA determined from ground observations and MOD10A2, showing that the MODIS snow product can be taken as a feasible remote sensing tool for SCA estimation in southern-central Chile. Regarding SCD, no significant reduction in SCA for the period 2000-2016 was detected, with the exception of the Aconcagua and Rapel watersheds. In addition to that, an important decline in SCA in the five watersheds for the period of 2012 and 2016 was also evident, which is coincidental with the rainfall deficit for the same years. Findings were compared against ENSO episodes that occurred during 2010-2016, detecting that Nina years are coincident with maximum SCA during winter in all watersheds.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variations of total column of CH4 and CO (TotCH(4) and TotCO) associated with the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan and 20 April 2013 Lushan earthquakes in western Sichuan, China were investigated using satellite data from AQUA AIRS in order to understand the lithospheric and atmospheric interactions during the seismic activity. The Wenchuan MS 8.0 and Lushan MS 7.0 earthquakes occurred in the Longmenshan fault zone. It was observed that large amounts of gases emitted from the earth's crust into the atmosphere before, during and after the earthquakes. The anomalies of TotCH4 and TotCO occurred along the fault zone, and the peak values were found at the intersection areas where the crust stress approached the maximum. Furthermore, temporal anomalies of TotCH4 and TotCO occurred during and after the Wenchuan earthquake, but 3 months before the Lushan earthquake. The anomalies related to the Lushan earthquake could be partially attributed to the Wenchuan earthquake because of the seismotectonic changes and fractures in the crust produced by the Wenchuan earthquake.

TI  - Overview of NASA's MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) snow-cover Earth System Data Records
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - Knowledge of the distribution, extent, duration and timing of snowmelt is critical for characterizing the Earth's climate system and its changes. As a result, snow cover is one of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) essential climate variables (ECVs). Consistent, long-term datasets of snow cover are needed to study interannual variability and snow climatology. The NASA snow-cover datasets generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are NASA Earth System Data Records (ESDR). The objective of the snow-cover detection algorithms is to optimize the accuracy of mapping snow-cover extent (SCE) and to minimize snow-cover detection errors of omission and commission using automated, globally applied algorithms to produce SCE data products. Advancements in snow-cover mapping have been made with each of the four major reprocessings of the MODIS data record, which extends from 2000 to the present. MODIS Collection 6 (C6; https://nsidc.org/data/modis/data_summaries) and VIIRS Collection 1 (C1; https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP10.001) represent the state-of-the-art global snow-cover mapping algorithms and products for NASA Earth science. There were many revisions made in the C6 algorithms which improved snow-cover detection accuracy and information content of the data products. These improvements have also been incorporated into the NASA VIIRS snow-cover algorithms for C1. Both information content and usability were improved by including the Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) and a quality assurance (QA) data array of algorithm processing flags in the data product, along with the SCE map. The increased data content allows flexibility in using the datasets for specific regions and end-user applications. Though there are important differences between the MODIS and VIIRS instruments (e.g., the VIIRS 375m native resolution compared to MODIS 500 m), the snow detection algorithms and data products are designed to be as similar as possible so that the 16+ year MODIS ESDR of global SCE can be extended into the future with the S-NPP VIIRS snow products and with products from future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) platforms. These NASA datasets are archived and accessible through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification assay is an accurate technique for sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer patients: a meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To estimate the accuracy of one- step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay as an intra- operative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer.Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched by two independent reviewers to retrieve literature with per-patient analysis. The deadline was up until December 2016. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA, MetaDisc, and Revman software. A random-effects model was used and subgroup analysis was carried out to identify possible sources of heterogeneity.Results: According to the inclusion criteria, 2833 patients from 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and the area under the sROC curve (AUC) for detecting SLN metastasis were 0.87 (95% CI 0.81-0.91), 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.95), 10.65 (95% CI 6.18-18.34), 0.14 (95% CI 0.10-0.20), 75.08 (95% CI 37.77-149.22) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.95), respectively.Conclusions: The present study adds the evidence that OSNA assay is an accurate molecular diagnostic tool for intra-operatively detecting SLN metastasis in breast cancer. One-step nucleic acid amplification assay might be introduced into clinical usage for replacing traditional intro-operative diagnostic methods of SLNB.

TI  - Intraoperative Radiation for Breast Cancer with Intrabeam™: Factors Associated with Decreased Operative Times in Patients Having IORT for Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Intraoperative radiation with Intrabeam (TM) (IORT) for breast cancer is a newer technology recently implemented into the operating room (OR). This procedure requires time and coordination between the surgeon and radiation oncologist, who both perform their treatments in a single operative setting. We evaluated the surgeons at our center, who perform IORT and their OR times to examine changes in OR times following implementation of this new surgical procedure. We hypothesized that IORT is a technique for which timing could be improved with the increasing number of cases performed.Methods: A prospectively maintained IRB approved database was queried for OR times (incision and close) in patients who underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS), sentinel lymph node biopsy with and without IORT using the Intrabeam (TM) system at our institution from 2011 to 2015. The total OR times were compared for each surgeon individually and over time. Next, the OR times of each surgeon were compared to each other. Continuous variables were summarized and then a prediction model was created using IORT time, OR time, surgeon, and number of cases performed.Results: There were five surgeons performing IORT at our institution during this time period with a total of 96 cases performed. There was a significant difference observed in baseline surgeon-specific OR time for BSC (p = 0.03) as well as for BCS with IORT (p < 0.05), attributable to surgeon experience. The average BCS times were faster than the BCS plus IORT procedure times for all surgeons. The overall mean OR time for the entire combined surgical and radiation procedure was 135.5 min. The most common applicator sizes used were the 3.5 and 4 cm, yielding an average 21 min IORT time. Applicator choice did not differ over time (p = 0.189). After adjusting for IORT time and surgeon, the prediction model estimated that surgeons decreased the total BCS plus IORT OR time at a rate of -4.5 min per each additional 10 cases performed.Conclusion: Surgeon experience and applicator size are related to OR times for performing IORT for breast cancer. OR time for IORT in breast cancer treatment can be improved over time, even among experienced surgeons.

TI  - Squamous cell carcinoma DNA detection using ultrabright SERS nanorattles and magnetic beads for head and neck cancer molecular diagnostics
T2  - ANALYTICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - A rise in head and neck cancers in low and middle countries over recent years has prompted the need for low-cost, resource-efficient diagnostic technologies. Standard diagnosis with histopathology is often not feasible due to the low number of trained pathologists in these regions, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. This study presents an alternative diagnostic method to standard histopathology. We developed a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based method to distinguish squamous cell carcinoma from other cell lines. Using a "sandwich" method employing ultrabright SERS nanorattles and magnetic beads, we directly targeted specific nucleic acid markers of squamous cells. Our method was able to detect the presence of squamous cells with high sensitivity and specificity, supporting its potential for use as a diagnostic tool in head and neck fine needle aspirations (FNA).

TI  - Internal mammary lymph nodes radiotherapy of breast cancer in the era of individualized medicine
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Review
AB  - Inclusion internal mammary lymph nodes as a part of regional nodal irradiation have a potential to reduce local recurrence, distant recurrence, and improve survival in breast cancer. However, the increased risk of cardiac toxicity and lungs injure associated with internal mammary lymph nodes irradiation has drew more and more attention. Estimating risk of metastasis in internal mammary lymph nodes based on axillary lymph nodes metastasis status is not always reliable: low-risk do not always mean negative in internal mammary lymph nodes and high-risk do not always indicate positive in internal mammary lymph nodes. Inaccurate prediction of in internal mammary lymph nodes metastasis might lead to over- or under-treatment of in internal mammary lymph node. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy is a minimally invasive technique which has a high potential to accurately evaluate the metastasis status in in internal mammary lymph nodes and improve accuracy of nodal staging. This technique might be a useful tool to guide individualized internal mammary lymph nodes irradiation.

TI  - Development of a simulation environment to support intercalibration studies over the Algodones Dunes system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of sensors to detect changes in the Earth's environment is dependent on retrieving radiometrically consistent and calibrated measurements from its surface. Intercalibration provides consistency among satellite instruments and ensures fidelity of scientific information. Intercalibration is especially important for spaceborne satellites without any on-board calibration, as accuracy of instruments is significantly affected by changes that occur postlaunch. To better understand the key parameters that impact the intercalibration process, this paper describes a simulation environment that was developed to support the primary mission of the Algodones Dunes campaign. Specifically, measurements obtained from the campaign were utilized to create a synthetic landscape to assess the feasibility of using the Algodones Dunes system as an intercalibration site for spaceborne instruments. The impact of two key parameters (differing view-angles and temporal offsets between instruments) on the intercalibration process was assessed. Results of these studies indicate that although the accuracy of intercalibration is sensitive to these parameters, proper knowledge of their impact leads to situations that minimize their effect. This paper concludes with a case study that addresses the feasibility of performing intercalibration on the International Space Station's platform to support NASA's CLARREO, the climate absolute radiance and refractivity observatory, mission.

TI  - A Smart Card-Based Electronic School Absenteeism System for Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance in Hong Kong: Design, Implementation, and Feasibility Assessment.
T2  - JMIR public health and surveillance
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: School-aged children have the highest incidence of respiratory virus infections each year, and transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus can be a major concern in school settings. School absenteeism data have been employed as a component of influenza surveillance systems in some locations. Data timeliness and system acceptance remain as key determinants affecting the usefulness of a prospective surveillance system.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic school absenteeism surveillance system using smart card-based technology for influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance among a representative network of local primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong.METHODS: We designed and implemented a surveillance system according to the Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER). We employed an existing smart card-based education and school administration platform for data capture, customized the user interface, and used additional back end systems built for other downstream surveillance steps. We invited local schools to participate and collected absenteeism data by the implemented system. We compared temporal trend of the absenteeism data with data from existing community sentinel and laboratory surveillance data.RESULTS: We designed and implemented an ILI surveillance system utilizing smart card-based attendance tracking approach for data capture. We implemented the surveillance system in a total of 107 schools (including 66 primary schools and 41 secondary schools), covering a total of 75,052 children. The system successfully captured information on absences for 2 consecutive academic years (2012-2013 and 2013-2014). The absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community, with an upsurge in disease activity detected up to 1 to 2 weeks preceding other existing surveillance systems.CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a novel smart card technology-based school absenteeism surveillance system. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of building a large-scale surveillance system riding on a routinely adopted data collection approach and the use of simple system enhancement to minimize workload implication and enhance system acceptability. Data from this system have potential value in supplementing existing sentinel influenza surveillance for situational awareness of influenza activity in the community.

TI  - Simulating the impact of climate change on the growth of Chinese fir plantations in Fujian province, China
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Climate change represents a considerable source of uncertainty with respect to the long-term health and productivity of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantations in southeastern China.Methods: We employed the process-based, stand-level model FORECAST Climate to investigate the potential impact of four alternative climate-change scenarios on the long-term growth and development of Chinese fir plantations in Fujian province, China. The capability of the model to project seasonal patterns of productivity related to variation in temperature and moisture availability was evaluated using 11 years of 8-day composite MODIS remote sensing data.Results: Simulation results suggest climate change will lead to a modest increase in long-term stemwood biomass production (6.1 to 12.1% after 30 to 60 years). The positive impact of climate change was largely attributable to both a lengthening of the growing season and an increase in nutrient-cycling rates. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the different emission scenarios led to an increase in water-use efficiency and a small increase in productivity. While the model predicted an overall increase in dry-season moisture stress, it did not predict increased levels of drought-related mortality.Conclusions: Climate change is expected have positive impact on the growth of Chinese fir in the Fujian region of China. However, the projected increase in plantation productivity associated with climate change may not be realised if the latter also results in enhanced activity of biotic and abiotic disturbance agents.

TI  - Historic flood events in NE Romania (post-1990)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using open-source satellite imagery like Landsat TM, ETM+ and Sentinel 2 can lead to accurate cartographic products. We mapped flood events from Siret and Prut river basins in the last 30 years based on the availability of Landsat data archive. In this area were recorded historical values in flow rates for the entire Romanian territory: 4650m(3)/s on the Siret River in 2005 - the maximum value ever recorded for Romania; 4240m(3)/s on the Prut in 2008 - second maximum value recorded for Romania. The most powerful floods that took place in Romania in the last years were in 1970, 1975, 1991, 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2011. In this study four years are distinguished by particularly characteristics: 1991, 2005, 2008 and 2010. Developing geo-hydrological hazard maps and adequate analysis at an appropriate scale and as quickly as possible is extremely important from an economic and social point of view.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of High Mountain Asia's snowmelt season identified with an automated snowmelt detection algorithm, 1987-2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - High Mountain Asia (HMA) - encompassing the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountain ranges - is the primary water source for much of Asia, serving more than a billion downstream users. Many catchments receive the majority of their yearly water budget in the form of snow, which is poorly monitored by sparse in situ weather networks. Both the timing and volume of snowmelt play critical roles in downstream water provision, as many applications - such as agriculture, drinking-water generation, and hydropower - rely on consistent and predictable snowmelt runoff. Here, we examine passive microwave data across HMA with five sensors (SSMI, SSMIS, AMSR-E, AMSR2, and GPM) from 1987 to 2016 to track the timing of the snowmelt season - defined here as the time between maximum passive microwave signal separation and snow clearance. We validated our method against climate model surface temperatures, optical remote-sensing snow-cover data, and a manual control dataset (n = 2100, 3 variables at 25 locations over 28 years); our algorithm is generally accurate within 3-5 days. Using the algorithm-generated snowmelt dates, we examine the spatiotemporal patterns of the snowmelt season across HMA. The climatically short (29-year) time series, along with complex interannual snowfall variations, makes determining trends in snowmelt dates at a single point difficult. We instead identify trends in snowmelt timing by using hierarchical clustering of the passive microwave data to determine trends in self-similar regions. We make the following four key observations. (1) The end of the snowmelt season is trending almost universally earlier in HMA (negative trends). Changes in the end of the snowmelt season are generally between 2 and 8 days decade 1 over the 29-year study period (5-25 days total). The length of the snowmelt season is thus shrinking in many, though not all, regions of HMA. Some areas exhibit later peak signal separation (positive trends), but with generally smaller magnitudes than trends in snowmelt end. (2) Areas with long snowmelt periods, such as the Tibetan Plateau, show the strongest compression of the snowmelt season (negative trends). These trends are apparent regardless of the time period over which the regression is performed. (3) While trends averaged over 3 decades indicate generally earlier snowmelt seasons, data from the last 14 years (2002-2016) exhibit positive trends in many regions, such as parts of the Pamir and Kunlun Shan. Due to the short nature of the time series, it is not clear whether this change is a reversal of a long-term trend or simply interannual variability. (4) Some regions with stable or growing glaciers - such as the Karakoram and Kunlun Shan - see slightly later snowmelt seasons and longer snowmelt periods. It is likely that changes in the snowmelt regime of HMA account for some of the observed heterogeneity in glacier response to climate change. While the decadal increases in regional temperature have in general led to earlier and shortened melt seasons, changes in HMA's cryosphere have been spatially and temporally heterogeneous.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness in the Central African Republic, 2010-2015
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza-like illness (ILI) is an important public health problem worldwide. In the Central African Republic, acute infectious diseases are the commonest reason for consultation. The Institut Pasteur of Bangui set up a surveillance network in 2008 to monitor the circulation of influenza viruses. We report the results of use of this surveillance system during the period 2010-2015.Methods: The first surveillance centre covered Bangui, the capital of the country, and neighbouring areas and epidemiological data on syndromes similar to ILI. Throat and nasopharyngeal swab samples are transmitted weekly to the Institut Pasteur of Bangui, where real-time and multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used to detect and subtype influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. The demographic characteristics of all patients and of positive cases according to age and the seasonal patterns of influenza virus circulation were analysed.Results: Between January 2010 and December 2015, 5385 throat swabs were collected; 454 (8.4%) of the samples were positive. Of these, 450 yielded at least one influenza virus and four showed co-infections. Children under the age of 5 years were the most frequently infected (257/ 450, 57.1%), with irregular peaks of ILI. Influenza B predominated (56.2%; n = 201), with 39.0% H3N2 and 16.7% H1N1pdm09. Influenza viruses were detected mainly in the rainy season (July-December).Conclusion: The sentinel surveillance site is yielding important information about the seasonality and age pattern of circulating influenza virus. Nationwide distribution of sentinel sites is warranted.

TI  - Specific Pathogen Recognition by Multiple Innate Immune Sensors in an Invertebrate
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of pathogens by all living organisms is the primary step needed to implement a coherent and efficient immune response. This implies a mediation by different soluble and/or membrane-anchored proteins related to innate immune receptors called PRRs (pattern-recognition receptors) to trigger immune signaling pathways. In most invertebrates, their roles have been inferred by analogy to those already characterized in vertebrate homologs. Despite the induction of their gene expression upon challenge and the presence of structural domains associated with the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns in their sequence, their exact role in the induction of immune response and their binding capacity still remain to be demonstrated. To this purpose, we developed a fast interactome approach, usable on any host-pathogen couple, to identify soluble proteins capable of directly or indirectly detecting the presence of pathogens. To investigate the molecular basis of immune recognition specificity, different pathogens (Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteus; Gram-negative, Escherichia coli; yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and metazoan parasites, Echinostoma caproni or Schistosoma mansoni) were exposed to hemocyte-free hemolymph from the gastropod Biomphalaria glabrata. Twenty-three different proteins bound to pathogens were identified and grouped into three different categories based on their primary function. Each pathogen was recognized by a specific but overlapping set of circulating proteins in mollusk's hemolymph. While known PRRs such as C-type lectins were identified, other proteins not known to be primarily involved in pathogen recognition were found, including actin, tubulin, collagen, and hemoglobin. Confocal microscopy and specific fluorescent labeling revealed that extracellular actin present in snail hemolymph was able to bind to yeasts and induce their clotting, a preliminary step for their elimination by the snail immune system. Aerolysin-like proteins (named biomphalysins) were the only ones involved in the recognition of all the five pathogens tested, suggesting a sentinel role of these horizontally acquired toxins. These findings highlight the diversity and complexity of a highly specific innate immune sensing system. It paves the way for the use of such approach on a wide range of host-pathogen systems to provide new insights into the specificity and diversity of immune recognition by innate immune systems.

TI  - Water extraction technique in mountainous areas from satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water monitoring is an important part of water resource management and has become an essential aspect of remote sensing. A number of indices have been developed for water extraction using satellite images. Even though all indices can extract the extent of a water body, none can do so without including a noise component, such as topographic shadows, cloud shadows, snow, ice, and buildup areas, all of which have spectrally similar characteristics under certain circumstances. In order to select the best index for water body extraction, several water indices have been compared. This paper proposes a method for extracting water bodies called the water extraction surface temperature index (WESTI). This method uses normalized difference water index (NDWI) and land surface temperature to eliminate the noise components, especially in mountainous and cold areas where other indices have very low accuracy. The results have shown that WESTI improves the NDWI results by removing more than 80% of topographic shadows, with an overall accuracy of 99% in all cases.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of relative geolocation accuracy of the TerraSAR-X enhanced ellipsoid corrected product
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution commercial synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites with resolutions of several meters have recently been used for effective disaster monitoring. One study reported the earthquake's displacement using the pixel matching method with both pre-and postevent TerraSAR-X data, with a validated accuracy of similar to 30 cm at global navigation satellite system (GNSS) Earth observation network (GEONET) reference points. However, it is insufficient to determine the accuracy using analysis of only a couple of data points per orbit. In addition, the errors were not reported because the number of data samples was too small to discuss the statistics. In order to better understand displacement accuracy, we analyzed displacement features using the pixel matching method to evaluate the relative geolocation accuracies of the TerraSAR-X product. First, we used fast Fourier transform oversampling 16 times to develop the pixel matching method for estimating the displacement at the subpixel level using the TerraSAR-X StripMap dataset. Second, we applied this methodology to 20 pairs of images from the Tokyo metropolitan area and calculated the displacement for each image pair. Third, we conducted spatial and temporal analyses in order to understand the displacement features. Finally, we evaluated the displacement accuracy by comparison with GEONET and solid earth tide data as a reference. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - High resolution remote sensing for reducing uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset life cycle assessments
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Urban forests reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing and sequestering considerable amounts of carbon. However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany.Main text: Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time.Conclusions: Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that.

TI  - Modelling patterns of pollinator species richness and diversity using satellite image texture
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing species richness and diversity on the basis of standardised field sampling effort represents a cost-and time-consuming method. Satellite remote sensing (RS) can help overcome these limitations because it facilitates the collection of larger amounts of spatial data using cost-effective techniques. RS information is hence increasingly analysed to model biodiversity across space and time. Here, we focus on image texture measures as a proxy for spatial habitat heterogeneity, which has been recognized as an important determinant of species distributions and diversity. Using bee monitoring data of four years (2010-2013) from six 4 x 4 km field sites across Central Germany and a multimodel inference approach we test the ability of texture features derived from Landsat-TM imagery to model local pollinator biodiversity. Textures were shown to reflect patterns of bee diversity and species richness to some extent, with the first-order entropy texture and terrain roughness being the most relevant indicators. However, the texture measurements accounted for only 3-5% of up to 60% of the variability that was explained by our final models, although the results are largely consistent across different species groups (bumble bees, solitary bees). While our findings provide indications in support of the applicability of satellite imagery textures for modeling patterns of bee biodiversity, they are inconsistent with the high predictive power of texture metrics reported in previous studies for avian biodiversity. We assume that our texture data captured mainly heterogeneity resulting from landscape configuration, which might be functionally less important for wild bees than compositional diversity of plant communities. Our study also highlights the substantial variability among taxa in the applicability of texture metrics for modelling biodiversity.

TI  - Zika beyond the Americas: Travelers as sentinels of Zika virus transmission. A GeoSentinel analysis, 2012 to 2016
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in Africa; decades later, caused large outbreaks in the Pacific, and is considered endemic in Asia. We aim to describe ZIKV disease epidemiology outside the Americas, the importance of travelers as sentinels of disease transmission, and discrepancies in travel advisories from major international health organizations.Methods and findingsThis descriptive analysis using GeoSentinel Surveillance Network records involves sixty-four travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries. Ill returned travelers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of ZIKV disease acquired in Africa, Asia and the Pacific seen between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 are included, and the frequencies of demographic, trip, and diagnostic characteristics described. ZIKV was acquired in Asia (18), the Pacific (10) and Africa (1). For five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cameroon), GeoSentinel patients were sentinel markers of recent Zika activity. Additionally, the first confirmed ZIKV infection acquired in Kiribati was reported to GeoSentinel (2015), and a probable case was reported from Timor Leste (April 2016), representing the only case known to date. Review of Zika situation updates from major international health authorities for country risk classifications shows heterogeneity in ZIKV country travel advisories.ConclusionsTravelers are integral to the global spread of ZIKV, serving as sentinel markers of disease activity. Although GeoSentinel data are collected by specialized clinics and do not capture all imported cases, we show that surveillance of imported infections by returned travelers augments local surveillance system data regarding ZIKV epidemiology and can assist with risk categorization by international authorities. However, travel advisories are variable due to risk uncertainties.

TI  - Predicting level 2 axillary lymph node metastasis in a Chinese breast cancer population post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy: development and assessment of a new predictive nomogram
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to develop a new nomogram to predict the probability of level 2 axillary lymph node metastasis (L-2-ALNM) in breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Methods: Data were collected from 709 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then underwent axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection between May 2009 and December 2015 at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital. The level 2 axillary lymph node metastasis (L-2-ALNM) nomogram was created from the logistic regression model. An additional set of 141 consecutive patients treated at the same institution between January 2015 and December 2015 were enrolled as the validation group. The predictive accuracy of the L-2-ALNM nomogram was measured by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Results: In multivariate analysis, age, tumor size, histological grade, skin invasion, and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were identified as independent predictors of L-2-ALNM. The new model was accurate and discriminating for both the modeling and validation groups (AUC: 0.819 vs 0.849). The false-negative rates of the L-2-ALNM nomogram were 4.44% and 7.69% for the predicted probability cut-off points of 10% and 20%.Conclusion: The L-2-ALNM nomogram shows reasonable accuracy for making clinical decisions. The omission of level 2 axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be possible if the probability of level 2 lymph node involvement was < 10% or < 20% in accordance with the acceptable risk determined by medical staff and patients.

TI  - Awareness and current knowledge of breast cancer
T2  - BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health dilemma and is currently the most common tumour in the globe. Awareness of breast cancer, public attentiveness, and advancement in breast imaging has made a positive impact on recognition and screening of breast cancer. Breast cancer is life-threatening disease in females and the leading cause of mortality among women population. For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer has guided to astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in further proficient treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer is considered as one of the leading cause of death in post menopausal women accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it is diagnosed in their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding the self inspection and clinical examination of the breast. This review addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, pathogenesis of breast cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary therapies, gene therapy and stem- cell therapy etc for breast cancer.

TI  - Ocean color retrieval from MWI onboard the Tiangong-2 Space Lab: preliminary results
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate-resolution Wide-wavelengths Imager (MWI) is the ocean color sensor onboard the Chinese Tiangong-2 Space Lab, which was launched on Sept. 15, 2016. The MWI is also an experimental satellite sensor for the Chinese next generation ocean color satellites, HY-1E and HY-1F, which are scheduled for launch around 2021. With 100m spatial resolution and 18 bands in the visible light and infrared wavelengths, MWI provides high quality ocean color observations especially over coastal and inland waters. For the first time, this study presents some important results on water color products generated from the MWI for the oceanic and inland waters. Preliminary validation in turbid coastal and inland waters showed good agreement between the MWI-retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances (Lwn) and in situ data. Further, the MWI-retrieved Lwn values compared well with the GOCI-retrieved Lwn values, with the correlation coefficient greater than 0.90 and mean relative differences smaller than 26.63% (413 nm), 4.72% (443 nm), 3.69% (490 nm), 7.15% (565 nm), 9.45% (665 nm), 8.11% (682.5 nm), 14.68% (750 nm) and 18.55% (865 nm). As for the Level 2 product (e.g, total suspended matter TSM) in turbid Yangtze River Estuary and Hangzhou Bay waters, the relative difference between MWI and GOCI-derived TSM values was similar to 18.59% with the correlation coefficient of 0.956. In open-oceanic waters, the retrieved MWI-Chla distributions were well consistent with the MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS Chla values products and resolved finer spatial structures of phytoplankton blooms. This study provides encouraging results for the MWI's performance and operational applications in oceanic and inland regions. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Estimation of chlorophyll concentration in waters near Hokkaido using the linear combination method
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - An inversion algorithm is implemented to retrieve the surface chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration using satellite observation data from the MODIS instrument. The algorithm employs a simple and flexible index (LCI) to combine with the Chl without explicit correction for aerosol scattering. To investigate the sensitivity of LCI to Chl and other influence factors, an oceanic radiative transfer model coupled with a comprehensive bio-optical module is developed. It is studied that the LCI is significantly linear to Chl and not sensitive to other influence factors, except in very low oceanic salinity or scattering angle conditions, where over a 12% relative difference of derived Chl exists. Inversion results show the retrieved Chl are highly consistent with the MODIS operational data products in waters near Hokkaido, with the correlation coefficient, root mean square deviation, and average percentage difference of 0.9702, 0.3756 mg m(-3), and 13.89%, respectively. Investigation of the validity of this algorithm with a variety of atmospheric conditions indicates that the residual influence of atmosphere on the LCI index, after Rayleigh scattering correction, is generally within +/- 0.001, allowing the retrieval error of Chl at less than 25% in most cases. A good comparison between retrieval and in situ measurements is also identified and implies that the retrieval accuracy via the LCI method depends on the linear combination coefficients used and the bio-optical module selected, while effects of polarization can be ignored.

TI  - Mapping <i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> (mesquite) in the semi-arid environment of South Africa using high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery and machine learning classifiers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid spread of the Prosopis species has caused considerable negative impacts to biodiversity across different landscapes. The invasive taxa of Prosopis is currently rated the world's top 100 unwanted species. However, the lack of up-to-date information about the spatial and temporal distribution of mesquite invasion has made the current control and monitoring methods unsuccessful. Consequently, detection and monitoring of Prosopis species is essential to provide reliable and accurate information about the spatial distribution and the level of invasive species dynamism into the native eco-community. This study investigates the ability of WorldView-2 imagery for mapping the invasion of P. glandulosa and coexistent indigenous species in the semi-arid region of Northern Cape Province, South Africa, using the random forest and support vector machines as classifiers. Our results show that the eight-band multi spectral WV-2 imagery is able to detect and distinguish P. glandulosa effectively from the three coexisting indigenous species of acacia, with an overall accuracy of 86% at 2 m spatial resolution. This result shows that high-accuracy can be achieved with the multispectral WV-2 sensor. This high-accuracy provides the possibility for economically-feasible mapping of the distribution and spread of invasive alien plants and assists with the restoration and conservation process.

TI  - Fracture mapping of lineaments and recognizing their tectonic significance using SPOT-5 satellite data: A case study from the Bajestan area, Lut Block, east of Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Syste'm Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) remote sensing satellite data have useful characteristics for lineament extraction and enhancement related to the tectonic evaluation of a region. In this study, lineament features in the Bajestan area associated with the tectonic significance of the Lut Block (LB), east Iran were mapped and characterized using SPOT-5 satellite data. The structure of the Bajestan area is affected by the activity of deep strike-slip faults in the boundary of the LB. Structural elements such as faults and major joints were extracted, mapped, and analyzed by the implementation of high-Pass and standard kernels (Threshold and Sobel) filters to bands 1, 2 and 3 of SPOT-5 Level 2 A scene product of the Bajestan area. Lineament map was produced by assigning resultant filter images to red-green-blue (RGB) colour combinations of three main directions such as N-S, E-W and NE-SW. Results derived from image processing technique and statistical assessment indicate that two main orientations, including NW-SE with N-110 azimuth and NE-SW with N-40 azimuth, were dominated in the Bajestan area. The NW-SE trend has a high frequency in the study area. Based on the results of remote sensing lineament analysis and fieldwork, two dextral and sinistral strike-slip components were identified as main fault trends in the Bajestan region. Two dextral faults have acted as the cause of shear in the south and north of the Bajestan granitoid mass. Furthermore, the results indicate that the most of the lineaments in this area are extensional fractures corresponding to both the dykes emplacement and hydrothermal alteration zones. The application of SPOT-5 satellite data for structural analysis in a study region has great capability to provide very useful information of a vast area with low cost and time-consuming.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Quantification of the Impact of Flash Flooding on the Rice Production: A Case Study over Northeastern Bangladesh
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeastern region of Bangladesh often experiences flash flooding during the pre-harvesting period of the boro rice crop, which is the major cereal crop in the country. In this study, our objective was to delineate the impact of the 2017 flash flood (that initiated on 27 March 2017) on boro rice using multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS data. Initially, we opted to use Landsat-8 OLI data for mapping the damages; however, during and after the flooding event the acquisition of cloud free images were challenging. Thus, we used this data to map the cultivated boro rice acreage considering the planting to mature stages of the crop. Also, in order to map the extent of the damaged boro area, we utilized MODIS data as their 16-day composites provided cloud free information. Our results indicated that both the cultivated and damaged boro area estimates based on satellite data had strong relationships while compared to the ground-based estimates (i.e., r(2) values approximately 0.92 for both cases, and RMSE of 18,374 and 9380 ha for cultivated and damaged areas, respectively). Finally, we believe that our study would be critical for planning and ensuring food security for the country.

TI  - Can We Skip Intraoperative Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Nodes? Nomogram Predicting Involvement of Three or More Axillary Lymph Nodes before Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial reported that complete dissection of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) may not be warranted in women with clinical T1-T2 tumors and one or two involved ALNs who were undergoing lumpectomy plus radiation followed by systemic therapy. The present study was conducted to identify preoperative imaging predictors of >= 3 ALNs.Materials and MethodsThe training set consisted of 1,917 patients with clinical T1-T2 and node negative invasive breast cancer. Factors associated with >= 3 involved ALNs were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. The validation set consisted of 378 independent patients. The nomogram was applied prospectively to 512 patients who met the Z0011 criteria.ResultsOf the 1,917 patients, 204 (10.6%) had >= 3 positive nodes. Multivariate analysis showed that involvement of >= 3 nodes was significantly associated with ultrasonographic and chest computed tomography findings of suspicious ALNs (p < 0.001 each). These two imaging criteria, plus patient age, were used to develop a nomogram calculating the probability of involvement of >= 3 ALNs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram were 0.852 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.820 to 0.883) for the training set and 0.896 (95% CI, 0.836 to 0.957) for the validation set. Prospective application of the nomogram showed that 60 of 512 patients (11.7%) had scores above the cut-off. Application of the nomogram reduced operation time and cost, with a very low re-operation rate (1.6%).ConclusionPatients likely to have >= 3 positive ALNs could be identified by preoperative imaging. The nomogram was helpful in selective intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Land change in the central Albertine rift: Insights from analysis and mapping of land use-land cover change in north-western Rwanda
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land change was assessed in the Albertine rift region (ARR) using its central section of north-western Rwanda as case study. This region is one of Africa's most ecologically sensitive environments under severe pressure from human activities. The study maps and quantifies the spatial extent of land use-land cover (LULC) changes between 1987 and 2016 from Landsat images. Transitions between five major land classes were identified in order to understand the trajectory of observed changes. In terms of gains, the forest class, the urban built-up and bare land class increased by 9% and 4% respectively over the study period. The gains of forest were mainly derived from the afforestation of some agricultural lands in the southern part, whereas the gains of built-up and bare lands were mostly from cultivated land which was a net losing class. Forest increase is in line with government's policy to increase the national forest cover to 30% by 2020. Forest losses occurred mostly outside protected areas due to land conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Much needed information about changes in LULC over the last three decades is provided. This study demonstrates in a timely manner how to analyse and monitor LULC change and the drivers in an environment where field based research is a challenge due to the mountainous terrain. The ecological richness of the region, which coincides with heightened human population pressure, necessitates the monitoring of land change as input for improving land use planning with focus on conserving biodiversity.

TI  - <i>In situ</i> spectral response of the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman coastal waters to bio-optical properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) over the coastal waters of the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman using the satellite-based observations, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), has shown inferior performance (Chl-a overestimation) than that of deep waters. Studies in the region have shown that this poor performance is due to three reasons: (i) water turbidity (sediments re-suspension), and the presence of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), (ii) bottom reflectance and (iii) incapability of the existing atmospheric correction models to reduce the effect of the aerosols from the water leaving radiance. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the sensitivity of the in situ spectral signatures of these coastal waters to the algal (chlorophyll: Chl-a), non-algal (sediments and CDOM) and the bottom reflectance properties, in absence of contributions from the atmosphere. Consequently, the collected in situ spectral signatures will improve our understanding of Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman water properties. For this purpose, comprehensive field measurements were carried out between 2013 and 2016, over Abu-Dhabi (Arabian Gulf) and Fujairah (Sea of Oman) where unique water quality data were collected. Based on the in situ water spectral analysis, the bottom reflectance (water depth < 20 m) are found to degrade the performance of the conventional ocean color algorithms more than the sediment-laden waters where these waters increase the R-rs at the blue and red ranges. The increasing presence of CDOM markedly decreases the R-rs in the blue range, which is conflicting with the effect of Chl-a. Given the inadequate performance of the widely used ocean-color algorithms (OC3: ocean color 3, OC2: ocean color 2) in retrieving Chl-a in these very shallow coastal waters, therefore, a new algorithm is proposed here based on a 3-bands ratio approach using [R-rs (656)(-1) - R-rs (506)(-1)] X R-rs (661). The selected optimum bands (656 nm, 506 nm, and 661 nm) from this approach can be used to retrieve the Chl-a more accurately in these coastal Case II (turbid) waters which are close to the bands of the current missions such as Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument), MODIS, VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LandSat 8. However, more uniformly distributed data over the Arabian Gulf is required to have a highly accurate regional model for Chl-a retrieval.

TI  - Evaluating land cover changes in Eastern and Southern Africa from 2000 to 2010 using validated Landsat and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assessed land cover land use (LCLU) changes and their potential environmental drivers (i.e., precipitation, temperature) in five countries in Eastern & Southern (E & S) Africa (Rwanda, Botswana, Tanzania, Malawi and Namibia) between 2000 and 2010. Landsat-derived LCLU products developed by the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) through the SERVIR (Spanish for "to serve") program, a joint initiative of NASA and USAID, and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to evaluate and quantify the LCLU changes in these five countries. Given that the original development of the MODIS land cover type standard products included limited training sites in Africa, we performed a two-level verification/validation of the MODIS land cover product in these five countries. Precipitation data from CHIRPS dataset were used to evaluate and quantify the precipitation changes in these countries and see if it was a significant driver behind some of these LCLU changes. MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data were also used to see if temperature was a main driver too.Our validation analysis revealed that the overall accuracies of the regional MODIS LCLU product for this African region alone were lower than that of the global MODIS LCLU product overall accuracy (63-66% vs. 75%). However, for countries with uniform or homogenous land cover, the overall accuracy was much higher than the global accuracy and as high as 87% and 78% for Botswana and Namibia, respectively. In addition, the wetland and grassland classes had the highest user's accuracies in most of the countries (89%-99%), which are the ones with the highest number of MODIS land cover classification algorithm training sites.Our LCLU change analysis revealed that Botswana's most significant changes were the net reforestation, net grass loss and net wetland expansion. For Rwanda, although there have been significant forest, grass and crop expansions in some areas, there also have been significant forest, grass and crop loss in other areas that resulted in very minimal nef changes. As for Tanzania, its most significant changes were the net deforestation and net crop expansion. Malawi's most significant changes were the net deforestation, net crop expansion, net grass expansion and net wetland loss. Finally, Namibia's most significant changes were the net deforestation and net grass expansion.The only noticeable environmental driver was in Malawi, which had a significant net wetland loss and could be due to the fact that it was the only country that had a reduction in total precipitation between the periods when the LCLU maps were developed. Not only that, but Malawi also happened to have a slight increase in temperature, which would cause more evaporation and net decrease in wetlands if the precipitation didn't increase as was the case in that country. In addition, within our studied countries, foresdand expansion and loss as well as crop expansion and loss were happening in the same country almost equally in some cases. All of that implies that non-environmental factors, such as socioeconomics and governmental policies, could have been the main drivers of these LCLU changes in many of these countries in E & S Africa. It will be important to further study in the future the detailed effects of such drivers on these LCLU changes in this part of the world.

TI  - Did Anthropogenic Activities Trigger the 3 April 2017 M<sub>w</sub> 6.5 Botswana Earthquake?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 April 2017, a M-w 6.5 earthquake occurred in Botswana, representing the second-strongest earthquake registered since 1949. Such an intraplate event occurred in a low seismic hazard area and was suspected to be an artificial earthquake induced by nearby anthropogenic activities (gas extraction). The possible relation between anthropogenic activities and the earthquake occurrence has been qualitatively investigated. We estimated the geometric and kinematic characteristics of the causative fault from the modeling of Sentinel-1 InSAR interferograms. Our best-fit solution for the main shock is represented by a normal fault located at a depth greater than 20 km, dipping 65 degrees northeast, with a right-lateral component, and a mean slip of 2.7 m. The retrieved fault geometry and mechanism are incompatible with the hypothetical stress perturbation caused by the anthropogenic activities performed in the area. Therefore, the 3 April 2017 Botswana earthquake can be classified as a natural intraplate earthquake.

TI  - A Hybrid Classification Approach Based on Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor for Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis and classification for remote sensing landscape based on remote sensing imagery is a popular research topic. In this paper, we propose a new remote sensing data classifier by incorporating the support vector machine (SVM) learning information into the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The SVM is well known for its extraordinary generalization capability even with limited learning samples, and it is very useful for remote sensing applications as data samples are usually limited. The KNN has been widely used in data classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the KNN is instance-based and needs to keep all the training samples for classification, which could cause not only high computation complexity but also overfitting problems. Meanwhile, the performance of the KNN classifier is sensitive to the neighborhood size K and how to select the value of the parameter K relies heavily on practice and experience. Based on the observations that the SVM can contribute to the KNN on the problems of smaller training samples size as well as the selection of the parameter K, we propose a support vector nearest neighbor (abbreviated as SV-NN) hybrid classification approach which can simplify the parameter selection while maintaining classification accuracy. The proposed approach is consist of two stages. In the first stage, the SVM is performed on the training samples to obtain the reduced support vectors (SVs) for each of the sample categories. In the second stage, a nearest neighbor classifier (NNC) is used to classify a testing sample, i.e. the average Euclidean distance between the testing data point to each set of SVs from different categories is calculated and the NNC identifies the category with minimum distance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,firstly experiments of classification for samples from remote sensing data are evaluated, and then experiments of identifying different land covers regions in the remote sensing images are evaluated. Experimental results show that the SV-NN approach maintains good classification accuracy while reduces the training samples compared with the conventional SVM and KNN classification model.

TI  - Evaluating Fourier Cross-Correlation Sub-Pixel Registration in Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal analysis is one of the main applications of remote sensing, and Landsat imagery has been one of the main resources for many years. However, the moderate spatial resolution (30 m) restricts their use for high precision applications. In this paper, we simulate Landsat scenes to evaluate, by means of an exhaustive number of tests, a subpixel registration process based on phase correlation and the upsampling of the Fourier transform. From a high resolution image (0.5 m), two sets of 121 synthetic images of fixed translations are created to simulate Landsat scenes (30 m). In this sense, the use of the point spread function (PSF) of the Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) sensor in the downsampling process improves the results compared to those obtained by simple averaging. In the process of obtaining sub-pixel accuracy by upsampling the cross correlation matrix by a certain factor, the limit of improvement is achieved at 0.1 pixels. We show that image size affects the cross correlation results, but for images equal or larger than 100 x 100 pixels similar accuracies are expected. The large dataset used in the tests allows us to describe the intra-pixel distribution of the errors obtained in the registration process and how they follow a waveform instead of random/stochastic behavior. The amplitude of this waveform, representing the highest expected error, is estimated at 1.88 m. Finally, a validation test is performed over a set of sub-pixel shorelines obtained from actual Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operation Land Imager) scenes. The evaluation of the shoreline accuracy with respect to permanent seawalls, before and after the registration, shows the importance of the registering process and serves as a non-synthetic validation test that reinforce previous results.

TI  - Extended Kalman Filter for Multichannel InSAR Height Reconstruction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main challenges in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the accurate height reconstruction of the observed scene. Recently, approaches based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) have been proposed. Most of them are based on the hypothesis of height profile continuity. Such condition greatly reduces their applicability, being only valid for particular scenarios. Within this paper, we present a novel Kalman-based height reconstruction approach, specifically designed to work with multichannel data related to any type of scenario, both smooth or sharp. The novelty of the technique consists in its ability in detecting and correctly handling sharp height discontinuities while regularizing smooth areas. The approach is able to maintain the high computational efficiency typical of EKF and to work in an almost unsupervised way. The methodology has been tested and validated on both simulated and real X-band (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) high-resolution data sets. Reported results are encouraging and interesting, showing the correctness and the validity of the proposed approach.

TI  - Detecting microrefugia in semi-arid landscapes from remotely sensed vegetation dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microrefugia are sites with stable, high quality habitat within landscapes characterized by dynamic environmental conditions driven by climate variability or ecological disturbances. There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia.Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.

TI  - Sequential Estimator: Toward Efficient InSAR Time Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions with short revisit times, such as Sentinel-1 and the planned NISAR and Tandem-L, provide an unprecedented wealth of interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series. However, the processing of the emerging Big Data is challenging for state-of-the-art InSAR analysis techniques. This contribution introduces a novel approach, named Sequential Estimator, for efficient estimation of the interferometric phase from long InSAR time series. The algorithm uses recursive estimation and analysis of the data covariance matrix via division of the data into small batches, followed by the compression of the data batches. From each compressed data batch artificial interferograms are formed, resulting in a strong data reduction. Such interferograms are used to link the "older" data batches with the most recent acquisitions and thus to reconstruct the phase time series. This scheme avoids the necessity of reprocessing the entire data stack at the face of each new acquisition. The proposed estimator introduces negligible degradation compared to the Cramer-Rao lower bound under realistic coherence scenarios. The estimator may therefore be adapted for high-precision near-real-time processing of InSAR and accommodate the conversion of InSAR from an offline to a monitoring geodetic tool. The performance of the Sequential Estimator is compared to state-of-the-art techniques via simulations and application to Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Genetic variants related to disease susceptibility and immunotolerance in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (<i>DARC, Fy</i>) gene in the black lion tamarin (<i>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</i>, primates)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene encodes the DARC protein, which serves multiple roles in the immune system, as a binding site for the malarial parasites Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi, a promiscuous chemokine receptor and a blood group antigen. Variation in DARC may play particularly significant roles in innate immunity, immunotolerance and pathogen entry in callitrichines, such as the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus). We compared amino acid sequences of DARC in the black lion tamarin (BLT) to non-human Haplorhine primates and Homo sapiens. Consistent with prior studies in other Haplorhines, we observed that the chemokine receptor experiences two opposing selection forces: (1) positive selection on the Plasmodium binding site and (2) purifying selection. We observed also that D21N, F22L, and V25L differentiated BLT from humans at a critical site for P. vivax and P. knowlesi binding. One amino acid residue, F22L, was subject to both positive selection and fixation in New World monkeys, suggesting a beneficial role as an adaptive barrier to Plasmodium entry. Unlike in humans, we observed no variation in DARC among BLTs, suggesting that the protein does not play a role in immunotolerance. In addition, lion tamarins differed from humans at the blood compatibility Fy(a)/Fy(b) antigen-binding site 44, as well as at the putative destabilizing residues A61, T68, A187, and L215, further supporting a difference in the functional role of DARC in these primates compared with humans. Further research is needed to determine whether changes in the Plasmodium and Fy(a)/Fy(b) antigen-binding sites disrupt DARC function in callitrichines.

TI  - Polarimetric ALOS PALSAR Time Series in Mapping Biomass of Boreal Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we examined multitemporal behavior of fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) parameters at L-band in relation to the stem volume of boreal forests. The PolSAR parameters were evaluated in terms of their temporal consistency, inter-dependence and suitability for forest stem volume estimation across several seasonal conditions (frozen, thaw and unfrozen). The satellite SAR data were represented by a time series of PolSAR images acquired during several seasons in the years 2006 to 2009 by the ALOS PALSAR sensor. The study area was in central Finland, and represented a managed area in typical boreal mixed forest land. Utility of different PolSAR parameters, their temporal stability and cross-correlations were studied along with reference stand-level stem volume data from forest inventory. Further, two polarimetric parameters, cross-polarization backscatter and co-polarization coherence, were chosen for further investigation and stem volume retrieval. A relationship between forest stem volume and PolSAR parameters was established using the kNN regression approach. Ways of optimally combining PolSAR images were evaluated as well. For a single scene, best results were observed with polarimetric coherence (RMSE approximate to 38.8 m(3)/ha) for scene acquired in frozen conditions. An RMSE of 40.8 m(3)/ha (42.9%, R-2 = 0.66) was achieved for cross-polarization backscatter in the best case. Cross-polarization backscatter was a better predictor than polarimetric coherence for few summer scenes. Multitemporal aggregation of selected PolSAR scenes improved estimates for both studied PolSAR parameters. Stronger improvement was observed for coherence with RMSE down to 34 m(3)/ha (35.8%, R-2 = 0.77) compared to 38.8-51.6 m(3)/ha (40.8-54.3%) from separate scenes. Finally, the accuracy statistics reached RMSE of 32.2 m(3)/ha (34%, R-2 = 0.79) when multitemporal HHVV coherence was combined with multitemporal HV-backscatter.

TI  - Assessing man-induced environmental changes in the Sepetiba Bay (Southeastern Brazil) with geochemical and satellite data
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sepetiba Bay, Southeastern Brazil, has undergone intense environmental changes due to anthropogenic influence. This work aims to: (i) evaluate the changes in the drainage landscape use over the last decades, (ii) identify new and past punctual and diffuse anthropogenic sources and assess risks of man-induced disturbances of the coastal zones of Sepetiba. A multivariate statistics approach on the sediment's elemental geochemical dataset discriminated three groups: the electroplating waste-affected elements (As, Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn), terrigenous elements (Si, K, Ti, Al and Fe), and biogenic and carbonatederived elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, P, Ni, and Cr). Sediment core profiles of trace elements evidence records of former environmental impacts from old metallurgical wastes. Analysis of two Landsat images from 30 years ago and 2015 reveals a decrease in the mangrove area of nearly 26%. The ongoing suppression of mangroves could enhance the release of trace elements into the Sepetiba Bay, increasing the risks to human and biota health.

M3  - Article
AB  - Any explanation of the driving force of globalization is based on a worldview. The premise of this paper is that any worldview can be associated with one of the four broad paradigms: functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist. This paper takes the case of the driving force of globalization and discusses it from the four different viewpoints. It emphasizes that the four views expressed are equally scientific and informative; they look at the phenomenon from their certain paradigmatic viewpoint; and together they provide a more balanced understanding of the phenomenon under consideration. This approach is applicable to any phenomena, including financial phenomena.

TI  - A financial cost-benefit analysis of eradicating virulent footrot
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2008, virulent footrot was detected in sheep in south-west Norway. Footrot is caused by Dichelobacter nodosus, and the outbreak was linked to live sheep imported from Denmark in 2005. A large-scale program for eradicating the disease was implemented as a joint industry and governmental driven eradication project in the years 2008-2014, and continued with surveillance and control measures by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority from 2015. The cost of the eradication program including surveillance and control measures until 2032 was assumed to reach approximately (sic)10.8 million (NOR 90 million). A financial cost-benefit analysis, comparing costs in the eradication program with costs in two simulated scenarios, was carried out. In the scenarios, designated ModerateSpread (baseline) and SlowSpread, it was assumed that the sheep farmers would undertake some voluntary measures on their own that would slow the spread of the disease. The program obtained a positive NPV after approximately 12 years. In a stochastic analysis, the probabilities of a positive NPV were estimated to 1.000 and to 0.648 after 15 years and to 0.378 and 0.016 after ten years, for the ModerateSpread and SlowSpread scenarios respectively. A rapid start-up of the program soon after the detection of the disease was considered crucial for the economic success as the disease would have become more widespread and probably raised the costs considerably at a later start-up.

TI  - Variations in urban surface temperature: an assessment of land use change impacts over Lagos metropolis
T2  - WEATHER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate seasonal and diurnal variations in urban temperature, as well as the contributions of different land uses to land surface temperature (LST). A time series of MODIS data was used in this study. Average seasonal LST differentials between day and night from 2002 to 2014 were estimated. The results reveal substantial changes in land use over the study period; in particular, urban centre and urban fringe surface area increased by 15.93 and 94.49% respectively, while forest land and wetland surface area decreased by approximately 5 and 8% respectively. Average LST increases by nearly 3 degC during the daytime in the dry seasons, compared with the wet season, for all land use/land cover (LULC) classes. In all seasons, the average LST of urban areas is nearly 1.5 degC higher than the LST values for the surrounding rural areas. The explanations for these variations are obvious: the majority of urban centres in Lagos metropolis have dense buildings and slight vegetal cover; thus they appear to have less energy loss due to latent heat by evaporation from the impervious urban surfaces. The study concludes by proposing improved urban planning in Nigeria through implementation of urban planning policies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to compare nonaspiration (NAS) and aspiration (AS) techniques in the evaluation of fine-needle cytology of lymph node (FNC-LN) in terms of diagnostic adequacy of cytologic material.Methods: One hundred and twenty-three superficial cervical LNs in 75 patients who underwent NAS and AS-FNC-LN in the same visit were evaluated. Cytological results were categorized as diagnostic and nondiagnostic.Results: The rates of malignancy were 13.8% in AS versus 16.3% in NAS technique, whereas non-diagnostic cytology was detected in 43.1% and 25.2%, respectively (P=.549 and P<.01).Conclusions: The diagnostic adequacy rate in NAS-FNC-LN was significantly higher than ASFNC-LN. However, NAS technique seems to be more simple and comfortable. We suggest both NAS and AS-FNC-LN in cytologic evaluation of suspicious cervical LNs until the diagnostic accuracy is determined with prospective studies.

TI  - Drainless mastectomy: Is it safe and effective?
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Practice regarding the use of post operative drains after simple mastectomy varies widely. This project aimed to establish if not using a drain lead to an increase in post-operative seroma formation or other complications. Methods: Women undergoing simple mastectomy +/- sentinel node biopsy were included. Patients were allocated to drain/no drain group via operating surgeon. Data was collected retrospectively from computer based records. Drain output, length of stay, seroma formation and volume and post-operative complications were recorded. Results: There were 39 patients in the drain group and 24 patients in the no drain group. Patients did not differ significantly in terms of age, BMI or specimen weight. Seroma was more prevalent in the no drain group (62 v 83%) and required more clinic attendances for aspiration with larger volumes drained (360 vs 725 ml, p = 0.0096). There was no difference in overall complication rate. There did not appear to be a correlation between seroma formation and age, BMI or mastectomy weight. Conclusions: The use of a drain after simple mastectomy may confer lower rates of seroma formation as well as lower overall volumes. Therefore drainless mastectomy appears to be safe but may require more post-operative intervention.

TI  - Albedo Retrieval From Multispectral Landsat 8 Observation in Urban Environment: Algorithm Validation by <i>in situ</i> Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface albedo in urban environment represents one of the most influencing parameters in the formation of the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Its assessment is therefore strategic to undertake actions for the UHI mitigation: the increase of urban surface reflectivity is an example of cooling strategies increasingly proposed and developed. Spaceborne observations could give a significant contribution supplying albedo maps, and different retrieval algorithms estimating broadband albedo from narrowband reflectivities provided by satellite sensors were proposed and validated in literature. In this study, the accuracy of two well-known retrieval algorithms applied to Landsat 8 OLI reflectivities was assessed in a city of Central Italy (Perugia), selecting test sites having different land cover types. Since the root mean square error of the estimated albedo was quite high (0.07-0.08), a custom retrieval algorithm was developed to evaluate the potential improvement in the narrowband reflectivity-broadband albedo conversion for the case study. This analysis was made possible thanks to an in situ measurement campaign, carried out during the summer months of 2016. The selected sites, having quite homogenous features inside the urban environment, also demonstrated that the albedo values are not significantly affected by the hour of the day, if measurements are taken near noon (variation less than 7%). Spaceborne observations showed once again a powerful tool for monitoring large areas with a quite good spatial resolution (30 m), even if an improvement of the literature albedo retrieval algorithms is required and possible in an urban context.

TI  - A Spectral Unmixing Method with Ensemble Estimation of Endmembers: Application to Flood Mapping in the Caprivi Floodplain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caprivi basin in Namibia has been affected by severe flooding in recent years resulting in deaths, displacements and destruction of infrastructure. The negative consequences of these floods have emphasized the need for timely, accurate and objective information about the extent and location of affected areas. Due to the high temporal variability of flood events, Earth Observation (EO) data at high revisit frequency is preferred for accurate flood monitoring. Currently, EO data has either high temporal or coarse spatial resolution. Accurate methodologies for the estimation and monitoring of flooding extent using coarse spatial resolution optical image data are needed in order to capture spatial details in heterogeneous areas such as Caprivi. The objective of this work was the retrieval of the fractional abundance of water (gamma omega) by applying a new spectral indices-based unmixing algorithm to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Full Resolution (MERIS FR) data using a minimum number of spectral bands. These images are technically similar to the OLCI image data acquired by the Sentinel-3 satellite, which are to be systematically provided in the near future. The normalized difference wetness index (NDWI) was applied to delineate the water surface and combined with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to account for emergent vegetation within the water bodies. The challenge to map flooded areas by applying spectral unmixing is the estimation of spectral endmembers, i.e., pure spectra of land cover features. In our study, we developed and applied a new unmixing method based on the use of an ensemble of spectral endmembers to capture and take into account spectral variability within each endmember. In our case study, forty realizations of the spectral endmembers gave a stable frequency distribution of gamma omega. Quality of the flood map derived from the Envisat MERIS (MERIS) data was assessed against high (30 m) spatial resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images on two different dates (17 April 2008 and 22 May 2009) during which floods occurred. The findings show that both the spatial and the frequency distribution of the gamma omega extracted from the MERIS data were in good agreement with the high-resolution TM retrievals. The use of conventional linear unmixing, instead, applied using the entire available spectra for each image, resulted in relatively large differences between TM and MERIS retrievals.

TI  - A novel strategy for wetland area extraction using multispectral MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) is an imaging sensor onboard Terra/Aqua platform which provides information in 36 spectral bands. Spectral mixing of features due to high data dimensionality and high inter-band correlations constitutes the biggest challenge in the analysis of MODIS. data. In view of this, present study attempts to develop a novel strategy involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Band to Band Correlation (BTBC) analysis, Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA), and separability analysis to reduce the data dimensionality for extracting reliable and maximum information for wetland areal extent using coarse resolution MODIS (1 Inn) data. The PCA explains variability in data and removes data redundant information; BTBC analysis eradicates the high correlated bands providing best bands suitable for wetland mapping; SDA evaluates the discriminatory power of different MODIS bands to discriminate the wetlands from other class types. Further, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wetland Model Index (WMI) were also incorporated into the study to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, separability analysis was conducted to optimize the selected MODIS bands and indices.Results of rigorous data mining reveal that out of 24 input layers of MODIS (1 km) data (22 optical MODIS bands, NDVI and WMI), only 4 input layers (WMI, NDVI, MODIS bands - NIR band 2 and SWIR band 6) are best suited for delineation and mapping of wetlands. This study also corroborates the usage of WMI, a newly developed index with combination of visible and short wavelength infra red (SWIR) MODIS bands, as the most optimal input layer to separate wetlands from the other land use class types (barren land, agricultural land, rivers/canals/streams, forest, wasteland/gullied or riverine land). It was observed that the magnitude of mapped wetland areal extent using MODIS (1 km) data varied from 105,053 ha in 2010-2011 to 111,479 ha in 2011-2012 accounting for 0.44% (2010-2011)-0.46% (2011-2012) of the total geographical area of Uttar Pradesh, India. Seasonally, monsoon season displayed maximum wetland area with overall accuracy of 92% whereas summer season exhibited minimum wetland area with overall accuracies varying from 85 to 87% during both the sampling years. The output of the present research work will not only facilitate to improve the wetland area estimates but also provide an important input for climate change predictions in wetlands over large areas.

TI  - Land use/Land Cover Changes and Causes of Deforestation in the Wilberforce Island, Bayelsa State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to provide the non-existent data on land use/land cover changes in the Wilberforce Island for the purposes of determining the causes of deforestation and changes in the vegetation cover for a 13 - year period. Accordingly, 125 questionnaires were administered in five communities to determine the causes of deforestation. Satellite imageries for 2002 and 2015 were also acquired from Landsat 7 and 8 respectively and analysed with the Quantum Geography Information System (QGIS) software to obtain the various land use/land cover changes. The semi - Automatic Classification Plugin Version 4.9.1 of the QGIS was used for the land use/land cover classification with a supervised classification method. Each satellite imagery was classified into 8 categories using their reflectance values and the error matrix was used to show the level of accuracy of the classified imageries. Results from the study indicated that the major drivers of deforestation were logging, farming, building of houses and fuel wood fetching. Results from satellite imageries also showed that forest and sparse vegetation/grassland decreased from 73.34% and 10.32% to 51.34% and 8.08% between 2002 and 2015 respectively, while farmland and residential area increased from 10.71% and 0.44% to 30.575 and 1.72% for the same period respectively. It was concluded that land use/cover changes was due to deforestation to provide raw materials for wood industries, and space for agriculture and building of house for the increasing population in the area. The implications of deforestation for biodiversity and climate change have been highlighted. (C) JASEM

TI  - A Methodology to Detect and Update Active Deformation Areas Based on Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is focused on deformation activity mapping and monitoring using Sentinel-1 (S-1) data and the DInSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique. The main goal is to present a procedure to periodically update and assess the geohazard activity (volcanic activity, landslides and ground-subsidence) of a given area by exploiting the wide area coverage and the high coherence and temporal sampling (revisit time up to six days) provided by the S-1 satellites. The main products of the procedure are two updatable maps: the deformation activity map and the active deformation areas map. These maps present two different levels of information aimed at different levels of geohazard risk management, from a very simplified level of information to the classical deformation map based on SAR interferometry. The methodology has been successfully applied to La Gomera, Tenerife and Gran Canaria Islands (Canary Island archipelago). The main obtained results are discussed.

TI  - Towards a satellite based monitoring of urban air temperatures
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely meteorological data of high accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution can contribute to sustainable urban planning and management in terms of human thermal comfort, heat wave warning, air pollution prediction, as well as building and transport management among others. Today, the scientific knowledge about the specific urban climate is not fully exploited by these applications. Of particular relevance is thereby the thermal impact which currently is either observed in situ or modelled. Both approaches have advantages but also shortcomings in terms of costs and data needs. In this study we investigated air temperatures estimations from satellite data as alternative source. In particular, we focused on dense time series of land surface temperature as predictors for urban and rural air temperature. We applied empirical models which used LST in predefined time intervals to estimate air temperature using a simple but robust method for empirical modelling. The root mean square errors of the model substantially decreased with the multi-temporal predictors and were below 2 K for most stations. Additionally, the representation of the diurnal cycle improved and the annual cycle was well represented. This method is seen as a great enhancement of existing satellite based air temperature monitoring methods especially for urban applications.

TI  - Fungal aerocontamination exposure risk for patients in 3 successive locations of a pediatric hematology unit department: Influence of air equipment and building structure on air quality
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) play an important role in the mortality of immunocompromised patients. The pediatric hematology department (PHD) at Besancon University Hospital has relocated 3 times: (1) from a building without an air filtration system (B1), (2) to a renovated building with low air pressure (B2), and (3) to a new building with high air pressure and high-efficiency particulate air filters (B3). This study aimed to investigate how these relocations influenced the fungal exposure risk for the PHD's patients.Methods: Air samples were taken monthly in patient rooms and weekly in corridors. The detection of opportunistic fungi species was used to assess IFI risk. Data were analyzed using univariate and multi-variate random-effects negative binomial regression.Results: A total of 1,074 samples from 29 rooms over a 10-year period showed that renovation of an old building with a basic ventilation system did not lead to a significant improvement of air quality (P = .004, multivariate analysis). Among factors linked to higher risk of patient rooms mold contamination was fungal contamination of the corridors (P < .001).Conclusions: This study demonstrates that corridors can be used as reliable sentinel to prevent fungal contamination in patient rooms. Only relocation in building B3, equipped with laminar air flow, achieved adequate air quality. (C) 2017 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

TI  - The Potential Impact of Satellite-Retrieved Cloud Parameters on Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Mass and Composition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical properties have been extensively used to estimate ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in support of air pollution health effects research and air quality assessment at the urban to global scales. However, a large proportion, similar to 70%, of satellite observations of aerosols are missing as a result of cloud-cover, surface brightness, and snow-cover. The resulting PM2.5 estimates could therefore be biased due to this non-random data missingness. Cloud-cover in particular has the potential to impact ground-level PM2.5 concentrations through complex chemical and physical processes. We developed a series of statistical models using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product at 1 km resolution with information from the MODIS cloud product and meteorological information to investigate the extent to which cloud parameters and associated meteorological conditions impact ground-level aerosols at two urban sites in the US: Atlanta and San Francisco. We find that changes in temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, convective available potential energy, precipitation, cloud effective radius, cloud optical depth, and cloud emissivity are associated with changes in PM2.5 concentration and composition, and the changes differ by overpass time and cloud phase as well as between the San Francisco and Atlanta sites. A case-study at the San Francisco site confirmed that accounting for cloud-cover and associated meteorological conditions could substantially alter the spatial distribution of monthly ground-level PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Analyzing Exoplanet Phase Curve Information Content: Toward Optimized Observing Strategies
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary eclipses and phase curves reveal information about the reflectivity and heat distribution in exoplanet atmospheres. The phase curve is composed of a combination of reflected and thermally emitted light from the planet, and for circular orbits the phase curve peaks during the secondary eclipse or at an orbital phase of 0.5. Physical mechanisms have been discovered that shift the phase curve maximum of tidally locked close-in planets to the right, or left, of the secondary eclipse. These mechanisms include cloud formations and atmospheric superrotation, both of which serve to shift the thermally bright hot-spot or highly reflective bright spot of the atmosphere away from the sub-stellar point. Here, we present a methodology for optimizing observing strategies for both secondary eclipses and phase curves with the goal of maximizing the information gained about the planetary atmosphere while minimizing the (assumed) continuous observation time. We show that we can increase the duty cycle of observations aimed at the measurements of phase curve characteristics (amplitude, phase offset) by up to 50% for future platforms such as CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and JWST. We apply this methodology to the test cases of the Spitzer phase curve of 55-Cancri-e, which displays an eastward shift in its phase curve maximum as well as model-generated observations of an ultra-short period planet observed with CHEOPS.

TI  - Development of Seasonal BRDF Models to Extend the Use of Deep Convective Clouds as Invariant Targets for Satellite SWIR-Band Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deep convective clouds (DCC) are an excellent invariant target for vicarious calibration of satellite visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) solar bands. The DCC technique (DCCT) is a statistical approach that collectively analyzes all identified DCC pixels on a monthly basis. The DCC reflectance in VIS and NIR spectrums is mainly a function of cloud optical depth, and provides a stable monthly statistical mode. However, for absorption shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, the monthly DCC response is found to exhibit large seasonal cycles that make the implementation of the DCCT more challenging at these wavelengths. The seasonality assumption was tested using the SNPP-VIIRS SWIR bands, with up to 50% of the monthly DCC response temporal variation removed through deseasonalization. In this article, a monthly DCC bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) approach is proposed, which is found to be comparable to or can outperform the effects of deseasonalization alone. To demonstrate that the SNPP-VIIRS DCC BRDF can be applied to other JPSS VIIRS imagers in the same 13:30 sun-synchronous orbit, the VIIRS DCC BRDF was applied to Aqua-MODIS. The Aqua-MODIS SWIR band DCC reflectance natural variability is reduced by up to 45% after applying the VIIRS-based monthly DCC BRDFs.

TI  - A procedure for quantifying runoff response to spatial and temporal changes of impervious surface in Qinhuai River basin of southeastern China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative assessment of the hydrological response to urbanization has been a major concern in hydrology and water resources management. In this study, a procedure combining different statistical methods and a hydrological model to quantify annual runoff response to spatial and temporal variations of impervious surface areas was proposed and applied to the Qinhuai River basin, an urbanized basin located in southeastern China, over the period from 1986 to 2013. The landscape indicators, such as impervious area and number of impervious patches were used to measure the spatial configuration of urbanization and quantify the runoff response to urbanization. Impervious area data were derived from the Landsat images using superior ensemble learning method of rotation forest. The Mann-Kendall test, Sen's estimator, Pettitt test and double mass curve method were applied to examine gradual trend and abrupt changes for hydro-meteorological data series. A hydrological model based on stepwise regression analysis was built and used to explore the relation among annual runoff and precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and landscape indicators. The results showed that annual runoff and runoff coefficient had significant increasing trends and an abrupt change after year 2001 when the watershed impervious area reached 8.6%. The average annual runoff increased by 60%, of which, urbanization was responsible for 59% of the increase, while precipitation changes were responsible for the remaining 1% in the study region. The annual runoff response to impervious area showed a nonlinear relationship, and was more sensitive in dry years than wet years. The changes of impervious area were more remarkable in connecting the existed impervious patches than in developing the new ones beginning in the early 2000s, which increased the watershed's drainage capacity and resulted in the abrupt change of runoff response. The study demonstrated that the proposed procedure was efficient to quantify the runoff responses to urbanization using landscape metrics of impervious surface.

TI  - Modeling the Temporal Variability of Thermal Emissions From Row-Planted Scenes Using a Radiosity and Energy Budget Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is often needed for using remotely sensed data to study the surface energy budget and hydrological cycle. However, LST is challenging to measure and simulate because of its high sensitivity to atmospheric instability and solar angle, particularly over large-scale heterogeneous scenes. We propose a model that combines radiosity theory and an energy budget method for surface temperatures; we also explore the anisotropic behavior of row-planted crop emissions. The surface thermodynamic equilibrium state is fulfilled via the interaction between the 3-D radiative transfer calculations of the thermal-region radiosity-graphics combined model and the energy balance equation. Despite its shortcomings, such as the time-consuming calculations, the proposed model is feasible according to the results of an intercomparison and validation analysis. The intercomparison shows that the model exhibits similar performance, in terms of surface temperature calculations, to that of the soil-canopy observation, photochemistry and energy balance model (root-mean-square differences) of 0.59 degrees C and 1.77 degrees C for the leaf and soil components, respectively. Excellent agreement with the observed directional variation over summer maize canopies is also obtained, with R-2 values exceeding 0.6 and a mean RMSE of 0.32 degrees C. Thus, we recommend the new combined model as an option for explaining directional anisotropy due to its potential application to 3-D scenes.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> exchange and evapotranspiration across dryland ecosystems of southwestern North America
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global-scale studies suggest that dryland ecosystems dominate an increasing trend in the magnitude and interannual variability of the land CO2 sink. However, such analyses are poorly constrained by measured CO2 exchange in drylands. Here we address this observation gap with eddy covariance data from 25 sites in the water-limited Southwest region of North America with observed ranges in annual precipitation of 100-1000 mm, annual temperatures of 2-25 degrees C, and records of 3-10 years (150 site-years in total). Annual fluxes were integrated using site-specific ecohydrologic years to group precipitation with resulting ecosystem exchanges. We found a wide range of carbon sink/source function, with mean annual net ecosystem production (NEP) varying from -350 to +330 gCm(-2) across sites with diverse vegetation types, contrasting with the more constant sink typically measured in mesic ecosystems. In this region, only forest-dominated sites were consistent carbon sinks. Interannual variability of NEP, gross ecosystem production (GEP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco) was larger than for mesic regions, and half the sites switched between functioning as C sinks/C sources in wet/dry years. The sites demonstrated coherent responses of GEP and NEP to anomalies in annual evapotranspiration (ET), used here as a proxy for annually available water after hydrologic losses. Notably, GEP and Reco were negatively related to temperature, both interannually within site and spatially across sites, in contrast to positive temperature effects commonly reported for mesic ecosystems. Models based on MODIS satellite observations matched the cross-site spatial pattern in mean annual GEP but consistently underestimated mean annual ET by similar to 50%. Importantly, the MODIS-based models captured only 20-30% of interannual variation magnitude. These results suggest the contribution of this dryland region to variability of regional to global CO2 exchange may be up to 3-5 times larger than current estimates.

TI  - Tumor vascularization and clinicopathologic parameters as prognostic factors in merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with an increasing incidence. The clinical course is variable and reliable prognostic factors are scarce. Tumor angiogenesis has been shown to have prognostic impact in different types of cancer. The aim of our study was to determine potential prognostic factors, including tumor vascularization, for clinical outcome of MCC.Methods The medical records of 46 patients with MCC diagnosed between 1997 and 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Tissue samples were immune-stained for the lymphatic endothelial vessel marker podoplanin/D2-40 and the panvascular marker CD31. These immunostained sections were analyzed using computer-assisted morphometric image analyses. Aside from the parameters of tumor vascularization, clinicopathologic features were investigated, and progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor-specific survival (TSS) were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors.Results Male sex of the MCC patients and a high cross-sectional whole vessel area (WVA) in relation to the entire tumor area as determined on CD31-stained tumor sections were found to be negative prognostic factors for PFS in a univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Ulceration of the primary tumor was significantly associated with both impaired PFS and TSS.Conclusions Our results indicate a high prognostic impact of tumor vascularization on the clinical outcome of MCC patients. Male sex and ulceration of the primary MCC were identified as independent unfavorable prognostic markers for the clinical outcome. As an outlook, MCC patients with increased angiogenesis might be identified and subjected to a targeted anti-angiogenic treatment.

TI  - Homologous series of low molecular weight (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10</sub>) monocarboxylic acids, benzoic acid and hydroxyacids in fine-mode (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) aerosols over the Bay of Bengal: Influence of heterogeneity in air masses and formation pathways
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low molecular weight monocarboxylic acids (LMW monoacids) are most abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere and often act as important contributors to the acidity of precipitation in addition to inorganic acids. However, there is a large uncertainty in the sources and secondary formations of these acids in the atmosphere. This study reports homologous series of LMW monoacids, including normal (C-1-C-10), branched chain (iC(4)-iC(6)), aromatic (benzoic acid) and hydroxyacids (lactic and glycolic acids) in the fine-mode (PM2.5) aerosols collected over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during a winter cruise (December 2008 to January 2009). The samples were associated with two distinct continental air masses arriving from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP-outflow) and Southeast Asia (SEA-outflow). The molecular distributions of organic acids are characterized by the dominance of formic acid (C-1) followed by acetic acid (C-2) and nonanoic acid (C-9) in the IGP-outflow, whereas dominance of C-1 or Cg was observed in the SEA-outflow followed by C-2. Formic-to-acetic acid (C-1/C-2) ratios were higher than unity (mean: 1.3 +/- 0.3) in the IGP-outflow, whereas they were less than unity (0.9 +/- 0.5) in the SEA-outflow. These results suggest that secondary formation of organic acids is largely important in the IGP-outflow whereas primary emission is a major source of organic acids in the SEA-outflow. Based on the correlation coefficient matrix analysis and C-1/C-2 and C-4/C-3 ratios, we consider that the sources of C-1 are probably associated with the secondary formation via the oxidation of biogenic VOCs, while C-2 has both primary and secondary formations associated with anthropogenic sources in the IGP-outflow. On the other hand, C1 and C2 have similar sources (both primary and secondary) originated from biomass burning and bacterial activities via long-range atmospheric transport in the SEA-outflow, as inferred from the MODIS fire spot data, significant concentrations of isovaleric acid (iC(5)), and a significant correlation (r = 0.67) between nss-K+ and total LMW monoacids.

TI  - A spatially-explicit method to assess the dry deposition of air pollution by urban forests in the city of Florence, Italy
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests (UF) provide a range of important ecosystem services (ES) for human well-being. Relevant ES delivered by UF include urban temperature regulation, runoff mitigation, noise reduction, recreation, and air purification. In this study the potential of air pollution removal by UF in the city of Florence (Italy) was investigated. Two main air pollutants were considered - particulate matter (PM10) and tropospheric ozone (O-3) with the aim of providing a methodological framework for mapping air pollutant removal by UF and assessing the percent removal of air pollutant.The distribution of UF was mapped by high spatial resolution remote sensing data and classified into seven forest categories. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) was estimated spatially using a regression model between in-field LAI survey and Airborne Laser Scanning data and it was found to be in good linear agreement with estimates from ground-based measurements (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE% = 11%). We applied pollution deposition equations by using pollution concentrations measured at urban monitoring stations and then estimated the pollutant removal potential of the UF: annual O-3 and PM10 removal accounted for 77.9 t and 171.3 t, respectively. O-3 and PM10 removal rates by evergreen broadleaves (16.1 and 27.3 g/m(2)), conifers (10.9 and 28.5 g/m(2)), and mixed evergreen species (15.8 and 31.7 g/m(2)) were higher than by deciduous broadleaf stands (4.1 and 10 g/m(2)). However, deciduous forests exhibited the largest total removal due to the high percentage of tree cover within the city. The present study confirms that UF play an important role in air purification in Mediterranean cities as they can remove monthly up to 5% of O-3 and 13% of PM10.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in the Management of Vulvar Carcinoma <i>An Evidence-Based Insight</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Lymph node metastasis has been shown to represent the most significant prognostic factor invulvar carcinoma. Because only 25% to 35% of patientswith early stage disease have lymph node metastases, a significant 65% to 75% possibly do not benefit from elective inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy considering the related morbidities of wound infection, breakdown, and lower limb lymphedema. This review article aims to present and summarize the evidence available with regard to sentinel lymph node (SLN) Yguided management of vulvar carcinoma.Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE resources using the subject headings "vulvar neoplasms,'' "sentinel lymph node,'' "sentinel lymph node biopsy,'' and "lymphatic metastasis.'' This search returned 886 articles that were published through January 2017. Prospective studies investigating sentinel node identification techniques and their impact on vulvar cancer management and prognosis were considered. Case reports were excluded from the review.Results: Technetium-99-m-labeled nanocolloid with or without blue dye and more recently indocyanine green fluorescence have been the main techniques used for SLN identification in vulvar carcinoma. Radioisotope and near-infrared techniques have been shown to be superior to blue dye particularly with midline lesions that drain bilaterally or that drain directly to a deep pelvic node. Patients with a small unifocal primary tumor (<4 cm) and no obvious preoperative metastasis have been shown to have low groin recurrence rates and excellent disease-specific survival rates with minimal treatment-related morbidity when undergoing SLN biopsyYguided management.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsyYguided management seems to be safe when restricted to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IB to II cases where tumors are unifocal, less than 4 cmin size, and when there is no evidence of lymph nodemetastasis on clinical/radiological assessment. This reduces operative morbidity in this cohort of patients.

TI  - Gray whale distribution relative to benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance: Northeastern Chukchi Sea 2009-2012
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The shallow continental shelf waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas are the northernmost foraging grounds of North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Benthic amphipods are considered the primary prey of gray whales in these waters, although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been performed to support this assumption. Gray whale relative abundance, distribution, and behavior in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (69 degrees-72 degrees N, 155 degrees-169 degrees W) were documented during aerial surveys in June-October 2009-2012. Concurrently, vessel based benthic infaunal sampling was conducted in the area in July-August 2009-10, September 2011, and August 2012. Gray whales were seen in the study area each month that surveys were conducted, with the majority of whales feeding. Statistical analyses confirm that the highest densities of feeding gray whales were associated with high benthic amphipod abundance, primarily within 70 km of shore from Point Barrow to Icy Cape, in water < 50 m deep. Conversely, gray whales were not seen in 40-km x 40-km cells containing benthic sampling stations with 85 m(-2) or fewer amphipods. Continuing broad-scale aerial surveys in the Chlikchi Sea and prey sampling near feeding gray whales will be an important means to monitor and document ongoing and predicted ecosystem changes.

TI  - Phenocams Bridge the Gap between Field and Satellite Observations in an Arid Grassland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near surface (i.e., camera) and satellite remote sensing metrics have become widely used indicators of plant growing seasons. While robust linkages have been established between field metrics and ecosystem exchange in many land cover types, assessment of how well remotely-derived season start and end dates depict field conditions in arid ecosystems remain unknown. We evaluated the correspondence between field measures of start (SOS; leaves unfolded and canopy greenness >0) and end of season (EOS) and canopy greenness for two widespread species in southwestern U.S. ecosystems with those metrics estimated from near-surface cameras and MODIS NDVI for five years (2012-2016). Using Timesat software to estimate SOS and EOS from the phenocam green chromatic coordinate (GCC) greenness index resulted in good agreement with ground observations for honey mesquite but not black grama. Despite differences in the detectability of SOS and EOS for the two species, GCC was significantly correlated with field estimates of canopy greenness for both species throughout the growing season. MODIS NDVI for this arid grassland site was driven by the black grama signal although a mesquite signal was discernable in average rainfall years. Our findings suggest phenocams could help meet myriad needs in natural resource management.

TI  - Cell-free DNA as a post-treatment surveillance strategy: current status
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) consists of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments that are released from tumor cells into the bloodstream. ctDNA harbors cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations that allow its detection and quantification using a variety of emerging techniques. The promise of convenient non-invasive access to the complex and dynamic molecular features of cancer through peripheral blood has galvanized translational researchers around this topic with compelling routes to clinical implementation, particularly in the post-treatment surveillance setting. Although analysis methods must contend with the small quantities of ctDNA present in most patients, and the relative over-abundance of background cfDNA derived from normal tissues, recent technical innovations have led to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity of ctDNA detection. As a result, ever more studies are investigating the clinical utility of ctDNA for applications in (1) treatment response assessment, (2) identification of emerging resistance mechanisms, (3) minimal residual disease detection, and (4) characterization of clonal heterogeneity and selection. In this review, we describe the detection methods currently used in clinical studies to assess low fractions of ctDNA, as well as their utility in the applications previously described. Finally, we address current limitations that have hampered the clinical implementation of ctDNA analysis for post-treatment surveillance and propose steps that could be made to address them.

TI  - Estimating gross primary productivity of a tropical forest ecosystem over north-east India using LAI and meteorological variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests act as a major sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and store large amounts of carbon in biomass. India is a tropical country with regions of dense vegetation and high biodiversity. However due to the paucity of observations, the carbon sequestration potential of these forests could not be assessed in detail so far. To address this gap, several flux towers were erected over different ecosystems in India by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology as part of the MetFlux India project funded by MoES (Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India). A 50 m tall tower was set up over a semi-evergreen moist deciduous forest named Kaziranga National Park in north-eastern part of India which houses a significant stretch of local forest cover. Climatically this region is identified to be humid sub-tropical. Here we report first generation of the in situ meteorological observations and leaf area index (LAI) measurements from this site. LAI obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is compared with the in situ measured LAI. We use these in situ measurements to calculate the total gross photosynthesis (or gross primary productivity, GPP) of the forest using a calibrated model. LAI and GPP show prominent seasonal variation. LAI ranges between 0.75 in winter to 3.25 in summer. Annual GPP is estimated to be 2.11 kg C m(-2) year(-1).

TI  - Using remotely sensed data to modify wind forcing in operational storm surge forecasting
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm surges are abnormal coastal sea level events caused by meteorological conditions such as tropical cyclones. They have the potential to cause widespread loss of life and financial damage and have done so on many occasions in the past. Accurate and timely forecasts are necessary to help mitigate the risks posed by these events. Operational forecasting models use discretisations of the governing equations for fluid flow to model the sea surface, which is then forced by surface stresses derived from a model wind and pressure fields. The wind fields are typically idealised and generated parametrically. In this study, wind field datasets derived from remotely sensed data are used to modify the model parametric wind forcing and investigate potential improvement to operational forecasting. We examine two methods for using analysis wind fields derived from remotely sensed observations of three hurricanes. Our first method simply replaces the parametric wind fields with its corresponding analysis wind field for a period of time. Our second method does this also but takes it further by attempting to use some of the information present in the analysis wind field to estimate future wind fields. We find that our methods do yield some forecast improvement, most notably for our second method where we get improvements of up to 0.29 m on average. Importantly, the spatial structure of the surge is changed in some places such that locations that were previously forecast small surges had their water levels increased. These results were validated by tide gauge data.

TI  - Impacts of Built-Up Area Expansion in 2D and 3D on Regional Surface Temperature
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have reported the thermal effects of urban expansion from non-built-up land; however, how changes in building height in built-up land influence the regional thermal environment is still uncertain. Thus, taking the transitional region between the Chinese megacities of Beijing and Tianjin as the study area, this study investigated the impacts of built-up land expansion in 2D and 3D on regional land surface temperature (LST). The expansion in 2D refers to the conversion from non-built-up land to built-up land, whereas the expansion in 3D characterized the building height change in the built-up land, referring to the conversion from low- and moderate-rise building (LMRB) to high-rise building (HRB) lands. The land use change from 2010 to 2015 was manually interpreted from high spatial resolution SPOT5 and Gaofen2 images, and the LST information in the corresponding period was derived from Landsat5/8 thermal images using an image-based method. The results showed that between 2010 and 2015, approximately 87.25 km(2) non-built-up land was transformed to built-up land, and 13.21 km(2) LMRB land was built into HRB land. These two types of built-up land expansions have induced opposing thermal effects in regard to regional surface temperature. The built-up land expansions from cropland and urban green land have raised the regional LST. However, the built-up land expansion from LMRB to HRB lands has induced a cooling effect. Thus, this study suggested that for the cooling urban design, the building height should also be considered. Furthermore, for future studies on thermal impacts of urbanization, it should be cautioned that, besides the urban area expansion, the building height change should also be emphasized due to its potential cooling effects.

TI  - Management of breast ductal carcinoma in situ in Catalonia, Spain: Results from the Grup Oncologic Calala-Occita-Catalonia survey with 9-year follow up
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Reliable data on DCIS incidence and management are not available in many countries. The present study describes the management of DCIS in Catalonia, Spain in the year 2005 and compares these findings to data obtained in France. Local recurrence and late toxicity rates from 2005 through the end of 2014 are reported.Materials and methods: Observational survey of patients with pure DCIS (n = 270) diagnosed during 2005. A written questionnaire, the same as used in the French survey, was completed by 14 doctors at 12 cancer centres in Catalonia, Spain.Results: Median patient age was 55 years (range, 29-89). Diagnosis was mammographic in 225 cases (83.3%). Treatment approaches included: mastectomy (10.4% of cases), breast-conserving surgery (BCS) alone (3.7%), and BCS plus radiotherapy (RT) (85.5%). Sentinel node biopsy and axillary dissection were performed in 27.4% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. Hormonotherapy was prescribed in 45.2% of cases. Tumour nuclear grade was as follows: low (16.7% of cases), intermediate (23%), and high (55.6%). Excision was complete (margins >= 1 mm) in 75% of patients treated with BCS alone vs. 95.7% for BCS+RT. The treatment approach varied widely: mastectomy rates ranged from 7.1% to 26.7% of centres, BCS+RT from 55.5% to 87.8%, and hormonotherapy from 3.3% to 83.3%. At a median follow-up of 102.6 months, 14 patients (5.6%) presented ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence.Conclusions: These findings on DCIS management in Catalonia are consistent with previous international reports. The inter-centre differences observed are similar to those reported in other international surveys during the same period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Water-soluble fraction of petroleum induces genotoxicity and morphological effects in fat snook (<i>Centropomus parallelus</i>)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Petroleum hydrocarbons are one of the primary organic chemicals found in water bodies, and the water-soluble fraction of petroleum (WSFP) may be responsible for much of the toxic effects. In the present study, genotoxicity assays and histopathological analysis of the gills were analyzed for two experimental protocols: 1) Juvenile Centropomus parallelus were exposed to different concentrations of WFSP (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) for 96 h; 2) A second fish group was exposed to 50% WFSP for 168 h followed by a post-exposure period for 168 h in clean water (recovery). The total benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations at time 0 were 254 mu g L-1 and 4.72 mu g L-1 in 25%; 552.9 mu g L-1 and 9.36 mu g L-1 in 50%; and 842.4 mu g L-1 and 9.97 mu g L-1 in 75% WSFP, respectively. Based on the alkaline comet assay, the damage index (DI) values of fish exposed to 25% WSFP for 96 h were significantly higher than those in the control group, and in the micronucleus test, the higher damage values were found in fish exposed to 75% WSFP. Furthermore, this last genotoxic test showed recovery after 168 h. At all concentrations of WSFP, several histopathological changes were observed, and overall, most of these changes observed in the gills were classified as proliferative changes and represented a protective mechanism against pollutant uptake. Based on the recovery experiment, the damage was also significantly reduced after recovery. Our results showed that short-term exposure to WSFP compounds triggered cellular alterations in C. parallelus, but total recovery did not occur with time. Additionally, the different periods of exposure were not sufficient to induce severe gill damage in C. parallelus. Moreover, this fish demonstrated its usefulness as a sentinel species.

TI  - Integrated Application of Remote Sensing, GIS and Hydrological Modeling to Estimate the Potential Impact Area of Earthquake-Induced Dammed Lakes
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Dammed lakes are an important secondary hazard caused by earthquakes. They can induce further damage to nearby humans. Current hydrology calculation research on dammed lakes usually lacks spatial expressive ability and cannot accurately conduct impact assessment without the support of remote sensing, which obtains important characteristic information of dammed lakes. The current study aims to address the issues of the potential impact area estimate of earthquake-induced dammed lakes by combining remote sensing (RS), a geographic information system (GIS), and hydrological modeling. The Tangjiashan dammed lake induced by the Wenchuan earthquake was selected as the case for study. The elevation-versus-reservoir capacity curve was first calculated using the seed-growing algorithm based on digital elevation model (DEM) data. The simulated annealing algorithm was applied to train the hydrological modeling parameters according to the historical hydrologic data. Then, the downstream water elevation variational process under different collapse capacity conditions was performed based on the obtained parameters. Finally, the downstream potential impact area was estimated by the highest water elevation values at different hydrologic sections. Results show that a flood with a collapse elevation of at least 680 m will impact the entire downstream region of Beichuan town. We conclude that spatial information technology combined with hydrological modeling can accurately predict and demonstrate the potential impact area with limited data resources. This paper provides a better guide for future immediate responses to dammed lake hazard mitigation.

TI  - Modeling seasonal surface temperature variations in secondary tropical dry forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary tropical dry forests (TDFs) provide important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and nutrient cycle regulation. However, their biogeophysical processes at the canopy atmosphere interface remain unknown, limiting our understanding of how this endangered ecosystem influences, and responds to the ongoing global warming. To facilitate future development of conservation policies, this study characterized the seasonal land surface temperature (LST) behavior of three successional stages (early, intermediate, and late) of a TDF, at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. A total of 38 Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and the Surface Reflectance (SR) product were utilized to model LST time series from July 2013 to July 2016 using a radiative transfer equation (RTE) algorithm. We further related the LST time series to seven vegetation indices which reflect different properties of TDFs, and soil moisture data obtained from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Results showed that the LST in the dry season was 15-20 K higher than in the wet season at SRNP. We found that the early successional stages were about 6-8 K warmer than the intermediate successional stages and were 9-10 K warmer than the late successional stages in the middle of the dry season; meanwhile, a minimum LST difference (0-1 K) was observed at the end of the wet season. Leaf phenology and canopy architecture explained most LST variations in both dry and wet seasons. However, our analysis revealed that it is precipitation that ultimately determines the LST variations through both biogeochemical (leaf phenology) and biogeophysical processes (evapotranspiration) of the plants. Results of this study could help physiological modeling studies in secondary TDFs.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Active Learning for Automatic Identification of Marine Oil Spills Using 10-Year (2004-2013) RADARSAT Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper intends to find a more cost-effective way for training oil spill classification systems by introducing active learning (AL) and exploring its potential, so that satisfying classifiers could be learned with reduced number of labeled samples. The dataset used has 143 oil spills and 124 look-alikes from 198 RADARSAT images covering the east and west coasts of Canada from 2004 to 2013. Six uncertainty-based active sample selecting (ACS) methods are designed to choose the most informative samples. A method for reducing information redundancy amongst the selected samples and a method with varying sample preference are considered. Four classifiers (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and decision tree (DT)) are coupled with ACS methods to explore the interaction and possible preference between classifiers and ACS methods. Three kinds of measures are adopted to highlight different aspect of classification performance of these AL-boosted classifiers. Overall, AL proves its strong potential with 4% to 78% reduction on training samples in different settings. The SVM classifier shows to be the best one for using in the AL frame, with perfect performance evolving curves in different kinds of measures. The exploration and exploitation criterion can further improve the performance of the AL-boosted SVM classifier but not of the other classifiers.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS-Aqua Atmospheric Correction and Chlorophyll Products of Western North American Coastal Waters Based on 13 Years of Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing need for satellite-derived accurate chlorophyll-a concentration (chla) products to improve fisheries management in coastal regions. However, the methods used to derive these products have to be evaluated, so the associated uncertainties are known. The performance of three atmospheric correction methods, the near infrared (NIR), the shortwave infrared (SWIR), and the Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models with an additional modification (MUMM + SWIR), and derived chla products based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AQUA (MODIS) images acquired from 2002 to 2014 over the west coast of Canada and the United States were evaluated. The atmospherically corrected products and above-water reflectance were compared with in situ AERONET (N similar to 650) and above-water reflectance (N similar to 34) data, and the Ocean Color 3 MODIS (OC3M)-derived chla were compared with in situ chla measurements (N similar to 82). The statistical analysis indicated that the MUMM + SWIR method was the most appropriate for this region, with relatively good retrievals of the atmospheric products, improved retrieval of remote sensing reflectance with bias lower than 20% for the OC3M bands, and improved retrievals of chla (r = 0.83, slope = 0.89, logRMSE = 0.33 mg m(-3) for +/- 1 h). The poorest chla retrievals were achieved with the SWIR and NIR methods. These results represent the most comprehensive satellite data analysis of MODIS retrievals for this region and provide a framework for the MUMM + SWIR method that can be further tested in other coastal regions of the world.

TI  - Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Node-Positive Breast Cancer at Diagnosis: Practice Patterns of American Society of Breast Surgeons Members
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The accuracy of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in clinically node-positive patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been investigated in clinical trials. This survey was designed to assess familiarity and impact of these trial findings into practice.Methods. American Society of Breast Surgeons members were invited by e-mail to complete an anonymous online survey. A total of 642 members responded (21% of 3090 eligible members). Results were summarized as proportions based on the number of responses to each question.Results. Respondents indicated knowledge of the Z1071 (86%), SENTINA (57%), and SN-FNAC (39%) trials. The published false negative rates (FNR) of the trials were correctly reported by 53% (336/638) of respondents. Before the trials, 45% (285/636) offered SLND compared with 85% (543/638) after the trials. In the 556 respondents who reported knowledge of at least one trial, 310 (56%) currently offer SLND to > 50% of patients, 175 (31%) offer to < 50%, and 70 (13%) routinely perform axillary lymph node dissection. Respondents who reported knowledge of the trials but did not change their practice to incorporate SLND (n = 67) cited concerns over lack of outcome data (64%), worries about FNR (42%), lack of resources (34%), or objections from radiation oncologists (25%), medical oncologists (18%), or other surgeons (8%).Conclusions. The publication of trials evaluating SLND in clinically node-positive patients has resulted in changes in practice. Concerns over the FNR and lack of outcome data limit incorporation of SLND into practice by some surgeons.

TI  - Reconstructing the pattern of the Bara Shigri Glacier fluctuation since the end of the Little Ice Age, Chandra valley, north-western Himalaya
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pattern of glacial records since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) are essential for evaluating glacier fluctuations and their link to post-LIA climate change. Although recession of the Himalayan glaciers is well-documented in this period, debate continues as to the magnitude and accuracy of estimated recession rates. This study presents a reconstruction of the pattern of fluctuations at the Bara Shigri Glacier in the Himachal Himalaya during the termination of the LIA (approximate to 1850). A multi-data integrative analysis (MDIA) technique consisting of repeat terrestrial photographs, historical archives and reports, geomorphological evidence and maps, and high to medium spatial resolution satellite images (Corona, Hexagon, Landsat and WorldView-2) was used with supplemented by extensive field validation. The results indicate that during the early part of the 19th century the terminus of Bara Shigri Glacier was at approximate to 3900 m asl. Following this, there was a continuous recession with a total retreat of 2898 +/- 50 m, which corresponds to a frontal areal loss of 4 +/- 1 km(2) in the last 151 years (1863-2014). Compared to this, during the last half century (1965-2014), the glacierised area was reduced by 1.1 +/- 0.02 km(2) with a concomitant terminus retreat of 1100 +/- 32 m. The early 19th century advance is ascribed to a combination of cooling during this period, glacier topographical characteristics and contributions from steep-fronted avalanching tributaries. The late 19th century recession can be attributed to an overall increase in the temperature with a corresponding decrease in precipitation in the north-western Himalaya. Results are at variance with earlier, larger estimates of the frontal area loss for the Bara Shigri Glacier using either Survey of India (SoI) topographic maps or coarse spatial resolution satellite images (e.g. Landsat MSS) as historical datasets, and demonstrate the utility of mixed method approaches including higher-resolution satellite imagery for accurate estimation of glacier behaviour in this region.

TI  - Radar polarization and ecological pattern properties across Mediterranean to-arid transition zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Full polarimetric L-band PALSAR data facilitated one of the first empirical assessments of the relationships between radar polarization properties (RPPs) and ecological pattern properties (EPPs) in desert fringe ecosystems. Correlations between radar parameters (polarized backscattering intensities, their ratios, entropy, and degrees of polarization) and remotely sensed ecological parameters (shrub cover, edge parameter, average shrub height, and biomass information) were analyzed for 52 least-disturbed sites along a climatic gradient between semi-arid and arid zones in the south-eastern Mediterranean. The degree of horizontal polarization (DOHP) was the RPP that was most highly correlated with all EPPs, while NDVIR biomass (NDVI multiplied by relative rainfall) was the EPP most highly correlated with all RPPs. Combinations of NDVIR biomass and DOHP data exhibited consistent inverse relationships for both the 52 least-disturbed sites as well as for the entire gradient. Mapping these combinations along the transition zone enabled differentiation of desert fringe areas and dense shrub and tree areas, with three transition typologies between the two. Although DOHP is instrumental in detecting changes in tall shrub coverage, it was found to be insufficiently sensitive to surface conditions in areas with dwarf shrubs and shrubs of biomass lower than 0.7 kg/m(2) at the end of the summer. Differentiation between the desert, desert fringe, and semi-arid margins of high DOHP values (> 0.9) was facilitated by differences in their NDVIR biomass. Areas of high anthropogenic influence on the landscape, i.e. abandoned terraces and low-density pine plantations, deviate significantly from the inverse DOHP and NDVIR biomass relationship, as both were characterized by low values in these parameterization. The wide extent of DOHP and NDVIR combinations representing desert fringe ecosystems and arid lands indicated a continuation of degradation processes in areas with rainfalls > 500 mm/year. The technique developed, which utilizes DOHP, provides new means for mapping desert fringe ecosystems and for exploring desertification over wide regions.

TI  - Integrating multisensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction in support of machine learning for better water quality management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality changes in lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and coastal waters is critical in response to the needs for sustainable development. This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed "cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ground Deformation for Monitoring Groundwater Management Practices: Application to the Santa Clara Valley During the 2012-2015 California Drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater management typically relies on water-level data and spatially limited deformation measurements. While interferometric synthetic aperture radar has been used to study hydrological deformation, its limited temporal sampling can lead to biases in rapidly changing systems. Here we use 2011-2017 COSMO-SkyMed data with revisit intervals as short as 1day to study the response of the Santa Clara Valley (SCV) aquifer in California to the unprecedented 2012-2015 drought. Cross-correlation and independent component analyses of deformation time series enable tracking water through the aquifer system. The aquifer properties are derived prior to and during the drought to assess the success of water-resource management practices. Subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal dominates during 2011-2017, limited to the confined aquifer and west of the Silver Creek Fault, similar to predrought summer periods. Minimum water levels and elevations were reached in mid-2014, but thanks to intensive groundwater management efforts the basin started to rebound in late 2014, during the deepening drought. By 2017, water levels were back to their predrought levels, while elevations had not yet fully rebounded due to the delayed poroelastic response of aquitards and their large elastic compressibility. As water levels did not reach a new lowstand, the drought led to only elastic and recoverable changes in the SCV. The SCV lost 0.09km(3) during the drought while seasonal variations amount to 0.02km(3). Analysis of surface loads due to water mass changes in the aquifer system suggests that groundwater drawdowns could influence the stress on nearby faults.

TI  - Separability of coffee leaf rust infection levels with machine learning methods at Sentinel-2 MSI spectral resolutions
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee leaf rust (CLR) caused by the fungus Hemileia vastarix is a devastating disease in almost all coffee producing countries and remote sensing approaches have the potential to monitor the disease. This study evaluated the potential of Sentinel-2 band settings for discriminating CLR infection levels at leaf levels. Field spectra were resampled to the band settings of the Sentinel-2, and evaluated using the random forest (RF) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) algorithms with and without variable optimization. Using all variables, Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI)-derived vegetation indices achieved higher overall accuracy of 76.2% when compared to 69.8% obtained using raw spectral bands. Using the RF out-of-bag (OOB) scores, 4 spectral bands and 7 vegetation indices were identified as important variables in CLR discrimination. Using the PLS-DA Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) score, 3 Sentinel-2 spectral bands (B4, B6 and B5) and 5 vegetation indices were found to be important variables. Use of the identified variables improved the CLR discrimination accuracies to 79.4 and 82.5% for spectral bands and indices respectively when discriminated with the RF. Discrimination accuracy slightly increased through variable optimization for PLS-DA using spectral bands (63.5%) and vegetation indices (71.4%). Overall, this study showed the potential of the Sentinel 2 MSI band settings for CLR discrimination as part of crop condition assessment. Nevertheless further studies are required under field conditions.

TI  - Using LiDAR surveys to document floods: A case study of the 2008 Iowa flood
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Can we use Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), an emergent remote sensing technology with wide applications, to document floods with high accuracy? To explore the feasibility of this application, we propose a method to extract distributed inundation depths from a LiDAR survey conducted during flooding. This method consists of three steps: (1) collecting LiDAR data during flooding; (2) classifying the LiDAR observational points as flooded water surface points and non-flooded points, and generating a floodwater surface elevation model; and (3) subtracting the bare earth Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the flood surface elevation model to obtain a flood depth map. We applied this method to the 2008 Iowa flood in the United States and evaluated the results using the high-water mark measurements, flood extent extracted from SPOT (Small Programmable Object Technology) imagery, and the near simultaneously acquired aerial photography. The root mean squared error of the LiDAR-derived floodwater surface profile to high-water marks was 30 cm, the consistency between the two flooded areas derived from LiDAR and SPOT imagery was 72% (81% if suspicious isolated ponds in the SPOT-derived extent were removed), and LiDAR-derived flood extent had a horizontal resolution of 3 m. This work demonstrates that LiDAR technology has the potential to provide calibration and validation reference data with appreciable accuracy for improved flood inundation modeling. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Application of Deep Networks to Oil Spill Detection Using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing provides an outstanding tool in oil spill detection and classification, for its advantages in distinguishing mineral oil and biogenic lookalikes. Various features can be extracted from polarimetric SAR data. The large number and correlated nature of polarimetric SAR features make the selection and optimization of these features impact on the performance of oil spill classification algorithms. In this paper, deep learning algorithms such as the stacked autoencoder (SAE) and deep belief network (DBN) are applied to optimize the polarimetric feature sets and reduce the feature dimension through layer-wise unsupervised pre-training. An experiment was conducted on RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric SAR image acquired during the Norwegian oil-on-water exercise of 2011, in which verified mineral, emulsions, and biogenic slicks were analyzed. The results show that oil spill classification achieved by deep networks outperformed both support vector machine (SVM) and traditional artificial neural networks (ANN) with similar parameter settings, especially when the number of training data samples is limited.

TI  - Regional contribution to variability and trends of global gross primary productivity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest component of the global carbon cycle and a key process for understanding land ecosystems dynamics. In this study, we used GPP estimates from a combination of eight global biome models participating in the Inter-Sectoral Impact-Model Intercomparison Project phase 2a (ISIMIP2a), the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product, and a data-driven product (Model Tree Ensemble, MTE) to study the spatiotemporal variability of GPP at the regional and global levels. We found the 2000-2010 total global GPP estimated from the model ensemble to be 117 +/- 13 PgC yr(-1) (mean +/- 1 standard deviation), which was higher than MODIS (112 Pg C yr(-1)), and close to the MTE (120 Pg C yr(-1)). The spatial patterns of MODIS, MTE and ISIMIP2a GPP generally agree well, but their temporal trends are different, and the seasonality and inter-annual variability of GPP at the regional and global levels are not completely consistent. For the model ensemble, Tropical Latin America contributes the most to global GPP, Asian regions contribute the most to the global GPP trend, the Northern Hemisphere regions dominate the global GPP seasonal variations, and Oceania is likely the largest contributor to inter-annual variability of global GPP. However, we observed large uncertainties across the eight ISIMIP2a models, which are probably due to the differences in the formulation of underlying photosynthetic processes. The results of this study are useful in understanding the contributions of different regions to global GPP and its spatiotemporal variability, how the model-and observational-based GPP estimates differ from each other in time and space, and the relative strength of the eight models. Our results also highlight the models' ability to capture the seasonality of GPP that are essential for understanding the inter-annual and seasonal variability of GPP as a major component of the carbon cycle.

TI  - An Accurate Estimate of Monthly Mean Land Surface Temperatures from MODIS Clear-Sky Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS thermal sensors can provide us with global land surface temperature (LST) several times each day, but have difficulty in obtaining information from the land surface in cloudy situations. As a result, the monthly day or night LST products [Terra monthly day LST (TMD), Terra monthly night LST (TMN), Aqua monthly day LST (AMD), and Aqua monthly night LST (AMN)] are the average LST values calculated over a variable number of clear-sky days in a month. Is it possible to derive an accurate estimate of monthly mean LST based on averaging of the multidaily overpasses of MODISsensors? In situ ground measurements and ERA-Interim reanalyses data, both of which provide continuous information in either clear or cloudy conditions, have been used to validate the approach. Using LST measurements from 156 ground flux towers, it was found that the three mean values LST((AMD,AMN) over bar), LST((TMD,TMN) over bar), and LST((AMD,AMN,TMD,TMN) over bar) (mean biases of 0.19, 0.59, and 0.40 K, respectively) can all provide a reliable estimate of all-sky monthly mean LST. Of the three means, we recommend the use of LST((AMD,AMN,TMD,TMN) over bar) for monthly mean LST in climate studies as it provides the most complete coverage. When retrievals from either Terra or Aqua are not available, then either LST((AMD,AMN) over bar) or LST((TMD,TMN) over bar) may be used to fill the gaps. The intrinsic error in the MODIS monthly mean LST cannot be explained from monthly mean view time, view angle, and clear-sky ratio. MODIS monthly LST calculated using this approach LST((AMD,AMN,TMD,TMN) over tilde) (RMSE52.65, mean bias, <+/- 1K) will have wide applicability for climate studies and numerical model evaluation.

TI  - Improving Land Use/Cover Classification with a Multiple Classifier System Using AdaBoost Integration Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Guangzhou has experienced a rapid urbanization since 1978 when China initiated the economic reform, resulting in significant land use/cover changes (LUC). To produce a time series of accurate LUC dataset that can be used to study urbanization and its impacts, Landsat imagery was used to map LUC changes in Guangzhou from 1987 to 2015 at a three-year interval using a multiple classifier system (MCS). The system was based on a weighted vector to combine base classifiers of different classification algorithms, and was improved using the AdaBoost technique. The new classification method used support vector machines (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, and neural networks (ANN) as the training algorithms of the base classifiers, and produced higher overall classification accuracy (88.12%) and Kappa coefficient (0.87) than each base classifier did. The results of the experiment showed that, based on the accuracy improvement of each class, the overall accuracy was improved effectively, which combined advantages from each base classifier. The new method is of high robustness and low risk of overfitting, and is reliable and accurate, and could be used for analyzing urbanization processes and its impacts.

TI  - Examining the Influence of Crop Residue Burning on Local PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in Heilongjiang Province Using Ground Observation and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although a many studies concerning crop residue burning have been conducted, the influence of crop residue burning on local PM2.5 concentrations remains unclear. The number of crop residue burning spots was the highest in Heilongjiang province and we extracted crop residue burning spots for this region using MOD14A1 (Thermal Anomalies & Fire Daily L3 Global 1 km) data and national land cover data. By analyzing the temporal variation of crop residue burning and PM2.5 concentrations in Heilongjiang province, we found that the total number of crop residue burning spots was not correlated with the variations of PM2.5 concentrations at a provincial (regional) scale. However, crop residue burning exerted notable influence on the variations of PM2.5 concentrations at a local scale. We experimented with a set of buffer zone radiuses to examine the influencing area of crop residue burning. The results suggest that the valid influencing area of crop residue burning was between 50 and 80 km. The mean PM2.5 concentration measured at stations close to crop residue burning spots was more than 60 mu g/m(3) higher than that measured at stations not close to crop residue burning spots. However, no consistent, significant correlation existed between the existence of crop residue burning spots and local PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that local PM2.5 concentrations were influenced by a diversity of factors and not solely controlled by crop residue burning. This research also provides suggestions for better understanding the role of crop residue burning in local and regional air pollution.

TI  - Preoperative MRI Features Associated With Lymphovascular Invasion in Node-Negative Invasive Breast Cancer: A Propensity-Matched Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: In node-negative disease, the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is reported to be an unfavorable prognostic factor. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative breast MRI features are associated with LVI in patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer by a propensity-matched analysis.Materials and Methods: Among 389 patients with node-negative invasive ductal breast cancer who had preoperative breast 3.0 Tesla MRI with precontrast T2-weighted fat-suppressed, pre- and dynamic postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed sequences, 61 patients with LVI (LVI group) were matched with 183 patients without LVI (no LVI group) at a ratio of 1:3 in terms of age, histologic grade, tumor size, and hormone receptor status. Two radiologists reviewed the MRI features, following profiles of focal breast edema (peritumoral, prepectoral, subcutaneous), intratumoral T2 signal intensity, adjacent vessel sign, and increased ipsilateral whole-breast vascularity, in addition to 2013 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon.Results: The presence of peritumoral edema (45.9% [28/61] versus 30.6% [56/183], P=0.030) and adjacent vessel sign (82.0% [50/61] versus 68.3% [125/183], P=0.041) was significantly associated with LVI. Prepectoral edema was also more frequently observed in the LVI group than in the no LVI group with borderline significance (26.2% [16/61] versus 15.3% [28/183], P=0.055). In cases of nonmass enhancement, regional enhancement was more frequently found in the LVI group than in the no LVI group (60.0% [3/4] versus 5.9% [1/4], P=0.042).Conclusion: Preoperative breast MRI features may be associated with LVI in patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer.

TI  - A Novel Methodology to Label Urban Remote Sensing Images Based on Location-Based Social Media Photos
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the internet and popularization of intelligent mobile devices, social media is evolving fast and contains rich spatial information, such as geolocated posts, tweets, photos, video, and audio. Those location-based social media data have offered new opportunities for hazards and disaster identification or tracking, recommendations for locations, friends or tags, pay-per-click advertising, etc. Meanwhile, a massive amount of remote sensing (RS) data can be easily acquired in both high temporal and spatial resolution with a multiple satellite system, if RS maps can be provided, to possibly enable the monitoring of our location-based living environments with some devices like charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras but on a much larger scale. To generate the classification maps, usually, labeled RS image pixels should be provided by RS experts to train a classification system. Traditionally, labeled samples are obtained according to ground surveys, image photo interpretation or a combination of the aforementioned strategies. All the strategies should be taken care of by domain experts, in a means which is costly, time consuming, and sometimes of a low quality due to reasons such as photo interpretation based on RS images only. These practices and constraints make it more challenging to classify land-cover RS images using big RS data. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to classify urban RS images by exploiting the semantics of location-based social media photos (SMPs). To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, an automatic classification system is developed based on RS images as well as SMPs via big data analysis techniques including active learning, crowdsourcing, shallow machine learning, and deep learning. As the labels of RS training data are given by ordinary people with a crowdsourcing technique, the developed system is named Crowd4RS. The quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Crowd4RS system as well as the proposed methodology for automatically generating RS image maps in terms of classification results based on big RS data made up of multispectral RS images in a high spatial resolution and a large amount of photos from social media sites, such as Flickr and Panoramio.

TI  - A multi-scale high-resolution analysis of global sea surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis presents daily SST estimates on a global 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees grid. The current version (Version 4.1, http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GHGMR-4FJ04) features the 1-km resolution MODIS retrievals, which are fused with AVHRR GAC, microwave, and in-situ SST data by applying internal correction for relative biases among the data sets. Only the night-time (dusk to dawn locally) satellite SST retrievals are used to estimate the foundation SST. The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36 degrees C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products.The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a "mesh-less" interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples. Future improvements of the MUR SST analysis will include ingestion of day-time MODIS retrievals as well as more recent high-resolution SST retrievals from VIIRS.

TI  - A Hybrid Pansharpening Algorithm of VHR Satellite Images that Employs Injection Gains Based on NDVI to Reduce Computational Costs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm for pansharpening of very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery that reduces the spectral distortion of the pansharpened images and enhances their spatial clarity with minimal computational costs. In order to minimize the spectral distortion and computational costs, the global injection gain is transformed to the local injection gains using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), on the assumption that the NDVI are positively or negatively correlated with local injection gains obtained from each band of the satellite data. In addition, the local injection gains are then applied in the hybrid pansharpening algorithm to optimize the spatial clarity. In particular, in the proposed algorithm, a synthetic intensity image is determined using block-based linear regression. In experiments using imagery collected by various satellites, such as KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3), KOMPSAT-3A and WorldView-3, the pansharpened results obtained using the proposed Hybrid Pansharpening algorithm using NDVI and based on the spectral mode (HP-NDVIspectral) provide a better representation of the values of the Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS), the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and the Q4/Q8 than those produced by existing pansharpening algorithms. In terms of spatial quality, the pansharpened images obtained using the proposed pansharpening algorithm based on the spatial mode (HP-NDVIspatial) have higher average gradient (AG) values than those obtained using existing pansharpening methods. In addition, the computational complexity of our method is similar to that of a pansharpening algorithm that is based on a global injection model, although our methodology has characteristics that are similar to those of a local injection gain-based model that has a very high computational cost. Thus, the quantitative and qualitative assessments presented here indicate that the proposed algorithm can be utilized in various applications that employ spectral information or require high spatial clarity.

TI  - Watershed classification by remote sensing indices: A fuzzy c-means clustering approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the relatively similar hydrological properties of the watersheds is very crucial in order to readily classify them for management practices such as flood and soil erosion control. This study aimed to identify homogeneous hydrological watersheds using remote sensing data in western Iran. To achieve this goal, remote sensing indices including SAVI, LAI, NDMI, NDVI and snow cover, were extracted from MODIS data over the period 2000 to 2015. Then, a fuzzy method was used to clustering the watersheds based on the extracted indices. A fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm enabled to classify 38 watersheds in three homogeneous groups. The optimal number of clusters was determined through evaluation of partition coefficient, partition entropy function and trial and error. The results indicated three homogeneous regions identified by the fuzzy c-mean clustering and remote sensing product which are consistent with the variations of topography and climate of the study area. Inherently, the grouped watersheds have similar hydrological properties and are likely to need similar management considerations and measures.

TI  - River channel segmentation in polarimetric SAR images: Watershed transform combined with average contrast maximisation
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This publication presents a computer method allowing river channels to be segmented based on SAR polarimetric images. Solutions have been proposed which are based on a morphological approach using the watershed segmentation and combining regions by maximising the average contrast. The image processing methods were developed so that their computational complexity is as low as possible, which is of particular importance in analysing high resolution SAR/polarimetric SAR images, where it has a measurable impact on the total segmentation time. What is more, compared to the existing solutions known from the literature review: (1) in the proposed approach, there is no need to execute further steps necessary to eliminate objects (i.e. background components) located outside the river channel from the image as a result of the segmentation carried out, (2) there is no need to sample the entire image and carry out a pixel-wise classification to prepare the segmentation process. If the steps listed in items (1) - (2) are performed, they can, unfortunately, extend the segmentation time. The experiments completed on images acquired from the ALOS PALSAR satellite for different regions of the world have shown a high quality of the segmentations carried out and a high computational efficiency compared to state-of-the art methods. Consequently, the proposed method can be used as a useful tool for monitoring changes in river courses and adopted in expert and intelligent systems used for analysing remote sensing data.

TI  - Comparison of simulated hyperspectral HyspIRI and multispectral Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for multi-seasonal, regional land-cover mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used simulated hyperspectral (HyspIRI) and multispectral (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) satellite imagery to compare regional land-cover mapping capabilities (San Francisco Bay Area, California) within an analytical framework that included consistent reference data and classification rules. Imagery had the pixel resolution (30 m) and extent (30,000 km(2)) of a Landsat scene, with multi-seasonal (spring, summer, fall) acquisitions from year 2013. Primary study objectives were to assess differences in map accuracy related to Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers, spectral resolution (hyperspectral vs. multispectral), and temporal resolution (multi-seasonal vs. summer). The RF classifier generally outperformed MESMA by 1.1 to 9.0% overall accuracy, with the exception of summer HyspIRI reflectance data. There were no clear patterns in accuracy when comparing HyspIRI and simulated multispectral reflectance bands with RF and MESMA classifiers. With summer data, HyspIRI had significantly higher accuracy for MESMA (+ 5.5 to + 8.7%) and significantly lower accuracy for RF (-9.7 to -16.4%). There were no significant differences in accuracy when using multi-seasonal HyspIRI and multispectral data with RF or MESMA (< 1.2% differences). There were highly significant improvements in overall accuracy (1.7 to 20.9%) with multi-season over summer-only images for all sensors, sample scales and classifiers. This result indicates that repeat image acquisitions from satellite sensors are important for land -cover classification, irrespective of sensor spectral resolution. A companion study (Clark & Kilham, 2016) that used RF with hyperspectral metrics derived from HyspIRI reflectance bands (from indices, derivatives, and absorption fitting) showed significant improvements in overall accuracy relative to map classifications in this study, which all used independent reflectance bands. These findings point to the need of additional land-cover mapping research with machine learning and hyperspectral data that span the spatial and temporal scales afforded by a satellite.

TI  - Coupling hydrodynamic and wave models: first step and sensitivity experiments in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work describes the first step towards a fully coupled modelling system composed of an ocean circulation and a wind wave model. Sensitivity experiments are presented for the Mediterranean Sea where the hydrodynamic model NEMO is coupled with the third-generation wave model WaveWatchIII (WW3). Both models are implemented at 1/16 degrees horizontal resolution and are forced by ECMWF 1/4 degrees horizontal resolution atmospheric fields. The models are two-way coupled at hourly intervals exchanging the following fields: sea surface currents and temperature are transferred from NEMO to WW3 by modifying the mean momentum transfer of waves and the wind speed stability parameter, respectively. The neutral drag coefficient computed by WW3 is then passed to NEMO, which computes the surface stress. Five-year (2009-2013) numerical experiments were carried out in both uncoupled and coupled mode. In order to validate the modelling system, numerical results were compared with coastal and drifting buoys and remote sensing data. The results show that the coupling of currents with waves improves the representation of the wave spectrum. However, the wave-induced drag coefficient shows only minor improvements in NEMO circulation fields, such as temperature, salinity, and currents.

TI  - Observation Bias Correction Reveals More Rapidly Draining Lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet enables the establishment of surface-to-bed hydrologic connections and subsequent basal water delivery. Estimates of the number and spatial distribution of rapidly draining lakes vary widely, and no study has so far quantified the impact of observation bias due to cloud cover in satellite imagery on reported frequency of rapid lake drainage. To better understand the rapid drainage mechanism, we map and track an average of 515 supraglacial lakes per year in central West Greenland from 2000 to 2015. We test four previously published definitions of rapid lake drainage and find the proportion of rapidly draining lakes to vary from 3% to 38% and to be strongly dependent on observation frequency. We then apply an observation bias correction and test three new drainage criteria, which reveal a bias-corrected rapid drainage probability of 36-45%. When observation bias is addressed, we can also show that lakes above 1,600 m are as likely to drain rapidly as lakes located at lower elevations. We conclude that inconsistent detection methodologies and observation bias have obscured the true frequency of rapidly draining lakes and that the rapid lake drainage mechanism will establish surface-to-bed hydrologic connections at increasing distance from the margin as supraglacial lakes expand inland under climate warming.

TI  - Active tectonic deformation of the western Indian plate boundary: A case study from the Chaman Fault System
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Collision of the Eurasian and Indian plates has resulted in two spatially offset subduction zones, the Makran subduction zone to the south and the Himalayan convergent margin to the north. These zones are linked by a system of left-lateral strike-slip faults known as the Chaman Fault System, similar to 1200 km, which spans along western Pakistan. Although this is one of the greatest strike-slip faults, yet temporal and spatial variation in displacement has not been adequately defined along this fault system. This study conducted geomorphic and geodetic investigations along the Chaman Fault in a search for evidence of spatial variations in motion. Four study areas were selected over the span of the Chaman Fault: (1) Tarnak-Rud area over the Tarnak-Rud valley, (2) Spinatizha area over the Spinatizha Mountain Range, (3) Nushki area over the Nushki basin, and (4) Kharan area over the northern tip of the Central Makran Mountains. Remote sensing data allowed for in depth mapping of different components and faults within the Kohjak group. Wind and water gap pairs along with offset rivers were identified Using high-resolution imagery and digital-elevation models to show displacement for the four study areas. The mountain-front-sinuosity ratio, valley height-to-width-ratio, and the stream-length-gradient index were calculated and used to determine the relative tectonic activity of each area. These geomorphic indices suggest that the Kharan area is the most active and the Tarnak-Rud area is the least active. GPS data were processed into a stable Indian plate reference frame and analyzed. Fault parallel velocity versus fault normal distance yielded a similar to 8-10 mm/yr displacement rate along the Chaman Fault just north of the Spinatizha area. InSAR data were also integrated to assess displacement rates along the fault system. Geodetic data support that ultra-slow earthquakes similar to those that strike along other major strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault System, are possible along the northern segments of the Chaman Fault zone. Geomorphic data suggest that the Chaman Fault along southern part is not very active now but may have gone through high tectonic activity in the past.

TI  - Modeling study of biomass burning plumes and their impact on urban air quality; a case study of Santiago de Chile
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 4, 2014, during the summer period in South America, an intense forest and dry pasture wildfire occurred nearby the city of Santiago de Chile. On that day the biomass-burning plume was transported by low-intensity winds towards the metropolitan area of Santiago and impacted the concentration of pollutants in this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) is implemented to investigate the biomass-burning plume associated with these wildfires nearby Santiago, which impacted the ground-level ozone concentration and exacerbated Santiago's air quality. Meteorological variables simulated by WRF/Chem are compared against surface and radiosonde observations, and the results show that the model reproduces fairly well the observed wind speed, wind direction air temperature and relative humidity for the case studied. Based on an analysis of the transport of an inert tracer released over the locations, and at the time the wildfires were captured by the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the model reproduced reasonably well the transport of biomass burning plume towards the city of Santiago de Chile within a time delay of two hours as observed in ceilometer data. A six day air quality simulation was performed: the first three days were used to validate the anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, and the last three days (during and after the wildfire event) to analyze the performance of WRF/Chem plume-rise model within FINNv1 fire emission estimations. The model presented a satisfactory performance on the first days of the simulation when contrasted against data from the well established air quality network over the city of Santiago de Chile. These days represent the urban air quality base case for Santiago de Chile unimpacted by fire emissions. However, for the last three simulation days, which were impacted by the fire emissions, the statistical indices showed a decrease in the model performance. While the model showed a satisfactory evidence that wildfires plumes that originated in the vicinity of Santiago de Chile were transported towards the urban area and impacted the air quality, the model still underpredicted some pollutants substantially, likely due to misrepresentation of fire emission sources during those days. Potential uncertainties may include to the land use/land cover classifications and its characteristics, such as type and density of vegetation assigned to the region, where the fire spots are detected. The variability of the ecosystem type during the fire event might also play a role. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The pulsating nature of large-scale Saharan dust transport as a result of interplays between mid-latitude Rossby waves and the North African Dipole Intensity
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It was previously shown that during August the export of Saharan dust to the Atlantic was strongly affected by the difference of the 700-hPa geopotential height anomaly between the subtropics and the tropics over North Africa, which was termed the North African Dipole Intensity (NAFDI). In this work a more comprehensive analysis of the NAFDI is performed, focusing on the entire summer dust season (June September), and examining the interactions between the mid-latitude Rossby waves (MLRWs) and NAFDI. Widespread and notable aerosol optical depth (AOD) monthly anomalies are found for each NAFDI-phase over the dust corridors off the Sahara, indicating that NAFDI presents intra-seasonal variability and drives dust transport over both the Mediterranean basin and the North Atlantic. Those summer months with the same NAFDI-phase show similar AOD-anomaly patterns. Variations in NAFDI-phase also control the displacement of the Saharan Heat Low (SHL) westwards or eastwards through horizontal advection of temperature over Morocco-Western Sahara or eastern Algeria-Western Libya, respectively. The connection between the SHL and the NAFDI is quantified statistically by introducing two new daily indexes that account for their respective phases (NAFDI daily index -NAFDIDI-, and SHL longitudinal shift index -SHLLSI-) and explained physically using the energy equation of the atmospheric dynamics. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the one-day-lag SHLLSI and the NAFDIDI for an extended summer season (1980-2013) is 0.78. A positive NAFDI is associated with the West-phase of the SHL, dust sources intensification on central Algeria, and positive AOD anomalies over this region and the Subtropical North Atlantic. A negative NAFDI is associated with the East-phase of the SHL, and positive point out that the phase changes of NAFDI at intra-seasonal time scale are conducted by those MLRWs that penetrate deeply into the low troposphere.

TI  - Increase in Medical Emergency Calls and Calls for Central Nervous System Symptoms During a Severe Air Pollution Event, January 2013, Jinan City, China
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In January 2013, a continuous and severe haze event affected one third of the major cities in China, including Jinan. Objectives: We investigated whether medical emergency calls (for nonaccidental emergencies) and calls for Central Nervous System (CNS) syndromes increased during this episode compared with the previous winter months (January, February, and December) in 2011 and 2012.Methods: Daily emergency calls were obtained from Jinan Medical Emergency Center. Sentinel CNS syndromes from nonaccidental emergency calls included seven symptoms: headache, dizziness, syncope, coma, convulsions, paralysis, and epilepsy. Particles with aerodynamic diameter <10 mu m (PM 10) were used as the indicator of air pollution. A generalized linear model based on quasi-Poisson regression was used to evaluate the effects on nonaccidental emergency calls and calls for CNS syndromes and each symptom, separately, during this episode.Results: Markedly higher mean daily concentration, 332 mu g/m(3) of PM 10, during this episode versus reference months was found. Obviously increased effects on nonaccidental emergency calls and calls for CNS syndromes were observed during this episode, with relative risk (RR) value 1.3 (95% CI = 1.2, 1.3) and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1, 1.3). Four of seven CNS symptoms were also increased during this episode: RRs values for dizziness, convulsions, paralysis, and epilepsy were 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2, 1.7), 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1, 1.6), 1.6 (95% CI = 1.2, 2.1), and 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 2.0), respectively.Conclusions: A noticeable increase in medical emergency calls and calls for Central Nervous System syndromes were observed during a severe air pollution episode on January 2013, in a large Chinese city.

TI  - Supporting local health decision making with spatial video: Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika risks in a data poor, informal community in Nicaragua
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - One challenge facing spatial scientists trying to support public health outreach and intervention in challenging environments is the lack of fine scale spatial data. These data are required to gain a better understanding of both physical and social systems; why disease occurs where it does, and how to disrupt it. While data options exist, including high resolution aerial imagery, remotely.sensed data, and even online mapping products like Google Street View, these all come with limitations. One option that has previously been utilized to assess cholera risk is spatial video. Here it is used to map potential mosquito breeding sites in an endemic Dengue and Chikungunya, and emerging Zika impacted community. We show how this method can provide mapping support in the hands of non-specialist public health workers who, working in collaboration with out-of-area geographic information systems (GIS) teams, can identify whereto target limited intervention resources. We use a case study of an impoverished informal style Nicaraguan community suffering from a high disease burden to show spatial variation in potential mosquito breeding habitats. A field team collected street-by-street spatial video data to produce fine scale risk maps of standing water and trash locations, which, when interpreted with the associated spatial video imagery, were used to suggest where intervention strategies should be targeted. We also discuss how these same data layers can be used to address other health concerns traditionally found in informal settlements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing Forest Cover Dynamics and Forest Perception in the Atlantic Forest of Paraguay, Combining Remote Sensing and Household Level Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA) in Paraguay is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. The rapid growth of deforestation has resulted in the loss of 91% of its original cover. Numerous efforts have been made to halt deforestation activities, however farmers' perception towards the forest and its benefits has not been considered either in studies conducted so far or by policy makers. This research provides the first multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics of the forest within the BAAPA region on the one hand, and assesses the way farmers perceive the forest and how this influences forest conservation at the farm level on the other. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat images from 1999 to 2016 were used to measure the extent of the forest cover and deforestation rates over 17 years. Farmers' influence on the dynamics of the forest was evaluated by combining earth observation data and household survey results conducted in the BAAPA region in 2016. Outcomes obtained in this study demonstrate a total loss in forest cover of 7500 km(2). Deforestation rates in protected areas were determined by management regimes. The combination of household level and remote sensing data demonstrated that forest dynamics at the farm level is influenced by farm type, the level of dependency/use of forest benefits and the level of education of forest owners. An understanding of the social value awarded to the forest is a relevant contribution towards preserving natural resources.

TI  - CHARACTERIZING LANDSCAPE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY USING SEMIVARIOGRAM PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM NDVI IMAGES
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assuming a relationship between landscape heterogeneity and measures of spatial dependence by using remotely sensed data, the aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of semivariogram parameters, derived from satellite images with different spatial resolutions, to characterize landscape spatial heterogeneity of forested and human modified areas. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was generated in an area of Brazilian amazon tropical forest (1,000 km(2)). We selected samples (1 x 1 km) from forested and human modified areas distributed throughout the study area, to generate the semivariogram and extract the sill (sigma(2)-overall spatial variability of the surface property) and range (phi-the length scale of the spatial structures of objects) parameters. The analysis revealed that image spatial resolution influenced the sill and range parameters. The average sill and range values increase from forested to human modified areas and the greatest between-class variation was found for LANDSAT 8 imagery, indicating that this image spatial resolution is the most appropriate for deriving sill and range parameters with the intention of describing landscape spatial heterogeneity. By combining remote sensing and geostatistical techniques, we have shown that the sill and range parameters of semivariograms derived from NDVI images are a simple indicator of landscape heterogeneity and can be used to provide landscape heterogeneity maps to enable researchers to design appropriate sampling regimes. In the future, more applications combining remote sensing and geostatistical features should be further investigated and developed, such as change detection and image classification using object-based image analysis (OBIA) approaches.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent trend toward open Earth observation ( EO) data has revived a general interest in satellite-based monitoring and mapping of the Earth surface. The open policy now applied to LANDSAT data, and the starting of Sentinel operations, whose data are freely distributed even for commercial purposes, tore down a financial barrier to wider use of EO data in business activities, especially those with a narrow financial margin. Notwithstanding the flood of open data, some aspects of the Earth surface still escape satisfactory monitoring from space, especially in complex, anthropic areas. Due to insufficient spatial resolution, lack of visibility, or unsuitable revisit times, important pieces of information may not emerge from spaceborne data. In situ sensing can represent a vital source of integrative information to fill the aforementioned gaps and build a more complete and accurate picture of the situation and trends in the observed area. The contribution of in situ sensing was envisaged quite early in the Earth observation history, but for a long time it remained limited to tailored sensors displaced in strategic locations. With the increasing circulation of smartphones, a new opportunity has recently opened for a different paradigm of in situ sensing, offering a huge mass of additional data by tapping on data generated by mobile devices. Even if such data may be less specialized and less usable for various reasons, the sheer size of the data flow ensures that statistical analysis will pick possible useful clues. The increasing availability of mobile connections has indeed revived the concept of "crowdsourcing,"i.e., entrusting a pool of actors with problem solution or information collection tasks. In our scenario, individuals carrying mobile devices can become "citizen sensors" on a voluntary basis by contributing data through their connected terminals. Even considering the typical issues of crowdsourced data, like quality and reliability, the balance remains definitely positive. This paper provides an overview of the theme and discusses how it relates to an important, coordinated EO initiative like Copernicus. It finally presents a specific example realized in the framework of a recent research project under the Copernicus aegis.

TI  - Improving Survival in Patients Treated for a Lung Cancer Using Self-Evaluated Symptoms Reported Through a Web Application
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: We retrospectively compared survivals in patients with a lung cancer history and followed by the so-called sentinel Web-application that allows early detection of relapse and early palliative care initiation versus a conventional follow-up in our center.Methods: The survival in 98 consecutive patients with lung cancer was assessed. The first part of them (the control arm) was retrospectively recruited between March 2011 and August 2012. The second half of them (the experimental arm) was prospectively recruited between August 2012 and December 2013 to weekly fill a form of 11 self-assessed symptoms, then processed by the "sentinel" Web-application. Data were sent to this sentinel application in real-time between planned visits. An email alert was sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched some predefined criteria. Follow-up visit and imaging were then organized after a phone call for confirming the suspect symptoms. In the control arm (49 patients), a common follow-up was applied (visit and imaging every 2 to 6 mo according to stage of tumor and kind of treatment).Results: Median follow-up duration was 12.3 months in the experimental arm and 16.7 months in the control arm (P = 0.27). Survival was significantly better in the sentinel arm than in the control arm (P = 0.0014). Median survival was 16.7 months in the control arm and 22.4 months in the experimental arm. One-year survival was 86.6% in the experimental arm and 59.1% in the control arm.Conclusions: Survival may be improved by early detection of relapse and early palliative care initiation by using sentinel-like Web-application.

TI  - Nomograms for preoperative prediction of axillary nodal status in breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAxillary staging in patients with breast cancer and clinically node-negative disease is performed by sentinel node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to integrate feasible preoperative variables into nomograms to guide clinicians in stratifying treatment options into no axillary staging for patients with non-metastatic disease (N0), SLNB for those with one or two metastases, and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with three or more metastases.MethodsPatients presenting to Skane University Hospital, Lund, with breast cancer were included in a prospectively maintained registry between January 2009 and December 2012. Those with a preoperative diagnosis of nodal metastases were excluded. Patients with data on hormone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and Ki-67 expression were included to allow grouping into surrogate molecular subtypes. Based on logistic regression analyses, nomograms summarizing the strength of the associations between the predictors and each nodal status endpoint were developed. Predictive performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Bootstrap resampling was performed for internal validation.ResultsOf the 692 patients eligible for analysis, 248 were diagnosed with node-positive disease. Molecular subtype, age, mode of detection, tumour size, multifocality and vascular invasion were identified as predictors of any nodal disease. Nomograms that included these predictors demonstrated good predictive abilities, and comparable performances in the internal validation; the area under the ROC curve was 074 for N0versus any lymph node metastasis, 070 for one or two involved nodes versusN0, and 081 for at least three nodes versus two or fewer metastatic nodes.ConclusionThe nomograms presented facilitate preoperative decision-making regarding the extent of axillary surgery.Defines need for staging?

TI  - Desertification Susceptibility Mapping Using Logistic Regression Analysis in the Djelfa Area, Algeria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this work was to identify the areas that are most susceptible to desertification in a part of the Algerian steppe, and to quantitatively assess the key factors that contribute to this desertification. In total, 139 desertified zones were mapped using field surveys and photo-interpretation. We selected 16 spectral and geomorphic predictive factors, which a priori play a significant role in desertification. They were mainly derived from Landsat 8 imagery and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM). Some factors, such as the topographic position index (TPI) and curvature, were used for the first time in this kind of study. For this purpose, we adapted the logistic regression algorithm for desertification susceptibility mapping, which has been widely used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The logistic model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The model accuracy was 87.8%. We estimated the model uncertainties using a bootstrap method. Our analysis suggests that the predictive model is robust and stable. Our results indicate that land cover factors, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rangeland classes, play a major role in determining desertification occurrence, while geomorphological factors have a limited impact. The predictive map shows that 44.57% of the area is classified as highly to very highly susceptible to desertification. The developed approach can be used to assess desertification in areas with similar characteristics and to guide possible actions to combat desertification.

TI  - Beyond Color-blindness: (Re) Theorizing Racial Ideology
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of color-blind racial ideology has made a significant contribution to the understanding of contemporary racism through its elaboration of the dominant racial ideologya worldview grounded in the claim that race no longer matters as an obstacle to success in a postracial United States. Despite, or perhaps as a result of this success, the study of color-blind racial ideology has in many ways become stagnant. Following a critique of the current state of theorizing color-blindness, I strive to lay the foundation for a broader framework for understanding racial ideology. In this article, I undertake three core tasks: first, to present a general framework for understanding racial ideologies as fluid and dynamic constructions that are linked to a racial system; second, to outline how color-blind racial ideology is evolving and adapting in response to political challenges and changing social conditions; and finally, to discuss challenges to the hegemony of color-blindness and to propose an agenda for research on the future direction of racial ideology.

TI  - Transmission electron microscopy study of second phase particles irradiated by 2 MeV protons at 350 °C in Zr alloys
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the understanding of the microscopic phenomena occurring during irradiation in zirconium alloys, ion beam irradiations are performed at 350 degrees C (dose-rate of 2 x 10(-5) dpa/s) on recrystallized Zy-4 and M5((R)) alloys, with 2 MeV protons. The aim of this study is to determine in which way proton irradiations can be representative of neutron irradiations, considering the second phase particle changes and the influence of these changes on the microstructural evolution of the material during irradiation.The 2 MeV proton irradiation at 350 degrees C, performed here, seems to reproduces well what happened in Zy-4 in PWR conditions with a progressive amorphisation of the Zr(Fe,Cr)(2) Laves phases, but with a lower growth rate and a higher Fe/Cr ratio of the amorphous rim. The Zr(Fe,Nb)(2) s phase particles in M5((R)) undergo a uniform amorphisation, while the native beta Nb precipitates remain fully crystalline as evidenced in neutron irradiation at very low irradiation temperature. No radiation-enhanced precipitation of nanometric beta Nb particles was observed. Thus, for M5((R)) alloy, the present irradiation seems to be representative of neutron irradiations at a very low irradiation temperature. Nevertheless it does not reproduce what happens in PWR conditions, where no amorphisation and a drastic loss of iron is reported for the Zr(Fe,Nb)(2) Laves phase SPPs. Despite the lower iron rejection from the particles into the matrix during proton irradiation than during neutron irradiation, < c >-component loop distribution is found to be similar after both types of irradiations. These results underline the influence of both dose-rate and temperature on second phase particles behavior under irradiation and point out the complexity of iron rejection influence on the basal < c >-component loops. Indeed, although the < c >-component loop nucleation and growth seem locally correlated to iron dissolution into the matrix, they do not seem to be directly correlated to the global amount of iron rejected.

TI  - Quantifying the cool island effects of urban green spaces using remote sensing Data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) leads to increased energy consumption, aggravated pollution and threatened health of citizens. Urban green spaces mitigate UHI effects, however, it is still unclear how the green space characteristics and its surrounding environment affects the green space cool island (GCI). In this study, land surface temperature (LST) and land cover types within the outmost ring road of Shanghai, China were obtained from Landsat 8 data and high-resolution Google Earth data. The GCI effects were defined in three aspects: GCI range (GR), amplitude of temperature drop (TA) and temperature gradient (TG). Pearson correlation analysis was processed to get the relationship between the aspects and impact factors. The results indicated that the GCI principle could be explained by the thermal conduct theory. The efficient methods to decrease LST of green spaces include increasing green space area while staying below the threshold, adding complexity of green space shape, decreasing impervious surfaces and enlarging the area of water bodies. For the surrounding environment of the green spaces, increasing vegetation and water body fractions or decreasing impervious surfaces will help to strengthen GCI effects. The findings can help urban planners to understand GCI formation and design cool green spaces to mitigate UHI effects.

TI  - Ecological and environmental effects of land use change in rapid urbanization: The case of hangzhou, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes sharply under rapid urbanization, yet its ecological and environmental effects are often neglected in land use decisions. Using the case of Hangzhou, China, we analyze the ecological and environmental effects of land use changes, including ecosystem services value (ESV) and carbon emissions, based on Landsat TM images from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014. We found significant ecological and environmental effects of land use changes under rapid urbanization. The value of ecosystem services in Hangzhou decreased from 546.7 million USD in 1995 to 448.97 million USD in 2014, and the ratio of ESV to GDP decreased from 5.8% to 0.6%. The net carbon emissions associated with land use changes increased from 4.26 million tons in 1995 to 15.10 million tons in 2014, mainly due to the increase of built-up land carbon emissions and the decrease of forest land carbon sink. The ESV is unevenly distributed spatially and low ESV spread from the central to the peripheral area. We use scenario analysis to illustrate that economic growth and environmental protection could be coordinated by bringing ecological and environmental effects into land use decisions.

TI  - Research on axial bearing capacity of rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular columns based on artificial neural networks
T2  - FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Design of rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFT) columns has been a big concern owing to their complex constraint mechanism. Generally, most existing methods are based on simplified mechanical model with limited experimental data, which is not reliable under many conditions, e.g., columns using high strength materials. Artificial neural network (ANN) models have shown the effectiveness to solve complex problems in many areas of civil engineering in recent years. In this paper, ANN models were employed to predict the axial bearing capacity of rectangular CFT columns based on the experimental data. 305 experimental data from articles were collected, and 275 experimental samples were chosen to train the ANN models while 30 experimental samples were used for testing. Based on the comparison among different models, artificial neural network model1 (ANN1) and artificial neural network model2 (ANN2) with a 20-neuron hidden layer were chosen as the fit prediction models. ANN1 has five inputs: the length (D) and width (B) of cross section, the thickness of steel (t), the yield strength of steel (f (y)), the cylinder strength of concrete (f'(c)). ANN2 has ten inputs: D, B, t, f (y), f'(c), the length to width ratio (D/B), the length to thickness ratio (D/t), the width to thickness ratio (B/t), restraint coefficient (xi), the steel ratio (alpha). The axial bearing capacity is the output data for both models.The outputs from ANN1 and ANN2 were verified and compared with those from EC4, ACI, GJB4142 and AISC360-10. The results show that the implemented models have good prediction and generalization capacity. Parametric study was conducted using ANN1 and ANN2 which indicates that effect law of basic parameters of columns on the axial bearing capacity of rectangular CFT columns differs from design codes.The results also provide convincing design reference to rectangular CFT columns.

TI  - Assimilation of Typhoon Wind Field Retrieved from Scatterometer and SAR Based on the Huber Norm Quality Control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of sea surface wind field are critical for typhoon prediction. The scatterometer observation is one of the most important sources of sea surface winds, which provides both wind speed and wind direction information. However, the spatial resolution of scatterometer wind is low. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can provide a more detailed wind structure of the tropical cyclone. In addition, the cross-polarization observation of SAR can provide more detailed information of high speed wind (>25 m.s(-1)) than the scatterometer. Nevertheless, due to the narrow swath of SAR, the number of retrieved sea surface wind data used in the data assimilation is limited, and another limitation of SAR wind observation is that it does not provide true wind direction information. In this paper, the joint assimilation of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind and Sentinel-1 SAR wind was investigated. Another limitation in the current operational typhoon prediction is the inefficient quality control (QC) method used in the data assimilation since a large number of high speed wind observations was rejected by the traditional Gaussian distribution QC. We introduce the Huber norm distribution quality control (QC) into the data assimilation successfully. A numerical simulation experiment of typhoon by Lionrock (2016) is conducted to test the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the new quality control scheme not only greatly increases the availability of wind data in the area of the typhoon center, but also improves the typhoon track prediction, as well as the intensity prediction. The joint assimilation of scatterometer and SAR winds does have a positive impact on the typhoon prediction.

TI  - MODIS observations of cyanobacterial risks in a eutrophic lake: Implications for long-term safety evaluation in drinking-water source
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence and related risks from cyanobacterial blooms have increased world-wide over the past 40 years. Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stand-volume estimation from multi-source data for coppiced and high forest <i>Eucalyptus</i> spp. silvicultural systems in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stand volume is one of the crucial stand parameters, which influences the ability of these forests to provide ecosystem goods and services. This study thus aimed at examining the potential of integrating multispectral SPOT 5 image, with ancillary data (forest age and rainfall metrics) in estimating stand volume between coppiced and planted Eucalyptus spp. in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. To achieve this objective, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithm was used. The PLSR algorithm was implemented by applying three tier analysis stages: stage I: using ancillary data as an independent dataset, stage II: SPOTS spectral bands as an independent dataset and stage III: combined SPOTS spectral bands and ancillary data. The results of the study showed that the use of an independent ancillary dataset better explained the volume of Eucalyptus spp. growing from coppices (adjusted R2 (R-Adj(2)) = 0.54, RMSEP = 44.08 m(3)/ha), when compared with those that were planted (R-Adj(2) = 0.43, RMSEP = 53.29 m(3)/ha). Similar results were also observed when SPOT 5 spectral bands were applied as an independent dataset, whereas improved volume estimates were produced when using combined dataset. For instance, planted Eucalyptus spp. were better predicted adjusted R2 (R-Adj(2)) = 0.77, adjusted R-Adj(2) = 0.59, RMSEP = 36.02 rn(3)/ha) when compared with those that grow from coppices (R-2 = 0.76, R-Adj(2) = 0.46, RMSEP = 40.63 m(3)/ha). Overall, the findings of this study demonstrated the relevance of multi-source data in ecosystems modelling. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Mapping the Dabus Wetlands, Ethiopia, Using Random Forest Classification of Landsat, PALSAR and Topographic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dabus Wetland complex in the highlands of Ethiopia is within the headwaters of the Nile Basin and is home to significant ecological communities and rare or endangered species. Its many interrelated wetland types undergo seasonal and longer-term changes due to weather and climate variations as well as anthropogenic land use such as grazing and burning. Mapping and monitoring of these wetlands has not been previously undertaken due primarily to their relative isolation and lack of resources. This study investigated the potential of remote sensing based classification for mapping the primary vegetation groups in the Dabus Wetlands using a combination of dry and wet season data, including optical (Landsat spectral bands and derived vegetation and wetness indices), radar (ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter), and elevation (SRTM derived DEM and other terrain metrics) as inputs to the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) classifier. Eight wetland types and three terrestrial/upland classes were mapped using field samples of observed plant community composition and structure groupings as reference information. Various tests to compare results using different RF input parameters and data types were conducted. A combination of multispectral optical, radar and topographic variables provided the best overall classification accuracy, 94.4% and 92.9% for the dry and wet season, respectively. Spectral and topographic data (radar data excluded) performed nearly as well, while accuracies using only radar and topographic data were 82-89%. Relatively homogeneous classes such as Papyrus Swamps, Forested Wetland, and Wet Meadow yielded the highest accuracies while spatially complex classes such as Emergent Marsh were more difficult to accurately classify. The methods and results presented in this paper can serve as a basis for development of long-term mapping and monitoring of these and other non-forested wetlands in Ethiopia and other similar environmental settings.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy and neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection in those patients with clinically node-negative axilla without compromising their oncologic outcomes. Indication of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been extended to patients to evaluate the pathologic response and to offer more conservative breast surgery. Sentinel lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible and accurate in patients with clinically node-negative patients. The timing of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, before or after medical treatment has been studied with benefits for each procedure. Sentinel lymph node dissection has been explored in different randomized prospective studies in clinically positive axilla with the aim of reduce axillary lymph node dissection. However, several studies are necessary to more accurately identify residual axillary disease and the sentinel lymph node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to adjust the adjuvant radiotherapy protocols and to evaluate the impact on oncologic outcomes.

TI  - Surveillance imaging following definitive radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: What is the clinical impact?
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recurrence rates at all stages are high, but evidence-based post-treatment surveillance imaging strategies to detect recurrence are poorly defined, and salvage options are frequently limited. A number of national and international oncology guidelines address post-treatment imaging, but are largely based on low-level, retrospective evidence because of a paucity of high-quality data, particularly in regard to cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life endpoints. Given the lack of randomized data addressing appropriate surveillance imaging modality and interval following definitive treatment of lung cancer, there remains an unmet clinical need. Meaningful surveillance endpoints should include the financial impact, patient quality-of-life outcomes, and access-to-care issues associated with intensive follow-up to ensure that guidelines reflect quality and sustainability. A need for prospective randomized data on the subject of imaging surveillance after definitive local therapy remains an unmet need, and an opportunity for collaboration and further research.

TI  - An integral lens on Patrick Geddes
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Patrick Geddes is a significant figure in the landscape and urban planning canon. In addition to situating cities within a regional context and advancing a socioecological understanding of urbanization, he viewed cities as the principal artifact of, and theater wherein, human culture evolves. This expansive view of cities may be one of the more challenging aspects of Geddes' legacy to assimilate. Working during a late 19th and early 20th century period when the limitations of modernity were becoming increasingly apparent, much of Geddes' aspirational thinking can be seen as an effort to create what he described as a "larger modernism." In this regard, Geddes can be counted amongst those whom we portray as integrative holistic thinkers, people whose worldview draws them toward meaning-making narratives and frameworks that include the many dimensions of the human condition. Today, a new generation of holistic approaches called "metatheories" - and "integral theory" in particular - provides an orienting lens through which to review, assess, and potentially extend the work of Geddes in the 21st century. Towards that goal, this article first provides an introductory primer to some of Geddes' noteworthy "thinking machines" as well as integral theory. We then assess correspondence between the two, focusing on Interdisciplinary Holism; Evolution, Development and Complex Systems; Human Agency and Ethics; and Spirituality. A closing discussion addresses prospects for future research, and suggests that the holistic, evolutionary, and generative orientation of our principal subjects may have particular relevance in an anthropogenic biosphere characterized, in part, by significant environmental challenges and the concentration of humans in cities.

AB  - Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) are employed in investigation of the environmental criteria for assessing the study area sustainability for hosting a landfill. The designated area is in the municipality of Thermi between the villages Trilofos, Agia Paraskevi, and Tagarades, prefecture of Thessaloniki in North Greece. In Greece, the overall waste management situation at the current time can be fairly characterized as underestimated, as the main constraints being from technical and financial nature. Ten environmental criteria, five factors, and five constraints were applied. 26 GIS map layers were produced using topographic, geological, and CORINE 2006 land cover maps as well as Landsat OLI-8 satellite images. The factors were considered in the weighted overlay analysis tool; then the weights were assigned under GIS environments. Moreover, the constraints were merged in one Boolean layer. Compiling both the factors map and the constraint map resulted in a map of suitable areas classified into three classes according to the suitability-least suitable, suitable, and most suitable. The suitable and most suitable areas represent 414.38 ha or 4.65% of the total study area of 8,895 ha with latitude 40 degrees 27'44.78 '' N and longitude 23 degrees 2'30.20 '' E. This study can be further used for assessing the sustainability cost for optimizing the landfill site by applying social and economic criteria.

TI  - Toward achieving a sustainable management: characterization of land use/land cover in Sokoto Rima floodplain, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is the main driving force of global environmental change and is considered as very central to the ongoing debate on sustainable development. Even though large volume of literature materials is available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin of Nigeria despite the basin's strategic importance. Thus, this study characterized the basin's LU/LC and its change using computer-based digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin's uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity with serious implication for livelihood and food security. The study recommends that interventions are needed to promote enhanced and sustainable management of land, water and vegetation resources in the basin, with particular emphasis on empowering the local land users to participate actively toward sustainable management of the floodplain.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the vegetation response to drought over the Sudano-Sahelian part of Nigeria. Landsat and monthly rainfall data with boundary map shapefile data. The results of SPI analysis revealed that the drought saga of the 70s and 80s was also experienced over the study area but later reversed in the 90s towards the 21st century as the result show a rapid decline in its occurrence which indicates improvement in rainfall. On the other hand, the vegetation response analysis also depicted that the year 1986 was a dry year over the study area as the spatial extent cover by the vegetation was much less compared to the bare-surface. But in the 1990s, greenness has returned to the areas that were previously bare soil, an indication of improvement in rainfall amount over the area. The study therefore concluded that there exists a kind of inverse relationship between drought intensity and vegetation growth and time lag in their response to dry or wet condition. (C) JASEM

AB  - A 31-genetic expression profile (31-GEP) test (DecisionDx-Melanoma, Castle Biosciences Inc, Friendswood, TX, USA) was developed as a diagnostic test to assist physicians in the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Based on a patient's primary tumor expression levels of a panel of genes (28 discriminating genes and 3 control genes), a lesion is classified as "low risk" (class 1) or "high risk" (class 2) for metastasis. Studies evaluating the clinical utility and impact of the 31-GEP test showed it positively influenced clinical management and patient care, as clinicians incorporated the additional data to modify their clinical recommendations in a risk-appropriate manner.

TI  - The investigation of spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature based, on land use changes using NDVI in southwest of Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes can bring about changes in land surface temperature (LST) which is influenced by climatic conditions and physical characteristics of the land surface. In this study, spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature have been investigated in the desert area of Dasht-e-Abbas, Ilam, based on a variety of land use changes. The investigated periods for the study include 1990, 2000 and 2010 using Landsat image data. First, in mapping land use we used the Fuzzy ARTMAP Neural Network Classification method followed by determination of the NDVI Index to estimate land surface temperature. The results show an increase in LST in areas where degradation, land use and land cover changes have occurred. In 1990, 2000 and 2010, the average land surface temperature of the Fair Rangelands was 26.72 degrees C, 30.06 degrees C and 30.95 degrees C, respectively. This rangeland has been reduced by about 5%. For poor rangelands, the average LSTs were 26.95, 32.83 and 34.49 degrees C, respectively which had a 18% reduction. In 1990, 2000 and 2010, the average land surface temperatures of agricultural lands were 24.31 degrees C, 27.87 degrees C and 28.61 degrees C, respectively which has been an increasing trend. The reason can be attributed to changes in cropping patterns of the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - InSAR Time-Series Estimation of the Ionospheric Phase Delay: An Extension of the Split Range-Spectrum Technique
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations may be significantly impacted by the propagation delay of the microwave signal through the ionosphere, which is commonly referred to as ionospheric delay. The dispersive character of the ionosphere at microwave frequencies allows one to estimate the ionospheric delay from InSAR data through a split range-spectrum technique. Here, we extend the existing split range-spectrum technique to InSAR time-series. We present an algorithm for estimating a time-series of ionospheric phase delay that is useful for correcting InSAR time-series of ground surface displacement or for evaluating the spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC). Experimental results from stacks of L-band SAR data acquired by the ALOS-1 Japanese satellite show significant ionospheric phase delay equivalent to 2 m of the temporal variation of InSAR time-series along 445 km in Chile, a region at low latitudes where large TEC variations are common. The observed delay is significantly smaller, with a maximum of 10 cm over 160 km, in California. The estimation and correction of ionospheric delay reduces the temporal variation of the InSAR time-series to centimeter levels in Chile. The ionospheric delay correction of the InSAR time-series reveals earthquake-induced ground displacement, which otherwise could not be detected. A comparison with independent GPS time-series demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in the root mean square difference between GPS and InSAR after correcting for ionospheric delay. The results show that the presented algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of InSAR time-series and should become a routine component of InSAR time-series analysis.

TI  - Testing of the 4SM Method in the Gulf of California Suggests Field Data Are not Needed to Derive Satellite Bathymetry
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry methods over coastal areas were developed to deliver basic and useful bathymetry information. However, the process is not straightforward, the main limitation being the need for field data. The Self-calibrated Spectral Supervised Shallow-water Modeler (4SM) method was tested to obtain coastal bathymetry without the use of any field data. Using Landsat-8 multispectral images from 2013 to 2016, a bathymetric time series was produced. Groundtruthed depths and an alternative method, Stumpf's Band Ratio Algorithm, were used to verify the results. Retrieved (4SM) vs groundtruthed depths scored an average r(2) (0.90), and a low error (RMSE = 1.47 m). 4SM also showed, over the whole time series, the same average accuracy of the control method (40%). Advantages, limitations and operability under complex atmosphere and water column conditions, and high and low-albedo bottom processing capabilities of 4SM are discussed. In conclusion, the findings suggest that 4SM is as accurate as the commonly used Stumpf's method, the only difference being the independence of 4SM from previous field data, and the potential to deliver bottom spectral characteristics for further modeling. 4SM thus represents a significant advance in coastal remote sensing potential to obtain bathymetry and optical properties of the marine bottom.

TI  - Assessment of molecular and genetic evolution, antigenicity and virulence properties during the persistence of the infectious bronchitis virus in broiler breeders
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly contagious disease [infectious bronchitis (IB)] that results in substantial economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. We conducted a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene of Brazilian (BR) IBV isolates from a routinely vaccinated commercial flock of broiler breeders, obtained from clinical IB episodes that occurred in 24-, 46-and 62-week-old chickens. We also characterized the antigenicity, pathogenesis, tissue tropism and spreading of three IBV isolates by experimental infection of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and contact sentinel birds. The results reveal that the three IBV isolates mainly exhibited mutations in the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the S1 gene and protein, but were phylogenetically and serologically closely related, belonging to lineage 11 of the GI genotype, the former BR genotype I. All three isolates caused persistent infection in broiler breeders reared in the field, despite high systemic anti-IBV antibody titres, and exhibited tropism and pathogenicity for the trachea and kidney after experimental infection in SPF chickens and contact birds. In conclusion, BR genotype I isolates of IBV evolve continuously during the productive cycle of persistently infected broiler breeders, causing outbreaks that are not impaired by the current vaccination programme with Massachusetts vaccine strains. In addition, the genetic alterations in the S1 gene of these isolates were not able to change their tissue tropism and pathogenicity, but did seem to negatively influence the effectiveness of the host immune responses against these viruses, and favour viral persistence.

TI  - Predators do not spill over from forest fragments to maize fields in a landscape mosaic in central Argentina
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - South America is undergoing a rapid and large-scale conversion of natural habitats to cultivated land. Ecosystem services still remain important but their level and sustainability are not known. We quantified predation intensity in an Argentinian agricultural landscape containing remnants of the original chaco serrano forest using artificial sentinel prey. We sought to identify the main predators and the effect of landscape configuration and maize phenology on predation pressure by invertebrate and vertebrate predators in this landscape. The most common predators were chewing insects (50.4% predation events), birds (22.7%), and ants (17.5%). Overall predation rates in forest fragments (41.6% per day) were significantly higher than in the surrounding maize fields (21.5% per day). Invertebrate predation was higher inside and at the edge of forest fragments than within fields, and did not change with increasing distance from a fragment edge, indicating a lack of spillover from the native habitat remnants to the cultivated matrix at the local scale. Distance from a continuous forest had a positive impact on predation by invertebrates and a negative impact on vertebrate predation.

TI  - WorldClim 2: new 1-km spatial resolution climate surfaces for global land areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1km(2)). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970-2000, using data from between 9000 and 60000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5-15% (0.07-0.17 degrees C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.

TI  - Analysis of land degradation processes on a tiger bush plateau in South West Niger using MODIS and LANDSAT TM/ETM plus data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing digital image analysis has been applied to monitor land clearing and degradation processes on a plateau covered by tiger bush near Niamey in South West Niger, where signs of severe landscape degradation due to fuelwood supply have been observed in the last decades. A MODIS NDVI dataset (2000-2015) and five LANDSAT images (1986-2012) were used to identify spatial and temporal dynamics and to emphasize areas of greater degradation. The study indicates that the land clearing found by previous investigations in the second part of the 20th century is still ongoing, with a decreasing trend of MODIS NDVI values recorded in the period 2000-2015. This trend appeared to be linked to an increase in bare soil areas that was demonstrated by analysis of LANDSAT SAVI images. The investigation also indicated that rates of degradation are stronger in more deteriorated areas like those located nearer Niamey; degradation patterns also tend to increase from the inner areas to the edges of the plateau. These results attest to the urgency to develop effective environmental preservation policies and find alternative solutions for domestic energy supply.

TI  - Patterns of mortality in a montane mixed-conifer forest in San Diego County, California
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine spatial patterns of conifer tree mortality and their changes over time for the montane mixed-conifer forests of San Diego County. These forest areas have recently experienced extensive tree mortality due to multiple factors. A spatial contextual image processing approach was utilized with high spatial resolution digital airborne imagery to map dead trees for the years 1997, 2000, 2002, and 2005 for three study areas: Palomar, Volcan, and Laguna mountains. Plot-based fieldwork was conducted to further assess mortality patterns. Mean mortality remained static from 1997 to 2002 (4, 2.2, and 4.2 trees/ha for Palomar, Volcan, and Laguna) and then increased by 2005 to 10.3, 9.7, and 5.2 trees/ha, respectively. The increase in mortality between 2002 and 2005 represents the temporal pattern of a discrete disturbance event, attributable to the 2002-2003 drought. Dead trees are significantly clustered for all dates, based on spatial cluster analysis, indicating that they form distinct groups, as opposed to spatially random single dead trees. Other tests indicate no directional shift or spread of mortality over time, but rather an increase in density. While general temporal and spatial mortality processes are uniform across all study areas, the plot-based species and quantity distribution of mortality, and diameter distributions of dead vs. living trees, vary by study area. The results of this study improve our understanding of stand-to landscape-level forest structure and dynamics, particularly by examining them from the multiple perspectives of field and remotely sensed data.

TI  - Nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two recently sympatric apex predators
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - An influential period in avian life-cycles is the annual breeding season, when competition over suitable nesting sites and territories is a key factor that can determine fitness and distribution, especially for species that are highly selective in their nesting habitats. We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest- sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nestsite characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 +/- 0.11 and 2.96 +/- 0.11 pairs per 10 km(2), respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area.

TI  - Community integration of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities: A national longitudinal analysis
T2  - DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) 1915(c) waivers are the largest providers of long-term supports and services (LTSS) for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in the United States. National and longitudinal analyses of HCBS 1915(c) waivers for people with IDD are critical because of changes in the fiscal landscape, the variability produced by states ability to flexibly customize their programs, and the significant changes required by the HCBS final settings rule.Objective/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to determine spending allocations and state priorities for LTSS for people with IDD through Medicaid HCBS waivers over a five-year period (fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2015).Methods: Medicaid HCBS 1915(c) waivers for people with IDD from fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY 2015 were analyzed to determine total projected spending, unduplicated participants, and average spending per participant across fiscal years and states. Over 10,000 services from the five years were also analyzed to determine service priorities.Results: This longitudinal analysis of HCBS IDD waiver allocation revealed large fluctuation across five years in terms of total participants, total spending, and average spending per participant. Trends also revealed a shifting away from residential habilitation settings towards supports for living in one's own home.Conclusions: When revising waivers to meet the Final Settings Rule, states should utilize our findings to determine areas of need and how to best apply limited funding.

M3  - Article
AB  - Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) 1915(c) waivers are the largest source of funding for the long term services and supports of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). National-level analyses of HCBS IDD waivers are crucial because of the large variance across states, the recent CMS rule and regulation changes (CMS 2249-F/2296-F), and the ever changing economic and political landscape. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine state waiver priorities for people with IDD. In FY 2015, 111 waivers projected spending $25.6 billion for approximately 630,000 people with IDD. The services with the most funding were residential habilitation, supports to live in one's own home, and day habilitation. However, our analysis revealed large discrepancies across states and services.

TI  - Genetic parameters and correlations between days open and production traits across lactations in pasture based dairy production systems
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the additive genetic correlations, heritabilities and repeatabilities of days open (DO), milk (MY), fat (FY) and protein yields (PY), using data from pasture based dairy systems of Uruguay, and to explore whether DO should be interpreted as a different trait across lactations or as a trait with repeated measures. The database contained 500, 412 and 294 thousand records of first, second and third lactation, respectively. Cows were offspring of 7747 sires. Fertility records lower and upper limits were 42 and 250 days, respectively. In a first approach (Mdiff) we estimated variance components and covariances over lactations, assuming that the traits were different at each lactation. In a second approach (Mrep) estimations were carried out considering each trait as a repeated measure along lactations. In Mdiff, DO with a production trait was analyzed considering each lactation as a different trait. Three six-variate linear models were analyzed (DO-MY, DO-FY, DO-PY, and lactations first to third). In the Mrep procedure, DO, MY, FY and PY were analyzed together with a multiple trait repeatability model. For all models, the fixed effects were herd-year-season and lactation age classes. Animal and the permanent environment effect were included as random effects. The additive genetic correlations between DO and yield traits by Mdiff were between + 0.39 and + 0.78; by Mrep, they ranged from +0.44 to + 0.55. Heritabilities of DO by Mdiff were between 0.04 and 0.06 and 0.05 by Mrep. The additive genetic correlations of DO between lactations ranged from + 0.76 to + 0.91. Heritabilities of MY, FY and PY were 0.23, 0.21 and 0.21, respectively. Repeatabilities obtained were 0.10, 0.49, 0.47 and 0.49 for DO, MY, FY and PY, respectively. We concluded that the heritability of DO was low but enough to consider the trait in selection programs. We confirmed unfavorable additive genetic correlations between DO and yield traits for the Uruguayan pasture systems, which supports the importance of considering fertility in selection programs to reduce or avoid a decline in reproduction. The additive genetic correlations, DO between lactations were high, suggesting that a plausible model should consider DO records of a given animal as repeated measures.

TI  - Effect of observation scale on remote sensing based estimates of evapotranspiration in a semi-arid row cropped orchard environment
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding in detail the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) in row cropped fruit production areas with diverse water requirements is vital for monitoring water use and efficient irrigation scheduling. Spatially distributed ET for these environments can be estimated using remote sensing (RS). However, the computation of RS based ET under such conditions is complicated because of the complex parameterizations that are required to derive ET for the mixed pixels comprising of bare soil and well-watered plants typical of row cropped areas. Also, the parameterization of these processes is not scale invariant, owing to change in the percentage of vegetation cover in the mixed pixels across remote sensing observation scales. In this study, our main objectives were (1) to isolate and evaluate the effect of varying spatial scales (comparable to canopy sizes and larger) of the remote sensing data on ET estimates; and (2) provide an operational method for estimating remote sensing based ET for row cropped conditions. ET was computed using an empirical technique (S-SEBI: Simplified-Surface Energy Balance Index Algorithm) for almond and pistachio orchards from remote sensing imagery collected at a scale comparable to the canopy sizes of the trees (5.8 and 7.2 m) and a scale that was much larger than the canopy size (120 m) using the MASTER and Landsat sensors, respectively. In order to account for the effect of mixed pixels, a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index based correction factor was applied to the derived ET values and the results averaged for different fields were validated with Penman-Monteith based ET estimates. It was found that the corrected mean ET estimates at 120 m were in agreement with the Penman-Monteith based ET estimates (RMSEaverage = 0.12 mm/h), whereas they were underestimated at the finer resolutions. Our results indicated that a remote sensing pixel resolution comparable to the row spacing and smaller and comparable to the canopy size overestimated the land surface temperature and consequently, underestimated ET when using operational models that do not account for vegetation and soil temperature separately. The results of the application of the NDVI correction factor indicates that good spatial estimates of crop ET can be made for crops growing in orchards using simple ET models that require minimal data and freely available Landsat imagery. These findings are very encouraging for the regular monitoring of crop health and effective management of irrigation water in highly water stressed agricultural environments.

TI  - Mapping of <i>Shorea robusta</i> Forest Using Time Series MODIS Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest types in a natural heterogeneous forest environment using remote sensing data is a long-standing challenge due to similar spectral reflectance from different tree species and significant time and resources are required for acquiring and processing the remote sensing data. The purpose of this research was to determine the optimum number of remote sensing images and map the Sal forest through the analysis of Vegetation Index (VI) signatures. We analyzed the eight days' composite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for the whole year of 2015. Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance was used for the separability index. Performance of EVI and NDVI was tested using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Boruta algorithm and statistical analysis were performed to identify the optimum set of imageries. We also performed data level five-fold cross validation of the model and field level accuracy assessment of the classification map. The finding confirmed that EVI with SVM (F-score of Sal 0.88) performed better than NDVI with either SVM or RF. The optimum 12 images during growing and post monsoon season significantly decreased processing time (to one-fourth) without much deteriorating accuracy. Accordingly, we were able to map the Sal forest whose area is accounted for about 36% of the 82% forest cover in the study area. The proposed methodology can be extended to produce a temporal forest type classification map in any other location.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate three different strategies to improve classification accuracy in a highly fragmented semiarid area using, (i) different classification algorithms with parameter optimization in some cases; (ii) different feature sets including spectral, textural and terrain features; and (iii) different seasonal combinations of images. A three-way ANOVA was used to discern which of these approaches and their interactions significantly increases accuracy. Tukey-Kramer contrast using a heteroscedasticity-consistent estimation of the kappa covariances matrix was used to check for significant differences in accuracy. The experiment was carried out with Landsat TM, ETM and OLI images corresponding to the period 2000-2015. A combination of four images using random forest and the three feature sets was the best way to improve accuracy. Maximum likelihood, random forest and support vector machines do not significantly increase accuracy when textural information was added, but do so when terrain features were taken into account. On the other hand, sequential maximum a posteriori increased accuracy when textural features were used, but reduced accuracy substantially when terrain features were included. Random forest using the three feature subsets and sequential maximum a posteriori with spectral and textural features had the largest kappa values, around 0.9.

TI  - Intraseasonal patterns in coastal plankton biomass off central Chile derived from satellite observations and a biochemical model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subseasonal (5-130 days) environmental variability can strongly affect plankton dynamics, but is often overlooked in marine ecology studies. We documented the main subseasonal patterns of plankton biomass in the coastal upwelling system off central Chile, the southern part of the Humboldt System. Subseasonal variability was extracted from temporal patterns in satellite data of wind stress, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll from the period 2003-2011, and from a realistically forced eddy-resolving physical-biochemical model from 2003 to 2008. Although most of the wind variability occurs at submonthly frequencies (<30 days), we found that the dominant subseasonal pattern of phytoplankton biomass is within the intraseasonal band (3090 days). The strongest intraseasonal coupling between wind and plankton is in spring-summer, when increased solar radiation enhances the phytoplankton response to upwelling. Biochemical model outputs show intraseasonal shifts in plankton community structure, mainly associated with the large fluctuations in diatom biomass. Diatom biomass peaks near surface during strong upwelling, whereas small phytoplankton biomass peaks at subsurface depths during relaxation or downwelling periods. Strong intraseasonally forced changes in biomass and species composition could strongly impact trophodynamics connections in the ecosystem, including the recruitment of commercially important fish species such as common sardine and anchovy. The wind-driven variability of chlorophyll concentration was connected to mid- and high-latitude atmospheric anomalies, which resemble disturbances with frequencies similar to the tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series land cover maps play a key role in monitoring the dynamic change of land use. To obtain classification maps with better spatial-temporal consistency and classification accuracy, this study used an algorithm that incorporated information from spatial and temporal neighboring observations in a hidden Markov model (HMM) to improve the time series land cover maps initially produced by a support vector machine (SVM). To investigate the effects of different initial distributions and transition probability matrices on the classification of the HMM, we designed different experimental schemes with different input elements to verify this algorithm with Landsat and HJ satellite images. In addition, we introduced spatial weights into the HMM to make effective use of spatial information. The experimental results showed that the HMM considered that spatial weights could eliminate the vast majority of illogical land cover transition that may occur in previous pixel-wise classification, and that this model had obvious advantages in spatial-temporal consistency and classification accuracy over some existing classification models.

AB  - Introduction: Lymphadenectomy is recommended during surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma when there is evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis (therapeutic) or in high -risk patients (prophylactic) such as those with T3 and T4 tumors of the TNM classification. Selective sentinel lymph node biopsy may improve preoperative diagnosis of nodal metastases.Objective: To analyze the results of selective sentinel lymph node biopsy in a group of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma and no evidence of nodal involvement before surgery. Patients and method: A retrospective, single -center study in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma and no clinical evidence of lymph node involvement who underwent surgery between 2011 and 2013. The sentinel node was identified by scintigraphy. When the sentinel node was positive, the affected compartment was removed, and when sentinel node was negative, central lymph node dissection was performed.Results: Forty-three patients, 34 females, with a mean age of 52.3 (17) years, were enrolled. Forty-six (27%) of the 170 SNs resected from 24 (55.8%) patients were positive for metastasis. In addition, 94 (15.6%) out of the 612 lymph nodes removed in the lymphadenectomies were positive for metastases. Twelve of the 30 (40%) low risk patients (cT1NO and cT2NO) changed their stage to pN1, whereas 12 of 13 (92%) high risk patients (cT3NO and cT4NO) changed to pN1 stage.Conclusions: Selective sentinel lymph node biopsy changes the stage of more than 50% of patients from cNO to pN1. This confirms the need for lymph node resection in T3 and T4 tumors, but reveals the presence of lymph node metastases in 40% of T1 -T2 tumors. 2017 SEEN. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Using Landsat images to monitor changes in the snow-covered area of selected glaciers in northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellite images were used to map and monitor the snow-covered areas of four glaciers with different aspects (Passu: 36.473 degrees N, 74.766 degrees E; Momhil: 36.394 degrees N, 75.085 degrees E; Trivor: 36.249 degrees N, 74.968 degrees E; and Kunyang: 36.083 degrees N, 75.288 degrees E) in the upper Indus basin, northern Pakistan, from 1990-2014. The snow-covered areas of the selected glaciers were identified and classified using supervised and rule-based image analysis techniques in three different seasons. Accuracy assessment of the classified images indicated that the supervised classification technique performed slightly better than the rule-based technique. Snow-covered areas on the selected glaciers were generally reduced during the study period but at different rates. Glaciers reached maximum areal snow coverage in winter and pre-monsoon seasons and minimum areal snow coverage in monsoon seasons, with the lowest snow-covered area occurring in August and September. The snow-covered area on Passu glacier decreased by 24.50%, 3.15% and 11.25% in the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Similarly, the other three glaciers showed notable decreases in snow-covered area during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons; however, no clear changes were observed during monsoon seasons. During pre-monsoon seasons, the eastward-facing glacier lost comparatively more snow-covered area than the westward-facing glacier. The average seasonal glacier surface temperature calculated from the Landsat thermal band showed negative correlations of -0.67, 0.89, -0.75 and -0.77 with the average seasonal snow-covered areas of the Passu, Momhil, Trivor and Kunyang glaciers, respectively, during pre-monsoon seasons. Similarly, the air temperature collected from a nearby meteorological station showed an increasing trend, indicating that the snow-covered area reduction in the region was largely due to climate warming.

TI  - Lip reconstruction using a functioning serratus anterior free flap: preliminary study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructive surgery to the lips requires the replacement of defective tissues with similarly functioning tissues. While non-dynamic free tissue transfers provide adequate lower lip reconstruction, improved benefits may be obtained with innervated free muscle flaps. This study reports the use of innervated serratus anterior muscle free flaps for lip reconstruction in five patients. All patients had squamous cell carcinoma of either the upper or lower lip. After resection of the tumours, the resultant defects comprised two-thirds of the lips. The innervated serratus anterior muscle free flap was transferred to the lip and an end-to-end vascular anastomosis on the facial artery was performed. The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve was preferred for nerve coaptation. The inner and outer surfaces of the flaps were grafted with a split-thickness skin graft. Concentric needle electromyography of the orbicularis oris and frontal muscles was performed for all patients in the preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up periods. All patients survived the surgical operation. Three patients achieved perfect oral sphincter function without drooling. Electromyography at 1 year postoperative demonstrated the successful reinnervation of the serratus anterior muscle. This study demonstrates that lip reconstruction using an innervated serratus anterior muscle free flap is a reliable method, providing a functional lower lip.

TI  - Can internet search queries be used for dengue fever surveillance in China?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - China experienced an unprecedented outbreak of dengue fever in 2014, and the number of cases reached the highest level over the past 25 years. Traditional sentinel surveillance systems of dengue fever in China have an obvious drawback that the average delay from receipt to dissemination of dengue case data is roughly 1-2 weeks. In order to exploit internet search queries to timely monitor dengue fever, we analyzed data of dengue incidence and Baidu search query from 31 provinces in mainland China during the period of January 2011 to December 2014. We found that there was a strong correlation between changes in people's online health-seeking behavior and dengue fever incidence. Our study represents the first attempt demonstrating a strong temporal and spatial correlation between internet search trends and dengue epidemics nationwide in China. The findings will help the government to strengthen the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for dengue fever. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Analysis of soybean cropland expansion in the southern Brazilian Amazon and its relation to economic drivers
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural dynamics of soybean expansion have long been recognized as a major driver of excessive land cover change on the southwestern border of the Brazilian Amazon. The hypothesis that the soybean market exerts an influence on land use was investigated by the association between economic indicators and soybean crop dynamics in the state of Mato Grosso (western Brazil). We integrated a historical series of satellite data of soybean cropland expansion and the two main economic variables (selling prices and production costs) for soybean in Mato Grosso. We focused on the relation between profit (the difference between the average soybean price and production costs) and land-use transition to soybean from 2001 to 2013. The spatially explicit analysis showed that the overall accuracy between the resulting first-time use and the most recent soybean crop area in 2013 was 96.75%, with a Kappa index of 0.63. However, dissimilar values found between Omission and Commission indicators suggest that most of the expanded areas prior to 2013 (5.57 million ha) were under a high dynamical range of land uses. Although there is no direct relation between either the deforestation rate or expansion trends (first-time-use rate) and profit, the results strongly suggest (R-2= 0.81) that profit exerts a direct and non-negligible influence on the evolution of consolidated land use for soybean in Mato Grosso State.

TI  - Factors Influencing Non-sentinel Node Metastasis in Patients with Macrometastatic Sentinel Lymph Node Involvement and Validation of Three Commonly Used Nomograms.
T2  - European journal of breast health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in a subgroup of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is becoming a widely accepted practice. Avoiding the well-known complications of ALND is the sole aim without compromising the curative intention of surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data were probed for breast cancer patients that were operated on between February 2014 and June 2016. SLN biopsies were performed in 507 patients and out of 157 patients who underwent ALND for a metastatic SLN, 151 were found eligible for the analyses as having macrometastatic (>2mm) SLN. MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Helsinki nomograms were also tested in our patient population.RESULTS: Pathologic tumor size greater than 2 cm, the ratio of metastatic SLN to dissected SLN, metastatic tumor greater than 1 cm and tumors that extended outside the SLN's capsule were found to be associated with non-sentinel node metastasis in both univariate and multivariate tests. MD Anderson nomogram performed well with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.72.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALND should be considered in patients with macrometastatic SLN greater than 10 mm in size, have extracapsular extension, have metastatic SLNs at a rate of more than 50% and whose primary tumor is greater than 2 cm.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of breast ultrasonography and MRI in the prediction of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - ACTA RADIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is widely used to treat breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection in patients who convert to node-negative status after NAC. However, few studies have evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining axillary lymph node status after NAC.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of breast ultrasonography and MRI in determining residual metastatic axillary lymph node status after NAC for breast cancer and to identify histopathological factors affecting radiological performance.Material and Methods: This study included 157 patients who underwent initial and follow-up preoperative breast ultrasonography and MRI before NAC between January and December 2010. The sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and accuracy of ultrasonography, MRI, and their combinations were evaluated.Results: The sensitivity of ultrasonography, MRI, and their combination in post-NAC axillary imaging was 60.00%, 57.33%, and 65.33%, respectively; the specificity was 60.47%, 72.09%, and 60.47%, respectively. The positive predictive value was highest with MRI (78.18%). On univariate analysis, positive estrogen receptor status was associated with misdiagnosis by ultrasonography (P = 0.002), MRI (P = 0.002), and their combination (P = 0.001). When residual metastatic lymph nodes were present, lymph nodes with macrometastasis (> 2.0 mm) were associated with correct ultrasonography-based diagnosis (P = 0.0027).Conclusion: Imaging assists in predicting axillary lymph node status in patients undergoing NAC; however, is imprudent to omit sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection for staging in women determined to be nodepositive.

TI  - Lossy compression of satellite images with low impact on vegetation features
T2  - MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel technique for lossy compression of satellite images aiming at decreasing the impact on vegetation features is presented in this paper. First, the satellite image bands are divided into two groups; the first group contains the most significant bands for vegetation feature extraction (i.e., vegetation group), and the other contains the rest of the spectral bands. After that, a new band ordering algorithm is applied that improves compression performance. The proposed compression technique is based on a new rate control scheme in which the vegetation group is encoded at a higher bit rate than that for the remaining group. We have selected two of the most common indices to assess the impact of lossy compression on the vegetation features in the satellite images; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Normalized Difference Water Index. The study is performed on several satellite images, where multispectral images are selected from a Landsat ETM satellite, and hyperspectral images are selected from an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer satellite. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is more effective than other traditional compression techniques.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relationship between precipitation sum and cloud properties over Fars province in Iran was analyzed for the cases of light (4 mm), moderate (17 mm), and heavy (62 mm) precipitation. The cloud properties (temperature and pressure at the top, cloud optical thickness and cloud water path) were obtained from satellite data of spectoradiometer MODIS (MODO6). The spatial distribution of rainfall was obtained from the 3-hourly data of TRMM (3B42). The multivariate regression model was developed to predict the spatial distribution of rainfall. A strong significant positive association between the spatial distribution of cloud characteristics and heavy precipitation was found, while no clear correlation was revealed between light precipitation and cloud properties. The developed regression model comprised 64, 47, and 24% of spatial variance of heavy, moderate, and light rainfall, respectively. The influence of cloud water path on the spatial distribution of rainfall dominates.

TI  - Interactions among symbionts operate across scales to influence parasite epidemics
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasite epidemics may be influenced by interactions among symbionts, which can depend on past events at multiple spatial scales. Within host individuals, interactions can depend on the sequence in which symbionts infect a host, generating priority effects. Across host individuals, interactions can depend on parasite phenology. To test the roles of parasite interactions and phenology in epidemics, we embedded multiple cohorts of sentinel plants, grown from seeds with and without a vertically transmitted symbiont, into a wild host population, and tracked foliar infections caused by three common fungal parasites. Within hosts, parasite growth was influenced by coinfections, but coinfections were often prevented by priority effects among symbionts. Across hosts, parasite phenology altered host susceptibility to secondary infections, symbiont interactions and ultimately the magnitude of parasite epidemics. Together, these results indicate that parasite phenology can influence parasite epidemics by altering the sequence of infection and interactions among symbionts within host individuals.

TI  - Yield of head computed tomography in patients with new onset of transient headaches
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHeadache is a common patient complaint. The threshold for brain imaging in headache is debated, especially when the headache is transient, although even if the headache has resolved at presentation, a sentinel bleed heralding a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) often remains a concern.AimTo assess the yield of computed tomography (CT) head scan referrals for patients with transient headache symptoms.MethodsThis study looked at 6 months of CT results in order to assess for brain pathology, with a particular focus on subarachnoid haemorrhage. Where any pathology was identified, detailed chart review looked for potential high-risk indicators.ResultsBetween January and July 2015, 531 undifferentiated headache patients were referred for head CT. Of these, 177 (33.3%) presented with a transient or episodic pattern. None of these cases had SAH on imaging nor re-presented with SAH within 3 months of initial CT. However, 7.3% (13/177) had other significant intracranial pathologies. The only significant risk factor for CT abnormality in this setting was focal neurology on presentation (odds ratio 3.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.0); P=0.044). All identified cases of SAH over the 6-month study period occurred in patients with persistent headache, and their clinical presentations showed a similar cluster of symptoms to previous literature (including thunderclap headache, vomiting and loss of consciousness).ConclusionThis study suggests that patients with transient headache are at a low risk of SAH; however, further study is needed to quantify this, and other serious pathologies remains a concern, especially in the setting of focal neurology at presentation.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection using a novel fuzzy c-means clustering simultaneously incorporating local and global information
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering simultaneously incorporating local and global information (FLGICM) method to unsupervised change detection (CD) from remotely sensed images. A new factor including three local, global and edge parameters is added into the conventional FCM to enhance the insensitivity to noise and preserve detailed features. The spatial attraction between the central pixel and its neighborhood pixels is incorporated as a local parameter to utilize spatial information. A global parameter designed based on the estimated mean values of changed and unchanged pixels is introduced into the new factor to enhance its robustness and ability of separating changed from unchanged pixels. In addition, an edge parameter is also added to remain accurate edges and change details. Two experiments were carried out on Landsat images to test the performance of FLGICM. Experimental results indicate that FLGICM always achieves high accuracy and overperforms some state-of-the-art CD methods. Therefore, the proposed FLGIC provides an effective unsupervised CD method.

TI  - Positive Ultrasound-guided Lymph Node Needle Biopsy in Breast Cancer may not Mandate Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The ACOSOG Z0011 (Z11) trial demonstrated that in patients with nonpalpable axillary lymph nodes (LN) and one to two positive sentinel LN (SLN), axillary LN dissection (ALND) is unnecessary.JAMA 305:569-575, [(2011)], Ann Surg 264:413-42, [(2016)] The Z11 trial did not require preoperative axillary ultrasound (axUS). In many centers, preoperative axUS is part of the standard workup of a newly diagnosed breast cancer patient, but in light of the Z11 results, its role is now questioned.Methods. We retrospectively analyzed newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at two institutions. Inclusion criteria were patients with (1) no palpable lymphadenopathy, (2) abnormal axUS, (3) axillary LN metastasis confirmed preoperatively by axUS-lymph node needle biopsy, (4) no neoadjuvant therapy, and (5) ALND. LN disease burden was dichotomized as N1 versus N2-3. We examined relationships between clinicopathologic factors, including axUS characteristics, and LN disease burden.Results. Of 129 included cases, 67 had N1 disease (51.9%) and 62 had N2-3 disease (48.1%). Factors significantly associated with N1 disease were tumor size <= 2 cm (p = 0.012), nonlobular histology (p = 0.013), and one suspicious LN on axUS (p = 0.008). For patients with both tumor size on imaging <= 2 cm and one abnormal LN on axUS, only 27% had N2-3 disease (p = 0.007).Conclusions. More than half of patients without palpable adenopathy but with preoperative US-guided biopsy proven axillary LN metastases had N1 disease. For patients with both tumor size <= 2 cm and only 1 abnormal LN on axUS, 73% had N1 disease. This suggests that such patients, if they are otherwise analogous to Z11 patients, may undergo attempt at SLNB.

TI  - Summer and winter drought drive the initiation and spread of spruce beetle outbreak
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Landsat-based detection of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak over the years 2000-2014 across the Southern Rocky Mountain Ecoregion to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of outbreak and assess the influence of temperature, drought, forest characteristics, and previous spruce beetle activity on outbreak development. During the 1999-2013 period, time series of spruce beetle activity were highly spatially correlated (r > 0.5) at distances <5 km, but remained weakly correlated (r = 0.08) at distances >400 km. Furthermore, cluster analysis on time series of outbreak activity revealed the outbreak developed at multiple incipient locations and spread to unaffected forest, highlighting the importance of both local-scale dispersal and regional-scale drivers in synchronizing spruce beetle outbreak. Spatial overlay analysis and Random Forest modeling of outbreak development show that outbreaks initiate in areas characterized by summer, winter, and multi-year drought and that outbreak spread is strongly linked to the proximity and extent of nearby outbreak, but remains associated with drought. Notably, we find that spruce beetle outbreak is associated with low peak snow water equivalent, not just summer drought. As such, future alterations to both winter and summer precipitation regimes are likely to drive important changes in subalpine forests.

TI  - Geological mapping and spectral based classification of basement rocks using remote sensing data analysis: The Korbiai-Gerf nappe complex, South Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pan-African Neoproterozoic Korbiai-Gerf nappe complex in the extreme South Eastern Desert of Egypt comprises dismembered ophiolite assemblages tectonically thrusted over pelite-psammopelite, quartzo-feldspathic gneiss and island-arc schistose metavolcanics. The whole sequence is intruded by syn-late to post tectonic mafic and felsic intrusions.The enhanced Landsat-8 band ratio (bands 6/2, 6/7 and 6/5 x 4/5) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Principal Component (PC2, PC6, and PC5) successfully discriminated most of the exposed lithological units and produced a detailed geological map. Granitoids, psammopelite-pelite, gneiss and serpentinite-talc carbonate rocks have been discriminated using ASTER kaolinite, clay, sericite-muscovite and calcite-carbonate indices respectively.Three spectral based classification algorithms have been compared using Landsat-8 and the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) datasets to obtain the best litho logical classification for the exposed basement rock units. Results from the present study revealed that, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm provided the best lithological classification accuracy (97.72%) using the combination of 9 ASTER bands and 20 ASTER derivative images.The results of the present study concluded that, the integrated data of ASTER and Landsat-8 enhanced images are effective in the discrimination and classification of the basement rock units exposed at Korbiai-Gerf nappe complex and can be applied in similar areas in the Arabian-Nubian Shield.

TI  - Identifying sky conditions in Iran from MODIS Terra and Aqua cloud products
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds can influence climate through many complex interactions within the hydrological cycle. Due to the important effects of cloud cover on climate, it is essential to study its variability over certain geographical areas. This study provides a spatial and temporal distribution of sky conditions, cloudy, partly cloudy, and clear days, in Iran. Cloud fraction parameters were calculated based on the cloud product (collection 6_L2) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on board the Terra (MOD06) and Aqua (MYD06) satellites. The cloud products were collected daily from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2014 (12 years) with a spatial resolution of 5 km x 5 km. First, the cloud fraction data were converted into a regular geographic coordinate network over Iran. Then, the estimations from both sensors were analyzed. Results revealed that the maximum annual frequency of cloudy days occurs along the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, while the minimum annual frequency occurs in southeast Iran. On average, the annual number of cloudy and clear-sky days was 88 and 256 d from MODIS Terra, as compared to 96 and 244 d from MODIS Aqua. Generally, cloudy and partly cloudy days decrease from north to south, and MODIS Aqua overestimates the cloudy and partly cloudy days compared to MODIS Terra.

TI  - Mapping the change of coral reefs using remote sensing and in situ measurements: a case study in Pangkajene and Kepulauan Regency, Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - As elsewhere in Indonesia, local inhabitants in the Pangkajene and Kepulauan (PANGKEP) Regency, Spermonde Archipelago area and along the south-west coast of Sulawesi traditionally regard the coral reefs as their livelihood source. Since human activities as well as natural disturbances pose major threats to the coral reefs, these livelihoods may also be at risk. Currently, no comprehensive information on the status and condition of coral reefs in this area is available for this resource management. We determined the changes of coral reef habitat over a period of 20 years from 1994 to 2014 using a satellite Landsat multi-temporal image substantiated with in situ measurement data collected in 2014. The spectral value of coral reefs was extracted from multi-temporal Landsat imagery data, while the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water was obtained by using statistical analysis between the ratio of live coral cover and the spectral value of the visible bands. By using the unsupervised classification integrated with the data ground truth, it is stated that there has been a decline in live coral cover over a period of 20 years from 7716 ha in 1994 to 4236 ha in 2014, with a degradation rate of 174 ha/year. Based on the results, the ratio of the coral cover in the coral reef transects varied from the average of 24% for live corals to 96% for coral rubbles, implying the degraded status of coral reefs in the study area.

TI  - A statistical distribution texton feature for synthetic aperture radar image classification
T2  - FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel statistical distribution texton (s-texton) feature for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification. Motivated by the traditional texton feature, the framework of texture analysis, and the importance of statistical distribution in SAR images, the s-texton feature is developed based on the idea that parameter estimation of the statistical distribution can replace the filtering operation in the traditional texture analysis of SAR images. In the process of extracting the s-texton feature, several strategies are adopted, including pre-processing, spatial gridding, parameter estimation, texton clustering, and histogram statistics. Experimental results on TerraSAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed s-texton feature.

TI  - PolSAR Ship Detection Using Local Scattering Mechanism Difference Based on Regression Kernel
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, the local scattering mechanism difference based on regression kernel (LSMDRK) is developed as a discriminative feature for ship detection. The LSMDRK measures the scattering mechanism dissimilarity of a center pixel to its neighboring pixels. A ship detection scheme is proposed based on the LSMDRK. The detection scheme consists of two stages. In the feature extraction stage, polarimetric target decomposition is required to improve the discriminative ability of the descriptor. In the detection stage, a saliency detection strategy is utilized to construct the saliency map. Then, local maximum detection is employed. Finally, an adaptive threshold method is designed to achieve the final detection. The effectiveness of the detection scheme is validated by a RADARSAT-2 data set. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can acquire a better detection on weak targets and has much less false alarms than some classical detection methods.

TI  - Enterovirus genotypes among patients with severe acute respiratory illness, influenza-like illness, and asymptomatic individuals in South Africa, 2012-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enteroviruses can cause outbreaks of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and EV-A, -B, -C, and -D species have different pathogenic profiles and circulation patterns. We aimed to characterize and determine the prevalence of enterovirus genotypes among South African patients with respiratory illness and controls during June 2012 to July 2014. Syndromic SARI and influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance was performed at two sentinel sites. At each site nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were collected from SARI and ILI patients as well as controls. Specimens were tested for enterovirus by real-time PCR. Positive specimens were further genotyped by sequencing a region of the VP1 gene. The prevalence of enterovirus was 5.8% (87/1494), 3.4% (103/3079), and 3.4% (46/1367) among SARI, ILI, and controls, respectively (SARI/controls, P = 0.002 and ILI/control, P = 0.973). Among the 101/236 (42.8%) enterovirus-positive specimens that could be genotyped, we observed a high diversity of circulating enterovirus genotypes (a total of 33 genotypes) from all four human enterovirus species with high prevalence of Enterovirus-B (60.4%; 61/101) and Enterovirus-A (21.8%; 22/101) compared to Enterovirus-C (10.9%; 11/101) and Enterovirus-D (6.9%; 7/101) (P = 0.477). Of the enterovirus genotypes identified, Echovirus 30 (9.9%, 10/101), Coxsackie virus B5 (7.9%, 8/101) and Enterovirus-D68 (6.9%, 7/101) were most prevalent. There was no difference in disease severity (SARI or ILI compared to controls) between the different enterovirus species (P = 0.167). We observed a high number of enterovirus genotypes in patients with respiratory illness and in controls from South Africa with no disease association of EV species with disease severity.

TI  - Beyond trend analysis: How a modified breakpoint analysis enhances knowledge of agricultural production after Zimbabwe's fast track land reform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the discourse on land reform assessments, a significant lack of spatial and time-series data has been identified, especially with respect to Zimbabwe's "Fast-Track Land Reform Programme" (FTLRP). At the same time, interest persists among land use change scientists to evaluate causes of land use change and therefore to increase the explanatory power of remote sensing products. This study recognizes these demands and aims to provide input on both levels: Evaluating the potential of satellite remote sensing time-series to answer questions which evolved after intensive land redistribution efforts in Zimbabwe; and investigating how time-series analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be enhanced to provide information on land reform induced land use change. To achieve this, two time-series methods are applied to MODIS NDVI data: Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA) and Breakpoint Analysis for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST). In our first analysis, a link of agricultural productivity trends to different land tenure regimes shows that regional clustering of trends is more dominant than a relationship between tenure and trend with a slightly negative slope for all regimes. We demonstrate that dusters of strong negative and positive productivity trends are results of changing irrigation patterns. To locate emerging and fallow irrigation schemes in semi-arid Zimbabwe, a new multi-method approach is developed which allows to map changes from bimodal seasonal phenological patterns to unimodal and vice versa. With an enhanced breakpoint analysis through the combination of STA and BFAST, we are able to provide a technique that can be applied on large scale to map status and development of highly productive cropping systems, which are key for food production, national export and local employment. We therefore conclude that the combination of existing and accessible time-series analysis methods: is able to achieve both: overcoming demonstrated limitations of MODIS based trend analysis and enhancing knowledge of Zimbabwe's FTLRP.

TI  - The role of green roofs in climate change mitigation. A case study in Seville (Spain)
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intense anthropogenic urban activity generates a phenomenon known as heat island, which is related with high temperatures in cities, as compared against adjacent suburban and rural areas. Due to this effect, the comfort conditions of the citizens deteriorate. In the case of the city of Seville (Spain), several models of climate change forecast increases in the maximum temperatures ranging from 1.5 to 6 degrees C in summer. This article explores the role of green roofs as a supplement to the green spaces of the city, in order to buffer the negative effects of the increase of the maximum temperatures due to climate change. Images from the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Sentinel-2 satellites have been used in order to verify the inverse relationship between land surface temperature and the abundance of vegetation, expressed by the normalized difference vegetation index. For Seville, a green roof surface of 740 ha should be implemented, in the most adverse scenario, which means covering 40.6% of the existing buildings. In the most optimistic scenario, the forecasted green roof surface required is 207 ha (11.3% of the roofs). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A simplified three-dimensional shallow landslide susceptibility framework considering topography and seismicity
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow landslides are a prevalent concern in mountainous or hilly regions that can result in severe societal, economic, and environmental impacts. The challenge is further compounded as the size and location of a potential slide is often unknown. This study presents a generalized approach for the evaluation of regional shallow landslide susceptibility using an existing shallow landslide inventory, remote sensing data, and various geotechnical scenarios. The three-dimensional limit equilibrium model derived in this study uses a raster-based approach that uniquely integrates tree root reinforcement, earth pressure boundary forces, and pseudo-static seismic accelerations. Contributions of this methodology include the back-calculation of soil strength from a landslide inventory, sensitivity analyses regarding landslide size-pixel size relationships, and the determination of shallow landslide susceptibility for a landscape or infrastructure considering various root, water, and seismic conditions using lidar bare-earth DEMs as a topographic input. Using a distribution of inventoried landslide points and random points in non-landslide locales, the proposed methodology demonstrated reasonable correlation between regions of high landslide susceptibility and observed shallow landslides within a 150-km(2) region of the Oregon Coast Range when the water-height ratio was 0.5. The method may be improved by considering spatial hydrologic conditions and geology more explicitly.

TI  - The Development of Empathic Perspective-Taking in an Engineering Ethics Course
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPerspective-taking, a key component of engineering, is particularly salient in engineering ethics. Yet practices for promoting its development in engineering students both within and outside of ethics education remain largely underexplored.PurposeThe objective of this investigation was twofold: first, we explored the aspects of an engineering ethics course that contributed to changes in perspective-taking among graduate-level engineering students. Second, we explored the nature of these changes.Design/MethodWe used Critical Incident Technique to explore these two research objectives. To enhance the rigor of this qualitative investigation, we implemented Walther, Sochacka, and Kellam's Quality Framework.ResultsThe analysis of 24 critical incidents extracted from post-course interviews resulted in five distinct but related themes representing potential causes of changes in perspective-taking. Themes included the sharing of diverse perspectives, the challenge of ethical decision-making, projection exercises, repetitive application of Reflexive Principlism, and experiencing cognitive dissonance. Second, we found four themes representing the nature of perspectivetaking changes, including open-mindedness, holistic perspective-taking, principle-based perspective-taking, and worldview broadening.ConclusionsThese findings elucidate nuances engineering educators might consider when seeking perspective-taking development among their students, such as the nature of case study prompts and the relationship between perspective-taking and ethical reasoning processes.

TI  - Factors Influencing Management and Outcome in Patients with Occult Breast Cancer with Axillary Lymph Node Involvement: Analysis of the National Cancer Database
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Occult breast cancer (OBC) is rare and optimal local-regional (LR) management has not been defined. Using a patient registry database, we examine factors associated with treatment and outcomes in OBC.Methods. Female patients with cT0 N1/2 M0 BC were selected from the National Cancer Database (2004-2013) and categorized into four treatment groups: MAST = mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) +/- radiation (RT); RT + ALND = RT with ALND, no breast surgery; ALND = ALND alone; OBS = no breast surgery, RT, or ALND. Patient characteristics and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups, and multivariable analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment and OS.Results. Among 2.03 million BC cases, 1853 females (0.09%) with cT0 N1/2 M0 disease were identified and 1231 patients were categorized into a treatment group: MAST = 592, RT + ALND = 342, ALND = 106, OBS = 191. On logistic regression, care at an academic center was associated with a higher likelihood of RT + ALND compared with MAST (odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-2.74, p < 0.001). Patients treated with RT + ALND had significantly better OS on univariate survival analysis compared with patients treated with MAST (hazard ratio [HR] 0.475, 95% CI 0.306-0.736, p = 0.001). RT + ALND was independently associated with OS on multivariable survival analysis (HR 0.509, 95% CI 0.321-0.808, p = 0.004), after adjusting for covariates.Conclusions. Patients with OBC were more likely to undergo RT + ALND if they received care at an academic center. Patients treated with RT + ALND had significantly better OS compared with patients treated with MAST, after adjusting for covariates. This supports the use of RT + ALND as LR treatment for patients with OBC.

TI  - Mating Disruption of the Navel Orangeworm (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Using Widely Spaced, Aerosol Dispensers: Is the Pheromone Blend the Most Efficacious Disruptant?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a key pest of almonds and pistachios and is sometimes controlled using mating disruption as part of a program of integrated management. The formulation used has a single, nonattractive compound [(11Z,13Z)-hexadecadienal] as the active ingredient that is emitted from timed aerosol dispensers. This study compared this nonattractive, single-compound formulation with two aerosol formulations also containing two additional compounds [(11Z,13Z)-hexadecadien-1-ol and (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-tricosapentaene] that are found in the pheromone glands, and that in combination with the aldehyde are attractive in wind-tunnel and field-attraction trials. An experiment in pistachios found 97% to 99% suppression of males captured in female-baited traps and 82-93% suppression of mating in sentinel females. Both assays revealed a trend to greater suppression by the more complete pheromone formulations. In almonds, where the abundance of navel orangeworm was lower, all three formulations suppressed males captured in traps and mating in sentinel females by > 99%. Each of the formulations significantly reduced damage to Nonpareil almonds. In almonds, there were no significant differences among the formulations in disruption of sexual communication or in damage. These findings suggest that it may be possible to make mating disruption more cost-effective and to achieve higher levels of mating disruption by using attractive aerosol formulations to reduce the number of dispenser per ha. Such a formulation, however, would be more expensive to register in the United States than pheromones meeting the definition of straight-chain lepidopteran pheromone, including the currently used aldehyde-only formulation.

TI  - Post-treatment surveillance imaging in lymphoma
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Appropriate post-treatment management of patients with lymphoma has been controversial, with imaging frequently performed as post-treatment surveillance. The goal of post-treatment imaging is to identify relapse prior to clinical symptoms, when the burden of disease is lower and the possibility of effective salvage therapy and cure are greater. However, little data exist to support the performance of surveillance imaging after completion of treatment, with the vast majority of studies suggesting there is no clinical benefit to surveillance imaging in asymptomatic patients. Ongoing efforts seek to identify a subset of patients with a higher risk of relapse that might benefit from surveillance imaging, though financial and other costs associated with imaging are non-negligible and must be considered. Here we summarize the current data regarding post-treatment surveillance imaging in lymphoma. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Futility of imaging to stage melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of staging imaging in melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) has been reported to be of limited value. Improved accuracy resulting from the development of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (PET) and ongoing image quality improvement of computed tomography (CT) may challenge this statement. Our retrospective study assessed the clinical value of routine staging CT and PET/CT imaging in a recent cohort of asymptomatic SLN-positive patients. Between January 2011 and April 2014, 143 patients with a positive SLN were routinely staged using CT of various parts of the body or whole-body PET/CT. Scores were assigned for level of certainty for regional or distant metastases and incidental second primary malignancies. Diagnostic test performance was assessed, as well as the number and nature of ensuing additional diagnostic actions. CT was performed in 102 of 143 (71%) patients and PET/CT in 41 (29%) patients. The use of PET/CT increased over the study period. Metastases were found in two of the 143 patients (true-positive yield 1.4%). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were 11, 73 and 4% for CT and 17, 57 and 6%, respectively, for PET/CT. None of the 143 patients had a change in AJCC stage. Two other primary malignancies were found. Twenty-one (15%) patients were subjected to 37 additional investigations, referrals or procedures. Routine staging imaging with CT or PET/CT in SLN-positive patients is not useful. The yield is low and the results are often false positive, leading to unnecessary additional tests, most of which are costly and some potentially morbid.

T2  - IDOJARAS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Networking Workshop on Climate Change
CL  - Hungarian Meteorol Serv, Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - The latest reanalysis at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts is the ERA5 system, which is produced in the framework of the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. ERA5 is primarily going to cover the satellite era, i.e. 1979 to near real-time and will be publicly available for the users during 2018. The present article provides information about the observation usage of ERA5 together with an impact assessment of the assimilated data. Though all this is based on some test ( scout) ERA5 experiments, however, they are providing a good overview of the evolution of the Global Observing System. The impact assessment is based on the Degree of Freedom to Signal adjoint diagnostic tool. There is a continuous data amount increase from the beginning of the ERA5 period, which is reaching more than 30 times of the assimilated data amount today than that of the 1979s. The data increase is mostly attributed to the satellite measurements, particularly lately to the hyper-spectral infrared observations. Though at every period the satellite data amounts are larger than that of the conventional observations, their impact is not getting larger until the late 1980s. At the same time the per observation impact of the conventional observations always remain larger than the satellite ones, which means that the conventional observations, though small in quantity, still remain essential ingredients of the Global Observing System.

TI  - Entropy-Based Fusion of Water Indices and DSM Derivatives for Automatic Water Surfaces Extraction and Flood Monitoring
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable water surface extraction is essential for river delineation and flood monitoring. Obtaining such information from fine resolution satellite imagery has attracted much interest for geographic and remote sensing applications. However, those images are often expensive and difficult to acquire. This study proposes a more cost-effective technique, employing freely available Landsat images. Despite its extensive spectrum and robust discrimination capability, Landsat data are normally of medium spatial resolution and, as such, fail to delineate smaller hydrological features. Based on Multivariate Mutual Information (MMI), the Landsat images were fused with Digital Surface Model (DSM) on the spatial domain. Each coinciding pixel would then contain not only rich indices but also intricate topographic attributes, derived from its respective sources. The proposed data fusion ensures robust, precise, and observer-invariable extraction of water surfaces and their branching, while eliminating spurious details. Its merit was demonstrated by effective discrimination of flooded regions from natural rivers for flood monitoring. The assessments we completed suggest improved extraction compared to traditional methods. Compared with manual digitizing, this method also exhibited promising consistency. Extraction using Dempster-Shafer fusion provided a 91.81% F-measure, 93.09% precision, 90.74% recall, and 98.25% accuracy, while using Majority Voting fusion resulted in an 84.91% F-measure, 75.44% precision, 97.37% recall, and 97.21% accuracy.

TI  - Unexpected locations of sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. To evaluate the anatomical location of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) following intra-operative cervical injection in endometrial cancer.Methods. All consecutive patients with endometrial cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping were included in this prospective study following intra-operative cervical injection of tracers. Areas of SLN detection distribution were mapped.Results. Among 436 patients undergoing SLN mapping, there were 1095 SLNs removed, and 7.9% of these SLNs found in 13.1% of patients, were detected in areas not routinely harvested during a standard lymph node dissection. These included the internal iliac vein, parametrial, and pre-sacral areas. The SLN was the only positive node in 46.1% (15/36) of cases with successful mapping and completion lymphadenectomy, including 3 cases where the sentinel node in the atypical location was the only node with metastatic disease.Conclusion. SLN mapping using intra-operative cervical injection is capable to map out areas not typically included in a standard lymphadenectomy. The sentinel node is the most relevant lymph node to analyze and may enable to discover metastatic disease in unusual areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Potential of Earth Observation for the Analysis of Cold Region Land Surface Dynamics in Europe-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Cold regions affect global, regional and local climate; oftentimes they are relevant for water supply, host valuable ecosystems, and support human livelihood. They are thus eminently important for human society. In the context of ongoing climate change, monitoring and understanding cold region land surface dynamics is essential for environmental scientists, stakeholders and decision makers. However, the definition of cold regions remains inexplicit, and no up-to-date cold region maps or overarching spatial analyses exist. For example, Europe has densely populated cold regions, but hardly an article exists that provides a solid overview of Earth Observation (EO) based applications assessing cold region land surface dynamics in Europe. With this review article we aim at closing this gap by providing an overview of EO-based techniques for cold region observation in Europe, focusing on the dynamics of glaciers and snow. We present a novel spatial delineation of cold regions for Europe before analyzing the benefits and limitations of different EO sensor types and data processing methods for EO based cold region research. Furthermore, we identify research gaps and discuss challenges for future studies.

TI  - Geo-Hazard Detection and Monitoring Using SAR and Optical Images in a Snow-Covered Area: The Menyuan (China) Test Site
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we combine SAR and optical images for geo-hazard detection and monitoring in Western China. An extremely small baseline of C-band SAR image pairs acquired from Sentinel-1A at Menyuan, China, is analyzed. Apart from the large area of coseismal deformation, we proposed an earthquake-derived landslide detecting method by removing the coseismal deformation with polynomial fitting, then the detected moving areas were confirmed with Chinese Gaofen-1 optical satellite images. Sentinel-1A C-band interferograms show about a 7-cm line of sight movement caused by the M-S 6.4 Menyuan earthquake; meanwhile, several features indicative of ground movement were detected by the proposed method and demonstrated by the Gaofen-1 optical images; the interpretation of high-resolution optical data complemented the goal of better understanding the behavior of geo-hazard disasters. InSAR time series analysis provides an opportunity for continuous monitoring of geo-hazards in remote areas, while the optical image method is easily affected by decorrelation due to snowfall.

TI  - Quantifying the Uncertainties of Reanalyzed Arctic Cloud and Radiation Properties Using Satellite Surface Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reanalyses have proven to be convenient tools for studying the Arctic climate system, but their uncertainties should first be identified. In this study, five reanalyses (JRA-55, 20CRv2c, CFSR, ERA-Interim, and MERRA-2) are compared with NASA CERES-MODIS (CM)-derived cloud fractions (CFs), cloud water paths (CWPs), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes over the Arctic (70 degrees-90 degrees N) over the period of 2000-12, and CloudSat-CALIPSO (CC)-derived CFs from 2006 to 2010. The monthly mean CFs in all reanalyses except JRA-55 are close to or slightly higher than the CC-derived CFs from May to September. However, wintertime CF cannot be confidently evaluated until instrument simulators are implemented in reanalysis products. The comparison between CM and CCCFs indicates that CM-derived CFs are reliable in summer but not in winter. Although the reanalysis CWPs follow the general seasonal variations of CM CWPs, their annual means are only half or even less than the CM-retrieved CWPs (126 g m(-2)). The annual mean differences in TOA and surface SW and LW fluxes between CERES EBAF and reanalyses are less than 6 W m(-2) for TOA radiative fluxes and 16 W m(-2) for surface radiative fluxes. All reanalyses show positive biases along the northern and eastern coasts of Greenland as a result of model elevation biases or possible CM clear-sky retrieval issues. The correlations between the reanalyses and CERES satellite retrievals indicate that all five reanalyses estimate radiative fluxes better than cloud properties, and MERRA-2 and JRA-55 exhibit comparatively higher correlations for Arctic cloud and radiation properties.

TI  - New approach for the determination of aerosol refractive indices - Part II: Experimental set-up and application to amorphous silica particles
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is the Part II of a work aimed at proposing a new method for determining the optical constants of aerosols. The Part I detailed the theoretical and numerical basis of an algorithm devoted to retrieve the imaginary and the real part of complex refractive indices from extinction spectra of aerosols. This algorithm associates the Mie theory, the single subtractive Kramers-Kronig relation, and an optimal estimation method in an iterative process. This Part II presents the experimental set-up developed to record simultaneously high spectral resolution extinction spectra and size distributions of airborne silica particles. Extinction spectra are measured with a high spectral resolution on a broad spectral range, including both infrared (650 - 2,500 cm(-1)) and UV-visible (9,000 - 32,500 cm(-1)) spectral regions. Experimental data were used to retrieve the complex refractive indices of aerosol particles. By associating the numerical procedure presented in the first paper and this experimental set-up, complex refractive indices of silica spherical aerosol particles have been determined under controlled experimental conditions. Additional comparison between experimental and simulated extinction spectra from retrieved complex refractive indices shows that this new methodology provides optical properties representative of the material.

TI  - Application of the Acoustic Propagation Model to a deep-water cross-shelf curtain
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A good understanding of acoustic coverage and temporal variation relative to environmental conditions is crucial for accurate interpretation of results from acoustic tracking studies and ensuing appropriate management recommendations.In their recent paper, Gjelland & Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2017) suggest that the general detection probability model proposed by Gjelland & Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2013, 4, 665-674) was not appropriately used in Huveneers et al. (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2016, 7, 825-835). The intent of the comparison in Huveneers et al. (2016) was to evaluate the Acoustic Propagation Model (APM) in a situation when parameterisation is not logistically feasible. This can be the case when reference tags have not been deployed, or when the distance between tagged animals and receivers cannot be accurately estimated or cannot be obtained under sufficiently varied weather conditions. Even when parameterisation is possible, there will be situations where the APM does not account for all factors affecting detection probability, e.g. deep-water receivers where density gradients can affect sound propagation.Re-parameterisation of the APM based on clarification in Gjelland & Hedger (2017) and application to a deep-water cross-shelf receiver array showed similar detection range to a logistic model until about (similar to)750m distance, after which the APM resulted in unrealistically high detection probability estimates. The need for large amounts of data to parameterise the APM and achieve good statistical fit negates the value of the theoretical propagation model. Detection range can also be affected by a broad range of factors, many of which are not included within the APM. The complexity of the way different environmental factors can influence acoustic detections and the variability of environments in which acoustic tracking studies are undertaken make it challenging to develop a general model applicable across environments.We support further improvement of the APM and recommend the use of reference tags to collect necessary data to parameterise the APM and assess factors influencing detection probability.

TI  - Land Cover Classification via Multitemporal Spatial Data by Deep Recurrent Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, modern earth observation programs produce huge volumes of satellite images time series that can be useful to monitor geographical areas through time. How to efficiently analyze such a kind of information is still an open question in the remote sensing field. Recently, deep learning methods proved suitable to deal with remote sensing data mainly for scene classification(i.e., convolutional neural networks on single images) while only very few studies exist involving temporal deep learning approaches [i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNNs)] to deal with remote sensing time series. In this letter, we evaluate the ability of RNNs, in particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multitemporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different data sets considering both pixel-based and object-based classifications. The obtained results show that RNNs are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in the presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.

TI  - Deletion of NF-κB/RelA in Angiotensin II-Sensitive Mesenchymal Cells Blocks Aortic Vascular Inflammation and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation
T2  - ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective-Infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) induces extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation resulting in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in normolipidemic mice. Although Ang II activates mesenchymal cells in the media and adventitia to become fibrogenic, the sentinel role of this mesenchymal population in modulating the inflammatory response and aneurysms is not known. We test the hypothesis that these fibrogenic mesenchymal cells play a critical role in Ang II-induced aortic wall vascular inflammation and AAA formation.Approach and Results-Ang II infusion increased phospho-Ser536-RelA and interleukin (IL)-6 immunostaining in the abdominal aorta. In addition, aortic mRNA transcripts of RelA-dependent cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 beta were significantly elevated suggesting that Ang II functionally activates RelA signaling. To test the role of mesenchymal RelA in AAA formation, we generated RelA-CKO mice by administering tamoxifen to double transgenic mice harboring RelA-flox alleles and tamoxifen-inducible Col1a2 promoter-driven Cre recombinase (Col1a2-CreER(T)). Tamoxifen administration to Col1a2-CreER(T).mT/mG mice induced Cre expression and RelA depletion in aortic smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts but not in endothelial cells. Infusion of Ang II significantly increased abdominal aortic diameter and the incidence of AAA in RelA wild-type but not in RelA-CKO mice, independent of changes in systolic blood pressure. Furthermore, mesenchymal cell-specific RelA-CKO mice exhibited decreased expression of IL-6 and IL-1 beta cytokines and decreased recruitment of C68+ and F4/80(lo).Ly6C(hi) monocytes during Ang II infusion.Conclusions-Fibrogenic mesenchymal RelA plays a causal role in Ang II-induced vascular inflammation and AAA in normolipidemic mice.

TI  - Effect of the Vegetation Fire on Backscattering: An Investigation Based on Sentinel-1 Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at investigating the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations for detecting fire scars in vegetated areas at regional scale. A comprehensive analysis of the backscattering coefficients is carried out. The experimental analysis is conducted by analyzing the scenario of the Sardinia Island, which is one of the Italian regions most affected by fire events over the summer season. The detection capability of fire scars in such an environment is demonstrated by exploiting information extracted from dual-polarized SAR data. Our results reveal a significant decrease of the VH response over the fire-disturbed forests, thus, highlighting the effectiveness of such cross-polarized observations. In order to prove the validity of the proposed approach for the detection of fire scars in the vegetation layer, the results of the conducted experiments have been suitably compared with burned areas identified by using an existing fuzzy-based algorithm, which has been applied to multispectral Landsat-8 operational land imager data. This investigation opens theway to systematic methods for monitoring fire scars in heterogeneous environments, and in particular in fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate angular, spatial, and energy resolution, sensitivity, and shielding of a gamma-probe.Materials and methods The EUROPROBE II gamma-probe (EuroRad) with sources of technetium-99m was assessed according to NEMA NU-3-2004. Resolution tests were evaluated considering the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The following parameters were evaluated: angular resolution in air, spatial resolution with a scattering medium and in air, energy resolution, and sensitivity and shielding. The collimator was used to evaluate angular and spatial resolution, sensitivity, and shielding. Background radiation was considered and did not affect the counts.Results FWHM of angular resolution (at 3/30 cm) was 39.17 degrees/33.13 degrees with the collimator and 74.08 degrees/71.51 degrees without the collimator; FWHM of spatial resolution in air at 10 mm was 13.32 mm with the collimator and 21.23 mm without the collimator. Energy resolution (%FWHM) was 20.51%. Sensitivity at 10 mm was 4.642 +/- 5 cps/MBq without the collimator and 1.063 +/- 2 cps/MBq with the collimator; shielding effectiveness of the probe tip was 99.52%. Background was not relevant to the counts.Conclusion We showed that the collimator improved angular and spatial resolution to the detriment of sensitivity. Feasible results of energy resolution, sensitivity, and shielding were achieved. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Presidential Election has precipitated a significant crisis in the world of journalism, prompting journalists and media critics to consider the shifts that have taken place in the media ecosystem. Journalists have had to narrate their sense of failure in order to understand it, and to integrate it within their larger worldview and their normative professional commitments. They have had to think about why they failed to see the Alt-Right as an independent and alternative public sphere. They have had to think about how the new media environment has challenged the taken-for-granted epistemological privileges of traditional journalism. They have had to confront the rise of populist discourse, and consider how it challenges journalists' authority by equating them with elites. In their self-reflection after the election, journalists have sought to update the sacred discourse of journalism and to justify their central position in a democratic society. In order to do this, they have mobilized around a new battle narrative, which foregrounds the collective memory of Watergate and encourages a reconsideration of alliances that might be formed with new media.

TI  - Axillary lymph node coverage with 3-dimensional tangential field irradiation and correlation with heart and lung dose.
T2  - Advances in radiation oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial indicated no benefit from axillary lymph node (LN) dissection after a positive sentinel LN biopsy in patients receiving breast irradiation, suggesting that level I-II LNs were covered in tangential fields.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 50 computed tomography-based tangential breast plans and contoured level I-III axillary LNs using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines. The volumes of level I-III LN regions covered by 90% and 95% of the prescription dose (PD) were calculated and correlated with the V20 ipsilateral lung and mean heart dose. We calculated field length, distance from the humeral head, and separation. The Pearson correlation method and linear models were used in the correlative study.RESULTS: Level I LN mean and median volume (MMV) covered by 90% of the PD were 46.8% and 47.2%, respectively. MMV covered by 95% of the PD was 30.8% and 29.62%. Mean and median dose to level I LNs were 29.03Gy and 30.13Gy, respectively. The MMV of level II LNs covered by 90% of the PD was 2.49% and 0%. The mean and median dose to level II LNs were 6.09Gy and 2.12Gy, respectively. The MMV of level III LNs was 0% with a mean and median dose of 1.04Gy and 0.92Gy, respectively. There was a moderate correlation between the 95% prescription coverage of level I LNs and V20 ipsilateral lung and a smaller correlation between 95% prescription coverage of level I LNs and mean heart dose. Distance from the humeral head was inversely correlated with coverage of level I and II LNs and positively correlated with V20 lung.CONCLUSION: In most patients, <50% of the level I LN volume was covered by 90% of the PD and <30% was covered by 95%; <5% of the level II nodes were covered by 90% of the PD; and coverage was 0% for level III LNs.

TI  - The burden of trauma at a district hospital in Malawi
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Trauma disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, many of which do not have the surveillance systems required to design effective prevention and treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to establish such a system at a district hospital in Malawi. Data on all trauma patients presenting to Mulanje District Hospital from 14 April 2013 to 30 December 2014 were collected using a form based on the core minimum data points for injuries recommended by the World Health Organization and an injury severity assessment. A total of 9073 trauma cases were recorded, accounting for 3.4% of patients that presented at the hospital during this period. Of them, 56.6% were boys/men, with the average age being 22.4 (range, 0.6-98 years). Falls (53.2%), animal bites (16.6%), road traffic injuries (11.1%) and assaults (10.2%) were the most prevalent causes, the majority of the former two taking place at home. Of the patients, 94.8% were treated and sent home, 5.0% were admitted and the remaining were either referred elsewhere or died.

TI  - A Validated Nomogram to Predict Upstaging of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ to Invasive Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article

CP  - 18th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Breast-Surgeons
CL  - Las Vegas, NV
AB  - Background. Approximately 8-56% of patients with a core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be upstaged to invasive disease at the time of excision. Patients with invasive disease are recommended to undergo axillary nodal staging, most often requiring a second operation. We developed and validated a nomogram to preoperatively predict percentage of risk for upstaging to invasive cancer.Methods. We reviewed 834 cases of DCIS on CNB between January 2004 and October 2014. Multivariable analysis was used to evaluate CNB and imaging factors to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of upstaging from DCIS to invasive cancer. This nomogram was validated with an external dataset of 579 similar patients between November 1998 and September 2016. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to evaluate nomogram discrimination.Results. The rate of upstaging to invasive disease was 118/834 (14.1%). On multivariable analysis, grade on CNB and imaging factors, including mass lesion, multicentric disease, and largest linear dimension, were associated with upstage to invasive disease, and was used to develop a nomogram (c-statistic 0.71). In the external validation dataset, 62/579 (10.7%) patients were upstaged to invasive disease. Our nomogram was validated in this dataset with a c-statistic of 0.71.Conclusion. For patients with a CNB diagnosis of DCIS, our validated nomogram using DCIS grade on biopsy, and imaging factors of mass lesion, multicentric disease, and largest linear dimension, may be used for preoperative assessment of risk of upstaging to invasive disease, allowing patient counseling regarding axillary staging at the time of definitive surgery.

TI  - Comparative analysis of diffuse solar radiation models based on sky-clearness index and sunshine period for humid-subtropical climatic region of India: A case study
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In the present work, long-term solar radiation assessment was performed for three years (September 2013 to August 2016) in Humid-Subtropical Climatic Region of India for the city of Aligarh (27.88 degrees N, 78.08 degrees E). Annual average global, beam and diffuse solar radiation values for Aligarh were observed as 21.01 MJ/m(2)-day, 13.40 MJ/m(2)-day and 7.61 MJ/m(2)-day. Annual average sky-clearness index, diffuse fraction and diffusion coefficient were found to be 0.66, 0.37 and 0.24 respectively. Ground based global solar radiation measurements were compared with the available satellite data of the closest coordinate location (27.50 degrees N, 78.50 degrees N). Strong association was found between the ground measurements and satellite data. Further, empirical models for estimation of monthly mean diffuse solar radiation were developed using ground-based measured data. Diffuse solar radiation was modelled in terms of single and two input variables (namely sky-clearness index and relative sunshine period). A total of 42 new models in six different categories were developed. Proposed models were also compared with well-established models from literature. Models were assessed for performance in terms of ten most frequently used statistical indicators. Subsequently, proposed models were ranked in order of suitability of estimation within their respective category as well as among the group of all the developed models using Global Performance Index (GPI). Overall GPI of developed models was found in the range of -1.2677 to 5.5596 with the highest value representing the best model. It was inferred that two input variable models perform much better in comparison to single variable input models. Among the two variable models, diffuse fraction model in terms of sky-clearness index and relative sunshine period (each in order one) was found to be the most accurate. Excellent agreement was affirmed between estimated and measured values from two variable models. The use of single variable models was also suggested within reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Validation of Ozone Monitoring Instrument UV Satellite Data Using Spectral and Broadband Surface Based Measurements at a Queensland Site
T2  - PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research reconstructed and validated the broadband UVA irradiances derived from discrete spectral irradiance data retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite from 1 January to 31 December 2009. OMI data at solar noon were compared to ground-based spectral irradiances at Toowoomba (27 degrees 36 S 151 degrees 55 E), Australia, at 310, 324 and 380 nm for both cloud-free and all sky conditions. There was a strong relationship between the ground-based UV spectroradiometer data and satellite-based measurements with an R-2 of 0.89 or better in each waveband for cloud-free days. The data show an overestimate of the satellite-derived spectral irradiances compared to the ground-based data. The models developed for the subtropical site data account for this overestimation and are essential for any data correlation between satellite- and ground-based measurements. Additionally, this research has compared solar noon broadband UVA irradiances evaluated with a model and the discrete satellite spectral irradiances for the solar noon values of cloud-free days to those measured with a ground-based UVA radiometer. An R-2 of 0.86 was obtained confirming that for cloud-free days the broadband UVA can be evaluated from the OMI satellite spectral irradiances.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluates carbon dioxide (CO2) production from yeast/sugar mixtures and its efficiency as an attractant in BG-Sentinel traps.Methods: The rate of CO2 production was optimized for different yeast/sugar mixtures. The optimized mixture was then used as bait in BG-Sentinel traps. The efficiency of this bait was then compared to octenol baited traps.Results: The yeast/sugar (5 g: 280 g) in 300 mL water generated the highest volume of CO2. The CO2 baited traps caught significantly more mosquitoes than octenol baited traps.Conclusions: Yeast-produced CO2 can effectively replace octenol baits in BG traps. This will significantly reduce costs and allow sustainable mass-application of the CO2 baited traps in large scale surveillance programs.

TI  - Effect of NOAA satellite orbital drift on AVHRR-derived phenological metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center routinely produces and distributes a remote sensing phenology (RSP) dataset derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1-km data compiled from a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-11, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19). Each NOAA satellite experienced orbital drift during its duty period, which influenced the AVHRR reflectance measurements. To understand the effect of the orbital drift on the AVHRR-derived RSP dataset, we analyzed the impact of solar zenith angle (SZA) on the RSP metrics in the conterminous United States (CONUS). The AVHRR weekly composites were used to calculate the growing-season median SZA at the pixel level for each year from 1989 to 2014. The results showed that the SZA increased towards the end of each NOAA satellite mission with the highest increasing rate occurring during NOAA-11 (1989-1994) and NOAA-14 (1995-2000) missions. The growing-season median SZA values (44 degrees-60 degrees) in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999, and 2000 were substantially higher than those in other years (28 degrees-40 degrees). The high SZA in those years caused negative trends in the SZA time series, that were statistically significant (at alpha = 0.05 level) in 76.9% of the CONUS area. A pixel-based temporal correlation analysis showed that the phenological metrics and SZA were significantly correlated (at alpha = 0.05 level) in 4.1-20.4% of the CONUS area. After excluding the 5 years with high SZA ( >40 degrees) from the analysis, the temporal SZA trend was largely reduced, significantly affecting less than 2% of the study area. Additionally, significant correlation between the phenological metrics and SZA was observed in less than 7% of the study area. Our study concluded that the NOAA satellite orbital drift increased SZA, and in turn, influenced the phenological metrics. Elimination of the years with high median SZA reduced the influence of orbital drift on the RSP time series.

TI  - InSAR observation and inversion of the seismogenic fault for the 2017 Jiuzhaigou <i>M</i><sub>S</sub>7. 0 earthquake in China
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake with M(S)7.0 occurred in Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province on 8 August 2017. This work derives the coseismic deformation field based on Sentinel-1 SAR images by using the InSAR technique. Then, the coseismic slip distribution is inverted and the static Coulomb stress changes in the aftershock distribution area and surrounding faults are calculated. Finally, we discuss the seismogenic fault of this event. The results show that from the InSAR deformation fields, the Jiuzhaigou earthquake caused crustal deformation with a magnitude of 20 cm in the line of sight direction. The coseismic deformation fields exhibit an asymmetric characteristic. The coseismic slip was dominated by left-lateral strike motion and mainly distributed at depths 4 similar to 16 km, with the maximum slip of approximately 77 cm at a depth 9 km. The inverted magnitude is approximately M(W)6.46. The causative fault did not rupture the surface. Most of the aftershocks occurred in the regions with increases of Coulomb stress change. This earthquake increased the Coulomb stress change on some surrounding faults, such as eastern segment of the Dongkunlun fault, Longriba fault, and Huya fault. The seismic risk of the eastern segment of the Dongkunlun fault should be considered in the future. Our work suggests that the causative fault of the Jiuzhaigou earthquake is the Shuzheng fault, which is presumably the hidden part of the northwestward extension of the Huya fault. And this event was resulted from southeastward motion of the Bayan Har block when blocked by the South China block.

TI  - Inconsistencies of interannual variability and trends in long-term satellite leaf area index products
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the long-term performance of global satellite leaf area index (LAI) products is important for global change research. However, few effort has been devoted to evaluating the long-term time-series consistencies of LAI products. This study compared four long-term LAI products (GLASS, GLOBMAP, LAI3g, and TCDR) in terms of trends, interannual variabilities, and uncertainty variations from 1982 through 2011. This study also used four ancillary LAI products (GEOV1, MERIS, MODIS C5, and MODIS C6) from 2003 through 2011 to help clarify the performances of the four long-term LAI products. In general, there were marked discrepancies between the four long-term LAI products. During the pre-MODIS period (1982-1999), both linear trends and interannual variabilities of global mean LAI followed the order GLASS>LAI3g>TCDR>GLOBMAP. The GLASS linear trend and interannual variability were almost 4.5 times those of GLOBMAP. During the overlap period (2003-2011), GLASS and GLOBMAP exhibited a decreasing trend, TCDR no trend, and LAI3g an increasing trend. GEOV1, MERIS, and MODIS C6 also exhibited an increasing trend, but to a much smaller extent than that from LAI3g. During both periods, the R-2 of detrended anomalies between the four long-term LAI products was smaller than 0.4 for most regions. Interannual variabilities of the four long-term LAI products were considerably different over the two periods, and the differences followed the order GLASS>LAI3g>TCDR>GLOBMAP. Uncertainty variations quantified by a collocation error model followed the same order. Our results indicate that the four long-term LAI products were neither intraconsistent over time nor interconsistent with each other. These inconsistencies may be due to NOAA satellite orbit changes and MODIS sensor degradation. Caution should be used in the interpretation of global changes derived from the four long-term LAI products.

TI  - Developing a two-step method for retrieving cyanobacteria abundance from inland eutrophic lakes using MERIS data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria are the main dominant species in inland eutrophic lakes during algae blooms, and measures of cyanobacteria abundance can be used for monitoring and early detection of algal blooms by remote sensing. During May 2013 and August 2016, a total 137 water samples were collected from Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. Remote-sensing reflectance was measured, surface water was collected in the field, and chlorophyll-a concentration, phycocyanin concentration, suspended-matter concentration and phytoplankton pigment absorption parameters were measured in the laboratory. The composition and density of planktonic algae were also detected by microscope examination. The remote-sensing reflectance at 15 MERIS bands was simulated based on our measured spectral data, and a two-step method for detecting cyanobacteria abundance using the partial least squares model based on 5 MERIS bands was developed. The results showed that the estimation algorithm can predict cyanobacteria abundance in inland eutrophic lakes with satisfactory accuracy, with RMSE of 7.56 and MAPE of 13.44 %. This algorithm was successfully applied to the MERIS image acquired on August 12, 2010, and showed a reasonable spatial distribution of cyanobacteria abundance in Lake Taihu. It demonstrated that the developed estimation method was an effective way to monitor cyanobacteria abundance in water with a potential to be successfully applied to Sentinel-3 images.

TI  - Level Set Segmentation Algorithm for High-Resolution Polarimetric SAR Images Based on a Heterogeneous Clutter Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a heterogeneous cluttermodel namedL distribution is introduced into the level setmethod for segmentation of high-resolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Level set methods are robust and effective techniques for segmentation. However, traditional level set methods for PolSAR data are based on the complex Wishart distribution, which is not an applicable model to high-resolution PolSAR images and heterogeneous regions such as forest and urban areas. The L distribution is proved to be a highly flexible model for multilook PolSAR data, which is based on the product model with a generalized-gamma-distributed texture component. The L-model-based level set segmentation method is assessed using C-band, X-band, and L-band PolSAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X, and ESAR sensors, respectively. Experimental results show that the L-distribution model has a better capacity for characterizing high-resolution PolSAR data, especially for extremely heterogeneous regions. Compared with the Wishart-model-based and Kummer-U-model-based level set methods and Markov random field based methods, it is observed that the proposed level set algorithm can obtain more precise segmentation results.

TI  - Integrated Analysis of Dust Transport and Budget in a Severe Asian Dust Event
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian dust storms markedly affect the ecosystem, environment, ocean biogeochemical cycle, and regional climate. Numerous measurements and model simulations have been performed to investigate the sources and transport of Asian dust. However, until now, few studies have performed a comprehensive quantification of the dust budget, resulting in significant uncertainty about the characterization of dust transport, emission, and deposition. In this study, a severe dust event in East Asia that occurred from April 28 till May 3, 2011, was analyzed in terms of dust transport characteristics based on multi-satellite observations and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. In particular, the dust budget of the event was quantitatively estimated using a new atmospheric reanalysis dataset, namely the second Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2). The multi-satellite observations and models indicated that dust events such as this are uncommon. A two-layered dust structure was found in southeast China, the lower (< 1.5 km) and elevated (> 3 km) layers of which mainly originated from the Gobi and Taklimakan Deserts, respectively. The dust budget in East Asia, as estimated from MERRA-2, revealed a high dust mass loading (5.7-6.6 Tg) between 70 degrees E and 140 degrees E from April 29 till May 1, with the highest daily dust loading (approximately 6.6 Tg) reported on April 30. The total dust emission was 6.3 Tg over a 6-day period (April 28-May 3), and the maximum amount (nearly 5.9 Tg) of dust was deposited on the ground in the region. The dust flux amounts horizontally transported across the longitudinal boundary of 70 degrees E and 140 degrees E were 1.7 and 2.8 Tg, respectively.

TI  - Flow and structure in a dendritic glacier with bedrock steps
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyse ice flow and structural glaciology of Shackleton Glacier, a dendritic glacier with multiple icefalls in the Canadian Rockies. A major tributary-trunk junction allows us to investigate the potential of tributaries to alter trunk flow and structure, and the formation of bedrock steps at confluences. Multi-year velocity-stake data and structural glaciology up-glacier from the junction were assimilated with glacier-wide velocity derived from Radarsat-2 speckle tracking. Maximum flow speeds are 65 m a(-1) in the trunk and 175 m a(-1) in icefalls. Field and remote-sensing velocities are in good agreement, except where velocity gradients are high. Although compression occurs in the trunk up-glacier of the tributary entrance, glacier flux is steady state because flow speed increases at the junction due to the funnelling of trunk ice towards an icefall related to a bedrock step. Drawing on a published erosion model, we relate the heights of the step and the hanging valley to the relative fluxes of the tributary and trunk. It is the first time that an extant glacier is used to test and support such model. Our study elucidates the inherent complexity of tributary/trunk interactions and provides a conceptual model for trunk flow restriction by a tributary in surge-type glaciers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY

AB  - BackgroundPolo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is one of the key regulators of cell cycle progression. Increased expression of PLK-1 was observed in several tumor types.MethodsWe immunohistochemically assessed PLK-1 expression in neoplastic and stromal compartments of 96 cutaneous melanomas, and analyzed associations between PLK-1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics.ResultsPLK-1 expression in cancer cells was not associated with basic clinical (eg, age, gender and tumor location) or histopathological (eg, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate and ulceration) parameters. However, increased PLK-1 was more frequent in tumors with concurrent regional nodal metastases and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy status. All primary tumors associated with co-existing distant metastases exhibited high PLK-1 expression in melanoma cells. Conversely, PLK-1 expression in stromal cells was more frequent in tumors without nodal metastases. PLK-1 expression in both compartments was not associated with survival.ConclusionPLK-1 expression is associated with metastatic potential in cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes of the coastline in Five South Island of Long Island in recent three decades on RS and GIS
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic islands contain abundant resource which have great economical value and effectively sustain the ecosystem, and they also play a significant role in preserving marine right and interests of the country. In this paper, based on the technology of RS and GIS, using Landsat of 1982, 1995, 2006 and 2015, the spatial and temporal changes of the coastline in the past 30 years were analyzed. The results showed that the total length of the coastline had increased by 9.54 km in the past 30 years, and the coastline had the trend toward sea at the speed of 0.54 m/a. Coastline changes were mainly affected by human factors, which are mainly reflected in aquaculture reclamation, construction land use and port construction. Relatively large changes are mainly in the west of the South Long Island and North Long Island. These results implyed that the changes of the coastline might lead to a set of environment problems such as coastline erosion, and attention should be paid to the coastline development and reasonable coastal resources uses.

TI  - Application of InSAR Techniques to an Analysis of the Guanling Landslide
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the afternoon of 28 June 2010, an enormous landslide occurred in the Gangwu region of Guanling County, Guizhou Province. In order to better understand the mechanism of the Guanling landslide, archived ALOS/PALSAR data was used to acquire the deformation prior to the landslide occurrence through stacking and time-series InSAR techniques. First, the deformation structure from InSAR was compared to the potential creep bodies identified using the optical remote sensing data. A strong consistency between the InSAR detected deformed regions and the creep bodies detected from optical remote sensing images was achieved. Around 10 creep bodies were suffering from deformation. In the source area, the maximum pre-slide mean deformation rate along the slope direction reached 160 mm/year, and the uncertainty of the deformation rates ranged from 15 to 34 mm/year. Then, the pre-slide deformation at the source area was analyzed in terms of the topography, geological structure, and historical rainfall records. Through observation and analysis, the deformation pattern of one creep body located within the source area can be segmented into three sections: a creeping section in the front, a locking section in the middle, and a cracking section in the rear. These sections constitute one of the common landslide modes seen in the south-west of China. This study concluded that a sudden shear failure in the locking segment of one creeping body located within the source area was caused by a strong rainstorm, which triggered the Guanling landslide.

TI  - Quantifying green cover change for sustainable urban planning: A case of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the numerous benefits of urban green cover, urban land development has led to its destruction and degradation, including in Malaysia. In this study, time series Landsat satellite imagery were used to monitor green cover changes in Kuala Lumpur (KL), the largest and capital city of Malaysia. An advanced satellite image processing technique that considers the mixed-pixel problem was employed to determine the fraction of green cover in each Landsat pixel. Results show that the total green coverage in Kuala Lumpur decreased by 3% over the first study period, from 6564 ha in 2001-5,891 ha in 2013. However, it increased by 4% in the second, from 6215 ha in 2014-7,310 ha in 2016, and now green cover is 30% of the total land area of KL. These periods were selected to observe the changes in green cover before and after implementation of the "Greening KL" program, which was aimed to plant 100,000 trees in KL by year 2020. Most of the increase in green cover was contributed by trees planted along streets and in recreational parks. Other findings include a loss of similar to 9% of green cover in two public parks compared to their total gazetted area, and a loss of green area in other forested parts of KL. Focus group discussions and structured interviews with public, private and non-governmental organizations indicate that green-cover losses can be partly attributed to weak regulations and their poor enforcement. Opportunities to protect and increase green cover in KL are also explored in this study. Such approaches are urgently needed before most of the green areas disappear from the landscape of KL, exacerbating the existing environmental problems in the city.

TI  - Clinical and Pathological Factors Affecting the Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become the routine procedure in axilla-negative breast cancer patients at most medical centers for axillary staging and local control in the recent years. Sentinel lymph node is the only focus in axillary lymph metastasis in a large portion of patients. In our trial, we investigated the clinical and pathological factors that affect the positive status of sentinel lymph node. We included 89 patients, who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with methylene blue and/or technetium-99 m Sulphur Colloid due to early-stage breast cancer. Five patients, in whom SLN was not detected and who underwent axillary dissection, were excluded from the trial. The patient age, location of the tumor, the type of the tumor, the T stage by the TNM staging system, the histological grade and type of the tumor, the status of multifocality, the lymphovascular invasion status of the tumor, and the ER, PR, and HER-neu2 status were recorded. The median age of the 89 patients was 52, 9 (+/- 10) years. Fifty-seven (64 %) and 32 (36 %) of the 89 patients were detected to have positive and negative SLN, respectively. Assessing the SLNB positivity and the patient age, tumor size, tumor grade, multifocality, tumor localization, the T stage by the TNM staging, the ER/PR positivity/negativity, and the HER/neu2 and p53 status, the data revealed no statistically significant results with respect to SLN metastasis. The lymphovascular invasion status (LVI) was observed to statistically affect the SLN positivity (p< 0.016). We showed that LVI could be an important marker in predicting the SLN positivity in patients with axilla-negative early-stage breast cancer. In the future, upon introduction of new biomarkers and with relevant studies, it may be possible to predict the SLNB status of patients at an adequately high accuracy and a low risk.

TI  - Estimation of Sediment Yield within Mining Watershed to Assess Impact of Mine Dumps Using Satellite Data: Modified Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast mining disturbs large areas of land, resulting in a decline in the groundwater table, increased sedimentation rates, and groundwater contamination. The sediment yield from the mined areas can be several times greater than from undisturbed areas. The sediment yields can be greater in the regions with large overburden (OB) dumps, which facilitate surface erosion because they consist of unconsolidated loose materials and induce changes in surface morphology. The present study proposes a modified approach using geoinformatics to estimate the sediment yield in a microwatershed dominated by coal mines and OB dumps. A modified equation has been proposed that uses the drainage and the vegetative cover, the major inputs required for sediment yield estimation. The sediment yields have been estimated for the years 1989 and 2007, during which the OB dump area increased significantly. Land use classes were extracted for 1989 and 2007, using multispectral Landsat and Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellite data. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the performance of the modified approach. The outcome of the study corroborates the utility of multidate, multiresolution satellite data for the estimation of sediment yield. In the absence of field data, the study reveals that satellite data provides the information on the impact of the OB dumps on the quantities of the sediment yields as a result of the enhanced erosion rates. The results obtained in the present study of a mining dominated microwatershed will help administrators and authorities to take the necessary preventive measures for controlling the erosion through proper mine management.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in colorectal surgery: overview, applications, and future directions
T2  - LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging is a surgical tool with increasing applications in colorectal surgery. This tool has received acceptance in various surgical disciplines as a potential method to enhance surgical field visualisation, improve lymph node retrieval, and decrease the incidence of anastomotic leaks. In colorectal surgery specifically, small studies have shown that intraoperative fluorescence imaging is a safe and feasible method to assess anastomotic perfusion, and its use might affect the incidence of anastomotic leaks. Controlled trials are ongoing to validate these conclusions. The number of new indications for indocyanine green continues to increase, including innovative options for detecting and guiding management of colorectal metastasis to the liver. These advances could offer great value for surgeons and patients, by improving the accuracy and outcomes of oncological resections.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the ability of the regional climate model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) in simulating the seasonal and interannual variability of hydrometeorological variables in the Tana River basin (TRB) in Kenya, East Africa. The impact of two different land use classifications, i.e., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the US Geological Survey (USGS) at two horizontal resolutions (50 and 25 km) is investigated. Simulated precipitation and temperature for the period 2011-2014 are compared with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climate Research Unit (CRU), and station data. The ability of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Climate Research Unit (CRU) data in reproducing in situ observation in the TRB is analyzed. All considered WRF simulations capture well the annual as well as the interannual and spatial distribution of precipitation in the TRB according to station data and the TRMM estimates. Our results demonstrate that the increase of horizontal resolution from 50 to 25 km, together with the use of the MODIS land use classification, significantly improves the precipitation results. In the case of temperature, spatial patterns and seasonal cycle are well reproduced, although there is a systematic cold bias with respect to both station and CRU data. Our results contribute to the identification of suitable and regionally adapted regional climate models (RCMs) for East Africa.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Morphotectonic indices by representing the longer period of time than recorded earthquake data, are useful in evaluating the tectonic activity of a region. Dashtkhak area is located in Kerman province of Iran, where one of the most active faults, Kouhbanan strike slip fault, passes through. This data article provides a precise level data on mountain fronts and valleys of Dashtkhak region that is fundamental for morphotectonic investigations of the relationship among geomorphology and tectonic activity. This data is valuable in the field of geology and geography. Mountain fronts and valleys data is more relevant in the field of tectonics and geomorphology. It helps to evaluate a region from the viewpoint of tectonic activity. The data which are presented for 31 mountain fronts and 61 valleys, is taken by processing of remotely sensed Landsat satellite data, photogeology of areal photographs, measuring on topographic maps and controlled by field checking. This data is useful for calculating of some morphotectonic indices such as sinuosity of mountain fronts (s(m)f), mountain front faceting percentage (Facet%), the ratio of valley floor width to valley height (V-f) and the valley ratio (V).

TI  - A spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) for salinity mapping in Florida Bay using Landsat images and in situ observations
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface water salinity of Florida Bay has been deteriorating due to anthropogenic interventions and natural disturbances for almost over a century, yet astoundingly, this issue perceiving limited exposure. Driven by this, this study developed a spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) to predict the dry and wet season's surface water salinity in Florida Bay. The modeling was carried out using in situ salinity observations from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for 1998-2001 coupled with processed Landsat TM 5 images for corresponding dates. A mathematical optimization formulation was developed for the model, which was solved using a gradient-based optimization solver, following the clustering of the study area into a set of 3 km * 3 km grids. To train the model so as to infer optimum values of decision variables, the optimization process was simulated for each 3 km pixel using two-third randomly selected samples, which yielded acceptable R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.90 for dry and wet seasons and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 1.8 and 1.73 parts per thousand (ppt) for dry and wet seasons, respectively. The validation of the model with the remaining one-third samples also provided good statistical correlation, as the R-squared values found were 0.91 (dry) and 0.89 (wet); and the validated RMSE values obtained were 1.92 ppt (dry) and 1.84 ppt (wet), providing strong inference of the model's consistency in estimating surface water salinity. Lastly, the model was applied to six different temporal cases (i.e., dry and wet seasons of 1996-97, 2004-05, and 2016). Upon application, the model provided reasonable accuracy except for showing errors in some regions for 2004-05. The surface water salinity mapping carried out using SWOM not only provided meaningful spatial and temporal variations of surface water salinity but also highlighted the wet season hypersaline peaks within the central Florida Bay region.

AB  - Objective. To describe the epidemiological characteristics and survival of desmoplastic melanoma of the head and neck (DMHN) and discuss the factors influencing survival variation among DMHN, DM of other sites (DMnHN), and conventional melanoma of the head and neck (CMHN).Study Design. Retrospective cohort study.Setting. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (years 1992-2013).Subjects and Methods. Incidence and survival data for 1095 patients with DMHN, 1139 patients with DMnHN, and 40,257 patients with CMHN were obtained. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate survival outcomes.Results. Patients with DMHN were diagnosed at greater Breslow thickness (P < .001), stage (P < .001), and Clark's level (P < .001) compared to DMnHN and CMHN. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated disease-specific survival (DSS) at 5 and 10 years for DMHN to be 80.5% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with 89.1% and 86%, respectively, for DMnHN and 88.1% and 83%, respectively, for CMHN (log-rank test; P < .001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, age at diagnosis (P < .001), Breslow depth >4.00 mm (P = .006), lymph node status (P < .001), and presence of ulceration (P < .001) were found to be independent predictors of DSS for DMHN.Conclusion. The increasing incidence and poor survivability of DMHN compared to DMnHN and CMHN are parsimoniously explained by the later stage of disease and depth of invasion at diagnosis, highlighting the importance of improved diagnosis and awareness of DMHN.

TI  - The clinical implication of the number of lymph nodes harvested during sentinel lymph node biopsy and its effects on survival outcome in patients with node-negative breast cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The optimal number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) that need to be harvested to achieve favorable survival outcome during a SLN biopsy (SLNB) has not yet been established.Methods: Six hundred and thirteen patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLNB were reviewed. Survival outcomes according to the number of total harvested lymph nodes (THLNs), defined as the sum of enumerated SLNs and non-SLNs were analyzed.Results: Patients with only 1 THLN showed lower recurrence-free survival (RFS) as compared to those with >= 2 THLNs (p = 0.049). In multivariate analysis, only 1 THLN was associated with poor RFS (HR = 2.711; p = 0.029).Conclusions: Removing at least 2 lymph nodes during SLNB may be acceptable. Harvesting only 1 lymph node should be undertaken cautiously because of false negative results and increasing the subsequent recurrence rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of Gas Emission Crater Geomorphodynamics on Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas (Russia), Based on Repeat Very-High-Resolution Stereopairs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas Emission Craters (GEC) represent a new phenomenon in permafrost regions discovered in the north of West Siberia. In this study we use very-high-resolution Worldview satellite stereopairs and Resurs-P images to reveal and measure the geomorphic features that preceded and followed GEC formation on the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas. Analysis of DEMs allowed us to: (1) distinguish different terrain positions of the GEC, at the foot of a gentle slope (Yamal), and on an upper edge of a terrace slope; (2) notice that the formation of both Yamal and Gydan GECs were preceded by mound development; (3) measure a funnel-shaped upper part and a cylindrical lower part for each crater; (4) and measure the expansion and plan form modification of GECs. Although the general characteristics of both craters are similar, there are differences when comparing both key sites in detail. The height of the mound and diameter of the resulting GEC in Yamal exceeds that in Gydan; GEC-1 was surrounded by a well-developed parapet, while AntGEC did not show any considerable accumulative body. Thus, using very-high-resolution remote sensing data allowed us to discriminate geomorphic features and relief positions characteristic for GEC formation. GECs are a potential threat to commercial facilities in permafrost and indigenous settlements, especially because at present there is no statistically significant number of study objects to identify the local environmental conditions in which the formation of new GEC is possible.

TI  - Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma: treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery and an update of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA) is a rare adenocarcinoma of the sweat glands.Aims We wish to report the treatment of two cases of ADPA with Mohs micrographic surgery and review the presentation, management, and prognosis of this rare malignancy.Materials & Methods Cases of ADPA were identified from recent surgery logs. Demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were extracted. A PubMed database search for English language full-text articles of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma was performed, and relevant articles were summarized.Results Two cases of ADPA were identified. A 53-year-old man presented with ADPA on his right third fingernail, and a 65-year-old man presented with ADPA on his right thumb. Both patients underwent Mohs micrographic surgery and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, remaining recurrence free at 34 and 9 months, respectively.Discussion ADPA frequently presents as a solitary mass on the digit. Treatment of ADPA with local excision or amputation has historically been fraught with high recurrence rates. Regional lymph node spread and distant metastasis have been reported. Mohs micrographic surgery may be an alternative treatment for ADPA.Conclusion Mohs micrographic surgery is a viable option for ADPA and warrants further exploration. Long-term follow-up is important, and additional studies will need to identify the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Automated Detection of Ice and Open Water From Dual-Polarization RADARSAT-2 Images for Data Assimilation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a new technique for automated detection of ice and open water from RADARSAT2 ScanSAR dual-polarization HH-HV images. Probability of the presence of ice within 2.05 km x 2.05 km areas is modeled using a form of logistic regression as a function of the difference between the wind speeds estimated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and those obtained from numerical weather prediction short-term forecasts, the spatial correlation between HH and HV backscatter signals, and the spatial standard deviation of the wind speed estimated from SAR. The resulting ice probability model was built based on thousands of SAR images and corresponding Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products covering all seasons and all Canadian and adjacent Arctic regions being monitored by CIS. Extensive verification of the proposed technique was conducted for an entire year (2013) against independent Image Analysis products and Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System ice extent products. Using a probability threshold of 0.95, 72.2% of the retrievals were classified as either ice or open water with an accuracy of 99.2% in the most clean verification scenario against Image Analysis pure ice and water data. The ability to obtain such a large number of retrievals with a very high accuracy makes it feasible to assimilate the resulting retrievals in an ice prediction system. Consequently, the developed ice/water retrieval technique will be implemented as a part of the data assimilation component of the operational Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System.

AB  - We present a new open source polarized radiative transfer code SORD written in Fortran 90/95. SORD numerically simulates propagation of monochromatic solar radiation in a plane-parallel atmosphere over a reflecting surface using the method of successive orders of scattering (hence the name). Thermal emission is ignored. We did not improve the method in any way, but report the accuracy and runtime in 52 benchmark scenarios. This paper also serves as a quick start user's guide for the code available from ftp://maiac.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/skorkin, from the JQSRT website, or from the corresponding (first) author.

TI  - Local Adjuvant Treatment with Low-Dose CpG-B Offers Durable Protection against Disease Recurrence in Clinical Stage I-II Melanoma: Data from Two Randomized Phase II Trials
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Although risk of recurrence after surgical removal of clinical stage I-II melanoma is considerable, there is no adjuvant therapy with proven efficacy. Here, we provide clinical evidence that a local conditioning regimen, aimed at immunologic arming of the tumor-draining lymph nodes, may provide durable protection against disease recurrence (median follow-up, 88.8 months).Experimental Design: In two randomized phase II trials, patients, diagnosed with stage I-II melanoma after excision of the primary tumor, received local injections at the primary tumor excision site within 7 days preceding re-excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy of either a saline placebo (n = 22) or low-dose CpG type B (CpG-B) with (n = 9) or without (n = 21) low-dose GM-CSF.Results: CpG-B treatment was shown to be safe, to boost locoregional and systemic immunity, to be associated with lower rates of tumor-involved SLN (10% vs. 36% in controls, P = 0.04), and, at a median follow-up of 88.8 months, to profoundly improve recurrence-free survival (P = 0.008), even for patients with histologically confirmed (i.e., pathologic) stage I-II disease (P = 0.02).Conclusions: Potentially offering durable protection, local low-dose CpG-B administration in early-stage melanoma provides an adjuvant treatment option for a large group of patients currently going untreated despite being at considerable risk for disease recurrence. Once validated in a larger randomized phase III trial, this nontoxic immunopotentiating regimen may prove clinically transformative. (C) 2017 AACR.

TI  - Mapping and Attributing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Trends for Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change affects vegetation cover and processes through multiple pathways. Long time series of surface land surface properties derived from satellite remote sensing give unique abilities to observe these changes, particularly in areas with complex topography and limited research infrastructure. Here, we focus on Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot where vegetation productivity is limited by moisture availability (dominated by a summer monsoon) at lower elevations and by temperature at high elevations. We analyze the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1981 to 2015 semimonthly, at an 8 km spatial resolution. We use a random forest (RF) of regression trees to generate a statistical model of the NDVI as a function of elevation, land use, CO2 level, temperature, and precipitation. We find that the NDVI increased over the studied period, particularly at low and middle elevations and during the fall (post-monsoon). We infer from the fitted RF model that the NDVI linear trend is primarily due to CO2 level (or another environmental parameter that is changing quasi-linearly), and not primarily due to temperature or precipitation trends. On the other hand, interannual fluctuation in the NDVI is more correlated with temperature and precipitation. The RF accurately fits the available data and shows promise for estimating trends and testing hypotheses about their causes.

T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the structure and quality of surveillance activities and to validate outcome detection in the Swiss national surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance program.DESIGN Countrywide survey of SSI surveillance quality.SETTING 147 hospitals or hospital units with surgical activities in Switzerland.METHODS Site visits were conducted with on-site structured interviews and review of a random sample of 15 patient records per hospital: 10 from the entire data set and 5 from a subset of patients with originally reported infection. Process and structure were rated in 9 domains with a weighted overall validation score, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the identification of SSI.RESULTS Of 50 possible points, the median validation score was 35.5 (range, 16.25-48.5). Public hospitals (P<.001), hospitals in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland (P=.021), and hospitals with longer participation in the surveillance (P=.018) had higher scores than others. Domains that contributed most to lower scores were quality of chart review and quality of data extraction. Of 49 infections, 15 (30.6%) had been overlooked in a random sample of 1,110 patient records, accounting for a sensitivity of 69.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6%-81.7%), a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.5%-100%), a positive predictive value of 97.1% (95% CI, 85.1%-99.9%), and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.2%).CONCLUSIONS Irrespective of a well-defined surveillance methodology, there is a wide variation of SSI surveillance quality. The quality of chart review and the accuracy of data collection are the main areas for improvement. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:1172-1181

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - WorldView 3 (WV-3) is the first commercially deployed super-spectral, very high-resolution (HR) satellite. However, the resolution of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands is much lower than that of the other bands. In this letter, we describe four different approaches, which are combinations of pansharpening and hypersharpening methods, to generate HR SWIR images. Since there are no ground truth HR SWIR images, we also propose a new picture quality predictor to assess hypersharpening performance, without the need for reference images. We describe extensive experiments using actual WV-3 images that demonstrate that some approaches can yield better performance than others, as measured by the proposed blind image quality assessment model of hypersharpened SWIR images.

TI  - Classification of Forest Vertical Structure in South Korea from Aerial Orthophoto and Lidar Data Using an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Every vegetation colony has its own vertical structure. Forest vertical structure is considered as an important indicator of a forest's diversity and vitality. The vertical structure of a forest has typically been investigated by field survey, which is the traditional method of forest inventory. However, this method is very time-and cost-consuming due to poor accessibility. Remote sensing data such as satellite imagery, aerial photography, and lidar data can be a viable alternative to the traditional field-based forestry survey. In this study, we classified forest vertical structures from red-green-blue (RGB) aerial orthophotos and lidar data using an artificial neural network (ANN), which is a powerful machine learning technique. The test site was Gongju province in South Korea, which contains single-, double-, and triple-layered forest structures. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the results with field survey data. The overall accuracy achieved was about 70%. It means that the proposed approach can classify the forest vertical structures from the aerial orthophotos and lidar data.

TI  - The American Society of Breast Surgeons and Quality Payment Programs: Ranking, Defining, and Benchmarking More Than 1 Million Patient Quality Measure Encounters
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. To identify and remediate gaps in the quality of surgical care, the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) developed surgeon-specific quality measures (QMs), built a patient registry, and nominated itself to become a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR), thereby linking surgical performance to potential reimbursement and public reporting. This report provides a summary of the program development.Methods. Using a modified Delphi process, more than 100 measures of care quality were ranked. In compliance with CMS rules, selected QMs were specified with inclusion, exclusion, and exception criteria, then incorporated into an electronic patient registry. After surgeons entered QM data into the registry, the ASBrS provided real-time peer performance comparisons.Results. After ranking, 9 of 144 measures of quality were chosen, submitted, and subsequently accepted by CMS as a QCDR in 2014. The measures selected were diagnosis of cancer by needle biopsy, surgical-site infection, mastectomy reoperation rate, and appropriateness of specimen imaging, intraoperative specimen orientation, sentinel node use, hereditary assessment, antibiotic choice, and antibiotic duration. More than 1 million patient-measure encounters were captured from 2010 to 2015. Benchmarking functionality with peer performance comparison was successful. In 2016, the ASBrS provided public transparency on its website for the 2015 performance reported by our surgeon participants.Conclusion In an effort to improve quality of care and to participate in CMS quality payment programs, the ASBrS defined QMs, tracked compliance, provided benchmarking, and reported breast-specific QMs to the public.

TI  - Ship Classification in Moderate-Resolution SAR Image by Naive Geometric Features-Combined Multiple Kernel Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with the high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, a moderate-resolution SAR image can offer wider swath, which is more suitable for maritime ship surveillance. Taking into account the amount of information in a moderate-resolution SAR image and the stability of feature extraction, we propose naive geometric features (NGFs) for ship classification. In contrast to the strictly defined geometric features (SGFs), the extraction of NGFs is very simpler and efficient. And more importantly, the NGFs are enough to reveal the essential difference between different types of ships for classification. To fuse various NGFs with different physical properties and discriminability, the multiple kernel learning (MKL) is utilized to learn the combination weights, rather than assigning the same weight to all features as usually applied by the traditional support vector machines (SVMs). The comprehensive experiments validate that: 1) the performance of the proposed NGF-combined MKL outperforms that of NGF-combined SVM by 3.4% and is very close to that obtained by SGF-combined MKL and 2) in terms of classifying ships in a moderate-resolution SAR image, NGFs are more feasible than scattering features.

TI  - Using Spreadsheets to Simulate an Evolving Population
T2  - AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Biology teachers inevitably struggle with how best to teach evolution. Students arrive in their classrooms with preconceptions, many of which are overwhelmingly skeptical, and science teachers are increasingly being pressured to adhere to an arbitrary degree of objectivity that makes discussing scientific worldviews challenging. These challenges have resulted in evolution being taught largely as a series of explanations for questions arising from observations of the living world. In so doing, students may not have a chance to grapple with the worldview that produced those explanations, or develop a more mechanistic intuition for inheritance and change in the world they see around themselves. Here we put forth all the tools necessary for a class to build a simulation of an evolving population experiencing natural selection from scratch in a Google Docs spreadsheet. Not only will this activity help students experiment with the natural world more mechanistically, but it will also allow them to learn as actual evolutionary biologists do.

TI  - Melting Characteristics of Snow Cover on Tidewater Glaciers in Hornsund Fjord, Svalbard
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Svalbard area, especially its southern section, has been characterised by an exceptionally thin snow cover, which has a significant impact of the annual mass balance of glaciers. The objective of this study was to determine melting processes of the snow cover deposited on 11 glaciers that terminate into Hornsund Fjord during the melting period of 2014. The study included analyses of snow pits and snow cores, meteorological data collected from automatic weather stations and Polish Polar Station Hornsund, and supervised classification of six Landsat 8 images for assessing the progress of snow cover melting. The calculated Snow-Covered Area (SCA) varied from 98% at the beginning of the melting season to 43% at the end of August. The melting vertical gradient on Hansbreen was -0.34 m 100 m(-1), leading to surface melting of -1.4 cm water equivalent (w.e.) day(-1) in the ablation zone (c. 200 m a.s.l. (above sea level)) and -0.7 cm w.e. day(-1) in the accumulation zone (c. 400 m a.s.l.). Furthermore, the study identified several observed features such as low snow depth in the accumulation zone of the Hornsund glaciers, a large proportion of the snow layers (12-27%) produced by rain-on-snow events, and a frequent occurrence of summer thermal inversions (80% annually), indicating that the area is experiencing intensive climate changes.

TI  - On the edge: The use of infrared thermography in monitoring responses of intertidal organisms to heat stress
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring changes in the environment and the corresponding effects on biological systems still represents a major challenge in many marine and terrestrial ecological studies. Infrared thermography (IRT), and its application within the marine environment, represents an effective non-invasive tool for measuring the temperatures of organisms and their surrounding environment in situ. The use of IRT within the intertidal zone is particularly useful since habitat and organismal temperatures are highly variable across both fine spatial and temporal scales. We review the growing number of intertidal studies that utilise IRT to investigate the role of small-scale temperature variability in contributing to various demographic and ecological processes. In particular, we introduce two indicators of the thermal quality of intertidal habitats that can be readily used by ecologists but also management and conservation policy makers to assess the suitability of a given habitat for a range of species under actual and predicted climatic conditions. We also outline a range of potential applications involving IRT that have yet to be explored for monitoring coastal environments. These include combining photogrammetry, unmanned aerial vehicles and IRT to large-scale three-dimensional thermal maps of intertidal habitats. We also suggest ways in which this technology could facilitate environmental management objectives in a warming world, such as the identification and quantification of thermal refugia across various spatial and temporal scales. We affirm with previous studies that such thermal refugia are vital for the adaptation of intertidal communities to climate change and that IRT could facilitate more effective management and conservation of these areas. The IRT applications outlined in this review are by no means exhaustive or limited to rocky intertidal environments. We envision that IRT will become increasingly popular as environmental management agencies become increasingly concerned about global climate change and how to combat its negative consequences on ecosystems.

TI  - OSIRIS-REx: Sample Return from Asteroid (101955) Bennu
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In May of 2011, NASA selected the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid sample return mission as the third mission in the New Frontiers program. The other two New Frontiers missions are New Horizons, which explored Pluto during a flyby in July 2015 and is on its way for a flyby of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019, and Juno, an orbiting mission that is studying the origin, evolution, and internal structure of Jupiter. The spacecraft departed for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu aboard an United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 evolved expendable launch vehicle at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016, on a seven-year journey to return samples from Bennu. The spacecraft is on an outbound-cruise trajectory that will result in a rendezvous with Bennu in November 2018. The science instruments on the spacecraft will survey Bennu to measure its physical, geological, and chemical properties, and the team will use these data to select a site on the surface to collect at least 60 g of asteroid regolith. The team will also analyze the remote-sensing data to perform a detailed study of the sample site for context, assess Bennu's resource potential, refine estimates of its impact probability with Earth, and provide ground-truth data for the extensive astronomical data set collected on this asteroid. The spacecraft will leave Bennu in 2021 and return the sample to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 24, 2023.

TI  - The northernmost tropical rain forest of the Americas: Endangered by agriculture expansion
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper sets out to analyze the changes in vegetation cover and land use in the Huasteca region during the period 1990-2015, to find out its causes, and to create future land use scenarios based on historical trends. The last remnants of the most northerly tropical rain forest in the Americas are found in the region in Mexico known as the Huasteca. The main factors causing changes in land use that threaten biodiversity in the Huasteca are crop and livestock agriculture, making this region a conservation priority for the Mexican government. Historically, the region has long been subject to transformation by human activity, from Spanish colonization to development by the oil industry in the mid-twentieth century. Images from the SPOT and Landsat satellite, and the Dinamica EGO program were used. During the twenty-five-year period examined, 87,173 ha of tropical rain forest, 4709 ha of cloud forest and 388 hectares of Oak forest were lost. Projections for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 show potential increases in agricultural land use at the expense of natural vegetation. By 2050, 155,856 ha of tropical rain forest and 7208 ha of cloud forest could be lost if current government agricultural policies and social trends continue. An analysis of changes in land use is fundamental for devising actions leading to the implementation of policies for both sustainable agricultural production and improving the living conditions of residents, as well as conservation of tropical rain forests in the Huasteca.

TI  - Polarized radiative transfer through terrestrial atmosphere accounting for rotational Raman scattering
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is devoted to the phenomenological derivation of the vector radiative transfer equation (VRTE) accounting for first-order source terms of rotational Raman scattering (RRS), which is responsible for the in-filling of Fraunhofer and telluric lines by inelastic scattered photons. The implementation of the solution of the VRTE within the framework of the forward-adjoint method is given. For the Ca II and the oxygen A-band (02 A) spectral windows, values of reflectance, degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and in-filling, in zenith and nadir geometry, are compared with results given in literature. Moreover, the dependence of these quantities on the columnar loading and vertical layering of non-spherical dust aerosols is investigated, together with their changes as function of two habits of ice crystals, modeled as regular icosahedra and severely rough aggregated columns. Bi-directional effects of an underlying polarizing surface are accounted for. The forward simulations are performed for one selected wavelength in the continuum and one in the strong absorption of the 02 A, as their combination can be exploited for the spaceborne retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties. For this reason, we also mimic seasonal maps of reflectance, DOLP and in-filling, that are prototypical measurements of the Ultraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared (UVN) sensor, at a nominal spectral resolution of 0.12 nm. UVN is the core payload of the upcoming European Sentinel-4 mission, that will observe Europe in geostationary orbit for air quality monitoring purposes. In general, in the core of 02 A, depending on the optical thickness and altitude of the scatterers, we find RRS-induced in-filling values ranging from 1.3% to 1.8%, while DOLP decreases by 1%. Conversely, while negligible differences of RRS in-filling are calculated with different ice crystal habits, the severely rough aggregated column model can reduce DOLP by a factor up to 10%. The UVN maps of in-filling show values varying between 1% and 8%. These changes are mainly driven by surface type and seasonal observational geometry. However, accounting for RRS, differences in DOLP do not exceed 0.2% within the full instrumental field-of-view. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection and analysis of coastline and islet area through image processing show that the average errors of coastline mapping and islet area estimation derived from SPOT imagery are around 5% while the errors of ten islets are around 10%. There are three case studies through imagery analysis on SPOT 5: short wave infrared (SWIR) imagery, SPOT 1 multi spectral (abbreviated as XS) and near infrared (NIR). The results from these studies indicate that using SWIR imagery for coastline mapping and islet area estimation is better than using the XS or the NIR. In addition to processing updated information quickly, remote sensing of land resources can also control and manage land resources effectively. Also, the results of this study highlight the traffic of reefs and encourages safe navigation through them. It can also spark new topics of research into marine ecology, marine environment, and fishery.

TI  - Integrating Multilayer Features of Convolutional Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scene classification from remote sensing images provides new possibilities for potential application of high spatial resolution imagery. How to efficiently implement scene recognition from high spatial resolution imagery remains a significant challenge in the remote sensing domain. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have attracted tremendous attention because of their excellent performance in different fields. However, most works focus on fully training a new deep CNN model for the target problems without considering the limited data and time-consuming issues. To alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks, some works have attempted to use the pretrained CNN models as feature extractors to build a feature representation of scene images for classification and achieved successful applications including remote sensing scene classification. However, existing works pay little attention to exploring the benefits of multilayer features for improving the scene classification in different aspects. As a matter of fact, the information hidden in different layers has great potential for improving feature discrimination capacity. Therefore, this paper presents a fusion strategy for integrating multilayer features of a pretrained CNN model for scene classification. Specifically, the pretrained CNN model is used as a feature extractor to extract deep features of different convolutional and fully connected layers; then, a multiscale improved Fisher kernel coding method is proposed to build a mid-level feature representation of convolutional deep features. Finally, the mid-level features extracted from convolutional layers and the features of fully connected layers are fused by a principal component analysis/ spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis method for classification. For validation and comparison purposes, the proposed approach is evaluated via experiments with two challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets, and shows the competitive performance compared with fully trained CNN models, fine-tuning CNN models, and other related works.

TI  - Dynamic of Dalinor Lakes in the Inner Mongolian Plateau and Its Driving Factors during 1976-2015
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and increasing human activities have induced lake expansion or shrinkage, posing a serious threat to the ecological security on the Inner Mongolian Plateau, China. However, the pattern of lake changes and how it responds to climate change and revegetation have rarely been reported. We investigated the pattern of lake-area changes in the Dalinor National Nature Reserve (DNR) using Landsat imagery during 1976-2015, and examined its relationship with changes in climate and vegetation factors. The total lake-area in the DNR has decreased by 11.6% from 1976 to 2015 with a rate of -0.55 km(2) year(-1). The largest Dalinor Lake reduced the most (by 32.7 km(2)) with a rate of -0.79 km(2) year(-1). The air temperature has increased significantly since 1976, with a rate of 0.03 degrees C year(-1) (p < 0.05), while the precipitation slightly decreased during 1976-2015, with a rate of -0.86 mm year(-1). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) increased by 27.7% from 1976 to 2015, especially after 2001 when vegetation has been promoted greatly as a result of the successful ecological protection and restoration in the Dalinor basin. The decrease in lake-areas for the DNR exhibited a negative correlation with NDVI (r = -0.397, p < 0.05) during 1976-2015. It seems that decreasing precipitation drives the reduction in lake-area, while rising temperature and vegetation greenness accelerated this decreasing trend by increasing evapotranspiration. The continuous lake shrinkage increases the ecological risks to the habitat of birds, causing a challenge to the management in the DNR.

TI  - Estimation of Melt Pond Fractions on First Year Sea Ice Using Compact Polarization SAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds are a common feature on Arctic sea ice. They are linked to the sea ice surface albedo and transmittance of energy to the ocean from the atmosphere and thus constitute an important process to parameterize in Arctic climate models and simulations. This paper presents a first attempt to retrieve the melt pond fraction from hybrid-polarized compact polarization (CP) SAR imagery, which has wider swath and shorter revisit time than the quad-polarization systems, e.g., from RADARSAT-2 (RS-2). The co-polarization (co-pol) ratio has been verified to provide estimates of melt pond fractions. However, it is a challenge to link CP parameters and the co-pol ratio. The theoretical possibility is presented, for making this linkage with the CP parameter C-22/C-11 (the ratio between the elements of the coherence matrix of CP SAR) for melt pond detection and monitoring with the tilted-Bragg scattering model for the ocean surface. The empirical transformed formulation, denoted as the compact polarization and quad-pol (CPQP) model, is proposed, based on 2062 RS-2 quad-pol SAR images, collocated with in situ measurements. We compared the retrieved melt pond fraction with CP parameters simulated from quad-pol SAR data with results retrieved from the co-pol ratio from quad-pol SAR observations acquired during the Arctic-Ice (Arctic-Ice Covered Ecosystem in a Rapidly Changing Environment) field project. The results are shown to be comparable for observed melt pond measurements in spatial and temporal distributions. Thus, the utility of CP mode SAR for melt pond fraction estimation on first year level ice is presented.

TI  - Spatial Technology and Social Media in Remote Sensing: A Survey
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of social media data and the associated growth in volume, velocity, and variety has fostered the idea of using these data to guide traditional remote sensing image retrieval and information extraction tasks. Although important progress has been made in recent years in harvesting spatial and temporal data from social media, the exploitation of these data for decision making still needs further investigation, particularly in the context of its integration with remote sensing and geographic information systems. In this paper, we first discuss the relation between localization techniques and spatial technologies, pointing out their similarities and differences. Then, we provide a discussion on location analysis of social media data, and the fusion of multiple data sources, with specific attention to the integration of social media content (including localization) with remote sensing-based spatial technologies. Next, we provide specific examples addressing the use of social media data to perform information extraction from large remote sensing data repositories. Although significant possibilities for the integration of localization and spatial technologies can be seen in the examples provided, our survey suggests that the convergence of remote sensing and social media data will continue to deeply transform these technologies.

TI  - Social Media: New Perspectives to Improve Remote Sensing for Emergency Response
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a powerful technology for Earth observation (EO), and it plays an essential role in many applications, including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, resource managing, urban characterization, disaster and emergency response, etc. However, due to limitations in the spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution of EO sensors, there are many situations in which remote sensing data cannot be fully exploited, particularly in the context of emergency response (i.e., applications in which real/near-real-time response is needed). Recently, with the rapid development and availability of social media data, new opportunities have become available to complement and fill the gaps in remote sensing data for emergency response. In this paper, we provide an overview on the integration of social media and remote sensing in time-critical applications. First, we revisit the most recent advances in the integration of social media and remote sensing data. Then, we describe several practical case studies and examples addressing the use of social media data to improve remote sensing data and/or techniques for emergency response.

TI  - Testing random forest classification for identifying lava flows and mapping age groups on a single Landsat 8 image
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping lava flows using satellite images is an important application of remote sensing in volcanology. Several volcanoes have been mapped through remote sensing using a wide range of data, from optical to thermal infrared and radar images, using techniques such as manual mapping, supervised/unsupervised classification, and elevation subtraction. So far, spectral-based mapping applications mainly focus on the use of traditional pixel-based classifiers, without much investigation into the added value of object-based approaches and into advantages of using machine learning algorithms. In this study, Nyamuragira, characterized by a series of >20 overlapping lava flows erupted over the last century, was used as a case study. The random forest classifier was tested to map lava flows based on pixels and objects. Image classification was conducted for the 20 individual flows and for 8 groups of flows of similar age using a Landsat 8 image and a DEM of the volcano, both at 30-meter spatial resolution. Results show that object-based classification produces maps with continuous and homogeneous lava surfaces, in agreement with the physical characteristics of lava flows, while lava flows mapped through the pixel-based classification are heterogeneous and fragmented including much "salt and pepper noise". In terms of accuracy, both pixel-based and object-based classification performs well but the former results in higher accuracies than the latter except for mapping lava flow age groups without using topographic features. It is concluded that despite spectral similarity, lava flows of contrasting age can be well discriminated and mapped by means of image classification. The classification approach demonstrated in this study only requires easily accessible image data and can be applied to other volcanoes as well if there is sufficient information to calibrate the mapping.

TI  - An Emergency Georeferencing Framework for GF-4 Imagery Based on GCP Prediction and Dynamic RPC Refinement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-4 (GF-4) imagery has very potential in terms of emergency response due to its gazing mode. However, only poor geometric accuracy can be obtained using the rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) parameters provided, making ground control points (GCPs) necessary for emergency response. However, selecting GCPs is traditionally time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not fully reliable. This is mainly due to the facts that (1) manual GCP selection is time-consuming and cumbersome because of too many human interventions, especially for the first few GCPs; (2) typically, GF-4 gives planar array imagery acquired at rather large tilt angles, and the distortion introduces problems in image matching; (3) reference data will not always be available, especially under emergency circumstances. This paper provides a novel emergency georeferencing framework for GF-4 Level 1 imagery. The key feature is GCP prediction based on dynamic RPC refinement, which is able to predict even the first GCP and the prediction will be dynamically refined as the selection goes on. This is done by two techniques: (1) GCP prediction using RPC parameters and (2) dynamic RPC refinement using as few as only one GCP. Besides, online map services are also adopted to automatically provide reference data. Experimental results show that (1) GCP predictions improve using dynamic RPC refinement; (2) GCP selection becomes more efficient with GCP prediction; (3) the integration of online map services constitutes a good example for emergency response.

TI  - PREDICTION OF CUTTING FORCE DURING GYPSUM FIBER COMPOSITE MILLING PROCESS USING RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY
T2  - WOOD AND FIBER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gypsum fiber composite (GFC) is a kind of building material widely used in interior decoration. Milling is the most commonly used machining process for GFC. Cutting force as an important cutting characteristic parameter has significant influence on the quality of machined surface, power consumption, and tools wear. The tangential force (Fx) and normal force (Fy) were measured and analyzed to find out the effects of milling parameters on these cutting forces. Milling parameters considered were spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. The response surface methodology (RSM) was selected to develop mathematical models and optimize milling parameters. The results showed that with the increase of feed rate and depth of cut, the Fx and Fy increased. But the cutting forces decreased with the increase of spindle speed. The optimization results indicated that high spindle speed, low feed rate, and small depth of cut are preferable for milling of GFC to obtain the best result.

TI  - Refined early-warning of tea frost disaster: A case study in Songyang county of Zhejiang.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Frost is one of the major climate disasters in tea production, affecting sustainable development of tea production. Based on the meteorological data of 70 basic weather stations in Zhejiang Province and 25 regional automatic stations in Songyang County, as well as Optimized Consensus Forecast fine grid numerical prediction products and 30-m resolution DEM data, a minimum air temperature model was established by GIS and mixed interpolation method. Taking daily minimum air temperature as tea frost damage warning index, combined with the map of tea plantation extracted from fine. resolution ZY-3 satellite remote sensing data, a refined early-warning method of tea frost disaster was studied. Results showed that the daily minimum air temperature model was of high accuracy with an absolute error of 0.35 degrees C and a relative error of 2.83%. The frost damage warning effectiveness was 8 days in advance and the spatial resolution was 30 mx30 m. Taking the tea frost disaster warning on March 15, 2017 as an example, the pre-estimated area of affected tea plantation was 2340.0 ha, accounting for 30.6% of the total tea area in the county. The mildly, moderately and severely affected areas were 1939.4, 367.2 and 34.9 hm(2), which accounted for 25.35%, 4.08% and 0.46% of the county's total tea area, respectively. The estimation was consistent with the field investigation.

TI  - Parallel Multiclass Support Vector Machine for Remote Sensing Data Classification on Multicore and Many-Core Architectures
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification method that has been widely used in the domain of remote sensing for decades. Although SVM-based classification method achieves good performance for classification accuracy in many studies, it can become very time-consuming in some remote sensing applications such as hyperspectral image classification or large-scale land cover mapping. To improve the efficiency for SVM training and classification in remote sensing applications, we designed and implemented a highly efficient multiclass support vector machine (MMSVM) for x 86-based multicore and many-core architectures such as the Ivy Bridge CPUs and the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor (MIC) based on our previous MIC-SVM library. Various analysis methods and optimization strategies are employed to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism of our studied architectures. We select several real-world remote sensing datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed MMSVM. Compared with the widely used serial LIBSVM, our MMSVM achieves 6.3-31.1 x (in training) and 4.9-32.2 x(in classification) speedups on MIC, and 6.9-14.9x (in training) and 5.5-22.1x (in classification) speedups on the Ivy Bridge CPUs. We also conduct a performance comparison analysis on different platforms and provide some ideas on how to select the most suitable architecture for specific re-mote sensing classification problems in order to achieve the best performance.

TI  - Combining hectometric and decametric satellite observations to provide near real time decametric FAPAR product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide range of ecological, agricultural, hydrological and meteorological applications at local to regional scales requires decametric biophysical data. However, before the launch of SENTINEL-2A, only few decametric products are produced and most of them remain limited by the small number of available observations, mostly due to a moderate revisit frequency combined with cloud occurrence. Conversely, kilometric and hectometric biophysical products are now widely available with almost complete and continuous coverage, but the associated spatial resolution limits the application over heterogeneous landscapes. The objective of this study is to combine unfrequent decametric spatial resolution products with frequent hectometric spatial resolution products to improve the temporal frequency and completeness of decametric observations. The study focuses on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation (FAPAR) because of its important role in canopy models and small dependency to scaling issues.An algorithm is developed to provide near real time estimates of FAPAR called DHF (for Decametric Hectometric Fusion) at a decametric resolution and dekadal time step. It is assumed that the FAPAR time course is described by a second-degree polynomial function over a limited 60-days temporal window for each decametric pixel. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, landcover classes are considered instead of each individual pixel. For each class, the coefficients of the polynomial function are adjusted using the temporal course of the available decametric FAPAR products, under the constraint of providing a good match with the time course of the hectometric dekadal FAPAR products. The point spread function associated to the hectometric FAPAR products and the possible biases between the decametric and hectometric FAPAR products are explicitly accounted for.The algorithm was evaluated over a time series of decametric Landsat-8 FAPAR images (30 m) and hectometric (330 m) dekadal GEOV3 FAPAR derived from PROBA-V images acquired in 2014 over a site in the South-West of France.Results show that the estimated DHF FAPAR products capture well the expected seasonal variation and spatial distribution while improving the temporal frequency and spatial and temporal completeness of the original Landsat-8 products. A leave one out exercise shows that the DHF values are in very good agreement with the Landsat-8 FAPAR (RMSE = 0.05-0.14) that were not used when computing the DHF. This demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm and interest under cloudy regions. Additional comparison with ground measurements collected over 14 sunflower fields along the growth season confirms the good performances of the DHF FAPAR products (RMSE = 0.11).

TI  - Meta-analysis of the efficacy of moxifloxacin in treating <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> infection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mycoplasma genitalium is an important pathogen that is transmitted through sexual contact. For patients diagnosed with M. genitalium infection, the current guidelines recommend 1 g of azithromycin as the first-line treatment. Moxifloxacin is used as a second-line drug due to its remarkable efficacy; however, increased use of moxifloxacin to treat M. genitalium infections has caused the emergence of cases of moxifloxacin treatment failure. This meta-analysis aims to estimate the treatment efficacy of moxifloxacin for M. genitalium infection. Electronic databases were searched for articles published from 1983 to the end of May 2016 using the following search terms: (Mycoplasma genitalium) AND (moxifloxacin OR 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo(4.3.0) non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acid OR Proflox OR moxifloxacin hydrochloride OR Octegra OR Avelox OR Avalox OR Izilox OR Actira OR [treatment efficacy]). All included studies were published in English; all participants were diagnosed with M. genitalium infection, and microbial cure times were measured within 12 months after treatment. Treatment efficacy was measured as microbial cure at the final follow-up after treatment. In total, 17 studies including 252 participants met the inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies were observational. The random-effects pooled microbial cure rate was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90%-99%; I-2 = 28.59%, P = 0.13). For studies with sample collection deadlines prior to 2010, the pooled microbial cure rate was 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I-2 = 0.00%, P = 1.00). For studies with sample collection deadlines of 2010 and later, the pooled microbial cure rate was 89% (95% CI, 82%-94%; I-2 = 0.00%, P = 0.59). The elimination rate of moxifloxacin for M. genitalium infection has decreased from 100% to 89% since 2010. This decline merits considerable attention. We suggest close follow-up to investigate the efficacy of moxifloxacin for treating M. genitalium infections. Additionally, sentinel points should be established to detect mutations in the gyrA/B and parC/E genes, which are associated with moxifloxacin resistance.

TI  - Application of Landsat Imagery to Investigate Lake Area Variations and Relict Gull Habitat in Hongjian Lake, Ordos Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in arid and semi-arid regions have an irreplaceable and important role in the local environment and wildlife habitat protection. Relict Gull (Larus relictus), which is listed as a "vulnerable" bird species in the IUCN Red List, uses only islands in lakes for habitat. The habitat with the largest colonies in Hongjian Lake (HL), which is located in Shaanxi Province in China, has been severely threatened by persistent lake shrinkage, yet the variations in the area of the lake and the islands are poorly understood due to a lack of in situ observations. In this study, using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, 336 Landsat remote sensing images from 1988-2015 were used to extract the monthly HL water area and lake island area, and the driving factors were investigated by correlation analysis. The results show that the lake area during 1988-2015 exhibited large fluctuations and an overall downward trend of -0.94 km(2)/year, and that the lake area ranged from 55.02 km(2) in 1997 to 30.90 km(2) in 2015. The cumulative anomaly analysis diagnosed the lake variations as two sub-periods with different characteristics and leading driving factors. The average and change trend were 52.88 and 0.21 km(2)/year during 1988-1998 and 38.85 and -1.04 km(2)/year during 1999-2015, respectively. During 1988-1998, the relatively high precipitation, low evapotranspiration, and low levels of human activity resulted in a weak increase in the area of HL. However, in 1999-2015, the more severe human activity as well as climate warming resulted in a fast decrease in the area of HL. The variations in lake island area were dependent on the area of HL, which ranged from 0.02 km(2) to 0.22 km(2). As the lake size declined, the islands successively outcropped in the form of the four island zones, and the two zones located in Northwest and South of HL were the most important habitats for Relict Gull. The formation of these island zones can provide enough space for Relict Gull breeding.

TI  - A Conversion Method to Determine the Regional Vegetation Cover Factor from Standard Plots Based on Large Sample Theory and TM Images: A Case Study in the Eastern Farming-Pasture Ecotone of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The key to simulating soil erosion is to calculate the vegetation cover (C) factor. Methods that apply remote sensing to calculate the C factor at a regional scale cannot directly use the C factor formula. That is because the C factor formula is obtained by experiments, and needs the coverage ratio data of croplands, woodlands, and grasslands at a standard plot scale. In this paper, we present a C factor conversion method from a standard plot to a km-sized grid based on large sample theory and multi-scale remote sensing. The results show that: (1) Compared with the existing C factor formula, our method is based on the coverage ratio of croplands, woodlands, and grasslands on a km-sized grid, and takes the C factor formula obtained from the standard plot experiment and applies it to a regional scale. This method improves the applicability of the C factor formula, and can satisfy the need to simulate soil erosion in large areas; (2) The vegetation coverage obtained by remote sensing interpretation is significantly consistent (paired samples t-test, t = -0.03, df = 0.12, 2-tail significance p < 0.05) and significantly correlated with the measured vegetation coverage; (3) The C factor of the study area is smaller in the middle, southern, and northern regions, and larger in the eastern and western regions. The main reason for that is the distribution of woodlands, the Hunshandake and Horqin sandy lands, and the valleys affected by human activities; (4) The method presented in this paper is more meticulous than the C factor method based on the vegetation index, improves the applicability of the C factor formula, and can be used to simulate soil erosion on a large scale and provide strong support for regional soil and water conservation planning.

TI  - Radiance Preprocessing for Assimilation in the Hourly Updating Rapid Refresh Mesoscale Model: A Study Using AIRS Data
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the initial application of radiance bias correction and channel selection in the hourly updated Rapid Refresh model. For this initial application, data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are used; this dataset gives atmospheric temperature and water vapor information at higher vertical resolution and accuracy than previously launched low-spectral resolution satellite systems. In this preliminary study, data from AIRS are shown to add skill to short-range weather forecasts over a relatively data-rich area. Two 1-month retrospective runs were conducted to evaluate the impact of assimilating clear-sky AIRS radiance data on 1-12-h forecasts using a research version of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Rapid Refresh (RAP) regional mesoscale model already assimilating conventional and other radiance [AMSU-A, Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS), HIRS-4] data. Prior to performing the assimilation, a channel selection and bias-correction spinup procedure was conducted that was appropriate for the RAP configuration. RAP forecasts initialized from analyses with and without AIRS data were verified against radiosonde, surface atmosphere, precipitation, and satellite radiance observations. Results show that the impact from AIRS radiance data on short-range forecast skill in the RAP system is small but positive and statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. The RAP-specific channel selection and bias correction procedures described in this study were the basis for similar applications to other radiance datasets now assimilated in version 3 of RAP implemented at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in August 2016.

TI  - Hydro-dam - A nature-based solution or an ecological problem: The fate of the Tonle Sap Lake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent proliferation of hydro-dams was one of the nature-based solutions to meet the increasing demand for energy and food in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB). While construction of these hydro-dams generated some hydropower and facilitated expansion of irrigated lands, it also significantly altered the basin-wide hydrology and subsequently impacted wetland ecosystems. Unintended adverse consequences of ecosystem services from lakes and wetlands offset the intended gains in hydroelectricity and irrigated agriculture. The trade-offs between gains in energy and food production and losses in aquatic ecosystem services were perceived to be significant but knowledge of the magnitude, spatial extent, and type of ecosystem services change is lacking and, therefore, the question whether the hydro-dam is an optimized solution or a potential ecological problem remains unanswered. In this study, as the first step to answer this question and using the Tonle Sap Lake as an example, we quantified one of the impacts of hydro-dams on lake ecosystem's phenology in terms of open water area, a critical ecological characteristic that affects lake systems' fish production, biodiversity, and livelihoods of the local communities. We used the MODIS-NDVI time series, forecast function and the Mann-Kendall trend test method to first quantify the open water area, analyzed its changes over time, and then performed correlation analysis with climate variables to disentangle dam impacts. The results showed reduced hydro-periods, diminishing lake seasonality and a declining trend in Tonle Sap Lake open water area over the past 15 years. These changes were insignificantly related to climatic influence during the same period. It is concluded that basin-wide hydro-dam construction and associated agricultural irrigation were deemed to be the primary cause of these ecological changes. Further analyses of changes in the lake's ecosystem services, including provision and cultural services, need to be carried out in order to have a holistic understanding of the trade-offs brought by the hydro dam proliferation as a solution to the emerging energy and food demand in the LMRB.

TI  - Assimilation of canopy cover and biomass measurements in the crop model AquaCrop
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements indicative of crop development, such as leaf area index, canopy cover or biomass are typically performed only a few times throughout the season at irregular time intervals. Furthermore, due to the inherent spatial variability that exists in the field, combining measurements taken at different locations in the field usually leads to large uncertainty around the mean value. These factors, together with the fact that crop-soil models are strongly non-linear, render assimilation of measurements in crop-soil models non-trivial. This work presents procedures for performing such data assimilation, using the crop model AquaCrop as specific example. The procedures are based on Extended Kalman Filter, with some heuristic adjustments, and enable re-initialisation of state variables and/or adjustments of selected parameters of the model. The uncertainties of the measurements are taken into account explicitly in the proposed assimilation scheme. The procedures were tested with data obtained from experiments conducted with potato in Denmark and cotton in Greece. In both cases the data available consisted of canopy cover and biomass (average and standard deviation on 5-10 days), and a locally calibrated AquaCrop model was used as starting point for the assimilation process. The results demonstrate the soundness of the approach but also emphasise the inherent limitations associated with data assimilation. In particular, assimilation of easy-to-obtain canopy cover measurements did not always improve the predictions of biomass. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Localized scleroderma: clinical and epidemiological features with emphasis on adulthood- versus childhood-onset disease differences
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundLocalized scleroderma is a rare inflammatory skin disorder that affects the skin and sometimes underlying subcutaneous tissue, muscles or bones. The disease has two modes of onset: juvenile- (JLS) and adult-onset (aLoS). Clinical features have impact on diagnostic and treatment recommendations, but no consensus on the disease management depending on the age at diagnosis was given.ObjectiveTo identify these features which differentiate aLoS from JLS.MethodsA review of the literature was carried out using the MEDLINE to identify studies assessing demographics, subtype distribution, extracutaneous manifestations, comorbidities, delay at diagnosis and outcome in JLS and aLoS. Non-English articles, reviews, case reports, treatment trials that did not investigate long-term outcomes and studies with the fused data for children and adults were excluded. The analysed papers were published between June 1986 and December 2016.ResultsFifty-five studies describing JLS or/and aLoS were included for analysis. Female: male ratio in aLoS was higher than in JLS. Adults presented with plaque and generalized subtype more often than paediatric patients. Linear subtype, musculoskeletal, neurologic and ophthalmologic involvement were more frequent, among children. aLoS was likely to be associated with increased prevalence of lichen sclerosus. There was significant delay in diagnosis in both groups of patients. Recurrences of disease were independent of its onset mode. aLoS patients had more poor quality of life scores than did JLS patients. As only a few studies or no studies assessing specified disease subtypes were identified, this limited the ability to compare the adult and paediatric patients with these subtypes.ConclusionDespite more favourable course of aLoS, a thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of domains related to physical, mental, emotional and social functioning of patients seems to be important to the proper management of disease. LoS heterogeneity makes it important to develop universal classification criteria.

TI  - Computing Coastal Ocean Surface Currents from MODIS and VIIRS Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the potential of computing coastal ocean surface currents from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite imagery using the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method. To improve on past versions of this method, we evaluate combining MODIS and VIIRS thermal infrared (IR) and ocean color (OC) imagery to map the coastal surface currents and discuss the benefits of this combination of sensors and optical channels. By combining these two sensors, the total number of vectors increases by 58.3%. In addition, we also make use of the different surface patterns of IR and OC imagery to improve the tracking performance of the MCC method. By merging the MCC velocity fields inferred from IR and OC products, the spatial coverage of each individual MCC field is increased by 65.8% relative to the vectors derived from OC images. The root mean square (RMS) error of the merged currents is 18 cm . s(-1) compared with coincident HF radar surface currents. A 5-year long time serious of merged MCC computed currents was used to investigate the current structure of the California Current (CC). Weekly, seasonal, and 5-year mean flows provide a unique space-time picture of the oceanographic variability of the CC.

TI  - Monitoring recent changes in snow cover in Central Asia using improved MODIS snow-cover products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in the fields of climatology and cryospheric science. Remotely-sensed data have been proven to be effective in monitoring snow covers. Improved methods to process the 8-day snow-cover products derived from MODIS Terra/Aqua data can dramatically increase the data quality and reduce noise. A five-step algorithm for removing cloud effects was designed to improve the quality of MODIS snow products, and the overall accuracy of the MODIS snow data without cloud (defined as cloud-free snow-cover dataset) was enhanced by more than 90% based on direct and indirect validation methods. The snow-cover frequency (SCF) and snow-cover rate (SCR) of Central Asia were analyzed from 2000 to 2015 using trend analysis and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). Over the plain regions, the SCF displayed a significant north-south declining trend with a rate of 0.03 per degree of latitude, and the SCR showed a similar north-south gradient. In the mountainous areas, the SCF significantly increased with altitude by 0.12 per kilometer. Within the study area, the SCF in 65% of the study area experienced an increasing trend, but only 4.3% of the SCF-increasing pixels passed a significance test. The remaining 35% of the area underwent a decreasing trend of SCF, but only 5.2% of the SCF-decreasing pixels passed a significance test. For the entire Central Asia, the inter-annual variations of snow-cover presented a slight and insignificant increase trend from 2000 to 2015. However, the change trends of snow cover are different between the plain and mountainous regions. That is, the annual mean SCR in the plain areas displayed an increasing trend, but a decreasing trend was found in the mountainous areas.

TI  - Mapping urban tree species using integrated airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping tree species within urban areas is essential for sustainable urban planning as well as to improve our understanding of the role of urban vegetation as an ecological service. Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m(2)) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. LiDAR-derived crown structural information was combined with hyper spectral-derived spectral vegetation indices for species classification. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively. The overall accuracy for the two most important and iconic native coniferous species improved markedly from 78.3% up to 91% using the combined data. The results of this research highlight that (1) the combination of structural and spectral information provided an improved classification accuracy than when used separately, and variables derived from LiDAR data contributed more to the accurate prediction of species than hyperspectral features; (2) higher classification accuracies were observed for evergreen species, species with distinguishable crown structure, and species undergoing flowering; (3) and finally the anthocyanin content index and photochemical reflectance index were the most important hyperspectral features for the discrimination of tree species in the spring bud burst stage.

TI  - An Extended ADOP for Performance Evaluation of Single-Frequency Single-Epoch Positioning by BDS/GPS in Asia-Pacific Region
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-Frequency Single-Epoch (SFSE) high-precision positioning has always been the hot spot of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and ambiguity dilution of precision (ADOP) is a well-known scalar measure for success rate of ambiguity resolution. Traditional ADOP expression is complicated, thus the SFSE extended ADOP (E-ADOP), with the newly defined Summation-Multiplication Ratio of Weight (SMRW) and two theorems for short baseline, was developed. This simplifies the ADOP expression; gives a clearer insight into the influences of SMRW and number of satellites on E-ADOP; and makes theoretical analysis of E-ADOP more convenient than that of ADOP, and through that the E-ADOP value can be predicted more accurately than through the ADOP expression for ADOP value. E-ADOP reveals that number of satellites and SMRW or high-elevation satellite are important for ADOP and, through E-ADOP, we studied which factor is dominant to control ADOP in different conditions and make ADOP different between BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and BDS/GPS. Based on experimental results of SFSE positioning with different baselines, some conclusions are made: (1) ADOP decreases when new satellites are added mainly because the number of satellites becomes larger; (2) when the number of satellites is constant, ADOP is mainly affected by SMRW; (3) in contrast to systems where the satellites with low-elevation are the majority or where low- and high-elevation satellites are equally distributed, in systems where the high-elevation satellites are the majority, the SMRW mainly makes ADOP smaller, even if there are fewer satellites than in the two previous cases, and the difference in numbers of satellites can be expanded as the proportion of high-elevation satellites becomes larger; and (4) ADOP of BDS is smaller than ADOP of GPS mainly because of its SMRW.

TI  - Predicting Forest Evapotranspiration by Coupling Carbon and Water Cycling Based on a Critical Stomatal Conductance Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying forest evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding of climatic response of forest carbon and water cycling. However, there are still large uncertainties in forest ET predictions, especially in plant transpiration (PT). The poor estimations of forestETand PT are largely attributed to the neglect of wet canopy evaporation and uncertainties in the stomatal conductance. Thus, by coupling a revised Ball-Woodrow-Berry (BWB) model, a precipitation intercepted algorithm and the gross primary production (GPP) model to Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) model, this study introduced a modified SW (SWm) model. The performances of this model were subsequently tested in three different forest sites with long-term observed records. Compared with previous models, SWm had a canopy stomatal scheme with stronger ecological significance and simpler GPP estimation scheme. Our analyses reveal the following. 1) SWm evidently improves the agreements between estimated and measured ET compared to original SW (R-2 increasing by 0.19-0.68). SWm could more accurately partition PT and evaporation, when compared with an earlier BWB-based SW (R-2 increasing by similar to 0.03). This finding also supports the use of Lohammer function in semiempirical model of stomatal conductance. 2) Accurate predictions of GPP are helpful for improving ET estimations in SWm (r = 0.73, p < 0.01), suggesting that carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked. 3) In addition to GPP, leaf area index evidently affects the performances of estimated ET in SWm. These results suggest that critically coupling carbon and water cycling are very important for improving forest ET prediction.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of Land Surface Temperature Derived From FengYun Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FengYun-2F (FY-2F) geostationary satellite land surface temperature (LST) and its diurnal variation are important when evaluating climate change, the land-atmosphere energy budget, and the hydrological cycle. However, the presence of clouds generates numerous meaningless pixels that constrain the potential application of the available satellite LST products. These pixels covered by cloud are assigned -2, and otherwise are the LST values, based on the result of a double-channel threshold cloud detection algorithm. This paper proposes a combined temporal and spatial information reconstruction method for the missing FY-2F LST data reconstruction with a good spatial continuity, where cloud detection has already been undertaken. Compared with the methods used in the past, the main characteristics of the proposed method are: 1) the consideration of a free parameter delta T when modeling the diurnal temperature cycle curve; 2) the introduction of the genetic algorithm for solving the parameters; 3) the adoption of the spectral multimanifold clustering algorithm for clustering the multitemporal geostationary satellite LST data; and 4) the accurate and efficient combined temporal and spatial reconstruction method. The proposed combined temporal and spatial reconstruction method was tested and quantitatively assessed with both simulated and real data experiments, using the FY-2F LST products. The results indicate that the combined reconstruction method is accurate to within about 2 degrees C, which can significantly improve the practical value of FY-2F LST datasets.

TI  - Single-center experience of antifungal prophylaxis for coccidioidomycosis in heart transplant recipients within an endemic area
T2  - TRANSPLANT INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - In endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis causes substantial morbidity and mortality for patients receiving solid organ transplants. We aimed to demonstrate the effect of antifungal coccidioidal prophylaxis in heart transplant (HT) recipients. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic health records of all patients who received HTs between October 19, 2005, and December 13, 2014. We collected information regarding antifungal regimens and determined whether patients subsequently developed infections. Our 174-person cohort all received antifungal prophylaxis for at least 6 months (mean follow-up, 53.8 months). One proven and one probable coccidioidal infection (each, 0.6%) occurred during the study period. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis was 0.6% at 1 year and 2.3% at 5 years. No cases of proven coccidioidomycosis occurred within 2 years after transplantation. No patients developed disseminated disease, and no sentinel events were attributed to coccidioidomycosis. Both fluconazole and voriconazole were well tolerated. In the absence of intolerance or contraindication, we suggest continuing a universal antifungal prophylactic regimen with fluconazole for at least 6-12 months in HT recipients residing in a coccidioidomycosis-endemic area.

TI  - Spectro-Temporal Heterogeneity Measures from Dense High Spatial Resolution Satellite Image Time Series: Application to Grassland Species Diversity Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands represent a significant source of biodiversity that is important to monitor over large extents. The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) assumes that the Spectral Heterogeneity (SH) measured from remote sensing data can be used as a proxy for species diversity. Here, we argue the hypothesis that the grassland's species differ in their phenology and, hence, that the temporal variations can be used in addition to the spectral variations. The purpose of this study is to attempt verifying the SVH in grasslands using the temporal information provided by dense Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) with a high spatial resolution. Our method to assess the spectro-temporal heterogeneity is based on a clustering of grasslands using a robust technique for high dimensional data. We propose new SH measures derived from this clustering and computed at the grassland level. We compare them to the Mean Distance to Centroid (MDC). The method is experimented on 192 grasslands from southwest France using an intra-annual multispectral SPOT5 SITS comprising 18 images and using single images from this SITS. The combination of two of the proposed SH measures-the within-class variability and the entropy-in a multivariate linear model explained the variance of the grasslands' Shannon index more than the MDC. However, there were no significant differences between the predicted values issued from the best models using multitemporal and monotemporal imagery. We conclude that multitemporal data at a spatial resolution of 10 m do not contribute to estimating the species diversity. The temporal variations may be more related to the effect of management practices.

TI  - Dimension Reduction of Multi-Spectral Satellite Image Time Series to Improve Deforestation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, sequential tests for detecting structural changes in time series have been adapted for deforestation monitoring using satellite data. The input time series of such sequential tests is typically a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI), which uses two or three bands and ignores all other bands. Being limited to a vegetation index will not benefit from the richer spectral information provided by newly launched satellites and will bring two bottle-necks for deforestation monitoring. Firstly, it is hard to select a suitable vegetation index a priori. Secondly, a single vegetation index is typically affected by seasonal signals, noise and other natural dynamics, which decrease its power for deforestation detection. A novel multispectral time series change monitoring method that combines dimension reduction methods with a sequential hypothesis test is proposed to address these limitations. For each location, the proposed method automatically chooses a "suitable" index for deforestation monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented it in two study areas: a dry tropical forest in Bolivia (time series length: 444) with strong seasonality and a moist tropical forest in Brazil (time series length: 225) with almost no seasonality. Our method significantly improves accuracy in the presence of strong seasonality, in particular the temporal lag between disturbance and its detection.

TI  - A Content-Based Remote Sensing Image Change Information Retrieval Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, the size of image datasets in many application areas is growing exponentially and the demand for Land-Cover and Land-Use change remote sensing data is growing rapidly. It is thus becoming hard to efficiently and intelligently retrieve the change information that users need from massive image databases. In this paper, content-based image retrieval is successfully applied to change detection, and a content-based remote sensing image change information retrieval model is introduced. First, the construction of a new model framework for change information retrieval from a remote sensing database is described. Then, as the target content cannot be expressed by one kind of feature alone, a multiple-feature, integrated retrieval model is proposed. Thirdly, an experimental prototype system that was set up to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the model is described. The proposed model is a new method of acquiring change detection information from remote sensing imagery and so can reduce the need for image pre-processing and also deal with problems related to seasonal changes, as well as other problems encountered in the field of change detection. Meanwhile, the new model has important implications for improving remote sensing image management and autonomous information retrieval. The experiment results obtained using a Landsat data set show that the use of the new model can produce promising results. A coverage rate and mean average precision of 71% and 89%, respectively, were achieved for the top 20 returned pairs of images.

AB  - This paper presents a kernel-based approach for the change detection of remote sensing images. It detects change by comparing the probability density (PD), expressed as kernel functions, of the feature vector extracted from bi-temporal images. PD is compared by defined kernel functions without immediate PD estimation. This algorithm is model-free and it can process multidimensional data, and is fit for the images with rich texture in particular. Experimental results show that overall accuracy of the algorithm is 98.9%, a little bit better than that of the change vector analysis and classification comparison method, which is 96.7 and 95.9% respectively.

TI  - Detection of thermal pollution from power plants on China's eastern coast using remote sensing data
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The acceleration of the industrialization process in China has increased the demand for electricity and triggered a power-plant building boom, especially along China's eastern coast, where the economy gets off early and enjoys a fast development. The thermal plumes, residual chlorine, nuclides and other pollutions produced by the thermal and nuclear power plants have exerted an impact on the coastal eco-environment. To monitor the thermal pollution from the power plants at Yueqing Bay on the eastern coast, in this research, the distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) surrounding the power plants is obtained by using the SST retrieval methods developed for Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), HJ-1B infrared sensor (IRS) and Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The comparison of the SST retrieval results before and after the operation of power plants indicates that the total area of sea waters that is impacted by the thermal discharge from the two power plants at Yueqing Bay is approximately 17.95 km(2), with the highest SST rise of 4.5 A degrees C appearing over the waters around the outlet of the Huaneng Yuhuan power plant on the eastern shore, whereas the highest SST rise around the Zheneng Yueqing power plant on the western shore reaches 3.8 A degrees C. The intensity and scope of influence of the thermal discharge mainly depend on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, and tide. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3 A degrees C is not large, thermal discharge still has an impact on bay ecosystems due to the relatively closed nature of the bay environment. Due to the influence of rising water temperatures on the reproduction and individual evolution of fish, shrimp, crabs, shellfish and other aquatic creatures, in the long term, the thermal pollution from coastal power plants will affect the volume of natural fishery and biological resources throughout the waters. The quantitative retrieval results also suggest that relative to MODIS data, Landsat ETM+ and HJ-1B IRS data with a high spatial resolution are more applicable to the estimation of small-scale SST, and IRS data with a high temporal resolution are more helpful in the study of spatio-temporal variability of thermal plumes from coastal power plants.

AB  - As one of the major terrestrial ecosystems, grasslands play a vital role in the global carbon cycle. However, the estimation of carbon stock in China's grasslands still remains controversial. Using the measured data from spatial stratified sampling (including 200 sites; 400 soil profiles, 2400 soil samples in the depth of 0-100 cm, 400 above-ground biomass carbon data, and 2400 below-ground biomass carbon data), together with the EVI (enhanced vegetation index), the estimation of total carbon stock was calculated at 29.9 Pg, with an area of 2.63 x 10(6) km(2) and the storage of SOC was larger than that of biomass carbon regardless of grassland types. The carbon density of grasslands showed a tendency of decreasing from the southeast to the northwest. Alpine grassland contributed the most (74.2%) of the total carbon storage, while the Desert grassland contributed the least (4.3%). The vertical distribution of carbon density varied strongly among different grassland types and a proportion of 15.8% of total carbon still stored at the layer of 60-100 cm. Since this study combined spatial stratified sampling (based on grassland type and community level, sampled belowground samples to a depth of 0-100 cm) with remote sensing data, it is believed that this estimation of the stock and spatial pattern:of carbon in grasslands of northern China is more accurate. Therefore, these results will be conducive for understanding the contribution of different grassland types to the global carbon cycle and providing a reference for future measures taken for increasing carbon storage in grasslands.

TI  - Regional Quantitative Cover Mapping of Tundra Plant Functional Types in Arctic Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem maps are foundational tools that support multi-disciplinary study design and applications including wildlife habitat assessment, monitoring and Earth-system modeling. Here, we present continuous-field cover maps for tundra plant functional types (PFTs) across similar to 125,000 km(2) of Alaska's North Slope at 30-m resolution. To develop maps, we collected a field-based training dataset using a point-intercept sampling method at 225 plots spanning bioclimatic and geomorphic gradients. We stratified vegetation by nine PFTs (e.g., low deciduous shrub, dwarf evergreen shrub, sedge, lichen) and summarized measurements of the PFTs, open water, bare ground and litter using the cover metrics total cover (areal cover including the understory) and top cover (uppermost canopy or ground cover). We then developed 73 spectral predictors derived from Landsat satellite observations (surface reflectance composites for similar to 15-day periods from May-August) and five gridded environmental predictors (e.g., summer temperature, climatological snow-free date) to model cover of PFTs using the random forest data-mining algorithm. Model performance tended to be best for canopy-forming PFTs, particularly deciduous shrubs. Our assessment of predictor importance indicated that models for low-statured PFTs were improved through the use of seasonal composites from early and late in the growing season, particularly when similar PFTs were aggregated together (e.g., total deciduous shrub, herbaceous). Continuous-field maps have many advantages over traditional thematic maps, and the methods described here are well-suited to support periodic map updates in tandem with future field and Landsat observations.

TI  - Evaluation of Combination Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Vaccine Introduction in Australia
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Incorporating combination vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, into immunization schedules should be evaluated from a benefit-risk perspective. Use of MMRV vaccine poses challenges due to a recognized increased risk of febrile seizures (FSs) when used as the first dose in the second year of life. Conversely, completion by age 2 years of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella immunization may offer improved disease control.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect on safety and coverage of earlier (age 18 months) scheduling of MMRV vaccine as the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) in Australia.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective active sentinel safety surveillance comparing the relative incidence (RI) of FSs in toddlers given MMRV and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and a national cohort study of vaccine coverage rates and timeliness before and after MMRV vaccine introduction were conducted. All Australian children aged 11 to 72 months were included in the coverage analysis, and 1471 Australian children aged 11 to 59 months were included in the FS analysis, with a focus on those aged 11 to 23 months.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES MMRV vaccine safety, specifically, the RI of FSs after MMRV vaccine at age 18 months, compared with risk following MMR vaccine and vaccine uptake for 2-dose MCV and single-dose varicella vaccine, focusing on timeliness.RESULTS Of the 1471 children, the median age at first FS was 21 months (interquartile range [IQR], 14-31 months). Three hundred ninety-one children were aged 11 to 23 months and had at least 1 FS included in the analysis; of these, 207 (52.9%) were male. A total of 278 children (71.1%) had received MMR followed by MMRV vaccine, 97 (24.8%) had received MMR vaccine only, and 16 (4.1%) had received neither vaccine. There was no increased risk of FSs (RI, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.55-2.13) in the 5 to 12 days following MMRV vaccine given as the second MCV to toddlers. Febrile seizures occurred after dose 1 of MMR vaccine at a known low increased risk (RI, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.71-4.29). Following program implementation, 2-dose MCV coverage at age 36 months exceeded that obtained at age 60 months in historical cohorts recommended to receive MMR vaccine before school entry, and on-time vaccination increased by 13.5%(from 58.9% to 72.4%). Despite no change in the scheduled age of varicella vaccine, use of MMRV vaccine was associated with a 4.0% increase in 1-dose varicella vaccine coverage.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of the absence of an association between use of MMRV vaccine as the second dose of MCV in toddlers and an increased risk of FSs. Incorporation of MMRV vaccine has facilitated improvements in vaccine coverage that will potentially improve disease control.

TI  - Digital soil mapping using remote sensing indices, terrain attributes, and vegetation features in the rangelands of northeastern Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil mapping has been introduced as a viable alternative to the traditional mapping methods due to being fast and cost-effective. The objective of the present study was to investigate the capability of the vegetation features and spectral indices as auxiliary variables in digital soil mapping models to predict soil properties. A region with an area of 1225 ha located in Bajgiran rangelands, Khorasan Razavi province, northeastern Iran, was chosen. A total of 137 sampling sites, each containing 3-5 plots with 10-m interval distance along a transect established based on randomized-systematic method, were investigated. In each plot, plant species names and numbers as well as vegetation cover percentage (VCP) were recorded, and finally one composite soil sample was taken from each transect at each site (137 soil samples in total). Terrain attributes were derived from a digital elevation model, different bands and spectral indices were obtained from the Landsat7 ETM+ images, and vegetation features were calculated in the plots, all of which were used as auxiliary variables to predict soil properties using artificial neural network, gene expression programming, and multivariate linear regression models. According to R-2 RMSE and MBE values, artificial neutral network was obtained as the most accurate soil properties prediction function used in scorpan model. Vegetation features and indices were more effective than remotely sensed data and terrain attributes in predicting soil properties including calcium carbonate equivalent, clay, bulk density, total nitrogen, carbon, sand, silt, and saturated moisture capacity. It was also shown that vegetation indices including NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, SARVI, RDVI, and DVI were more effective in estimating the majority of soil properties compared to separate bands and even some soil spectral indices.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in Water Use Efficiency to Understand Drought Induced Tree Mortality
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are becoming increasingly vulnerable to rising tree mortality rates in response to warming and drought. In California, the most severe drought on record occurred from 2012 to 2016 and high tree mortality rates were observed in response to this prolonged drought. Differences in satellite-derived estimates of water-use efficiency (WUE) under normal (i.e., WUEBASELINE) and drought conditions (WUE = WUE2014 - WUEBASELINE) captured variation in drought resilience, and is used here to understand patterns in tree mortality. Across California forests, a low WUEBASELINE under normal conditions was indicative of a low drought resilience and was associated with increasing tree mortality rates. Forested areas with high drought frequency in recent years (2002-2015) and lower WUEBASELINE were the most vulnerable to high post-drought tree mortality. Post drought tree mortality peaked in 2015 and tree mortality was detected in areas where bark beetles were active. Our results show that spatial and temporal changes in WUE can signal shifts in ecosystem resilience and that water-limited forests are sensitive to temperature- and precipitation-driven drought stress. Considering that forests with low resilience will be poised for dieback in the future if climates continue to feature rising temperatures without compensating increases in precipitation, it is becoming increasingly important that we understand drought vulnerability at the ecosystem level and how it changes over time with climate conditions.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Mineral Exploration in Central Portugal
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Portugal is well known for the existence of Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences primarily associated with hydrothermal processes. Despite the economic and strategic importance of such occurrences, the detailed geology of this particular region is poorly known and there is an obvious absence of geological mapping at an adequate scale. Remote sensing techniques were used in order to increase current geological knowledge of the Gois-Castanheira de Para area (600 km(2)) and to guide future exploration stages by targeting and prioritising potential locations. Digital image processing algorithms, such as Red, Green, Blue (RGB) colour composites, digital spatial filters, band ratios and Principal Components Analysis, were applied to Landsat 8 imagery and elevation data. Lineaments were extracted relying on geological photointerpretation criteria, allowing the identification of new geological-structural elements. Fieldwork was carried out in order to validate the remote sensing interpretations. Integration of remote sensing data with other information sources led to the definition of locations possibly suitable for hosting Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences. These areas were ranked according to their mineral potential. Targeting the most promising locations resulted in a reduction to less than 10% of the original study area (50.5 km(2)).

TI  - Predictive clinicopathological characteristics affecting sentinel lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer patients
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is one of the standard procedures for breast cancer patients without clinically detected axillary lymph nodes. However, 60-78% of patients suffered from unnecessary invasive axilla surgery. Our objective is to investigate predictive clinicopathological factors affecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in early breast cancer patients.Methods: There were 324 patients who were diagnosed as invasive breast cancer and took SLNB in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). They were categorized into the two groups according to axillary lymph node status, and their clinicopathological characteristics were compared by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results: Univariate analysis showed that tumor size, pT stage, lympho-vascular invasion (LVI), estrogen (ER) status, hormone receptor (HR) status, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were associated with SLN metastasis. However, pT stage, histological grade and TNBC were independent predictive factors for SLN involvement by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that pT stage and histological grade provided positive, and TNBC provided negative prediction about SLN metastasis in early stage breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Multiband PSInSAR and long-period monitoring of land subsidence in a strategic detrital aquifer (Vega de Granada, SE Spain): An approach to support management decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work integrates detailed geological and hydrogeological information with PSI data to obtain a better understanding of subsidence processes detected in the detrital aquifer of the Vega de Granada (SE Spain) during the past 13 years. Ground motion was monitored by exploiting SAR images from the ENVISAT (2003-2009), Cosmo-SkyMed (2011-2014) and Sentinel-1A (2015-2016) satellites. PSInSAR results show an inelastic deformation in the aquifer and small land surface displacements (up to -55 mm). The most widespread land subsidence is detected during the ENVISAT period (2003-2009), which coincided with a long, dry period in the region. The highest displacement rates recorded during this period (up to 10 mm/yr) were detected in the central part of the aquifer, where many villages are located. For this period, there is a good correlation between groundwater level depletion and the augmentation, of the average subsidence velocity and slight hydraulic head changes (<2 m) have a rapid ground motion response. The Cosmo-SkyMed period (2011-2014) coincided with a rainy period, and the land subsidence is only concentrated in some points. Rates of average subsidence up to 11.5 mm/yr are obtained for this period and are anthropogenic in origin, being related to earthmoving works. During the Sentinel-1A monitoring period (2015-2016) most of the region showed no deformation, except for some points of unknown origin in the NE sector. A general conclusion is that there is a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of ground subsidence; all the subsiding areas detected are located where a higher clay content was identified. Although the SE sector of the aquifer had more intense groundwater exploitation, no land subsidence processes were detected, as coarse-grained sediments predominate in the substratum. This research will contribute to the drawing-up of a management plan for the sustainable use of this strategic aquifer, taking into account critical levels of groundwater depletion to avoid land subsidence in the areas identified as vulnerable. The European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-1A could be an effective decision making tool in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Offshore Metallic Platforms Observation Using Dual-Polarimetric TS-X/TD-X Satellite Imagery: A Case Study in the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been proven to be an effective tool for ship monitoring. Offshore platforms monitoring is a key topic for both safety and security of the maritime domain. However, the scientific literature oriented to the observation of offshore platforms using SAR imagery is very limited. This study is mostly focused on the analysis and understanding of the multipolarization behavior of platforms' backscattering using dual-polarization X-band SAR imagery. This study is motivated by the fact that under low incidence angle and moderate wind conditions, copolarized channels may fail in detecting offshore platforms even when fine-resolution imagery is considered. This behavior has been observed on both medium-and high-resolution TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR imagery, despite the fact that platforms consist of large metallic structures. Hence, a simple multipolarization model is proposed to analyze the platform backscattering. Model predictions are verified on TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR imagery, showing that for acquisitions under low incidence angle, the platforms result in a reduced copolarized backscattered intensity even when fine resolution imagery is considered. Finally, several solutions to tackle this issue are proposed with concluding remark that the performance of offshore observation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Information theory has recently become an interesting topic in earth observation data management and analysis, since it can provide important information on hidden interactions and correlations among the considered data records. Although several methods have been proposed and implemented to efficiently extract a proper set of features and deliver accurate image investigation, classification, and segmentation, these architectures show drawbacks when the data sets are characterized by complex interactions among the samples. In this paper, a new approach based on information theory for automatic pattern recognition is introduced for accurate classification of remotely sensed data. Experimental results carried out on real data sets show the validity of the proposed approach.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Different Air Pollutants (QADAP) Using Daily MODIS Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale assessment of the amount of different air pollutants is routinely conducted using satellite images. This information is not useful in urban areas where more precise information is needed. In this work, a model called quantitative assessment of different air pollutants (QADAP) was prepared. The ability of QADAP is to produce images quantifying pollutant distribution throughout the city of Tehran at 500 m resolution. The model is based on surface reflectance changes due to air pollution. For this, the city was classified into various classes using GeoEye images. Then the reflectance of each class was calculated using this classified image along with a Hyperion image of the same region. Next, using this spectral information, a MODIS reflectance reference image in its first seven bands was prepared using MODIS image overlaid with the prepared classified image on a clear and clean sky. Then, some coefficients were calculated using surface reflectance differences between polluted days and the referenced clean day image. Required equations were then obtained by relating the pollution coefficients to the values of air pollutants measured in the pollution monitoring stations. Finally, given the equations and coefficients, pollutant concentration was calculated for each pixel and consequently daily images of different pollutants were produced. Data from ground stations were subsequently used to evaluate the model. The best results were for CO, PM2.5, NO2 and O-3, which had lower relative Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE), and the worst result was for PM10 with a high relative RMSE. The relative error of the model was 13-25% for higher levels of pollution and 150-400% for lower values. Finally highly polluted areas were determined by accumulation of different pollution images acquired on consecutive days; this aggregated image was used to identify the most contaminated regions considerably in agreement with the ground measured values.

TI  - Spectral Similarity and PRI Variations for a Boreal Forest Stand Using Multi-angular Airborne Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a proxy for light use efficiency (LUE), and is used in remote sensing to measure plant stress and photosynthetic downregulation in plant canopies. It is known to depend on local light conditions within a canopy indicating non-photosynthetic quenching of incident radiation. Additionally, when measured from a distance, canopy PRI depends on shadow fraction-the fraction of shaded foliage in the instantaneous field of view of the sensor-due to observation geometry. Our aim is to quantify the extent to which sunlit fraction alone can describe variations in PRI so that it would be possible to correct for its variation and identify other possible factors affecting the PRI-sunlit fraction relationship. We used a high spatial and spectral resolution Aisa Eagle airborne imaging spectrometer above a boreal Scots pine site in Finland (Hyytiala forest research station, 61 degrees 50'N, 24 degrees 17'E), with the sensor looking in nadir and tilted (off-nadir) directions. The spectral resolution of the data was 4.6 nm, and the spatial resolution was 0.6 m. We compared the PRI for three different scatter angles (beta = 19 degrees, 55 degrees and 76 degrees defined as the angle between sensor and solar directions) at the forest stand level, and observed a small (0.006) but statistically significant (p < 0.01) difference in stand PRI. We found that stand mean PRI was not a direct function of sunlit fraction. However, for each scatter angle separately, we found a clear non-linear relationship between PRI and sunlit fraction. The relationship was systematic and had a similar shape for all of the scatter angles. As the PRI-sunlit fraction curves for the different scatter angles were shifted with respect to each other, no universal curve could be found causing the observed independence of canopy PRI from the average sunlit fraction of each view direction. We found the shifts of the curves to be related to a leaf structural effect on canopy scattering: the ratio of needle spectral reflectance to transmittance. We demonstrate that modeling PRI-sunlit fraction relationships using high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy data is suitable and needed in order to quantify PRI variations over forest canopies.

TI  - Submesoscale Tidal-Inlet Dipoles Resolved Using Stereo WorldView Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A pair of high-resolution visible-band satellite images, acquired 65 s apart and analyzed using an optical-flow algorithm, is shown to provide a realistic snapshot of the velocity field of dipolar vortices (dipoles) emitted from the Gulf of San Jose, Argentina. The results reveal the expected counter-rotating vortices within three dipoles, as well as one monopole; the magnitude of vorticity ranges from 8 to 29 times the local Coriolis parameter. Analysis of the derived velocity and vorticity fields yields an estimate of 0.27 ms(-1) for the dipole self-propagation velocity, which is the part of the physics that allows transport of gulf-derived material into open waters. Dipole size, measured as the distance between vortex centers, increases with distance from the source area in a manner consistent with the effects of entrainment of ambient sea water. Given favorable imaging conditions, the general approach used here can provide a detailed portrayal of local circulation patterns-one suitable for use in validating high-resolution numerical models, especially in coastal areas having complex bathymetry.

TI  - Facing death. Student's thoughts towards the feeling of their own death
T2  - ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Narratives produced by thinking and reflecting about death and dying may be themselves a source of new knowledge in the study of anxiety and attitudes toward death. A qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore the features of thoughts, emotions and feelings about young people's own death, (nursing students) was conducted. 85 students voluntarily answered a self-administered questionnaire with open questions based on Mortality Salience, used in the Terror Management Theory. Content analysis using Atlas.ti software was performed. When reflecting upon their own death, participants reported substantive emotions such as fear, pain, distress, sadness or loneliness. The fear of their own death was specified as the inability to achieve goals in life, to leave the family and the dying process itself. When reflecting upon been physically dead, attributes of the decomposition of the body, spiritual attributes, beliefs, denial and preferences were identified. Cultural worldview, values and beliefs of each person were remarkably present when thinking about their own death.

TI  - Pan-Arctic optical characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter: Tracing dissolved organic carbon in changing Arctic waters using satellite ocean color data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Light absorption of the colored fraction of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a dominant optical component of the Arctic Ocean (AO). Here we show Pan-Arctic characteristics of CDOM light absorption for various Arctic regions covering both coastal and oceanic waters during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12% (root mean square error of 0.3 m(-1)) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r(2) > 0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28%. Implications for the monitoring of DOC concentrations in Arctic coastal waters are discussed.

TI  - HLA class Ia and Ib molecules and FOXP3+TILs in relation to the prognosis of malignant melanoma patients
T2  - CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - HIA class Ia (HLA-ABC) and HLA class Ib (HLA-E, -F and -G) molecules and FOXP3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are often reported as relevant factors of tumor immune regulation. We investigated their expression as prognostic factors in 200 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM). In our cohort, patients with tumors showing upregulation of HLA-ABC molecules had significantly thicker tumors (32% vs 7%, P < 0.001), frequent ulceration (20% vs 6%, P = 0.007) and frequent nodular melanomas (20% vs 4%, P = 0.001). Additionally, high expression of HLA-G in the tumor was a sign of bad prognosis for the patients, being associated with thick tumors (30% vs 12%, P = 0.017), ulceration (24% vs 5%, P < 0.001) and positive sentinel node (13% vs 6%, P = 0.015). HLA-E, HLA-F and FOXP3+ TILs were not indicative of the prognosis in PCM. High HIA-ABC and HLA-G were associated with tumor aggressiveness and could be relevant predictive markers for effective immunotherapy of melanoma tumors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The FIGO staging system has undergone many modifications since it first appeared in about the middle of the previous century. Due to the use of modern diagnostic tools, namely computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, sentinel lymph node biopsy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, certain gynecological cancer cases cannot be allocated to a specific stage if one wishes to adhere strictly to FIGO requirements. In these circumstances such cases actually remain unstaged. This should prompt appropriate modifications of the current FIGO staging system so that it fulfills its aims.

TI  - Mapping Changes in Carbon Storage and Productivity Services Provided by Riparian Ecosystems of Semi-Arid Environments in Northwestern Mexico
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the importance of riparian ecosystems (RE) as critical areas for carbon storage and productivity in semi-arid regions of Northwest Mexico. We calculated the carbon storage by land cover and compared temporal trends of basal productivity (MODIS) and pre-monsoon productivity (Landsat) of RE, to other land cover types. We used land cover maps generated previously for the region (years 1993, 2002, and 2011), assigning values of carbon stored in aerial and root biomass, as well as organic carbon stored in the soil. To estimate productivity (proxy), time series were generated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of Landsat 4-5 TM and MODIS for each land cover type. We found that RE stores 93,147 tC/ha, about 1.5 times the estimated storage for oak forest (65,048 tC/ha). Productivity of RE was similar to highly productive land cover types, such as agriculture and oak forest, and higher than in the rest of the ecosystems of the region. We also found that changes from RE to agriculture and cultivated grasslands represented a decrease in productivity (p < 0.001). Finally, we report a gradual decrease in basal productivity (p = 0.0151) and pre-monsoon productivity (p = 0.031) in the RE. These results help us understand that changes in land use, intensive use of water, and climate can influence the ecosystem services of productivity and carbon storage offered by RE in semi-arid areas.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of snow on surface energy balance through assimilating snow cover fraction and snow depth
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow plays an important part in Earth's climate system. Snow cover regulates the land surface energy balance through altering the albedo of the land surface. To utilize the satellite-retrieved snow cover fraction (SCF) and snow depth (SD) data sufficiently and avoid inconsistency, this paper developed a very simple but robust quality control method to assimilate Fengyun satellite-retrieved SCF and SD simultaneously. The results show that the assimilation method which this paper implemented can not only utilize the satellite-retrieved SCF and SD data sufficiently but also avoid the inconsistency of them. Two experiments were designed and performed to quantify the impacts of snow on land surface energy balance using the integrated urban land model. With the increase of the SCF and SD, the net radiation decreased significantly during the day and increased a little at night; the sensible heat flux decreased significantly during the day; the evapotranspiration and ground heat flux decreased during the day too.

TI  - On Authoritarianism. <i>A Review Essay</i>
T2  - COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY
M3  - Review
AB  - A product of the nineteenth-century age of isms, authoritarianism describes a worldview that promotes the establishment of a hierarchical relation whereby one person or group dominates and governs another without recourse to either physical force or persuasion. Authoritarianism is the advocacy of authority as a source or origin that compels voluntary obedience without question. A person has authority if he or she can command someone to do something without having to do anything other than issue a command; which is to say that the person who obeys recognizes the authority of the person who commands as legitimate or correct. The word authority comes from the Latin, auctoritas, which Cicero employs to characterize the distinctive influence of the Senate in ancient Rome: Power is with the people, authority with the Senate. Whereas power (potestas) is political and relies on force or persuasion to command obedience, authority enjoys unequivocal obedience as a source beyond the contested realm of politics.

TI  - Improving the Algorithm of Extracting Regional Total Precipitable Water Vapor Over Land From MODIS Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise estimation of total precipitable water vapor (TPW) with high temporal and spatial resolutions is of great importance in different disciplines. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the sensors which have absorption and nonabsorption bands of water vapor. There is a standard algorithm to produce TPW product of MODIS (MOD05/MYD05) which uses the ratios of reflectances in strong, moderate, and weak absorption bands of water vapor to nonabsorption ones (transmission). This paper aims to present a method based on this algorithm to optimize TPW estimation in local scale. To do so, the western part of Iran was chosen as the study region. Terra MODIS images and MOD05 in clear-sky conditions related to the 100 days in four seasons of 2015-2016 were provided as the selected data. To validate and improve the results, TPW measured in six radiosonde stations and interpolated for overpass time of Terra was utilized. Four procedures were performed. In the first procedure, the coefficients of transmissions were extracted using linear least-squares technique, separately. For the second procedure, the coefficients were calculated in terms of the highest atmospheric transmission sensitivity to TPW for each absorption band separately, and in the third procedure, they were calculated simultaneously. In the last procedure, the errors from third one were modeled with a linear relationship between reflectance ratios of absorption bands. Based on the results, in highest accuracy, the coefficient of determination R-2 and Root Mean Square Error was 0.878 and 2.702 mm, respectively, which were acceptable comparing those of other researchers.

TI  - Pain, Sensory Disturbances, and Psychological Distress among Danish Women Treated for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: An Exploratory Study
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ is a noninvasive precancer condition. The treatment resembles the treatment of invasive breast cancer. The aim of this exploratory study was to gain knowledge on the level of postoperative pain, sensory disturbances, and distress among a small group of Danish women with ductal carcinoma in situ who had sentinel lymph node biopsy in order to plan a population study. A subgroup of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 20) was compared to patients with invasive breast cancer (n = 455) at time of diagnosis and after 12 months. Six patients were interviewed on the impact of the diagnosis and life after treatment. We found no significant difference in reported sensory disturbances or pain after 12 months between the groups. More than one-third (39%) of ductal carcinoma in situ patients reported moderate to severe distress 7 on the Distress Thermometer) at time of diagnosis decreasing to 10% after 12 months. Similarly 36% of breast cancer patients reported distress at time of diagnosis and 10% after 12 months. Interviews confirmed that ductal carcinoma in situ patients experienced distress and also uncovered phySical problems and rehabilitation needs. The study indicates that women with ductal carcinoma in situ seem to suffer from pain and distress. The study highlights the need for a large study in order to validate the findings. Additional efforts may be needed to improve patients' understanding of diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and alleviate psychological morbidity and physical restraints related to the condition.

TI  - Seasonal and Spatial Characteristics of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) in Northern West Siberian Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat and modified landscapes raise air and surface temperatures in urbanized areas around the globe. This phenomenon is widely known as an urban heat island (UHI). Previous UHI studies, and specifically those based on remote sensing data, have not included cities north of 60 degrees N. A few in situ studies have indicated that even relatively small cities in high latitudes may exhibit significantly amplified UHIs. The UHI characteristics and factors controlling its intensity in high latitudes remain largely unknown. This study attempts to close this knowledge gap for 28 cities in northern West Siberia (NWS). NWS cities are convenient for urban intercomparison studies as they have relatively similar cold continental climates, and flat, rather homogeneous landscapes. We investigated the UHI in NWS cities using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD 11A2 land surface temperature (LST) product in 8-day composites. The analysis reveals that all 28 NWS cities exhibit a persistent UHI in summer and winter. The LST analysis found differences in summer and winter regarding the UHI effect, and supports the hypothesis of seasonal differences in the causes of UHI formation. Correlation analysis found the strongest relationships between the UHI and population (log P). Regression models using log P alone could explain 65-67% of the variability of UHIs in the region. Additional explanatory power-at least in summer-is provided by the surrounding background temperatures, which themselves are strongly correlated with latitude. The performed regression analysis thus confirms the important role of the surrounding temperature in explaining spatial-temporal variation of UHI intensity. These findings suggest a climatological basis for these phenomena and, given the importance of climatic warming, an aspect that deserves future study.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method for inferring time-dependent three-component surface deformation fields given a set of geodetic images of displacements collected from multiple viewing geometries. Displacements are parameterized in time with a dictionary of displacement functions. The algorithm extends an earlier single-component (i.e., single line of sight) framework for time-series analysis to three spatial dimensions using combinations of multitemporal, multigeometry interferometic synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and/or pixel offset (PO) maps. We demonstrate this method with a set of 101 pairs of azimuth and range PO maps generated for a portion of the Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, derived from data collected by the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation. We compare our results with previously published InSAR mean velocity fields and selected GPS time series and show that our resulting three-component surface displacements resolve both secular motion and tidal variability.

AB  - In recent decades, high groundwater extraction rates, often coincident with periods of severe drought, result in the widespread decline of water levels. Overexploitation of aquifers also causes land subsidence, which poses a severe threat to infrastructure. Tucson, Arizona experiences land subsidence coupled with the depletion of groundwater, a critical water resource for the desert city. To understand the spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence and its implications for aquifer properties, we examine long time series of surface deformation and head levels. Measurements at extensometer stations indicate rapid compaction of fine-grained material up to 8.5mm/yr from 1990 to 2005, which results in permanent storage volume losses up to 4.1%. The analysis of densely populated sets of interferograms generated from Envisat and RadarSAT C band acquisitions yields multitemporal maps of surface deformation at unprecedented resolution. These maps reveal that subsidence significantly slows by the late 2000s, corresponding with the implementation of artificial recharge efforts. Subsequent to groundwater level recovery, we observe a brief 6.6year interval of residual compaction, suggesting a high vertical hydraulic conductivity, which is then shown to be up to 9.8 x 10(-4)m/d. We also estimate the average elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients for the aquifer system to be 3.78 x10(-3) and 6.01 x 10(-3), respectively. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar shows deformation nearly ceases by 2015, likely reducing hazards associated with Earth fissuring and infrastructure damage. This study highlights successful outcomes of water management and conservation plans that preserve existing groundwater reserves and increase artificial recharge.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (HA) are common childhood diseases mostly associated with human enteroviruses (EV). Although usually benign illnesses, neurological complications may be observed during large epidemics when enterovirus A7I (EV-A7 I) is involved, as observed in the Asia Pacific Region and in China since the late 1990s. The occurrence of these complications warrants reinforcing the surveillance of the emergence of EV-A7 I infections in France and Europe. Monitoring EV infections associated with HFMD can be considered as an effective tool to detect an upsurge of EV-A7 I infections in a timely manner. In 2014, a national sentinel surveillance system for HFMD/HA was set up in France through a network of volunteer pediatricians and coordinated by the National Reference Center for Enteroviruses and Parechoviruses. Although classical manifestations of HFMD/HA can be easily recognized, there are several atypical presentations of the disease that can be confused with other skin conditions. Delayed cutaneous manifestations, such as onychomadesis and acral desquamation, may also occur and should prompt consideration of HFMD in the preceding weeks. Severe complications following HFMD include neurological manifestations (mainly rhombencephalitis) or less frequently cardiopulmonary failure and can sometimes be fatal. In China, the case severity rate has been estimated at 1%, with a case fatality rate at 0.03%. EV-A7 I was involved in more than 90% of the fatal cases. Diagnosis of EV infections associated with severe neurological manifestations is based on the molecular detection of the EV genome in vesicles, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), throat and stool given that EV-A7 I is rarely recovered from the CSF. Positive EV genome detection should be followed by EV genotyping to identify the type of the EV. In temperate-climate countries, outbreaks of HFMD occur mostly but not exclusively during summer and autumn months. Adults may also present with HFMD. In 2016, an upsurge of severe neurological manifestations was reported in France; EV-A7 I accounted for 50% of the cases. No specific treatment is available, but two inactivated EV-A7 I vaccines are currently available in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combination of Spectral and Textural Features in the MSG Satellite Remote Sensing Images for Classifying Rainy Area into Different Classes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainfall intensity classification technique using spectral and textural features from MSG/SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation/Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared) satellite data is proposed in this paper. The study is carried out over north of Algeria. The developed method is based on the artificial neural multilayer perceptron network (MLP). Two MLP algorithms are used: the MLP-S based only on spectral parameters and the MLP-ST that use both spectral and textural features. The MLP model is created with three layers (input, hidden, and output) that consist of 6 output neurons in the output layer that represent the 6 rain intensities classes: very high, moderate to high, moderate, light to moderate, light and no rain and 10 spectral input neurons for the MLP-S and 15 input neurons for MLP-ST, which as ten spectral features that were calculated from MSG thermal infrared brilliance temperature and brilliance temperature difference and as five textural features, and The rainfall intensity areas classified by the proposed technique are validated against ground-based radar data. The rainfall rates used in the training set are derived from Setif radar measurements (Algeria). The results obtained after applying this method show that the introduction of textural parameters as additional information works in improving the classification of different rainfall intensities pixels in the MSG/SEVIRI imagery compared to the techniques based only on spectral information. These results are compared with results obtained with the probability of rainfall intensity (PRI). This comparison revealed a clear outperformance of the MLP algorithms over the PRI algorithms. Best results are provided by the MLP-ST algorithm. The combination of spectral and textural features in the MSG-SEVIRI imagery is important and for the classification of the rainfall intensities to different classes.

TI  - Increasing utilization of regional nodal irradiation in elderly node-positive women and declining emphasis on demographic factors
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the practice patterns for the use of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in treatment of elderly women with low volume node-positive breast cancer in the setting of breast conservation surgery (BCS).Women aged 70-89 diagnosed with unilateral, pathologic T1-2N1M0 breast cancer from 2004 to 2013, who underwent BCS and received radiotherapy were identified from the National Cancer Database. In 2011, two major trials were presented that helped define indications for RNI. Patients were dichotomized into "early", i.e. diagnosed up to 2010, and "late" cohorts. Patient and treatment characteristics were compared between the cohorts and logistic regression used to determine independent factors associated with the receipt of RNI.7228 women met inclusion criteria; 4330 (59.9%) in early and 2898 (40.1%) in late cohorts. Utilization of RNI increased from 33.9% in early to 42.5% in late cohorts (P ae<currency> 0.001) and was independent of a general increase in RNI utilization. RNI in the early and late cohorts was not different between the study population and younger women (P > 0.05). RNI utilization increased in both cohorts with increasing number of positive lymph nodes. In the early cohort, RNI was also associated with higher grade, white race and lower income. In the late cohort, RNI increased with the presence of multiple, predefined risk factors.There was an increase in utilization of RNI for elderly patients from 2004 to 2013. In more recent years, the primary factors associated with receipt of RNI were tumor related with declining importance of demographic factors.

TI  - Surveillance of occupational accidents by sentinel workers' health centers in the municipality of Fortaleza, Northeast of Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the factors associated with the notification of occupational accidents by sentinel workers' health centers in the municipality of Fortaleza in the northeast of Brazil. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted of five sentinel workers' health centers for serious and fatal occupational accidents. A total of 354 interviews were conducted with professionals responsible for notifying occupational accidents. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's chi-square test and/or Fisher's exact test using prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals, followed by stratified analysis and multivariate Poisson regression adopting the stepwise forward method. Variables that obtained a p-value of less than or equal to the chosen significance level (0.05) were maintained in the final model. Professionals who had a greater number of years of work experience, had undertaken three training courses, had knowledge of policy directives concerning occupational accidents, were familiar with the SINAN notification form, were aware that occupational accidents are reportable, and discussed the theme of occupational accidents in the workplace were statistically more likely to notify occupational accidents. Education and training helps raise awareness among health professionals.

TI  - <i>De novo</i> transcriptome assembly and RNA-Seq expression analysis in blood from beluga Whales of Bristol Bay, AK
T2  - MARINE GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the health of marine mammal sentinel species is crucial to understanding the impacts of environmental perturbations on marine ecosystems and human health. In Arctic regions, beluga whales, Deiphinapterus leucas, are upper level predators that may serve as a sentinel species, potentially forecasting impacts on human health. While gene expression profiling from blood transcriptomes has widely been used to assess health status and environmental exposures in human and veterinary medicine, its use in wildlife has been limited due to the lack of available genomes and baseline data. To this end we constructed the first beluga whale blood transcriptome de novo from samples collected during annual health assessments of the healthy Bristol Bay, AK stock during 2012-2014 to establish baseline information on the content and variation of the beluga whale blood transcriptome. The Trinity transcriptome assembly from beluga was comprised of 91,325 transcripts that represented a wide array of cellular functions and processes and was extremely similar in content to the blood transcriptome of another cetacean, the bottlenose dolphin. Expression of hemoglobin transcripts was much lower in beluga (25.6% of TPM, transcripts per million) than has been observed in many other mammals. A T12A amino acid substitution in the HBB sequence of beluga whales, but not bottlenose dolphins, was identified and may play a role in low temperature adaptation. The beluga blood transcriptome was extremely stable between sex and year, with no apparent clustering of samples by principle components analysis and < 4% of genes differentially expressed (EBseq, FDR < 0.05). While the impacts of season, sexual maturity, disease, and geography on the beluga blood transcriptome must be established, the presence of transcripts involved in stress, detoxification, and immune functions indicate that blood gene expression analyses may provide information on health status and exposure. This study provides a wealth of transcriptomic data on beluga whales and provides a sizeable pool of preliminary data for comparison with other studies in beluga whale.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are limited data on the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness in HIV-infected adults or the elderly in Africa. We studied the epidemiology of RSV-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalizations in adults in South Africa from 2009 through 2013.Methods: Individuals admitted to sentinel surveillance hospitals were investigated by respiratory tract swabs for RSV, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The incidence of RSV-associated SARI was calculated for the one site with population denominators.Results: Of 7796 participants investigated, 329 (4%) tested positive for RSV. On multivariable analysis, HIV-infected individuals with RSV-associated SARI had greater odds of being in the age groups 18-44 and 45-64 years (odd ratios (OR) 26.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-112.1 and OR 11.4; 95% CI 2.6-50.0) compared with those >= 65 years and being female (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4-5.4). The relative risk of hospitalization with RSV-associated SARI was 12-18 times higher in HIV infected individual compared to that of HIV-uninfected.Conclusion: The incidence of RSV-associated SARI was higher in HIV-infected individuals and those aged 65 years and older. Further studies are warranted to describe the disease association of RSV detected in adults with SARI. (C) 2017 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: Recommendations for Diagnostics and Treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive tumor that often occurs in the head and neck region. Because of these features, the classifications and diagnostic and treatment regimens are frequently modified. Especially in the anatomically complex head and neck region, it is crucial to be aware of the current recommendations for diagnostics and treatment of MCC to ensure appropriate treatment. This overview aims to summarize the currently available literature.The authors reviewed the relevant literature and international guidelines for MCC from 2012 to 2017 with respect to epidemiology and prognosis, diagnostic procedures and imaging, surgery, radiation, systemic treatment, and aftercare. These results were compared with existing guidelines, some of them current, and recommendations were derived.Marked developments in imaging have resulted in an increased use of functional imaging. The surgical concepts have changed regarding safety margins and the use of sentinel node biopsies. In systemic treatment, a move from conventional agents toward immuno-oncology can be observed.For staging, it is important to be as exact as possible using functional imaging (e.g., positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan), especially in the head and neck area with its complex lymph drainage. This often plays an especially important role in early stages of the tumor, when the resection margin can be reduced to preserve the organ. Aftercare also should include functional imaging. In an advanced, metastatic stage, immuno-oncology (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4) is superior to the previous methods of systemic treatment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: National enhanced surveillance of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) commenced on 1st October 2014 to gain a more in-depth understanding of the epidemiology of SAB in Scotland. Children under 16 years of age were analysed separately from adults because previous studies had demonstrated epidemiological differences.Aim: To identify risk factors and patient populations at greatest risk to enable the development of focused improvement plans.Methods: All National Health Service (NHS) boards within NHS Scotland take part in the mandatory enhanced surveillance, with data collected by trained data collectors using nationally agreed definitions.Findings: Analysis of the first 18 months of data showed that hospital-acquired SAB was mostly associated with neonates with device risk factors, whereas community-associated SAB was found in older children who had few, if any, risk factors and most presented with a bone or joint infection.Conclusion: The enhanced SAB data highlighted the difference in risk factors and entry points for the acquisition of SAB within the paediatric population.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is the second most common source of positive blood cultures, after Escherichia coli, reported within NHS Scotland. Laboratory surveillance has been mandatory in Scotland for SAB since 2001.Aim: To gain an understanding of the epidemiology of SAB cases and associated risk factors for healthcare and true community onset. Identification of these factors and the patient populations at greatest risk enables the development of focused improvement plans.Methods: All NHS boards within NHS Scotland take part in the mandatory enhanced surveillance, with data collected by trained data collectors using nationally agreed definitions.Findings: Between 1st October 2014 and 31st March 2016, 2256 episodes of SAB in adults were identified. The blood cultures were taken in 58 hospitals and across all 15 Scottish health boards. The data demonstrated that approximately one-third of all SAB cases are true community cases. Vascular access devices continue to be the most reported entry point (25.7%) in individuals who receive health care, whereas skin and soft tissue risk factors are present in all origins. A significant risk factor unique to community cases is illicit drug injection.Conclusion: Improvement plans for reduction of SAB should be targeted more widely than hospital care settings alone.

TI  - Lake ice and temperature trends for Ontario and Manitoba: 2001 to 2014
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are a prominent geographic feature in northern landscapes and play an important role in understanding regional climate systems. In order to better model changes within climate systems, it is important to study lake ice processes. Although the availability of records for lake ice through ground measurements has declined in recent years, the increased use of remote sensing provides an alternative to this. Using a preclassified snow and ice remote sensing product with a 500-m resolution, based on images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/MOD10A1), and the use of measured and reanalysis temperature data, this study evaluated lake ice phenology dates in connection to recent trends in temperature and 0 degrees C isotherms within Ontario and Manitoba between 2001 and 2014. Temperature trends indicated both regional warming and cooling, with significant cooling observed in Southern Ontario (p<.05) and significant warming in Southern Manitoba (p<.1) during the fall. Spatial analysis of the trends in the lake ice data showed significant clustering of significant trends in ice on dates (p<.01). When analysing the trends in ice phenology in connection to the trends in temperature, it was found that 70% of lakes experienced a change in the ice on date with the expected change in temperature and 85% of lakes for ice off date. When shifting ice on and ice off dates are investigated in relation to 0 degrees C isotherms, it was seen that 80% of ice on dates and 100% of ice off dates shifted in sync with the isotherm dates. This demonstrates that the ice phenology of lakes in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, is responding to short-term variability in temperature. The MODIS product could be used to investigate ice phenology on a large scale and contribute towards expanding existing records of ice phenology. Establishing long-term ice records could be a valuable asset for other research ranging from water balance studies to the response of lake biota under changing climate.

TI  - Selective Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery in Patients Undergoing Prophylactic Mastectomy Using Intraoperative Pathology
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Routine sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery during prophylactic mastectomy (PM) is unnecessary, because most PMs do not contain cancer. Our institution utilizes intraoperative pathology to guide the surgical decision for resection of SLNs in PM. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness of this approach.Method. We identified all women aged >= 18 years who underwent bilateral PM (BPM) or contralateral PM (CPM) at our institution from January 2008 to July 2016. We evaluated the frequency of SLN resection and rate of occult breast cancer (DCIS or invasive disease) in the PM. We used the following definitions: over-treatment-SLN surgery in patients without cancer; under-treatment-no SLN surgery in patients with cancer; appropriate treatment-no SLN in patients without cancer or SLN surgery in patients with cancer.Result. PM was performed on 1900 breasts: 1410 (74.2%) CPMs and 490 (25.8%) BPMs. Cancer was identified in 58 (3.0%) cases (32 invasive disease and 26 DCIS) and concurrent SLN surgery was performed in 44 (75.9%) of those cases. Overall, SLN surgery guided by intraoperative pathology resulted in appropriate treatment of 1787 (94.1%) cases: 1319 (93.5%) CPMs and 468 (95.5%) BPMs, by avoiding SLN in 1743/1842 cases without cancer (94.6%), and performing SLN surgery in 44/58 cases with cancer (75.9%).Conclusion. Use of intraoperative pathology to direct SLN surgery in patients undergoing PM minimizes over-treatment from routine SLN in PM and minimizes under-treatment from avoiding SLN in PM, demonstrating the value of intraoperative pathology in this era of focus on appropriateness of care.

TI  - Estimates of genetic parameters, genetic trends, and inbreeding in a crossbred dairy sheep research flock in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For the past 2 decades, the Spooner Agriculture Research Station (ARS) of the University of Wisconsin-Madison operated the only dairy sheep research flock in North America. The objectives of the present study were to 1) obtain estimates of genetic parameters for lactation and reproductive traits in dairy ewes, 2) estimate the amount of genetic change in these traits over time, and 3) quantify the level of inbreeding in this flock over the last 20 yr. Multiple-trait repeatability models (MTRM) were used to analyze ewe traits through their first 6 parities. The first MTRM jointly analyzed milk (180-d-adjusted milk yield [180d MY]), fat (180-d-adjusted fat yield [180d FY]), and protein (180-d-adjusted protein yield [180d PY]) yields adjusted to 180 d of lactation; number of lambs born per ewe lambing (NLB); and lactation average test-day somatic cell score (LSCS). A second MTRM analyzed 180d MY, NLB, LSCS, and percentage milk fat (% F) and percentage milk protein (% P). The 3 yield traits were moderately heritable (0.26 to 0.32) and strongly genetically correlated (0.91 to 0.96). Percentage milk fat and % P were highly heritable (0.53 and 0.61, respectively) and moderately genetically correlated (0.61). Milk yield adjusted to 180 d was negatively genetically correlated with % F and % P (-0.31 and -0.34, respectively). Ewe prolificacy was not significantly (P > 0.67) genetically correlated with yield traits, % P, or LSCS but lowly negatively correlated with % F (-0.26). Lactation somatic cell score was unfavorably genetically correlated with yield traits (0.28 to 0.39) but not significantly (P > 0.09) correlated with % F, % P, and NLB. Within-trait multiple-trait models through the first 4 parities revealed that 180d MY, 180d FY, 180d PY, % F, and % P were strongly genetically correlated across parity (0.67 to 1.00). However, the genetic correlations across parity for NLB and LSCS were somewhat lower (0.51 to 0.96). Regressing predicted breeding values for 180d MY, without and with the addition of breed effects, on ewe year of birth revealed a positive genetic gain of 2.30 and 6.24 kg/yr, respectively, over the past 20 yr in this flock. Inbreeding coefficients of ewes with an extended pedigree ranged from 0.0 to 0.29, with an average of 0.07. To optimize genetic gains and avoid excessive inbreeding, the development of a national genetic improvement program should be a top priority for the growing dairy sheep industry.

TI  - Understanding the relationship between urban outdoor temperatures and indoor air-conditioning energy demand in Zimbabwe
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization causes thermal elevation which increase household energy consumption through air conditioning to reduce human heat stress. The objective of this study was thus to quantify the long term changes in potential energy requirements for indoor space warming and cooling in the built environment of Harare using remotely sensed satellite data. Landsat and in-situ temperature data were used to determine land use and land cover distribution, as well as to estimate trends in air conditioning energy requirements between 1984 and 2015. Daytime Heating Degree Days (HDD) and the Cooling Degree Days (CDD) derived from Landsat thermal data and in situ temperature measurements were used as a measure of indoor heating and cooling energy in the cool and hot season, respectively. Due to surface alterations from urban growth between 1984 and 2015, surface temperature increased on average by 2.26 degrees C and by 4.10 degrees C in the cool and hot season, respectively. This decreased potential indoor heating energy needed in the cool season by 1 degrees day and increased indoor cooling energy during the hot season by 3 degrees days. In-situ observations revealed that energy consumption in residential areas Harare increases with temperature in summer and the opposite in winter. Findings in this are important for implementation of mechanisms to rationalize power supply based on spatial differences in levels of need for air conditioning. The findings are also relevant for authorities to devise measures to capacitate the most vulnerable societies, such as by subsidizing electricity for the urban poor, and ensure that they are protected from stress due to low or high temperature.

TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance in bloodstream infection isolates at a large urban hospital in Malawi (1998-2016): a surveillance study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Bacterial bloodstream infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, yet few facilities are able to maintain long-term surveillance. The Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme has done sentinel surveillance of bacteraemia since 1998. We report long-term trends in bloodstream infection and antimicrobial resistance from this surveillance.Methods In this surveillance study, we analysed blood cultures that were routinely taken from adult and paediatric patients with fever or suspicion of sepsis admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi from 1998 to 2016. The hospital served an urban population of 920 000 in 2016, with 1000 beds, although occupancy often exceeds capacity. The hospital admits about 10 000 adults and 30 000 children each year. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done by the disc diffusion method according to British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines. We used the Cochran-Armitage test for trend to examine trends in rates of antimicrobial resistance, and negative binomial regression to examine trends in icidence of bloodstream infection over time.Findings Between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2016, we isolated 29 183 pathogens from 194539 blood cultures. Pathogen detection decreased significantly from 327.1/100 000 in 1998 to 120.2/100 000 in 2016 (p<0. 0001). 13366 (51.1%) of 26174 bacterial isolates were resistant to the Malawian first-line antibiotics amoxicillin or penicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole; 68.3% of Gram-negative and 6.6% of Gram-positive pathogens. The proportions of non-Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or fluoroquinolone resistance rose significantly after 2003 to 61.9% in 2016 (p<0 .0001). Between 2003 and 2016, ESBL resistance rose from 0.7% to 30.3% in Escherichia coli, from 11.8% to 90.5% in Klebsiella spp and from 30.4% to 71.9% in other Enterobacteriaceae. Similarly, resistance to ciprofloxacin rose from 2.5% to 31.1% in E coli, from 1.7% to 70.2% in Klebsiella spp and from 5.9% to 68.8% in other Enterobacteriaceae. By contrast, more than 92.0% of common Gram-positive pathogens remain susceptible to either penicillin or chloramphenicol. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first reported in 1998 at 7.7% and represented 18.4% of S aureus isolates in 2016.Interpretation The rapid expansion of ESBL and fluoroquinolone resistance among common Gram-negative pathogens, and the emergence of MRSA, highlight the growing challenge of bloodstream infections that are effectively impossible to treat in this resource-limited setting.

TI  - The rate of facial nerve dysfunction and time to recovery after intraparotid and extraparotid facial nerve exposure and protection in head and neck cutaneous tumor surgery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most patients with head and neck skin tumors present with normal facial nerve function. A common treatment strategy for these patients is facial nerve preservation surgery, although the degree to which the nerve is successfully preserved is still unclear. Data on the incidence and recovery of facial nerve dysfunction are woefully lacking in the field of dermato-oncology.In 23 patients with normal preoperative facial nerve function, we retrospectively reviewed twenty-six head and neck surgical interventions that included facial nerve exposure and protection, focusing particularly on the differences in outcome between intraparotid and extraparotid exposure of the facial nerve branches.Eleven of the 26 cases (42.4%) developed transient paresis, but only one (3.8%) developed permanent paresis. Of 41 dissected facial nerve branches, 14 developed transient paresis (34.1%) and one, a marginal mandibular branch, developed permanent paresis (2.4%). The branches most susceptible to developing paresis were the temporal (4/6 branches, 66.7%) and marginal mandibular branches (8/17 branches, 47.1%). Although the rate of paresis was higher, and ensuing recovery period slightly longer in the extraparotid dissection group compared to the intraparotid dissection group, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The extraparotid and intraparotid rates of paresis were 48% (11/23 branches) and 21.1% (4/19 branches), respectively, P = 0.139; and the average recovery periods were 10.3 and 9.3 weeks, respectively, P = 0.64.The functional outcome, regardless of the different sites of facial nerve exposure, was almost always either complete facial nerve sparing or transient dysfunction that resolved within 6 months.

TI  - An integrated evacuation decision support system framework with social perception analysis and dynamic population estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In designing evacuation plans, it is critical for the responsive agencies to consider the dynamic change of human population within impact areas and understand social perception from local residents. Although a large number of evacuation models has been reported in the literature, many used census survey data which represent only the nighttime population distribution. To fill this research gap, this paper introduces a novel data integration framework for developing an evacuation decision support system for wildfire, Integrated Wildfire Evacuation Decision Support System (IWEDSS). IWEDSS integrates multiple data sources including social media, census survey, geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, volunteer suggestions, and remote sensing data. The integration is based on multi-disciplinary theoretical and modeling approaches including Geographic Information Science, civil and transportation engineering, computer science, social media and communication. IWEDSS includes four core modules: dynamic population estimation, stage-based robust evacuation planning, social perception analysis, and web-based geomatical analytic platform. It offers tools for evacuation planers and resource managers to make better decisions that can reduce the evacuation time and potential number of injuries and deaths. This paper also presents a case study to demonstrate the suitability of incorporating social media data to estimate the dynamic change of human population.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Breast-Surgeons
CL  - Las Vegas, NV
AB  - Background. Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a significant complication for women undergoing treatment. We assessed BCRL incidence and risk factors in a large population-based cohort.Methods. We utilized the Olmsted County Rochester Epidemiology Project Breast Cancer Cohort from 1990-2010 and ascertained BCRL and risk factors. The cumulative incidence estimator was used to estimate the rate of BCRL; competing risks regression was used for multivariable analysis.Results. A total of 1794 patients with stage 0-3 breast cancer with a median of 10 years follow-up were included. The cumulative incidence of BCRL diagnosis within 5 years was 9.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-10.5%]. No BCRL events occurred among patients without axillary surgery. In the axillary surgery subset (n = 1512), the 5-year incidence of BCRL was 5.3% in sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery and 15.9% in axillary dissection (ALND) patients (p < 0.001). In patients treated with surgery only, BCRL rates were not different between ALND versus SLN (3.5 and 4.1% at 5 years, p = 0.36). Addition of breast or chest wall radiation more than doubled the BCRL rate in ALND patients (3.5 vs. 9.5% at 5 years, p = 0.01). The groups with highest risk (> 25% at 5 years) all involved ALND with nodal RT and/or anthracycline/cytoxan + taxane chemotherapy. In multivariable analysis of patients with any axillary surgery factors significantly associated with BCRL were ALND, chemotherapy, radiation, and obesity.Conclusions. BCRL is a sequelae of multimodal breast cancer treatment and risk is multifactorial. BCRL rates are higher in patients receiving chemotherapy, radiation, ALND, more advanced disease stage, and higher body mass index.

TI  - Localizing the Clipped Node in Patients with Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Early Learning Experience and Challenges
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Placement of a clip in the positive node in patients presenting with node-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) allows resection of the clipped node at SLN surgery and improves the accuracy of surgical staging. We sought to evaluate our experience with SLN surgery with resection of the clipped node since incorporation into our practice.Methods. With Institutional Review Board approval, we evaluated all breast cancer patients with a percutaneous biopsy-positive axillary lymph node, clipped at the time of diagnosis, who underwent NAC followed by surgery.Results. Fifty-six node-positive patients were identified. Eighteen patients (32.1%) underwent axillary dissection without sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery, and 38 patients underwent SLN surgery (18 patients underwent SLN surgery alone, and 20 patients underwent SLN surgery and axillary lymph node dissection). In 25 patients, preoperative localization of the clipped node with an I-125 radioactive seed was attempted. This was performed by ultrasound guidance in 18 cases (72%), computed tomography (CT) guidance in two cases (8%), and was unable to be localized in five cases (20%). In all 20 seed-localized cases, the seed and the clipped node were resected along with additional SLNs. In 14 patients without seed localization (nine not attempted, five unable to be localized), the clipped node was resected in 11 cases (79%)-as one of the SLNs (6), by intraoperative ultrasound (4), or by palpation (1). Overall, the clipped node was resected in 31/34 (91%) cases.Conclusion. Preoperative ultrasound localization of the clipped node was successful in 72% of cases. Alternatively, the clipped node can be identified by preoperative CT, routine SLN surgery, intraoperative ultrasound, or palpation.

TI  - Determining wetland spatial extent and seasonal variations of the inundated area using multispectral remote sensing
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands can only be well managed if their spatial location and extent are accurately documented, which presents a problem as wetland type and morphology are highly variable. Current efforts to delineate wetland extent are varied, resulting in a host of inconsistent and incomparable inventories. This study, done in the Witbank Dam Catchment in Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, explores a remote-sensing technique to delineate wetland extent and assesses the seasonal variations of the inundated area. The objective was to monitor the spatio-temporal changes of wetlands over time through remote sensing and GIS for effective wetland management. Multispectral satellite images, together with a digital elevation model (DEM), were used to delineate wetland extent. The seasonal variations of the inundated area were assessed through an analysis of monthly water indices derived from the normalised difference water index (NDWI). Landsat images and DEM were used to delineate wetland extent and MODIS images were used to assess seasonal variation of the inundated area. A time-series trend analysis on the delineated wetlands shows a declining tendency from 2000 to 2015, which could worsen in the coming few years if no remedial action is taken. Wetland area declined by 19% in the study area over the period under review. An analysis of NDWI indices on the wetland area showed that wetland inundated area is highly variable, exhibiting an increasing variability over time. An overlay of wetland area on cultivated land showed that 21% of the wetland area is subjected to cultivation which is a major contributing factor to wetland degradation.

T2  - BIOANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Dried blood spots (DBS) offer significant ethical and scientific advantages; however preparation of calibration curves often times, off-sets some of these advantages. We have developed a methodology wherein small volumes of external calibration standards can be spiked on to blank DBS cards. Results: A total of 2 mu l of stock solution spotted on to blank blood spots yielded concentrations that were comparable to those obtained using conventional DBS method. The stability of six analytes on 10-day-old blank spots was within 80-120%. The new methodology was successfully applied to a hydroxycholorquine mouse pharmacokinetics study. Conclusion: Blank DBS samples can be opportunistically prepared from overweight or satellite animals, be stored, and subsequently spiked with standards to prepare calibration standards.

M3  - Review
AB  - Bordetellae, pathogenic to mammals, produce an immunomodulatory adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT or AC-Hly) that enables them to overcome the innate immune defense of the host. CyaA subverts host phagocytic cells by an orchestrated action of its functional domains, where an extremely catalytically active adenylyl cyclase enzyme is delivered into phagocyte cytosol by a pore-forming repeat-in-toxin (RTX) cytolysin moiety. By targeting sentinel cells expressing the complement receptor 3, known as the CD11b/CD18 ((M2)) integrin, CyaA compromises the bactericidal functions of host phagocytes and supports infection of host airways by Bordetellae. Here, we review the state of knowledge on structural and functional aspects of CyaA toxin action, placing particular emphasis on signaling mechanisms by which the toxin-produced 3,5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) subverts the physiology of phagocytic cells.

AB  - Objective Report two positive sentinel node biopsies for sinonasal melanoma.Design Retrospective review.Setting Academic tertiary care center.Participants Patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy for sinonasal melanoma between November 1, 2014 and November 1, 2015.Main Outcome Measures Clinical course.Results Two patients were identified. Patient 1 (83M) presented with a sinonasal melanoma anterior to the left inferior turbinate and was clinically N0 neck. Lymphoscintigraphy revealed two sentinel nodes in the ipsilateral and three in the contralateral cervical basins. The left level I sentinel node was positive for melanoma and lymphadenectomy showed no additional metastases. Patient 2 (71F) presented after incomplete resection of a sinonasal melanoma of the left posterior maxillary sinus wall and was clinically N0 neck. Lymphoscintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) localization revealed one sentinel node in the parapharyngeal space and another in the ipsilateral cervical basin. Metastatic melanoma was found in both nodes and completion lymphadenectomy was negative for additional disease. Both patients developed distant metastasis in less than 1year after surgical resection but responded well to adjuvant immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agents.Conclusion Sentinel node biopsy for sinonasal melanoma can provide crucial clinical evidence of regional metastasis prior to overt clinical signs and symptoms. This intraoperative tool has the potential to improve detection of regional metastasis and improve long-term outcomes of this aggressive malignancy.

TI  - Assessing a Multi-Platform Data Fusion Technique in Capturing Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Heterogeneous Dryland Ecosystems in Topographically Complex Terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-limited ecosystems encompass approximately 40% of terrestrial land mass and play a critical role in modulating Earth's climate and provisioning ecosystem services to humanity. Spaceborne remote sensing is a critical tool for characterizing ecohydrologic patterns and advancing the understanding of the interactions between atmospheric forcings and ecohydrologic responses. Fine to medium scale spatial and temporal resolutions are needed to capture the spatial heterogeneity and the temporally intermittent response of these ecosystems to environmental forcings. Techniques combining complementary remote sensing datasets have been developed, but the heterogeneous nature of these regions present significant challenges. Here we investigate the capacity of one such approach, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm, to map Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 30 m spatial resolution and at a daily temporal resolution in an experimental watershed in southwest Idaho, USA. The Dry Creek Experimental Watershed captures an ecotone from a sagebrush steppe ecosystem to evergreen needle-leaf forests along an approximately 1000 m elevation gradient. We used STARFM to fuse NDVI retrievals from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat during the course of a growing season (April to September). Specifically we input to STARFM a pair of Landsat NDVI retrievals bracketing a sequence of daily MODIS NDVI retrievals to yield daily estimates of NDVI at resolutions of 30 m. In a suite of data denial experiments we compared these STARFM predictions against corresponding Landsat NDVI retrievals and characterized errors in predicted NDVI. We investigated how errors vary as a function of vegetation functional type and topographic aspect. We find that errors in predicting NDVI were highest during green-up and senescence and lowest during the middle of the growing season. Absolute errors were generally greatest in tree-covered portions of the watershed and lowest in locations characterized by grasses/bare ground. On average, relative errors in predicted average NDVI were greatest in grass/bare ground regions, on south-facing aspects, and at the height of the growing season. We present several ramifications revealed in this study for the use of multi-sensor remote sensing data for the study of spatiotemporal ecohydrologic patterns in dryland ecosystems.

TI  - Morphotectonic analysis of Kosi River basin in Kumaun Lesser Himalaya: an evidence of neotectonics
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan arc is one of the prominent sites on Earth, for ongoing research on active tectonics because of the frequent occurrence of earthquakes of low-moderate intensity that occur in various sectors of the region. The present study is an attempt to decipher the active uplift and relative tectonic activity in Kosi River basin, a part of the southern Kumaun Himalayas. Several morphotectonic parameters such as asymmetry factor (AF), hypsometric integral (HI), mountain front sinuosity (Smf), channel sinuosity (S), and basin elongation ratio (Re) have been calculated with an objective to compare different sub-basins in the Kosi watershed that may prove useful in deciphering of relative tectonic activity. The watershed delineation of the Kosi River basin as well as its subbasins, and detailed drainage network has been accomplished by using the CARTOSAT-1 DEM with the help of ArcGIS 10.3 software, using TauDEM tool and Global Mapper 18. Analysis of these morphotectonic parameters reveals that although the whole of the Kosi River basin lies in the seismically active zone, but the northern part along North Almora Thrust (NAT), central part around South Almora Thrust (SAT), Ramgarh Thrust (RT), and southern part along Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) are tectonically more active and undergoing neotectonic rejuvenation. The information derived would prove beneficial in identification of hazard prone areas and in planning of socio-economic development in mountainous terrain.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: comparison of fluorescence dye with traditional radiocolloid and blue
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer (EMCA) is rapidly gaining acceptance in the clinical community. As compared to a full lymphadenectomy in every patient, to a selective lymphadenectomy after frozen section of uterus in selected patients with intrauterine risk factors or to a strategy in which a lymphadenectomy is always omitted, SLN mapping seems to be a reasonable and oncologically safe middle ground. Various protocols can be used when applying an SLN mapping. In this manuscript we review the characteristics, toxicity and clinical impact of technetium-99m radiocolloid (Tc-99m), of the blue dyes (methylene blue, isosulfan blue and patent blue) and of indocyanine green (ICG). ICG has an excellent toxicity profile, has higher overall and bilateral detection rates as compared to blue dyes and higher bilateral detection rates as compared to a combination of Tc-99m and blue dye. The detrimental effect of BMI on the detection rates is attenuated when ICG is used as a tracer. The ease of use of the ICG SLN mapping is perceived by the patients as a better quality of care delivered. Whenever possible, ICG should be favored over the other tracers for SLN mapping in EMCA patients.

TI  - Earthquake Triggering Inferred from Rupture Histories, DInSAR Ground Deformation and Stress-Transfer Modelling: The Case of Central Italy During August 2016-January 2017
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On August 24, October 26 and 30, 2016, Central Apennines (Italy) were hit by three shallow, normal faulting very strong earthquakes rupturing in an NW-SE striking zone. Event 3 (Norcia) occurred between event 1 (Amatrice) at the SE and event 2 (Visso) at the NW of the entire rupture zone. The rupture histories of the three events, as revealed by teleseismic P-wave inversion, showed that all were characterized by bilateral rupture process with stronger rupture directivity towards NW for events 1 and 3 and towards SSE for event 2. Maximum seismic slip of 1.2, 0.8, and 1.4 m in the hypocenter and magnitude of M (w) 6.2, 6.1, and 6.5 were calculated for the three events, respectively. DInSaR measurements based on Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite images showed ground deformation directivity from events 1 and 2 towards event 3, which is consistent with the rupture process directivity. For events 1, 2, and 3, the maximum ground subsidence was found equal to 0.2, 0.15, and 0.35 m. Based on rupture directivity and ground deformation pattern, we put forward the hypothesis that the area of the second event was stress loaded by the first one and that both the first and second earthquake events caused stress loading in the area, where the third event ruptured. Coulomb stress-transfer modelling yields strong evidence in favor of our hypothesis. The stress in the fault plane of event 2 was increased by similar to 0.19 bars due to loading from event 1. Event 3 fault plane was loaded by an amount of similar to 2 bars, due to the combined stress transfer from the two previous events, despite its proximity to the negative/positive lobe boundary. The three events produced combined stress loading of more than +0.5 bar along the Apennines to the NW and SE of the entire rupture zone. In the SE stress lobe, a series of strong earthquakes of M (w) 5.3, 5.6, and 5.7 occurred on January 18, 2017, but likely, seismic potential remains in the area. We consider that in the NW and more extensive stress lobe, the seismic potential has also elevated due to stress loading.

TI  - Role of ICG-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanocolloid for sentinel lymph node detection in cervical cancer: a pilot study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be used for nodal staging in early cervical cancer. For this purpose, the tracers most commonly used are radiotracers based on technetium. For the last decade, indocyanine green (ICG) has been used as a tracer for SLNB in other malignancies with excellent results and, more recently, a combination of ICG and a radiotracer has been shown to have the advantages of both tracers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ICG-(99m)Tcnanocolloid in SLN detection in patients with cervical cancer.Methods This prospective study included 16 patients with cervical cancer. The hybrid tracer was injected the day (1921 h) before surgery for planar and SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy. Blue dye was administered periorificially in 14 patients. SLNs were removed according to their distribution on lymphoscintigraphy and when radioactive, fluorescent and/or stained with blue dye. Nodal specimens were pathologically analysed for metastases including by immunochemistry.Results Lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT showed drainage in all patients. A total of 69 SLNs were removed, of which 66 were detected by their radioactivity signal and 67 by their fluorescence signal. Blue dye identified only 35 SLNs in 12 of the 14 patients (85.7%). All patients showed bilateral pelvic drainage. Micrometastases were diagnosed in two patients, and were the only lymphatic nodes involved.Conclusions SLNB with ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid is feasible and safe in patients with early cervical cancer. This hybrid tracer provided bilateral SLN detection in all patients and a higher detection rate than blue dye, so it could become an alternative to the combined technique.

TI  - Monitoring the brazilian pasturelands: A new mapping approach based on the landsat 8 spectral and temporal domains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In a world marked by a rapid population expansion and an unprecedented increase in per capita income and consumption, sustainable food production is certainly the most pressing issue affecting mankind. Within this context, the brazilian pasturelands, the main land-use form in the country, constitute a particularly important asset as a land reserve, which, through improved land-use strategies and intensification, can meet food security goals and contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we utilized the entire set of Landsat 8 images available for Brazil in 2015, from which dozens of seasonal metrics were derived, to produce, through objective criteria and automated classification strategies, a new pasture map for the country. Based on the Random Forest algorithm, individually modelled and applied to each one of the 380 Landsat scenes covering the Brazilian territory, our map showed an overall accuracy of 87%. Another result of this study was the thorough spatial and temporal assessment of Landsat 8 data availability in Brazil, which indicated that about 80% of the country had 12 or fewer observations free of clouds or cloud shadows in 2015.

TI  - Sharpening the VNIR and SWIR Bands of Sentinel-2A Imagery through Modified Selected and Synthesized Band Schemes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the bands of a Sentinel-2A image with spatial resolutions of 20 m and 60 m are sharpened to a spatial resolution of 10 m to obtain visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 10 m. In particular, we propose a two-step sharpening algorithm for Sentinel-2A imagery based on modified, selected, and synthesized band schemes using layer-stacked bands to sharpen Sentinel-2A images. The modified selected and synthesized band schemes proposed in this study extend the existing band schemes for sharpening Sentinel-2A images with spatial resolutions of 20 m and 60 m to improve the pan-sharpening accuracy by changing the combinations of bands used for multiple linear regression analysis through band-layer stacking. The proposed algorithms are applied to the pan-sharpening algorithm based on component substitution (CS) and a multiresolution analysis (MRA), and our results are then compared to the sharpening results when using sharpening algorithms based on existing band schemes. The experimental results show that the sharpening results from the proposed algorithm are improved in terms of the spatial and spectral properties when compared to existing methods. However, the results of the sharpening algorithm when applied to our modified band schemes show differing tendencies. With the modified, selected band scheme, the sharpening result when applying the CS-based algorithm is higher than the result when applying the MRA-based algorithm. However, the quality of the sharpening results when using the MRA-based algorithm with the modified synthesized band scheme is higher than that when using the CS-based algorithm.

TI  - A quantitative method to evaluate the performance of topographic correction models used to improve land cover identification
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic correction methods have been widely used prior to land cover identification in sloping terrain because the topographic variation on the Earth's surface can interfere with the classifications. The topographic correction involves the normalization of brightness or surface reflectance values from the slanted to the horizontal plane. Several topographic correction models have been proposed, and a quantitative evaluation method is needed for these models because the performance can vary according to the surface cover types and spectral bands. In this study, we proposed an efficient method to evaluate the performance of topographic correction models through measuring the histogram structural similarity (HSSIM) index estimated from the sunlit and sun-shaded slope areas before and after the correction. We tested the HSSIM index by using three different land cover types derived from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and eight commonly used topographic correction models. When the proposed HSSIM index was compared with the visual analysis technique, the results matched exactly. Using the HSSIM index, the best correction methods were then determined, and the best ones included the statistical-empirical or SCS+C methods (where SCS+C refers to the sun-canopy-sensor plus C-correction) for the R, G, and B bands and the Minnaert+SCS method for the NIR, SWIR-1, and SWIR-2 bands. These results indicate that (i) the HSSIM index enables quantitative performance evaluations of topographic correction models and (ii) the HSSIM index can be used to determine the best topographic correction method for particular land cover identification applications.

TI  - Study of Volcanic Activity at Different Time Scales Using Hypertemporal Land Surface Temperature Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a method for detecting subtle spatiotemporal signal fluctuations to monitor volcanic activity. Whereas midwave infrared data are commonly used for volcanic hot spot detection, our approach utilizes hypertemporal longwave infrared-based land surface temperature (LST) data. Using LST data of the second-generation European Meteorological Satellites, we study (a) a paroxysmal, 1day long eruption of Mount Etna (Italy); (b) a prolonged, 6month period of effusive and lateral lava flows of the Nyamuragira volcano (Democratic Republic of Congo); and (c) intermittent activity in the permanent lava lake of Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of Congo) over a period of 2years (2011-2012). We compare our analysis with published ground-based observations and satellite-based alert systems; results agree on the periods of increased volcanic activity and quiescence. We further apply our analysis on mid-infrared and long-infrared brightness temperatures and compare the results. We conclude that our study enables the use of LST data for monitoring volcanic dynamics at different time scales, can complement existing methodologies, and allows for use of long time series from older sensors that do not provide midwave infrared data.

TI  - Scaling effects on spring phenology detections from MODIS data at multiple spatial resolutions over the contiguous United States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely retrieved from satellite data at multiple spatial resolutions, but the spatial scaling effects on LSP detection are poorly understood. In this study, we collected enhanced vegetation index (EVI, 250 m) from collection 6 MOD13Q1 product over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in 2007 and 2008, and generated a set of multiple spatial resolution EVI data by resampling 250 m to 2 x 250 m and 3 x 250 m, 4 x 250 m,..., 35 x 250 m. These EVI time series were then used to detect the start of spring season (SOS) at various spatial resolutions. Further the SOS variation across scales was examined at each coarse resolution grid (35 x 250 m approximate to 8 km, refer to as reference grid) and ecoregion. Finally, the SOS scaling effects were associated with landscape fragment, proportion of primary land cover type, and spatial variability of seasonal greenness variation within each reference grid. The results revealed the influences of satellite spatial resolutions on SOS retrievals and the related impact factors. Specifically, SOS significantly varied lineally or logarithmically across scales although the relationship could be either positive or negative. The overall SOS values averaged from spatial resolutions between 250 m and 35 x 250 m at large ecosystem regions were generally similar with a difference less than 5 days, while the SOS values within the reference grid could differ greatly in some local areas. Moreover, the standard deviation of SOS across scales in the reference grid was less than 5 days in more than 70% of area over the CONUS, which was smaller in northeastern than in southern and western regions. The SOS scaling effect was significantly associated with heterogeneity of vegetation properties characterized using land landscape fragment, proportion of primary land cover type, and spatial variability of seasonal greenness variation, but the latter was the most important impact factor.

TI  - The use of ultrasound in the clinical re-staging of the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Ultrasound (US) is the imaging modality of choice for staging the axilla prior to surgery in patients with breast cancer (BC). High pathological complete response rates in the axilla after NACT mean a more conservative approach to surgery can be considered. Radiological re-staging is important in this decision making. After the presentation of results from ACOSOG Z1071 in December 2012, formal ultrasound re-assessment of the axilla after primary therapy was specifically requested in our institution. We report on the accuracy of axillary US (aUS) for identifying residual axillary disease post-NACT.Methods: Data were collected on patients who had proven axillary disease prior to NACT and underwent axillary lymph node dissection after NACT between January 2013 and December 2015. Post-chemotherapy aUS reports and axillary pathology reports were classified as positive or negative for abnormal lymph nodes and for residual disease (cCR and pCR respectively).Results: The sensitivity and specificity of aUS was 71% and 88% respectively. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. The false negative rate was 29%.Conclusions: Axillary ultrasound provides clinically useful information post-NACT, which will guide surgical decision-making. Patients with aUS-negative axillae are likely to have a lower false negative rate of SLNB after NACT (Boughey et al.). However, aUS does not replace the need to identify and biopsy the nodes which were proven to be positive prior to NACT. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - DNA damage and cytotoxicity induced on common carp by pollutants in water from an urban reservoir. Madin reservoir, a case study
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Madin Reservoir provides a substantial amount of drinking water to two municipalities close to Mexico City metropolitan area. However, it receives untreated wastewater discharges from domestic sources in the towns of Nuevo Madin and others, as well as diverse pollutants which are hauled by the Rio Tlal-nepantla from its upper reaches, so that the xenobiotics in the reservoir are highly diverse in terms of type and quantity. Previous studies showed that MR is contaminated with xenobiotics such as Al, Hg and Fe, as well as NSAIDs, at concentrations exceeding the limits established for aquatic life protection. These pollutants have been shown to induce oxidative stress on Cyprinus carpio and may therefore also damage the genetic material of exposed organisms, eliciting cytotoxicity as well. The present study aimed to determine the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced on blood, liver and gill of C carpio by the pollutants present in MR water. Specimens were exposed to water from five sampling sites and the following biomarkers were evaluated: DNA damage by comet assay, frequency of micronuclei, apoptosis by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activity. Significant increases relative to the control group (P < 0.05) were found with all biomarkers in all tissues evaluated, with the level of damage differing between sampling sites. In conclusion, pollutants present in MR water are genotoxic and cytotoxic to C. carpio, and this sentinel species, coupled with the biomarkers evaluated herein, is a reliable tool for assessing the health risk to wildlife posed by exposure to pollutants in freshwater bodies.

TI  - Description of a reproducible anatomically based surgical algorithm for detection of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To describe and evaluate a reproducible, anatomically based surgical algorithm, including reinjection of tracer to enhance technical success rate, for detection of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. A prospective study of 102 consecutive women with high risk EC scheduled for robotic surgery was conducted. Following cervical injection of a fluorescent dye, an algorithm for trans- and retroperitoneal identification of tracer display in the lower and upper paracervical pathways was strictly adhered to. To enhance the technical success rate, this included ipsilateral reinjection of tracer in case of non-display of any lymphatic pathway. The lymphatic pathways were kept intact by opening the avascular planes. To minimize disturbance from leaking dye, removal of SLNs was first performed along the lower paracervical (presacral) pathways followed by the more caudal upper paracervical pathways. In each pathway, the juxtauterine node with an afferent lymph vessel was defined as an SLN. After removal of SLNs, a complete pelvic and, unless contraindicated, infrarenal paraaortic lymph node dissection was performed.Results. The bilateral detection rate including tracer reinjection was 96%. All 24 (23.5%) node positive patients had at least one metastatic SLN. Presacral lymph node metastases were discovered in 33.3% of the node positive patients. One patient (4.2%) had an isolated presacral lymph node metastasis.Conclusions. The described cranial-to-caudal anatomically based surgical SLN algorithm, including a presacral dissection and reinjection of tracer, results in a high SLN detection rate and identified all patients with lymph node metastases.

TI  - Mesospheric temperature trends derived from standard phase-height measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - New homogeneous time series of daily standard phase-height (SPH) and daily plasma scale-height (PSH) have been derived from a 50-year long-radio-wave measurement of the broadcasting station Allouis (France, 162 kHz). The signal was received at Kiihlungsbom (54 degrees N, 12 degrees E, Mecklenburg, Germany) and the present series is a third release. The daily time series of SPH shows in its spectrum dominant modes which are typical for the solar cycle (SC), for El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and for quasi-biannual oscillation (QBO), indicating solar and lower atmospheric influences. Surprisingly, the time series of daily PSH shows a band of dominant cycles larger than 16 years.In order to exclude the influence of the winter anomaly in the determination of column-integrated mesospheric temperature trends the phase-height-temperature procedure is confined to summer months.The derived thickness temperature of the mesosphere decreased statistically significant over the period 1959-2008 after pre-whitening with summer mean of solar sun spot numbers. The trend value is in the order of about-1.05 K/decade if the stratopause trend is excluded. The linear regression is more pronounced, -1.35 K/decade for the period of 1963-1985 (2 SCs), but weaker, -0.51 K/decade during 1986-2008 (last 2 SCs). The linear regression is in very good agreement with a mean column-integrated mesospheric trend derived from OHP-Lidar temperatures on a monthly mean basis for the last two SCs.This clearly shows that the thickness temperature of the mesosphere derived from phase-height measurement is a useful proxy for the long-term summer temperature change in the mesosphere from 1959 until 2008.

TI  - Serological Evidence of Infection by <i>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</i> in Dogs with Leishmaniasis
T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis prevalent in Latin American countries, caused by the dimorphic fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii. The habitat of these fungi in nature remains undefined, although it is believed that infection occurs by inhalation of infective propagules present in soil. Sentinel animals, such as dogs, can be valuable epidemiological markers of paracoccidioidomycosis. Taking into account that paracoccidioidomycosis and visceral leishmaniasis may occur in the same area, the objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of P. brasiliensis infection in dogs positive for Leishmania sp. Serum samples of dogs positive (n = 199) and negative (n = 101) for Leishmania sp. were analyzed by the immunodiffusion test using P. brasiliensis exoantigen, and 22 samples (7.3%) were positive. The serum samples positive in the immunodiffusion test were also analyzed by Western blotting using the P. brasiliensis gp43 recombinant protein, and 86% of the samples were positive. A high positive correlation (r = 0.96) between positivity for Leishmania sp. and P. brasiliensis was observed. These data suggest an association between leishmaniasis and paracoccidioidomycosis in dogs.

TI  - Quantifying Snow Cover Distribution in Semiarid Regions Combining Satellite and Terrestrial Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean mountainous regions constitute a climate change hotspot where snow plays a crucial role in water resources. The characteristic snow-patched distribution over these areas makes spatial resolution the limiting factor for its correct representation. This work assesses the estimation of snow cover area and the contribution of the patchy areas to the seasonal and annual regime of the snow in a semiarid mountainous range, the Sierra Nevada Mountains in southern Spain, by means of Landsat imagery combined with terrestrial photography (TP). Two methodologies were tested: (1) difference indexes to produce binary maps; and (2) spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to obtain fractional maps; their results were validated from ground-truth data by means of TP in a small monitored control area. Both methods provided satisfactory results when the snow cover was above 85% of the study area; below this threshold, the use of spectral mixture analysis is clearly recommended. Mixed pixels can reach up to 40% of the area during wet and cold years, their importance being larger as altitude increases, proving the usefulness of TP for assessing the accuracy of remote data sources. Mixed pixels identification allows for determining the more vulnerable areas facing potential changes of the snow regime due to global warming and climate variability.

TI  - Including cover crops during fallow periods for increasing ecosystem services: Is it possible in croplands of Southern South America?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of cover crops (CC) into annual crop rotations improves the provision of multiple ecosystem services in time and represents an alternative paradigm to achieve sustainability goals. In spite of the benefits that several authors have exposed, CC are seldom included in rotations because their water consumption could affect cash crops development. We evaluated the possibility of including CC in the agricultural area of Rio de la Plata grasslands and identified its optimal duration depending on both environmental conditions and crop rotations. Fallow areas were located based on NDVI time series derived from MOMS satellite images and the influence of CC on the subsequent cash crop was evaluated based on modeled changes in soil water contents at the sowing date of the cash crop. Our land use classifications revealed that single crop rotations, mostly summer crops with winter fallow periods, occupy a large proportion (89%) of the agricultural portion of the Rio de la Plata grasslands studied. In most of the region, sowing CC of 3 to 5 months of length during fallow periods had little impact on soil water contents at the sowing date of the following cash crop. As expected, the optimal CC duration in the different sub-regions increased with the average rainfall occurred during the fallow period. The possibility of sowing CC without affecting cash crops yields opens the opportunity for intensifying crop sequences in the region, oriented to mitigate environmental concerns raised by monocultures and agricultural simplification.

TI  - Internal and external potential-field estimation from regional vector data at varying satellite altitude
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - When modelling satellite data to recover a global planetary magnetic or gravitational potential field, the method of choice remains their analysis in terms of spherical harmonics. When only regional data are available, or when data quality varies strongly with geographic location, the inversion problem becomes severely ill-posed. In those cases, adopting explicitly local methods is to be preferred over adapting global ones (e.g. by regularization). Here, we develop the theory behind a procedure to invert for planetary potential fields from vector observations collected within a spatially bounded region at varying satellite altitude. Our method relies on the construction of spatiospectrally localized bases of functions that mitigate the noise amplification caused by downward continuation (from the satellite altitude to the source) while balancing the conflicting demands for spatial concentration and spectral limitation. The 'altitude-cognizant' gradient vector Slepian functions (AC-GVSF) enjoy a noise tolerance under downward continuation that is much improved relative to the 'classical' gradient vector Slepian functions (CL-GVSF), which do not factor satellite altitude into their construction. Furthermore, venturing beyond the realm of their first application, published in a preceding paper, in the present article we extend the theory to being able to handle both internal and external potential-field estimation. Solving simultaneously for internal and external fields under the limitation of regional data availability reduces internal-field artefacts introduced by downward-continuing unmodelled external fields, as we show with numerical examples. We explain our solution strategies on the basis of analytic expressions for the behaviour of the estimation bias and variance of models for which signal and noise are uncorrelated, (essentially) space-and band-limited, and spectrally (almost) white. The AC-GVSF are optimal linear combinations of vector spherical harmonics. Their construction is not altogether very computationally demanding when the concentration domains (the regions of spatial concentration) have circular symmetry, for example, on spherical caps or rings-even when the spherical-harmonic bandwidth is large. Data inversion proceeds by solving for the expansion coefficients of truncated function sequences, by least-squares analysis in a reduced-dimensional space. Hence, our method brings high-resolution regional potential-field modelling from incomplete and noisy vector-valued satellite data within reach of contemporary desktop machines.

TI  - A method for estimating direct normal irradiation from GOES geostationary satellite imagery: Validation and application over Northeast Brazil
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping and monitoring of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is most relevant for the proper installation of solar power plants that use concentrating solar systems. This paper presents a satellite-based method for estimating DNI and daily direct normal irradiation (Q(n)) that uses a minimal set of regional meteorological information and avoids empirical adjustment with ground-based radiometric data. The focus of the validation and application were on the Northeast Brazil region (NEB), which exhibits high solar radiation levels throughout the year. Two basic parameters for satellite-derived DNI estimates are: (i) DNI under clear-sky conditions DNIclear (computed from the REST model) and (ii) cloud cover C (estimated from GOES visible imagery). The first validations were performed by comparison with measurements from three radiometric stations of the SONDA network in the NEB (Petrofina, Natal and Sao Luis) during 2007-2008. Overall, the results confirmed the good performance of the proposed model. DNI daily cycles in conditions of clear and partially cloudy skies were represented satisfactorily, with daily average errors within +/- 25 W m(-2). Good linearity was found between the measured and satellite estimated Q(n), with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.84 to 0.89. The average values of MBE (Mean Bias Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) over all sites were -1.7% and 18.7%, respectively. In addition, seasonal and annual average maps of direct normal irradiation were generated over NEB for 2008. It was found that the spatial-temporal variability of Q(n) is strongly modulated by meteorological systems acting in the region, such as the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone). The mapped results reveal that the highest value was approximately 22 MJ m(-2) on an annual average basis, and higher values occurred in areas of semi-arid climate. The proposed satellite-based model may be applied for providing information of DNI (with a spatial resolution of 4 km), particularly over regions without in situ measurements, and suggests good accuracy for climatic and solar resource studies.

TI  - Comprehensive monitoring of Bangladesh tree cover inside and outside of forests, 2000-2014
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach for satellite-based comprehensive national tree cover change assessment was developed and applied in Bangladesh, a country where trees outside of forests play an important role in the national economy and carbon sequestration. Tree cover change area was quantified using the integration of wall-to-wall Landsat-based mapping with a higher spatial resolution sample-based assessment. The total national tree canopy cover area was estimated as 3165 500 +/- 186 600 ha in the year 2000, with trees outside forests making up 54% of total canopy cover. Total tree canopy cover increased by 135 700 (+/- 116 600) ha (4.3%) during the 2000-2014 time interval. Bangladesh exhibits a national tree cover dynamic where net change is rather small, but gross dynamics significant and variable by forest type. Despite the overall gain in tree cover, results revealed the ongoing clearing of natural forests, especially within the Chittagong hill tracts. While forests decreased their tree cover area by 83 600 ha, the trees outside forests (including tree plantations, village woodlots, and agroforestry) increased their canopy area by 219 300 ha. Our results demonstrated method capability to quantify tree canopy cover dynamics within a fine-scale agricultural landscape. Our approach for comprehensive monitoring of tree canopy cover may be recommended for operational implementation in Bangladesh and other countries with significant tree cover outside of forests.

TI  - Improvement of Lake Ice Thickness Retrieval From MODIS Satellite Data Using a Thermodynamic Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of ice thickness are limited in high latitude regions, at a time when they are increasingly being requested by operational ice centers. This study aims to improve the retrieval of lake ice thickness using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA's Aqua (P.M.) and Terra (A.M.) satellites. The accuracy of ice thickness retrievals based on MODIS lake ice surface temperature (LIST) is investigated using a commonly used heat balance equation and the retrieved ice thicknesses are compared to in situ measurements from the Canadian Ice Service. The accuracy of ice thickness estimates is improved when using snow depth from the 1-D thermodynamic lake ice model Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) rather than an empirical relationship between snow depth and ice thickness utilized in the recent investigations. Taking into account all data over the study period (2002-2014), the mean bias error and the root-mean-square error are reduced from -0.42 to 0.07 m and 0.58 to 0.17 m, respectively, with the novel approach proposed herein. However, this approach is limited to ice thickness estimations of less than ca. 1.7 m.

TI  - Hands-on Horticulture: A Course for Building Enrollments in Plant Science Courses
T2  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A course was developed at Cornell University for the purpose of attracting nonmajors from across the university, instilling in them an appreciation for horticulture and then encouraging them to take additional horticulture and plant science courses. The course incorporates many engaging and interesting horticultural activities, with scientific concepts and horticultural techniques conveyed almost exclusively through hands-on instruction using the campus as a laboratory. Experiential learning and culinary experiences are key components of the course. Student evaluations are very high (5-year average of 4.94/5.00 with five representing "excellent''), and the class fills to capacity each spring semester with diverse students from across campus. Enrollment in other horticulture classes has increased since the course has been offered. Forty-three percent of students who took Hands-On Horticulture as a freshman, sophomore, or junior subsequently enrolled in at least one other plant science course. Participating horticulture faculty also find the class to be fertile ground for recruiting research and field assistants. Students report an increase in well-being and reduction in stress while taking the course, and write about how their worldview has changed after the course experience. This class has allowed students to discover or rediscover their role and connection to nature while simultaneously providing them horticultural skills and understanding of scientific principles.

TI  - Estimation of lakes water storage and their changes on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau based on bathymetric and Landsat data and driving force analyses
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water storage changes in four lakes were analyzed based on in situ bathymetric survey data and Landsat images in the extremely dry and cold northwestern Tibetan Plateau region. The results indicated that Bangdag Co and Aksai Chin Lake, which are glacier-fed and closed lakes, showed decreasing trends from 1976 to 1996, then increasing trend from 1996 to 2015, during which period water storage increased by 1.24 km(3) and 1.37 km(3), respectively, and 65% of the water storage increase in Aksai Chin Lake during this period occurring in 2006 and 2013. Longmu Co, which is a non-glacier-fed lake, exhibited little variation from 1976 to 1996 and a slight increase of 0.1 km(3) from 1996 to 2015. The precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation (Ep) trends indicated that lake shrinkage from 1976 to 1996 was attributed to less precipitation and less meltwater at lower surface air temperatures. Decreased Ep (15.5 mm/y) contributed approximately 2% and 4% to the lake expansion of Aksai Chin Lake and Bangdag Co from 2000 to 2009. Based on the assumption of equal precipitation-evaporation for the study area, glacial meltwater contributed 76.6% to the lake expansion of Bangdag Co from 2000 to 2015. Because change in lakes' water storage showed a large difference between glacier-fed lakes and nonglacier-fed lakes from 1996 to 2015 under relatively high precipitation conditions, it is suggested that glacial meltwater exerted more influence on increasing lake water storage associated with rising temperatures.

TI  - Radiometric validation of atmospheric correction for MERIS in the Baltic Sea based on continuous observations from ships and AERONET-OC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea that is optically dominated by coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and has relatively low sun elevation which makes accurate ocean colour remote sensing challenging in these waters. The high absorption, low scattering properties of the Baltic Sea are representative of other optically similar water bodies including the Arctic Ocean, Black Sea, coastal regions adjacent to the CDOM-rich estuaries such as the Amazon, and highly absorbing lakes where radiometric validation is essential in order to develop accurate remote sensing algorithms. Previous studies in this region mainly focused on the validation and improvement of standard Chlorophyll-a (Chl alpha) and attenuation coefficient (k(d)) ocean colour products. The primary input to derive these is the water-leaving radiance (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and it is therefore fundamental to obtain the most accurate L-w or R-rs before deriving higher level products. To this end, the retrieval accuracy of R-rs from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery using six atmospheric correction processors was assessed through above-water measurements at two sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network for Ocean Colour (AERONET-OC; 363 measurements) and a shipbome autonomous platform from which the highest number of measurements were obtained (4986 measurements). The six processors tested were the CoastColour processor (CC), the Case 2 Regional processor for lakes (C2R-Lakes), the Case 2 Regional CoastColour processor (C2R-CC), the FUB/WeW water processor (FUB), the MERIS ground segment processor (MEGS) and POLYMER. All processors except for CC had small average absolute percentage differences (psi) in the wavelength range from 490 nm to 709 nm (psi < 40%), while other bands had larger differences with psi > 60%. Compared to in situ values, the R-rs(709)/R-rs(665) band ratio had psi < 30% for all processors. The most accurate R-rs in the 490 to 709 nm domain was obtained from POLYMER with psi < 30% and coefficients of determination (R-2) > 0.6. Using a score system based on all statistical tests, POLYMER scored highest, while C2R-CC, C2R-Lakes and FUB had lower scores. This study represents the largest data base of in situ R-rs the most comprehensive analysis of AC models for highly absorbing waters and for MERIS, conducted to date. The results have implications for the new generation of Copernicus Sentinel ocean colour satellites.

TI  - Studying Land Use Travel Demand Interaction Using 3S Technology for Tiruchirappalli City
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper gives an overview of a major application of modern geospatial tools such as remote sensing, GIS and GPS, i.e., 3S technology in estimating travel demand along Indian roads by considering the study area, Tiruchirappalli urban city in Tamil Nadu. In the study, an attempt was made to estimate travel demand based on the current land-use classification as the pattern of travel depends on the type of land use activity in a zone. IRS high resolution image Cartosat-1 of year 2009 was used to extract the land-use information required. The travel demand model developed was validated with the field obtained OD-matrix to understand the accuracy of the method considered.

TI  - Comparing MODIS and near-surface vegetation indexes for monitoring tropical dry forest phenology along a successional gradient using optical phenology towers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) present strong seasonal greenness signals ideal for tracking phenology and primary productivity using remote sensing techniques. The tightly synchronized relationship these ecosystems have with water availability offer a valuable natural experiment for observing the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere in the tropics. To investigate how well the MODIS vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) represented the phenology of different successional stages of naturally regenerating TDFs, within a widely conserved forest fragment in the semi-arid southeast of Brazil, we installed several canopy towers with radiometric sensors to produce high temporal resolution near-surface vegetation greenness indices. Direct comparison of several years of ground measurements with a combined Aqua/Terra 8 day satellite product showed similar broad temporal trends, but MODIS often suffered from cloud contamination during the onset of the growing season and occasionally during the peak growing season. The strength of the in-situ and MODIS linear relationship was greater for NDVI than for EVI across sites but varied with forest stand age. Furthermore, we describe the onset dates and duration of canopy development phases for three years of in-situ monitoring. A seasonality analysis revealed significant discrepancies between tower and MODIS phenology transitions dates, with up to five weeks differences in growing season length estimation. Our results indicate that 8 and 16 day MODIS satellite vegetation monitoring products are suitable for tracking general patterns of tropical dry forest phenology in this region but are not temporally sufficient to characterize inter-annual differences in phenology phase onset dates or changes in productivity due to mid-season droughts. Such rapid transitions in canopy greenness are important indicators of climate change sensitivity of these already endangered forest ecosystems and should be further monitored using both ground and satellite approaches.

TI  - Reassessment of areas with persistent Lymphatic Filariasis nine years after cessation of mass drug administration in Sri Lanka
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSri Lanka was one of the first countries to initiate a lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination program based on WHO guidelines. The Anti-Filariasis Campaign provided 5 annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole in all 8 endemic districts from 2002-2006. Microfilaremia (Mf) prevalences have been consistently <1 % in all sentinel and spot-check sites since 2006, and all evaluation units passed school-based transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in 2013. We previously reported results from comprehensive surveillance studies conducted in 2011-2013 that documented low-level persistence of Wuchereria bancrofti in 19 high risk areas in 8 endemic districts. We now present results from repeat surveys conducted 3 to 4 years later in 6 areas that had the strongest LF signals in the prior study.Methodology and principal findingsThe surveys assessed prevalence of filarial antigenemia (CFA) and Mf in communities, CFA and anti-filarial antibody in school children (ages 6-8), and filarial DNA in Culex mosquitoes (molecular xenomonitoring, MX). Three study areas had significantly improved infection parameters compared to the prior study, but three other areas had little change. MX was more sensitive for detecting W. bancrofti persistence, and it was a better predictor than other parameters. Adult males accounted for more than 80% of infections detected in the study.ConclusionsThese results suggest that W. bancrofti transmission was near the break point in some of the areas studied in 2011-13. LF is likely to decline to zero without further intervention in these areas, while other areas may require further intervention. Long term surveillance may be needed to verify W. bancrofti elimination in areas like Sri Lanka with efficient transmission by Culex. Test and treat or other programs targeting adult males plus bed net promotion may be more effective than MDA for clearing remaining hotspots of transmission in Sri Lanka.Author summaryLymphatic Filariasis (LF, also known as "elephantiasis") is a disabling and deforming tropical disease caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The Sri Lankan Anti-Filariasis Campaign provided 5 annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole between 2002 and 2006 in all endemic areas, and this reduced infection prevalence to very low levels. Post-MDA surveillance conducted by our group in 19 sentinel sites in 8 endemic districts in 2011-2013 revealed evidence of persistent LF infection in all study sites. The present paper reports results of repeat assessments conducted 3-4 years later in 6 areas with high signals in the prior study. LF parameters were significantly improved in 3 areas where LF appears to be on a glide path to elimination. However, LF infection parameters remained high in 3 areas, and further work will probably be required to interrupt transmission in these areas. Molecular xenomonitoring (to detect filarial DNA in mosquito vectors) was especially sensitive for detecting persistent LF in Sri Lanka, and this may also be true in other areas with Culex transmission. Our results suggest that test and treat or other programs targeting adult males plus expanded bed net use may be helpful for clearing up remaining LF hotspots.

TI  - Investigation of the scaling characteristics of LANDSAT temperature and vegetation data: a wavelet-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An investigation of the scaling characteristics of vegetation and temperature data derived from LANDSAT data was undertaken for a heterogeneous area in Tamil Nadu, India. A wavelet-based multiresolution technique decomposed the data into large-scale mean vegetation and temperature fields and fluctuations in horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions at hierarchical spatial resolutions. In this approach, the wavelet coefficients were used to investigate whether the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) fields exhibited self-similar scaling behaviour. In this study, l-moments were used instead of conventional simple moments to understand scaling behaviour. Using the first six moments of the wavelet coefficients through five levels of dyadic decomposition, the NDVI data were shown to be statistically self-similar, with a slope of approximately -0.45 in each of the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions of the image, over scales ranging from 30 to 960 m. The temperature data were also shown to exhibit self-similarity with slopes ranging from -0.25 in the diagonal direction to -0.20 in the vertical direction over the same scales. These findings can help develop appropriate up- and down-scaling schemes of remotely sensed NDVI and LST data for various hydrologic and environmental modelling applications. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to understand the effect of mother wavelets on the scaling characteristics of LST and NDVI images.

TI  - What colour is penguin guano?
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and quantification of Antarctic Pygoscelis penguin colonies depends increasingly on recognition of the characteristic optical properties of guano deposits, but almost all knowledge of these properties until now has been compromised by resolution and atmospheric propagation effects. Here we present hyperspectral reflectance data in the range 350-2500 nm, collected in situ from fresh guano deposits in Pygoscelis penguin colonies on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. The period of data collection included the transition from predominantly white guano to the pink coloration characteristic of a krill-rich diet. The main identifiable features in the spectra are a broad absorption feature centred around 550 nm, responsible for the pink coloration and identified with the pigment astaxanthin, as well as several water absorption features. Variations in these features are responsible for differentiation between spectra. From these results we propose two spectral indices suitable for use with satellite data, one of which responds to the presence of astaxanthin in the guano and the other to water. Our results do not allow us to differentiate between penguin species from their guano, but do suggest that the breeding phenology of Pygoscelis penguins could be determined from a time series of multispectral imagery.

TI  - Using the vegetation-solar radiation (VSr) model to estimate the short-term gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation in Jinghe county, XinJiang, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross Primary Production (GPP) is the sum of ecosystem photosynthetic production and is an important variable in the study of the carbon cycle. Remote sensing methods were used to calculate GPP and compare the GPP of different regions with various land cover types (LCTs). We used a remote sensing-based vegetation-solar radiation (VSr) GPP estimation model to simulate changes in short-term GPP where vegetation ecosystem measurements are lacking. The study was conducted in 2011 at a typical arid and semi-arid oasis site in Jinghe County, Xinjiang, North China. The VSr model was appraised using 254 global radiation and MODIS GPP data points, including 84 grassland vegetation points (GP), 86 forest vegetation points (FP), and 84 cultivated land vegetation points (CP). The model was developed using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and solar radiation was obtained by calculation. Our results indicated that the updated VSr model improved the GPP accuracy compared with the standard MODIS GPP product by decreasing the root mean square errors (RMSEs) by 5.083, 4.802 and 3.076 for the GP, FP and CP sites, respectively. A comparison of test samples of GPP MODIS products and the VSr GPP model calculation showed that the VSr model had higher accuracy and stability. The VSr model can be used to simulate changes in short-term GPP where vegetation ecosystem measurements are lacking.

TI  - Generation and performance assessment of the global TanDEM-X digital elevation model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of the TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a global, consistent, and high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with unprecedented global accuracy. The goal is achieved by exploiting the interferometric capabilities of the two twin SAR satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, which fly in a close orbit formation, acting as an X-band single-pass interferometer. Between December 2010 and early 2015 all land surfaces have been acquired at least twice, difficult terrain up to seven or eight times. The acquisition strategy, data processing, and DEM calibration and mosaicking have been systematically monitored and optimized throughout the entire mission duration, in order to fulfill the specification. The processing of all data has finally been completed in September 2016 and this paper reports on the final performance of the TanDEM-X global DEM and presents the acquisition and processing strategy which allowed to obtain the final DEM quality. The results confirm the outstanding global accuracy of the delivered product, which can be now utilized for both scientific and commercial applications. (C) 2017 The Authors.

T2  - CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Langerhans cells (LCs) from melanoma patients sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are poor T cell activators mostly due to an immature immunophenotype. However Antigen Presenting Machinery (APM) role is unknown. We investigated HLA-class I APM components (Delta, LMP-7/10, TAP-1, Calnexin, Tapasin, beta 2-microglobulin and HLA-A, B, C) in LCs from healthy donors skin and melanoma patients SLN. APM component levels were low in immature epidermal LCs and significantly increased after maturation (p < 0.05); their levels were significantly high in SLN LCs (p < 0.01). APM component expression correlated with melanoma Breslow's thickness and SLN metastases: HLA-A, B, C level was significantly lower in SLN LCs from thick lesions patients compared with those from thin/intermediate lesions (p < 0.05); beta 2-microglobulin level was significantly higher in positive SLN LCs compared to negative ones (p < 0.05). Functionally, SLN LCs did not phagocytose exogenous antigens. These findings extend LCs knowledge indicating that they are not fully impaired by melanoma, contributing to design new LCs-based therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Methods for Estimating 2D Cloud Size Distributions from 1D Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-dimensional (2D) size distribution of clouds in the horizontal plane plays a central role in the calculation of cloud cover, cloud radiative forcing, convective entrainment rates, and the likelihood of precipitation. Here, a simple method is proposed for calculating the area-weighted mean cloud size and for approximating the 2D size distribution from the 1D cloud-chord lengths measured by aircraft and vertically pointing lidar and radar. This simple method (which is exact for square clouds) compares favorably against the inverse Abel transform (which is exact for circular clouds) in the context of theoretical size distributions. Both methods also perform well when used to predict the size distribution of real clouds from a Landsat scene. When applied to a large number of Landsat scenes, the simple method is able to accurately estimate the mean cloud size. As a demonstration, the methods are applied to aircraft measurements of shallow cumuli during the Routine ARM Aerial Facility (AAF) Clouds with Low Optical Water Depths (CLOWD) Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO) campaign, which then allow for an estimate of the true area-weighted mean cloud size.

TI  - Restoring connectivity between fragmented woodlands in Chile with a reintroduced mobile link species
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the feasibility of improving connectivity between of two dryland woodland types (espinal, a savanna type habitat, and sclerophyllous forest) in the Mediterranean climate zone of Chile, for restoration purposes. The restoration approach we examine involves the reintroduction of guanacos (Lama guanicoe) in a transhumant rewilding model. The guanacos stimulate the growth of Acacia caven in espinal through browsing, and also provide seed and nutrient dispersal and connectivity between the two woodland types. As in many drylands, degradation is problematic in this region, but clear criteria or maps of degradation are lacking. Thus to assess where restoration is required, how degradation has varied with ENSO across years, and how degraded areas are distributed across the region, we construct an index of woodland condition from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Net Primary Production (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), derived from MODIS data at 1 km resolution for each year between 2000 and 2013 inclusive. We construct a least-cost path for each year, which models the possible transhumant movements of herded guanacos between low and high quality woodlands each year. We find highly fragmented areas of espinal, sclerophyllous forest, and overlap between these, which we identified as sucessional habitat. We also found a fully-connected network linking low-quality and high-quality fragments of all types of woodland in each year. This shows that guanaco transhumant herding has the capacity to be used to create regional connectivity and restoration services. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

TI  - Sensitivity of Landsat 8 Surface Temperature Estimates to Atmospheric Profile Data: A Study Using MODTRAN in Dryland Irrigated Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) represents a critical element in efforts to characterize global surface energy and water fluxes, as well as being an essential climate variable in its own right. Current satellite platforms provide a range of spatial and temporal resolution radiance data from which LST can be determined. One of the most complete records of data comes via the Landsat series of satellites, which provide a continuous sequence that extends back to 1982. However, for much of this time, Landsat thermal data were provided through a single broadband thermal channel, making surface temperature retrieval challenging. To fully exploit the valuable time-series of thermal information that is available from these satellites requires efforts to better describe and understand the accuracy of temperature retrievals. Here, we contribute to these efforts by examining the impact of atmospheric correction on the estimation of LST, using atmospheric profiles derived from a range of in-situ, reanalysis, and satellite data. Radiance data from the thermal infrared (TIR) sensor onboard Landsat 8 was converted to LST by using the MODTRAN version 5.2 radiative transfer model, allowing the production of an LST time series based upon 28 Landsat overpasses. LST retrievals were then evaluated against in-situ thermal measurements collected over an arid zone farmland comprising both bare soil and vegetated surface types. Atmospheric profiles derived from AIRS, MOD07, ECMWF, NCEP, and balloon-based radiosonde data were used to drive the MODTRAN simulations. In addition to examining the direct impact of using various profile data on LST retrievals, randomly distributed errors were introduced into a range of forcing variables to better understand retrieval uncertainty. Results indicated differences in LST of up to 1 K for perturbations in emissivity and profile measurements, with the analysis also highlighting the challenges in modeling aerosol optical depth (AOD) over arid lands and its impact on the TIR bands. Days with high AOD content (AOD > 0.5) in the evaluation study seem to consistently underestimate in-situ LSTs by 1-2 K, suggesting that MODTRAN is unable to accurately simulate the aerosol conditions for the TIR bands. Comparisons between available in-situ and Landsat 8 derived LST illustrate a range of seasonal and land surface dynamics and provide an assessment of retrieval accuracy throughout the nine-month long study period. In terms of the choice of atmospheric profile, when excluding the in-situ data, results show a mean absolute range of between 1.2 K to 1.8 K over bare soil and 3.3 K to 3.8 K over alfalfa for the different meteorological forcing, with the AIRS profile providing the best reproduction over the studied arid land irrigation region.

TI  - Multi-sensor Space-Borne Earth Observation Data for Characterizing Fluvial-Geomorphic Provinces: A Case Study from Kosi River, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamism of geomorphic provinces in fluvial systems present considerable ambiguities in mapping by remote sensing. This necessitates use of multiple satellite data to characterize such depositional provinces. We use, an integrated dataset to characterize the geomorphic provinces (e.g. active flood plain, older food plain, fan etc.) of the Kosi River (Bihar), India. This is done using contrast in spectral signatures derived from multispectral bands (of IRS-P6 LISS III), radiant temperature (from ETM+) and radar-roughness (from radar brightness image RISAT-1). ASTER DEM has been used in deriving topographic profiles. The optical imagery, enables regional characterization through direct tonal changes (e.g. active flood plain is brighter than older flood plain). The radiant temperatures show variations across provinces. Geomorphic transitions are represented by topographic breaks. Radar backscatter imagery, show differences in radar-return from different sub-provinces. Observations made using specific sensor characterize each provinces and is supplementary/complimentary to the parameter(s) from other sensors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A project from 2013 to 2017 sought to discover pathogenic fungi and oomycetes from dipteran species that are vectors of major diseases of humans and animals in central Brazil and to begin evaluating the potential of these pathogens as potential biological control agents concentrated on mosquito larvae. Some collecting sites proved to be especially productive for pathogens of naturally occurring mosquito species and for placements of healthy sentinel larvae of Aedes aegypti in various sorts of containers in a gallery forest in the Santa Branca Ecoturismo Private Reserve of Natural Patrimony (RPPN) near Terezopolis de Goias (GO). Collections during May-April of 2016 and February 2017 yielded a few dead mosquito larvae of an undetermined Onirion sp. (Culicidae: Sabethini) whose hemocoels contained many ovoid, thick-walled, yellow-golden to golden-brown, ovoid thick-walled resistant sporangia, 38.3 +/- 4 x 22.8 +/- 2.3 mu m, decorated by numerous, closely and randomly spaced punctations of variable size and shape. These were the first indisputable collections from Brazil of any Coelomomyces species. Comparisons of the morphology of these sporangia with those of other species of Coelomomyces, confirmed that this Brazilian fungus represented a new species that is described here as Coelomomyces santabrancae.

TI  - Integration of enteric fever surveillance into the WHO-coordinated Invasive Bacterial-Vaccine Preventable Diseases (IB-VPD) platform: A low cost approach to track an increasingly important disease
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLack of surveillance systems and accurate data impede evidence-based decisions on treatment and prevention of enteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi/Paratyphi. The WHO coordinates a global Invasive Bacterial-Vaccine Preventable Diseases (IB-VPD) surveillance network but does not monitor enteric fever. We evaluated the feasibility and sustainability of integrating enteric fever surveillance into the ongoing IB-VPD platform.MethodologiesThe IB-VPD surveillance system uses WHO definitions to enroll 2-59 month children hospitalized with possible pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. We expanded this surveillance system to additionally capture suspect enteric fever cases during 2012-2016, in two WHO sentinel hospitals of Bangladesh, by adding inclusion criteria of fever >= 102 degrees F for >= 3 days, irrespective of other manifestations. Culture-positive enteric fever cases from in-patient departments (IPD) detected in the hospital laboratories but missed by the expanded surveillance, were also enrolled to assess completion. Costs for this integration were calculated for the additional personnel and resources required.Principal findingsIn the IB-VPD surveillance, 5,185 cases were enrolled; 3% (N = 171/5185) were positive for microbiological growth, of which 55% (94/171) were culture-confirmed cases of enteric fever (85 Typhi and 9 Paratyphi A). The added inclusion criteria for enteric fever enrolled an additional 1,699 cases; 22% (358/1699) were positive, of which 85% (349/358) were enteric fever cases (305 Typhi and 44 Paratyphi A). Laboratory surveillance of in-patients of all ages enrolled 311 additional enteric fever cases (263 Typhi and 48 Paratyphi A); 9% (28/311) were 2-59 m and 91% (283/311) >59 m. Altogether, 754 (94+349+311) culture-confirmed enteric fever cases were found, of which 471 were 2-59 m. Of these 471 cases, 94% (443/471) were identified through the hospital surveillances and 6% (28/471) through laboratory results. Twenty-three percent (170/754) of all cases were children <2 years. Additional cost for the integration was USD 44,974/year, a 27% increase to the IB-VPD annual expenditure.ConclusionIn a setting where enteric disease is a substantial public health problem, we could integrate enteric fever surveillance into the standard IB-VPD surveillance platform at a modest cost.

TI  - Source profiling of arsenic and heavy metals in the Selangor River basin and their maternal and cord blood levels in Selangor State, Malaysia
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arsenic and 5 heavy metals (nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead) were quantitated in surface water (n = 18) and soil/ore samples (n = 45) collected from 5 land uses (oil palm converted from forest, oil palm in peat swamp, bare land, quarry and forest) in the Selangor River basin by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Geographic information system (GIS) was used as a spatial analytical tool to classify 4 land uses (forest, agriculture/peat, urban and bare land) from a satellite image taken by Landsat 8. Source profiling of the 6 elements was conducted to identify their occurrence, their distribution and the pollution source associated with the land use. The concentrations of arsenic, cadmium and lead were also analyzed'in maternal blood (n = 99) and cord blood (n = 87) specimens from 136 pregnant women collected at the University of Malaya Medical Center for elucidating maternal exposure as well as maternal-to-fetal transfer. The source profiling identified that nickel and zinc were discharged from sewage and/or industrial effluents, and that lead was discharged from mining sites. Arsenic showed a site-specific pollution in tin-tungsten deposit areas, and the pollution source could be associated with arsenopyrite. The maternal blood levels of arsenic (0.82 +/- 0.61 mu g/dL), cadmium (0.15 +/- 0.2 mu g/dL) and lead (2.6 +/- 2.1 mu g/dL) were not significantly high compared to their acute toxicity levels, but could have attributable risks of chronic toxicity. Those in cord blood were significantly decreased in cadmium (0.06 +/- 0.07 mu g/dL) and lead (0.99 +/- 1.2 mu g/dL) but were equivalent in arsenic (0.82 +/- 1.1 mu g/dL) because of the different kinetics of maternal-to-fetal transfer.

TI  - Observational study on the fine structure and dynamics of a solar jet. I. Energy build-up process around a satellite spot
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on a solar jet phenomenon associated with successive flares on 2014 November 10. These explosive events were involved with the satellite spots' emergence around a delta-type sunspot in the decaying active region NOAA 12205. The data for this jet were provided by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the X-Ray Telescope aboard Hinode, and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. These abundant data enabled us to present this series of papers to discuss the entire process of the observed phenomena, including the energy storage, event trigger, and energy release. In this paper, we focus on the energy build-up and trigger phases, by analyzing the photospheric horizontal flow field around the active region by an optical flow method. The analysis shows the following results: (1) The observed explosive phenomena involved three satellite spots, themagnetic fluxes of which successively reconnected with their pre-existing ambient fields; (2) All of these satellite spots emerged in the moat region of a pivotal delta-type sunspot, especially near its convergent boundary with the neighboring supergranules or moat regions of adjacent sunspots; (3) Around the jet ejection site, the positive polarities of the satellite spot and adjacent emerging flux encountered the global magnetic field with a negative polarity in the moat region of the pivotal delta-type sunspot, and thus the polarity inversion line was formed along the convergent boundary of the photospheric horizontal flow channels.

AB  - Penile cancer is a rare disease and can be associated with a high risk of recurrence in regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Surveillance strategies geared towards early detection and treatment are recommended given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with recurrences. Although physical examination is the single most important surveillance strategy, imaging is an important adjunct in high-risk disease and certain clinical scenarios.

T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim > The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the preservation of the intercostobrachial nerve on the quality of life of patients operated for breast cancer.Methods > This study was ancillary to cost comparison study of axillary sentinel lymph node detection and axillary lymphadenectomy in early breast cancer. It was a prospective multicenter, observational, non-randomized study. The quality of life was assessed using two questionnaires: QLQ-C30 and specific module QLQ-BR23 Surveys have been performed before initiation of surgery, one week, and 1 month, 8 months and 12 months after discharge from hospitalization for the first surgical procedure.Results > Five hundred and seventy-eight patients with preservation of intercostobrachial nerve without axillary lymph node dissection (C = P +), 85 without preservation of nerve and axillary lymph node dissection (C + P =) and 57 with preservation of nerve and axillary lymph node dissection (C + P +) have been included in the study. The changing arm symptoms score was significantly different during follow-up between the three groups (P < 0.001). This difference between the two groups C = P+ and C + P+ was significant clinically at one week [16.9, IC95%: 11.9 to 22 (P < 0.01)], and persisted for up to 12 months [9.9, IC95%: 3.2 a16.6 (P = 0.022)]. There was no difference between the group C + P = and C + P+. Results for physical functioning score were similar.Conclusion > Preservation of the intercostobral nerve is not associated with better quality of life. Only axillary lymph node dissection has an impact on quality of life.

TI  - The potential of multifrequency SAR images for estimating forest biomass in Mediterranean areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of forest information from SAR images is particularly complex in Mediterranean areas, since they are characterized by high spatial fragmentation and heterogeneity. We have investigated the use of multi-frequency SAR data from different sensors (ALOS/PALSAR and ENVISAT/ASAR) for estimating forest biomass in two test areas in Central Italy (San Rossore and Molise), where detailed in-situ measurements and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data were available. The study focused on the estimation of growing stock volume (GS, in m(3)/ha) by using an inversion algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The ANN algorithm was first appropriately trained using the available GS estimates obtained from ALS data. The potential of this algorithm was then improved through the innovative use of a simulated dataset, generated by a forward electromagnetic model based on the Radiative Transfer Theory (RTT). The algorithm is able to merge SAR data at L and C bands for predicting GS in diversified Mediterranean environments. The performed analyses indicated that GS was correctly estimated by integrating information from L and C bands on both test areas, with the following statistics: R > 0.97 and RMSE = 28.5 m(3)/ha for the independent test, and R = 0.86 and RMSE approximate to 77 m(3)/ha for the final independent validation, the latter performed on the forest stands of both areas not included in the ALS acquisitions and where conventional measurements were available. The research then illustrates the potential of using the obtained GS estimates from SAR data to drive the simulations of forest net primary production (NPP). This experiment produced spatially explicit estimates of GS current annual increments that are slightly less accurate than those obtained from ground observations (R = 0.75 and RMSE approximate to 1.5 m(3)/ha/year).

TI  - Desertification Vulnerability Assessment Model for a Resource Rich Region: A Case Study of Bellary District, Karnataka, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a global challenge being experienced across countries irrespective of their levels of development. Desertification is a complex negative process involving both natural and human components in terms of their socio-economic attainments. Hence, for identification and assessment of the process, pattern, magnitude and possible impacts of desertification, a multi-disciplinary approach with inter-disciplinary framework of analysis is essential. This study has made such an attempt to develop a comprehensive desertification vulnerability assessment Model on the basis of multi-variate Principal Component Analysis along with the Geographic Information System framework by using natural and socio-economic resources data inputs from census, satellite data and other sources. Bellary district, located in a rapidly growing southern state of India, Karnataka which is afflicted with various natural and development issues such as droughts, backwardness, haphazard mining, over irrigation, and associated effects of land degradation, siltation and water pollution has been chosen for the study. The inter-disciplinary framework based desertification vulnerability assessment model has assessed that 1379.198 km 2 area (15.55%) of Bellary district is prone to desertification (based on the satellite data IRS LISS III data of Dec 2005, Feb 2006, March 2006 and April 2006). In addition, 3229.337 km(2) (36.40%) is under moderate vulnerability which is fragile. Hence, unless proper development intervention and conservation measures are taken well in advance, almost more than half of Bellary district (51.95%) will be vulnerable to desertification. Spatially, the talukas that are seriously affected and that require development intervention on high priority are: Sandur, Kudligi, Hospet and Bellary which are the prime talukas of the district.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Where are we now?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent data have confirmed that elective surgical management of the cN0 neck improves survival in patients with early (T1-T2) oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and is better than watchful waiting. However, elective neck dissection (END) may not always be necessary. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB), which is a reliable staging test for patients with early disease and a radiologically N0 neck, can detect occult metastases with a sensitivity of 86%-94%. Patients with no sign of metastases on SNB could avoid neck dissection, and individual treatment should reduce both morbidity and cost. Currently, SNB for oral SCC is available at a limited number of centres in the UK, but this is likely to change as national guidelines have recommended that it is incorporated into the standard treatment pathway. It is therefore important to understand the current evidence that supports its use, its limitations and related controversies, and to plan for a validated training programme (C) 2017 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

TI  - Estimating Soil Moisture Patterns with Remote Sensing and Terrain Data at the Small Catchment Scale
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment characteristics (e. g., terrain and land use) that can be used as proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture database for the Schafertal catchment, located in central Germany, was used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58% of the cases and was stable to explain about 50% of the total observed variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale.

TI  - Long term analysis of the columnar and surface aerosol relationship at an urban European coastal site
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous PM2.5, PM10 and columnar (ground and satellite based) AOD measurements have been analyzed at Burjassot site in the metropolitan area of Valencia (Spain) during the period 2007-2016. The site is representative of a south European city in the Western Mediterranean coastal area, influenced by local urban pollution but also from frequent Saharan dust events. First, multiannual statistics were performed to characterize the main aerosol burden characteristics. The averages and standard deviations resulted 18 +/- 9 mu g m(-3), 25 +/- 19 mu g m(-3), 0.15 +/- 0.11, 0.23 +/- 0.17, 0.19 +/- 0.15 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 for PM2.5, PM10, AERONET AOD, MODIS Terra AOD, MODIS Aqua AOD, and AERONET Angstrom exponent AE, respectively. The AOD is always referred to 550 nm. PM10 and AOD showed seasonal patterns with maxima in summer and minima in winter. However, PM2.5 and AE did not show such an evident seasonality. The relationship between, surface and columnar measurements show a poor correlation (r down to 0.30) for daily values, although the correlation increases to r up to 0.90 for yearly averages. The relationship between PM and AOD becomes more consistent when the databases are binned in intervals of 0.05 AOD. Results for AERONET and MODIS AOD are very similar, although for daily averages is slightly worse for satellite than ground based measurements. In order to explain some seasonality effects found, the mixing layer height has been included in the analysis. Results show that the correlation is maximum when PM2.5 is used and the mixing layer height is greater than 1 000 m (r > 0.90). (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - MAPPING INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES IN KARACHI USING HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY: AN OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSES APPROACH
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species (also known as exotic species) are prime focus of government depaitalents, plant conservationist, ecologist, environmentalist and farmers now days. One of the major non climatic drivers of global change are these plant invasive species that pose serious damages to anthropogenic activities and biodiversity. The study aims at mapping plant invasive species in Karachi using high resolution satellite imagery. World View (WV2) satellite imagery was used as high resolution satellite data source. The imagery was pan-sharpened to the spatial resolution of 0.5 m. Principal component resolution merging technique was used for pan-sharpening of WV 2 imagery. Three level image segmentation was performed using eCognition software. We performed quadtree at first level then multiresolution segmentation was performed at second and third level with different parameters at each level. Once, we picked the shrub canopies well with image segmentation, the WV 2 image was processed for vegetation indices. Threshold classification was performed for all three vegetation indices: ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index EVI2. We conclude that EVI2 mapped the invasive species with the less generalizations and mix classes as compared to RVI and NDVI.

TI  - Verification of Space Weather Forecasts Issued by the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre was founded in 2014 and part of its remit is a daily Space Weather Technical Forecast to help the UK build resilience to space weather impacts; guidance includes 4 day geomagnetic storm forecasts (GMSF) and X-ray flare forecasts (XRFF). It is crucial for forecasters, users, modelers, and stakeholders to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these forecasts; therefore, it is important to verify against the most reliable truth data source available. The present study contains verification results for XRFFs using Geo-Orbiting Earth Satellite 15 satellite data and GMSF using planetary K-index (Kp) values from the GFZ Helmholtz Centre. To assess the value of the verification results, it is helpful to compare them against a reference forecast and the frequency of occurrence during a rolling prediction period is used for this purpose. An analysis of the rolling 12 month performance over a 19 month period suggests that both the XRFF and GMSF struggle to provide a better prediction than the reference. However, a relative operating characteristic and reliability analysis of the full 19 month period reveals that although the GMSF and XRFF possess discriminatory skill, events tend to be overforecast.

TI  - Death-Related Dimensions of Disability: How Terror Management Theory Can Affect People with Disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have promoted a research paradigm that considers dimensions of disability as being integral to understanding and predicting divergent treatment of people with different disabilities. We used a modified policy capture study (N = 225) to assess statistical relationships between established dimensions of disability and the perception of closeness to death. We find that some dimensions of disability (course, peril, risk, origin) are indeed associated with closeness to death. This has important implications because terror management theory posits that people who experience death-related thoughts will become more judgmental and exclusionary toward others. We argue that certain disability dimensions may therefore activate unintentional discriminatory tendencies in others. Practical implications include a different approach to considering and responding to discrimination against people with disabilities. We explain how practitioners can promote egalitarian ideals as a means of channeling the effects of death-related thinking toward outcomes that favor individuals with disabilities.

TI  - ANALYSING SPATIAL AND STATISTICAL DEPENDENCIES OF DEFORESTATION AFFECTED BY RESIDENTIAL GROWTH: GORGANROOD BASIN, NORTHEAST IRAN
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to examine deforestation and residential growth trends and their spatial dependencies from 1972 to 2010 in Northeast of Iran. First, change rates of forests and residential areas were mapped using Landsat satellite images in 1972-1987, 1987-2000 and 2000-2010. Then, the forest change patterns were interpreted using univariate local Moran's I (local univariate spatial autocorrelation), and the spatial autocorrelation between deforestation and residential growth was tested through bivariate local Moran's I (bivariate local spatial autocorrelation). Furthermore, the spatial relationships between deforestation and residential growth rates were quantified by ordinary least squares, spatial lag (SL) and geographically weighted regression. Results indicated that approximately 25% of forests have been converted to other land-use types in the span of 38years, since 1972. Local univariate spatial autocorrelation maps showed that significant values of high-high cluster scattered in all locations in the first span, in the east and south aspects in the second duration, and in the eastern part in the third span. Bivariate local spatial autocorrelation indicated a meaningful Moran's I values of -0.12, -0.26 and -0.20 between deforestation and residential growth, chronologically. Analyses of spatial regression models showed that geographically weighted regression performed better than SL and ordinary least squares in the first (R-2 = 0.315, AIC = 6,160) and third periods (R-2 = 0.27, AIC = 6,351), whereas, the validity of SL was the highest in the second period (R-2 = 0.36, AIC = 6,288). However, the overall trends of deforestation and residential growth have decreased, but the rate of deforestation induced by residential growth is still significant. Spatial exploration of residential growth in deforestation leads to determine its influences in local scale for better conservation of these valuable natural resources.

TI  - Seasonal discrimination of C3 and C4 grasses functional types: An evaluation of the prospects of varying spectral configurations of new generation sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assessed the potential of varying spectral configuration of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel 2 MultiSpectal Instrument (MSI) and Worldview 2 sensors in the seasonal discrimination of Festuca costata (C3) and Themeda Trksndra (C4) grass species in the Drakensberg, South Africa. This was achieved by resampling hyperspectral measurements to the spectral windows corresponding to the three sensors at two distinct seasonal periods (summer peak and end of winter), using the Discriminant Analysis (DA) classification ensemble. In summer, standard bands of the Worldview 2 produced the highest overall classification accuracy (98.61%), followed by Sentinel 2 (97.52%), whereas the Landsat 8 spectral configuration was the least performer, using vegetation indices (95.83%). In winter, Sentinel 2 spectral bands produced the highest accuracy (96.18%) for the two species, followed by Worldview 2 (94.44%) and Landsat 8 yielded the least (91.67%) accuracy. Results also showed that maximum separability between C3 and C4 grasses was in summer, while at the end of winter considerable overlaps were noted, especially when using the spectral settings of the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 shortwave infrared bands. Test of significance in species reflectance further confirmed that in summer, there were significant differences (P < 0.05), whereas in winter, most of the spectral windows of all sensors yielded insignificant differences (P > 0.05) between the two species. In this regard, the peak summer period presents a promising opportunity for the spectral discrimination of C3 and C4 grass species functional types, than the end of winter, when using multispectral sensors. Results from this study highlight the influence of seasonality on discrimination and therefore provide the basis for the successful discrimination and mapping of C3 and C4 grass species.

TI  - Long-Term, High-Resolution Survey of Atmospheric Aerosols over Egypt with NASA's MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A decadal survey of atmospheric aerosols over Egypt and selected cities and regions is presented using daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 550 nm wavelength onboard the Aqua satellite. We explore the AOD spatio-temporal variations over Egypt during a 12-year record (2003 to 2014) using the MODIS high-resolution (10 km) Level 2 data product. Five cities and two geographic regions that feature different landscape and human activities were selected for detailed analysis. For most of the examined areas, AOD is found to be most frequent in the 0.2-0.3 range, and the highest mean AOD was found to be over Cairo, Alexandria, and the Nile Delta region. Severe events are identified based on AOD higher than a selected threshold. Most of these events are engendered by sand and dust storms that originate from the Western Desert during January-April. Spatial analysis indicates that they cover the Nile Delta region, including cities of Cairo and Alexandria, on the same day. Examination of the spatial gradient of AOD along the four cardinal directions originating from the city's center reveals seasonally dependent gradients in some cases. The gradients have been linked to locations of industrial activity. No trend of AOD has been observed in the studied areas during the study period, though data from Cairo and Asyut reveal a slight linear increase of AOD. Considering Cairo is commonly perceived as a city of poor air quality, the results show that local events are fairly constrained. The study highlights spatial and seasonal distributions of AOD and links them to geographic and climatic conditions across the country.

TI  - Decadal glacial lake changes in the Koshi basin, central Himalaya, from 1977 to 2010, derived from Landsat satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in glacial lakes and the consequences of these changes, particularly on the development of water resources and management of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk, has become one of the challenges in the sustainable development of high mountain areas in the context of global warming. This paper presents the findings of a study on the distribution of, and area changes in, glacial lakes in the Koshi basin in the central Himalayas. Data on the number of glacial lakes and their area was generated for the years 1977, 1990, 2000, and 2010 using Landsat satellite images. According to the glacial lake inventory in 2010, there were a total of 2168 glacial lakes with a total area of 127.61 km(2) and average size of 0.06 km(2) in the Koshi basin. Of these, 47% were moraine dammed lakes, 34.8% bedrock dammed lakes and 17.7% ice dammed lakes. The number of glacial lakes increased consistently over the study period from 1160 in 1977 to 2168 in 2010, an overall growth rate of 86.9%. The area of glacial lakes also increased from 94.44 km(2) in 1977 to 127.61 km(2) in 2010, a growth rate of 35.1%. A large number of glacial lakes in the inventory are small in size (<= 0.1 km(2)). End moraine dammed lakes with area greater than 0.1 km(2) were selected to analyze the change characteristics of glacial lakes in the basin. The results show that, in 2010, there were 129 lakes greater than 0.1 km(2) in area; these lakes had a total area of 42.92 km(2) in 1997, increasing to 63.28 km(2) in 2010. The distribution of lakes on the north side of the Himalayas (in China) was three times higher than on the south side of the Himalayas (in Nepal). Comparing the mean growth rate in area for the 33 year study period (1977-2010), the growth rate on the north side was found to be a little slower than that on the south side. A total of 42 glacial lakes with an area greater than 0.2 km(2) are rapidly growing between 1977 and 2010 in the Koshi basin, which need to be paid more attention to monitoring in the future and to identify how critical they are in terms of GLOF.

TI  - Usability Study to Assess the IGBP Land Cover Classification for Singapore
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our research focuses on assessing the usability of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme provided in the MODIS MCD12Q1-1 dataset for assessing the land cover of the city-state, Singapore. We conducted a user study with responses from 33 users by providing them with Google Earth images from different parts of Singapore, asking survey-takers to classify these images according to their understanding by the IGBP definitions provided. We also conducted interviews with experts from major governmental agencies working with satellite imagery, which highlighted the need for a detailed land classification for Singapore. In addition to the qualitative analysis of the IGBP land classification scheme, we carried out a validation of the MCD12Q1-1 remote sensing product against SPOT-5 imagery for our study area. The user study revealed that survey-takers were able to correctly classify urban areas, as well as densely forested areas. Misclassifications between Cropland and Mixed Forest classes were highest and were attributed by users to the broad terminology of the IGBP of the two land cover class definitions. For the accuracy assessment, we obtained validation points using weighted and unweighted stratified sampling. The overall classification accuracy for all 17 IGBP land classes is 62%. Upon selecting only the four most occurring IGBP land classes in Singapore, the classification accuracy improved to 71%. Validation of the MCD12Q1-1 against ground truth for Singapore revealed less-common land classes that may be of importance in a global context but are sources of error when the same product is applied at a smaller scale. Combining the user study with the accuracy assessment gives a comprehensive overview of the challenges associated with using global-level land cover data to derive localized land cover information specifically for smaller land masses like Singapore.

TI  - Hand-held Clinical Photoacoustic Imaging System for Real-time Non-invasive Small Animal Imaging
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Translation of photoacoustic imaging into the clinic is a major challenge. Handheld real-time clinical photoacoustic imaging systems are very rare. Here, we report a combined photoacoustic and clinical ultrasound imaging system by integrating an ultrasound probe with light delivery for small animal imaging. We demonstrate this by showing sentinel lymph node imaging in small animals along with minimally invasive real-time needle guidance. A clinical ultrasound platform with access to raw channel data allows the integration of photoacoustic imaging leading to a handheld real-time clinical photoacoustic imaging system. Methylene blue was used for sentinel lymph node imaging at 675 nm wavelength. Additionally, needle guidance with dual modal ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging was shown using the imaging system. Depth imaging of up to 1.5 cm was demonstrated with a 10 Hz laser at a photoacoustic imaging frame rate of 5 frames per second.

TI  - The Boundaries of Woman's Spirituality in the Beliefs-Spirituality-Religiousness (B-S-R) Model: A Third Perspective-Beliefs as a Cognitive Basis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The real nature of the phenomenon of woman's Spirituality is the main contemporary challenge for empirical research. The literature needs many more examples of the cognitive genesis of worldviews, Spirituality and Religiousness. The first aim of this article is to present the central tenet of the Threefold Nature of Spirituality model which theoretically explains the nature of Spirituality and the theoretical relationship between beliefs (worldviews), Spirituality and Religiousness (B-S-R model). The second aim is the empirical verification of this relationship through the application of an analysis of mediation. The 308 participants were women aged 18-50 years (M = 25.25, SD = 9.42). The results obtained indicate that is a good mediator between an individual's worldview and Religiousness. Presented analysis of mediation allows us to describe the basic functioning mechanism of the spiritual sphere and the relationship between the three elements: worldview, Spirituality and Religiousness.

TI  - Climatology of the Auroral Electrojets Derived From the Along-Track Gradient of Magnetic Field Intensity Measured by POGO, Magsat, CHAMP, and Swarm
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The auroral electrojets (AEJs) are complex and dynamic horizontal ionospheric electric currents which form ovals around Earth's poles, being controlled by the morphology of the main magnetic field and the energy input from the solar wind interaction with the magnetosphere. The strength and location of the AEJ varies with solar wind conditions and the solar cycle but should also be controlled on decadal timescales by main field secular variation. To determine the AEJ climatology, we use data from four polar Low Earth Orbit magnetic satellite missions: POGO, Magsat, CHAMP, and Swarm. A simple estimation of the AEJ strength and latitude is made from each pass of the satellites, from peaks in the along-track gradient of the magnetic field intensity after subtracting a core and crustal magnetic field model. This measure of the AEJ activity is used to study the response in different sectors of magnetic local time (MLT) during different seasons and directions of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We find a season-dependent hemispherical asymmetry in the AEJ response to IMF B-y, with a tendency toward stronger (weaker) AEJ currents in the north than the south during B-y > 0 (B-y < 0) around local winter. This effect disappears during local summer when we find a tendency toward stronger currents in the south than the north. The solar cycle modulation of the AEJ and the long-term shifting of its position and strength due to the core field variation are presented as challenges to internal field modeling.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To evaluate the risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection, the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health developed a sentinel surveillance system in health centers located in the Constitutional Province of Callao. This surveillance system included the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTI) using interferon gamma release assays. The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of LTI in health workers in a region with a high burden of TB. The prevalence of LTI in health workers was 56%. The prevalence of LTI was 63% in workers with more than 10 years of service and 58-60% in workers with more than 35 years of service. The prevalence of LTI in health workers from primary health care centers was high, and longer service time was one of the main risk factors.

TI  - Forest Harvest Patterns on Private Lands in the Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Washington State generate substantial economic revenue from commercial timber harvesting on private lands. To investigate the rates, causes, and spatial and temporal patterns of forest harvest on private tracts throughout the Cascade Mountains, we relied on a new generation of annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) products created from the application of the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to Landsat satellite imagery collected from 1985 to 2014. We calculated metrics of landscape pattern using patches of intact and harvested forest in each annual layer to identify changes throughout the time series. Patch dynamics revealed four distinct eras of logging trends that align with prevailing regulations and economic conditions. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the biophysical and anthropogenic factors that influence fine-scale selection of harvest stands in each time period. Results show that private lands forest cover became significantly reduced and more fragmented from 1985 to 2014. Variables linked to parameters of site conditions, location, climate, and vegetation greenness consistently distinguished harvest selection for each distinct era. This study demonstrates the utility of annual LULC data for investigating the underlying factors that influence land cover change.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The ongoing 2016/17 influenza epidemic in France is characterized by the circulation of A(H3N2) viruses, known to cause more severe illness among at risk populations.Objectives: The purpose of our study was to provide early influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) estimates for the ongoing influenza epidemic in France and compare these estimates over the six post-pandemic IVE.Study design: We used clinical and virological data collected in primary care by the French Sentinelles network. IVE in preventing influenza infection was estimated by the test-negative design method. The screening method was used to estimate IVE in preventing medically-attended influenza-like illness among target groups (<65 year with chronic diseases and >= 65 years) since 2010/11 influenza epidemic.Results: Early IVE estimates in primary care against influenza A(H3N2) were 48% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22-66) overall and 39% (95% CI: -17 to 69) among elderly (aged 65 and older). In comparison to the last six epidemics, 2016/17 early IVE in preventing influenza-like illness among target groups showed VE estimates higher to those reported during the 2011/12 and 2014/15 epidemics.Conclusions: The moderate 2016/17 IVE estimates were higher than those estimated during influenza A(H3N2) epidemics with vaccine mismatch.

TI  - Multi-Product Category Choices Labeled for Ecological Footprints: Exploring Psychographics and Evolved Psychological Biases for Characterizing Latent Consumer Classes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores psychographics and evolved psychological biases to characterize consumer segments regarding pro-environmental choices. Based on survey-evidence from Germany, we analyze consumer preferences for two product categories, a food-staple and a non-food staple, labeled for carbon and water footprints. Latent class analysis is employed to identify and characterize distinct consumer segments as a function of consumers"ecological worldview', consumer involvement, motivation to attend to product label information, personal values, as well as consumers' environmental group membership and donation behavior. Results suggest that latent segments of ecologically-oriented consumers can be differentiated from price-sensitive segments, with the former appearing less prone to certain evolved psychological biases compared to the latter segments. In contrast to previous work on self-reported ecologically conscious behavior, our results highlight the role of personal values, in particular that of personal health. This is found to be valued less by ecologically-oriented consumers, indicating that such individuals may have a strong communal focus in their value orientation. In terms of policy implications, our findings suggest that sustainability labels can provide valuable and interpretable information to consumers, yet more effective intervention efforts may require a stronger focus on targeted information provision with regard to carbon rather than water footprints.

TI  - A Workflow for Automated Satellite Image Processing: from Raw VHSR Data to Object-Based Spectral Information for Smallholder Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation has become a progressively important source of information for land use and land cover services over the past decades. At the same time, an increasing number of reconnaissance satellites have been set in orbit with ever increasing spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions. The available bulk of data, fostered by open access policies adopted by several agencies, is setting a new landscape in remote sensing in which timeliness and efficiency are important aspects of data processing. This study presents a fully automated workflow able to process a large collection of very high spatial resolution satellite images to produce actionable information in the application framework of smallholder farming. The workflow applies sequential image processing, extracts meaningful statistical information from agricultural parcels, and stores them in a crop spectrotemporal signature library. An important objective is to follow crop development through the season by analyzing multi-temporal and multi-sensor images. The workflow is based on free and open-source software, namely R, Python, Linux shell scripts, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, custom FORTRAN, C++, and the GNU Make utilities. We tested and applied this workflow on a multi-sensor image archive of over 270 VHSR WorldView-2, -3, QuickBird, GeoEye, and RapidEye images acquired over five different study areas where smallholder agriculture prevails.

TI  - The Geometry of Large Tundra Lakes Observed in Historical Maps and Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate of the Arctic is warming rapidly and this is causing major changes to the cycling of carbon and the distribution of permafrost in this region. Tundra lakes are key components of the Arctic climate system because they represent a source of methane to the atmosphere. In this paper, we aim to analyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large (> 0.8 km(2)) tundra lakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in historical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale 0.21166 km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google Earth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale 0.1503 km/pixel). The G.E.E. is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis on over four decades of Landsat data. We developed an image-processing algorithm to segment these maps and images, measure the area and perimeter of each lake, and compute the fractal dimension of the lakes in the images we have studied. Our results indicate that as lake size increases, their fractal dimension bifurcates. For lakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than 100 km2 (fractal dimension 1.43 to 1.87). For lakes observed in satellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than similar to 100 km(2) (fractal dimension 1.31 to 1.95). Tundra lakes with a fractal dimension close to 2 have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their area-perimeter relationships. Area-perimeter measurements indicate that lakes with a length scale greater than 70 km(2) are power-law distributed. Preliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes that were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite imagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size over time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change during this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as recorded in the historical map.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer: a New Standard of Care?
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node status is one of the most important factors in determining prognosis and the need for adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer (EMCA). Unfortunately, full lymphadenectomy bears significant surgical and postoperative risks. The majority of patients with clinical stage I disease will not have metastatic disease; thus, a full lymphadenectomy only increases morbidity in this population of patients. The use of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as an alternative to complete lymphadenectomy in EMCA. By removing the highest yield lymph nodes, the SLN biopsy has the same diagnostic ability as lymphadenectomy while minimizing morbidity. The sensitivity of sentinel lymph node identification with robotic fluorescence imaging for detecting metastatic endometrial and cervical cancer (FIRES) trial published this year is the largest prospective, multi-institution trial investigating the accuracy of the SLN biopsy for endometrial and cervical cancer. Results of this trial found an excellent sensitivity (97.2%) and false negative rate (3%) with the technique. The conclusions from the FIRES trial and those of a recent meta-analysis are that SLN biopsy has an acceptable diagnostic accuracy in detecting lymphatic metastases, and can replace lymphadenectomy for this diagnostic purpose. There remains controversy surrounding the SLN biopsy in high- risk disease and the use of adjuvant therapy in the setting of low volume disease detected with ultrastaging. Current data suggests that the technique is accurate in high-risk disease and that the increased detection of metastasis helps guide adjuvant therapy such that oncologic outcomes are likely not affected by forgoing a full lymphadenectomy. Further prospective study is needed to investigate the impact of low volume metastatic disease on oncologic outcomes and the need for adjuvant therapy in these patients.

TI  - Haze Removal Based on a Fully Automated and Improved Haze Optimized Transformation for Landsat Imagery over Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite imagery is often contaminated by the persistent presence of clouds and atmospheric haze. Without an effective method for removing this contamination, most optical remote sensing applications are less reliable. In this research, a methodology has been developed to fully automate and improve the Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT)-based haze removal. The method is referred to as AutoHOT and characterized with three notable features: a fully automated HOT process, a novel HOT image post-processing tool and a class-based HOT radiometric adjustment method. The performances of AutoHOT in haze detection and compensation were evaluated through three experiments with one Landsat-5 TM, one Landsat-7 ETM+ and eight Landsat-8 OLI scenes that encompass diverse landscapes and atmospheric haze conditions. The first experiment confirms that AutoHOT is robust and effective for haze detection. The average overall, user's and producer's accuracies of AutoHOT in haze detection can reach 96.4%, 97.6% and 97.5%, respectively. The second and third experiments demonstrate that AutoHOT can not only accurately characterize the haze intensities but also improve dehazed results, especially for brighter targets, compared to traditional HOT radiometric adjustment.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Characteristics of Glacier Velocity in the Central Karakoram Revealed with 1999-2003 Landsat-7 ETM+ Pan Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The situation of stable and slightly advancing glaciers in the Karakoram is called the Karakoram anomaly. Glacier surface velocity is one of the key parameters of glacier dynamics and mass balance, however, the response of glacier motion to this regional anomaly is not fully understood. Here, we characterize the spatial-temporal variations in glacier velocity over the Central Karakoram from 1999-2003. The inter-annual glacier velocity fields were retrieved using a cross-correlation-based algorithm applied to four Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) panchromatic image pairs. We find that most of the glaciers on the southern slope flowed faster than those on the northern slope, which might be attributed to the differences in glacier sizes. Furthermore, ice motion observations over four years reveal that most of the glaciers were quasi-stable or experienced small fluctuations of flow velocity during our study period. We identify a new surging event for the South Skamri Glacier in the study period by investigating the glacier frontal changes and the longer-term time series of surface velocities between 1996 and 2006. From the transverse velocity profiles of seven typical glaciers, we infer that basal sliding is the predominant motion mechanism of the middle and upper glaciers, whereas internal deformation dominates closest to the glacier terminus.

In this study, we used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, flood potential index (FPI), precipitation data (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM 3B43), and other meteorological data to generate monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and to evaluate flood potential in the YRB. The results indicate that the basin contained increasing amounts of water from 2003 to 2014, with a slight increase of 3.04 mm/year in the TWSA. The TWSA and TRMM data exhibit marked seasonal characteristics with summer peaks and winter dips. Estimates of terrestrial water storage based on GRACE, measured as FPI, are critical for understanding and predicting flooding. The 2010 flood (FPI similar to 0.36) was identified as the most serious disaster during the study period, with discharge and precipitation values 37.95% and 19.44% higher, respectively, than multi-year average values for the same period. FPI can assess reliably hydrological extremes with high spatial and temporal resolution, but currently, it is not suitable for smaller and/or short-term flood events. Thus, we conclude that GRACE data can be effectively used for monitoring and examining large floods in the YRB and elsewhere, thus improving the current knowledge and presenting potentially important political and economic implications.

TI  - Bidirectional Polarized Reflectance Factors of Vegetation Covers: Influence on the BRF Models Results
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we performed multiangular measurements spanning a wide viewing range in a hemisphere space for three types of vegetation cover and analyzed the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) measurements based on basic physical reflectance mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of the data. The measurements and the results with the best fitted model parameters were evaluated to determine whether the BRF models produce vegetation cover reflectance factor values that are qualitatively the same as the measured values. These models effectively characterized the BRF of the vegetation cover at most of the selected wavelengths (565, 670, and 865 nm). However, for planophile vegetation cover with smooth leaves, the current BRF models did not produce accurate values in the selected visible wavelength range; the average relative difference was approximately 0.3 at 670 nm. Subsequently, we subtracted the specular reflectance factor (calculated using the bidirectional polarized reflectance factors) from the total BRF and compared these data with the modeled results. The difference between the measured and modeled BRFs was notably decreased when we separated the specular reflectance factor at 670 nm for the planophile vegetation cover with smooth leaves. Moreover, there was a different degree of improvement in the agreement between the measured and modeled results, which depended on the wavelength and the type of vegetation cover. These results indicated that the subtraction of the specular reflectance factor effectively improved the capability of the BRF models to calculate the diffuse portion of the BRF of the vegetation cover.

AB  - AimTo investigate the clinical significance of the DLN metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).MethodsA total of 231 PTC patients who underwent first surgical treatment in the Department of Hand and Neck Surgery of Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 2013 to June 2014 were enrolled. The relationship between Delphian lymph node (DLN) metastasis and patient age, gender, tumor size, tumor number, unilateral or bilateral, capsular invasion, pretracheal and paratracheal node metastasis, and lateral node metastasis was analyzed.ResultsWithin 231 cases, 69 showed DLN, but only 19 (8.23%) were found with metastasis. In the univariate analysis, DLN metastasis was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.023), capsular invasion (P = 0.001), pretracheal or paratracheal node metastasis (P = 0.003) and lateral node metastasis (P = 0.001), while there were no significant correlation between DLN metastasis and gender (P = 0.976), age (P = 0.976), tumor number (P = 0.234) and unilateral or bilateral (P = 0.724). In the multivariate analysis, capsular invasion was an independent risk factor of DLN metastasis (P < 0.05, odds ratio = 10.15).ConclusionCapsular invasion is an independent risk factor of DLN metastasis and DLN metastasis could be used as a predictor of lateral node metastasis. The dissection of DLN in PTC patients is recommended and lateral lymph node should be evaluated for patients with DLN positive.

TI  - An End-Member-Based Two-Source Approach for Estimating Land Surface Evapotranspiration From Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key variables in the water and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere. This paper develops an end-member-based two-source approach for estimating land surface ET (i.e., the ESVEP model) from remote sensing data, considering the differing responses of soil water content at the upper surface layer to soil evaporation and at the deeper root zone layer to vegetation transpiration. The ESVEP model first diverges the soil-vegetation system net radiation into soil and vegetation components by considering the transmission of direct and diffuse shortwave radiation separately from the transmission of longwave radiation through the canopy, then calculates the four dry/wet soil/vegetation end-members with the diverged soil and vegetation net radiations, and last separates soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration based on the two-phase ET dynamics and the four end-member temperatures. The model can overall produce reasonably good surface energy fluxes and is no more sensitive to meteorology, vegetation, and remote sensing inputs than other two-source energy balance models and surface temperature versus vegetation index (T-R-VI) trapezoid models. A reasonable agreement could be found with a small bias of +/- 8 W/m(2) and a root-mean-square error within 60 W/m(2) (comparable to accuracies published in other studies) when both model-estimated sensible heat flux and latent heat flux from MODIS remote sensing data are validated with ground-based large aperture scintillometer measurements.

TI  - Validating SMAP SSS with in situ measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved from SMAP radiometer measurements are validated against in situ salinity from Argo floats, tropical moored buoys and ship-based thermosalinograph (TSG) data. SMAP SSS achieved an accuracy of 0.2 PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In the tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1 m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from the assessment of the satellite data. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis gives an average standard deviation of 0.22 PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale. On monthly time scales, the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17 PSU and the correlation coefficient improved to 0.8. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusions from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from Argo floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG. Comparison with individual Argo floats suggests the SMAP retrieval algorithm performs better in the Western Mediterranean region, but suffers from radio-frequency interference (RFI) and land contamination in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Adriatic Sea.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Snow Cover in Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia, Based on Cloud-Free MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Product, 2001-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in snow cover under climate change is poorly understood in Tianshan Mountains. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of snow-covered area (SCA) and snow-covered days (SCD) in the Tianshan Mountains by using the cloud-removed MODIS fractional snow cover datasets from 2001-2015. The possible linkage between the snow cover and temperature and precipitation changes over the Tianshan Mountains is also investigated. The results are as follows: (1) The distribution of snow cover over the Tianshan Mountains exhibits a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The areas with SCD greater than 120 days are distributed in the principal mountains with elevations of above 3000 m. (2) In total, 26.39% (5.09% with a significant decline) and 34.26% (2.81% with a significant increase) of the study area show declining and increasing trend in SCD, respectively. The SCD mainly decreases in Central and Eastern Tianshan (decreased by 11.88% and 8.03%, respectively), while it increases in Northern and Western Tianshan (increased by 9.36% and 7.47%). (3) The snow cover variations are linked to the temperature and precipitation changes. Temperature tends to be the major factor effecting the snow cover changes in the Tianshan Mountains during 2001-2015.

TI  - A Hybrid EOF Algorithm to Improve MODIS Cyanobacteria Phycocyanin Data Quality in a Highly Turbid Lake: Bloom and Nonbloom Condition
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs can provide important protection for drinking water sources. In most inland waterbodies, phycocyanin (PC) concentrations are the best indicator of cyanobacteria distribution. PC has a characteristic absorption peak near 620 nm; however, reflectance at this wavelength is only available from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors. MERIS stopped providing data after 2012 and OLCI was only recently launched (February 2016). TheModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua is currently the only satellite instrument that can provide well-calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiance data over an extended number of years to the present. In this study, we develop and validate a new approach based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) to quantify PC concentrations in a turbid inland lake (Lake Chaohu, China). Based on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance data (Rrc) at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, the concentrations of PC were estimated by regression of 87 concurrent MODIS-field measurements for bloom and nonbloom conditions. The validation (N = 93) showed R-2 = 0.40 and unbiased RMS = 60.86%. Application of the algorithm from 2000 and 2014 showed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that confirmed in situ and MERIS-based studies of floating algae mats. The spatial information on PC concentrations in Lake Chaohu had a reduced sensitivity to perturbations from thin aerosols and high sediments. This EOF approach allows us for new insights in the long-term dynamics of shallow lakes and reservoirs where having a better understanding of cyanobacterial blooms is important.

TI  - A unique gene expression signature is significantly differentially expressed in tumor-positive or tumor-negative sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to learn whether molecular characterization through gene expression profiling of node-positive and node-negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with clinical stage I and II melanoma may improve the understanding of mechanisms of metastasis and identify gene signatures for SLNs(+)/SLNs(-) that correlate with diagnosis or clinical outcome. Gene expression profiling was performed on SLN biopsies of 48 (24 SLN+ and 24 SLN-) patients (T3a/b-T4a/b) who underwent staging of SLNs using transcriptome profiling analysis on 5 mu m sections of fresh SLNs. U133A 2.0 Affymetrix gene chips were used. Significance analysis of microarrays was used to test the association between gene expression level and SLN status. Genes with fold change more than 1.5 and q value less than 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to adjust for multiple testing in pathway analysis. We identified 89 probe sets that were significantly differentially expressed (1.5-27-fold; q < 0.05). Upon performing the pathway analysis, it was found that 25 genes were common among the most significant and biologically relevant canonical pathways. The molecules and pathways that achieved differential expression of highest statistical significance were notably related to melanoma and its microenvironment and to signaling pathways implicated in immunosuppression and development of cancer. A 25-gene signature is significantly differentially expressed between SLN+ and SLN- and is related to melanoma oncogenesis and immunosuppression. The identified expression profile provides a signature of melanoma nodal involvement. These findings warrant further investigation into the mechanisms of metastasis, melanoma metastasis diagnosis, and prediction of outcome. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Parametric Modelling of Potential Evapotranspiration: A Global Survey
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We present and validate a global parametric model of potential evapotranspiration (PET) with two parameters that are estimated through calibration, using as explanatory variables temperature and extraterrestrial radiation. The model is tested over the globe, taking advantage of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO CLIMWAT) database that provides monthly averaged values of meteorological inputs at 4300 locations worldwide. A preliminary analysis of these data allows for explaining the major drivers of PET over the globe and across seasons. The model calibration against the given Penman-Monteith values was carried out through an automatic optimization procedure. For the evaluation of the model, we present global maps of optimized model parameters and associated performance metrics, and also contrast its performance against the well-known Hargreaves-Samani method. Also, we use interpolated values of the optimized parameters to validate the predictive capacity of our model against monthly meteorological time series, at several stations worldwide. The results are very encouraging, since even with the use of abstract climatic information for model calibration and the use of interpolated parameters as local predictors, the model generally ensures reliable PET estimations. Exceptions are mainly attributed to irregular interactions between temperature and extraterrestrial radiation, as well as because the associated processes are influenced by additional drivers, e.g., relative humidity and wind speed. However, the analysis of the residuals shows that the model is consistent in terms of parameters estimation and model validation. The parameter maps allow for the direct use of the model wherever in the world, providing PET estimates in case of missing data, that can be further improved even with a short term acquisition of meteorological data.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy status is strongly predictive of survival in cutaneous melanoma: Extended follow-up of Oxford patients from 1998 to 2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is widely used as a key investigatory tool for cutaneous melanoma, with results incorporated into the latest AJCC staging guidelines. We present the results of our extended follow-up of sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma over a sixteen-year period.Methods: Data were collected prospectively from June 1998 to December 2014 from a single tertiary skin cancer referral centre. Chi-squared analysis was used to analyse patient demo-graphics and primary tumour pathology. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox regression models and Kaplane-Meier survival curves.Results: Over a sixteen-year period 1527 patients underwent SLNB in 1609 basins, with 2876 nodes harvested. 347 patients (23%) had a positive biopsy. The most common primary tumour sites for males was the back (32%); women had a significantly higher number of melanomas occurring on the lower and upper limbs (45% and 26% respectively) [ all p < 0.0001, Chisquared]. Mean follow-up time was 4.9 years. Patients with a positive SLNB at diagnosis were significantly more likely to die from melanoma (subhazard ratio 5.59, p = 0.000, 95% CI 3.59-8.69). Breslow thickness and ulceration were also significant predictors of melanoma-specific mortality. For patients with a primary Breslow >4.0 mm ten-year disease free survival was 52% for SLNB negative and 26% for SLNB positive patients. For Breslow thicknesses of 2.01-4 mm these values were 66% and 32% respectively.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsy status is strongly predictive of survival across all thicknesses of primary cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Addressing the source contribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on mortality: an evaluation study of its impacts on excess mortality in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated PM2.5 concentrations using satellite data and population mortality values for cause-specific diseases and employed the integrated exposure-response model to obtain the associations between exposure and response. PM2.5 source apportionment data were then used to evaluate the excess mortality attributable to PM2.5 from different emission sources. In 2013, 1.07 million excess deaths were attributed to PM2.5 exposure in China. The potentially avoidable excess deaths would be 279 000, 459 000, 731 000 and 898 000 if the PM2.5 concentrations were reduced to meet WHO interim target (IT)-1 (35 mu g m(-3), also theChinese standard), IT-2 (25 mu g m(-3)), IT-3 (15 mu g m(-3)) and the air quality guidelines (10 mu g m(-3)), respectively, compared with concentrations experienced in 2013. There were 249 000 (95% CI: 115-337), 228 000 (95% CI: 105-309), 203 000 (95% CI: 94-274), 197 000 (95% CI: 91-266), and 193 000 (95% CI: 88-262) excess deaths attributed to PM2.5 from coal burning, vehicle emissions, industry-related emissions, dust and other sources in 2013, respectively. Coal burning was the main source of atmospheric PM2.5; it contributed the most to excess mortalities and the health effects were likely to have been conservatively estimated. Considerable health benefits could be achieved if more stringent ambient PM2.5 standards were achieved in China.

TI  - Mapping Water Quality Parameters with Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument Imagery in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Sentinel-3A in 2016 is the beginning of a new era in long time, continuous, high frequency water quality monitoring of coastal waters. Therefore, there is a strong need to validate the OLCI products to be sure that the technical capabilities provided will be used in the best possible way in water quality monitoring and research. The Baltic Sea is an optically complex waterbody where many ocean colour products, performing well in other waterbodies, fail. We tested the performance of standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain in retrieving water reflectance, inherent optical properties (IOPs), and water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a, total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Baltic Sea. The reflectance spectra produced by the C2RCC are realistic in both shape and magnitude. However, the IOPs, and consequently the water quality parameters estimated by the C2RCC, did not have correlation with in situ data. On the other hand, some tested empirical remote sensing algorithms performed well in retrieving chlorophyll a, TSM, CDOM and Secchi depth from the reflectance produced by the C2RCC. This suggests that the atmospheric correction part of the processor performs relatively well while IOP retrieval part of the neural network needs extensive training with actual IOP data before it can produce reasonable estimates for the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) share transmission routes, dual infection could be frequent. In Spain, HTLV underdiagnosis is highlighted by the high proportion of patients presenting either with tropical spastic paraparesis or adult T cell leukemia at first diagnosis. We examined whether the renewed efforts for expanding HCV testing may provide a sentinel population that might selectively be targeted to unveil asymptomatic HTLV carriers. The presence of anti-HTLV antibodies was examined in 3,838 consecutive individuals with reactive HCV serology attended during the last 3 years at 13 hospitals distributed across the Spanish geography. Overall 71% were male, and the median age was 41 years old. Foreigners represented 9% of the study population. A total of 50 individuals (1.3%) were seroreactive for HTLV, being 30 confirmed as HTLV-2 and 2 as HTLV-1 (0.12%). The remaining 18 had indeterminate Western blot patterns. Most individuals with HTLV-2 and HTLV indeterminate serology were human immunodeficiency virus positive, former injection drug users, and native Spaniards. In contrast, the two HTLV-1 infections were found in men coming from Brazil and the Dominican Republic, respectively. In summary, the overall prevalence of HTLV infection in individuals living in Spain seropositive for HCV is 1.3%, more than 10-fold greater than in general outclinics in Spain. However, immigrants from HTLV-1 endemic regions and former injection drug users with HTLV-2 infection are by far the major contributory groups in HCV patients. Therefore, testing for HTLV in newly diagnosed HCV individuals would not contribute much to improve late HTLV diagnosis in Spain.

TI  - Intraoperative Tumor Detection Using a Ratiometric Activatable Fluorescent Peptide: A First-in-Human Phase 1 Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Positive surgical margins remain a significant challenge in breast cancer surgery. This report describes the use of a novel, first-in-human ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptide in breast cancer surgery.A two-part, multi-institutional phase 1 trial of AVB-620 with a 3+3 dose escalation and dose-expansion cohorts was conducted. The patients received an infusion of AVB-620 2-20 h before planned lumpectomy/mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy/axillary dissection. Imaging analysis was performed on images obtained from the surgical field as well as post-excision surgical specimens. Pathology reports were obtained to correlate imaging results with histopathologic data. Information on physical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were recorded.A total of 27 patients received infusion of AVB-620 and underwent surgical excision of breast cancer. The findings showed no adverse events or laboratory values attributable to infusion of AVB-620. The 8-mg dose was selected from the dose-escalation cohort for use with the expansion cohort based on imaging data. Region-of-interest (ROI) imaging analysis from the 8-mg cohort demonstrated measurable changes between pathology confirmed tumor-positive and tumor-negative tissue.Intraoperative imaging of surgical specimens after infusion with AVB-620 allowed for real-time tumor detection. Infusion of AVB-620 is safe and may improve intraoperative detection of malignant tissue during breast cancer operations.

TI  - Management of aorto-esophageal fistula secondary after thoracic endovascular aortic repair: a review of literature.
T2  - Clinical journal of gastroenterology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Aorto-esophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare and lethal entity, and the difficulty of making diagnosis of AEF is well-known. As promising results in the short-term effectiveness of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) promote its usage, the occurrence of AEF after TEVAR (post-TEVAR AEF) increases as one of the major complications. Therefore, we provide a review concerning the management strategy of post-TEVAR AEF. Although its representative symptom was reported as the triad of mid-thoracic pain and sentinel hematemesis followed by massive hematemesis, the symptom-free interval between sentinel hemorrhage and massive exsanguination is unpredictable. However, the physiological condition represents a surgical contraindication. Accordingly, early diagnosis is important, but either CT or esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy rarely depicts a typical image. The formation of post-TEVAR AEF might be associated with the infection of micro-organisms, which is uncontrollable with anti-biotic administration. The current first-line strategy is combination therapy as follows, (1) to control bleeding by TEVAR in the urgent phase, and (2) radical debridement and aortic/esophageal re-construction in the semi-urgent phase. In view of the high mortality and morbidity rate, it is proposed that the choice in treatment strategies might be affected by patient`s condition, size of the wall defects and the etiology of AEF. Practically, we should keep in mind the importance of making an early diagnosis and, once a suspicious symptom has occurred in a patient with a history of TEVAR, the existence of post-TEVAR AEF should be suspected. A prospective registry together with more developed technologies will be needed to establish a future strategy.

TI  - Utilization of Electronic Health Record Events to Conduct a Tuberculosis Contact Investigation in a High-Risk Oncology Unit
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To describe the utilization of electronic medical data resources, including health records and nursing scheduling resources, to conduct a tuberculosis (TB) exposure investigation in a high-risk oncology unit.SETTING A 42-bed inpatient unit with a mix of surgical and medical patients at a large tertiary-care cancer center in New York City.PARTICIPANTS High-risk subjects and coworkers exposed to a healthcare worker (HCW) with cavitary smear positive lung TB.RESULTS During the 3-month exposure period, 270 patients were admitted to the unit; 137 of these (50.7%) received direct care from the index case HCW. Host immune status and intensity of exposure were used to establish criteria for postexposure testing, and 63 patients (45%) met these criteria for first-tier postexposure testing. No cases of active TB occurred. Among coworkers, 146 had significant exposure (ie, >8 hours cumulative). In the 22-month follow-up period after the exposure, no purified protein derivative or interferon gamma release assay conversions or active cases of TB occurred among exposed HCWs or patients.CONCLUSIONS Electronic medical records and employee scheduling systems are useful resources to conduct otherwise labor-intensive contact investigations. Despite the high-risk features of our index case, a highly vulnerable immunocompromised patient population, and extended proximity to coworkers, we did not find any evidence of transmission of active or latent tuberculosis infection among exposed individuals.

TI  - Targeting C-type lectin receptors: a high-carbohydrate diet for dendritic cells to improve cancer vaccines
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - There is a growing understanding of why certain patients do or do not respond to checkpoint inhibition therapy. This opens new opportunities to reconsider and redevelop vaccine strategies to prime an anticancer immune response. Combination of such vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors will both provide the fuel and release the brake for an efficient anticancer response. Here, we discuss vaccine strategies that use C-type lectin receptor (CLR) targeting of APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. APCs are a necessity for the priming of antigen-specific cytotoxic and helper T cells. Because CLRs are natural carbohydrate-recognition receptors highly expressed by multiple subsets of APCs and involved in uptake and processing of Ags for presentation, these receptors seem particularly interesting for targeting purposes.

TI  - A systems perspective on markets - Toward a research agenda
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the implications of an emerging, increasingly important way of thinking about markets: systems thinking. A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Influence of neighbourhood information on 'Local Climate Zone' mapping in heterogeneous cities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zone (LCZ) mapping is an emerging field in urban climate research. LCZs potentially provide an objective framework to assess urban form and function worldwide. The scheme is currently being used to globally map LCZs as a part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) initiative. So far, most of the LCZ maps lack proper quantitative assessment, challenging the generic character of the WUDAPT workflow. Using the standard method introduced by the WUDAPT community difficulties arose concerning the built zones due to high levels of heterogeneity. To overcome this problem a contextual classifier is adopted in the mapping process. This paper quantitatively assesses the influence of neighbourhood information on the LCZ mapping result of three cities in Belgium: Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent. Overall accuracies for the maps were respectively 85.7 +/- 0.5, 79.6 +/- 0.9, 90.2 +/- 0.4%. The approach presented here results in overall accuracies of 93.6 +/- 0.2, 92.6 +/- 0.3 and 95.6 +/- 0.3% for Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent. The results thus indicate a positive influence of neighbourhood information for all study areas with an increase in overall accuracies of 7.9, 13.0 and 5.4%. This paper reaches two main conclusions. Firstly, evidence was introduced on the relevance of a quantitative accuracy assessment in LCZ mapping, showing that the accuracies reported in previous papers are not easily achieved, Secondly, the method presented in this paper proves to be highly effective in Belgian cities, and given its open character shows promise for application in other heterogeneous cities worldwide.

TI  - Different outcome in node-positive breast cancer patients found by axillary ultrasound or sentinel node procedure
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Z0011 trial initiated a paradigm shift in the axillary treatment of breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), disregarding patients with a positive ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy (UGLNB). We examined whether relevant differences exist between these patients to determine if the conclusions of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial are applicable to UGLNB-positive patients.Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the Netherlands between January 2008 and December 2014 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry.A total of 11,820 cases were included: 9149 cases in the SLNB group and 2671 in the UGLNB group. Multivariate analyses showed that UGLNB-positive patients were older (p < 0.001), more likely to have a poorly differentiated tumor (p < 0.001), had a negative hormone receptor status (p < 0.001), and more often had extensive nodal involvement (p < 0.001). However, they were less likely to undergo adjuvant radiation (p = 0.004) or systemic therapy (p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for these factors, UGLNB-positive patients had a worse overall survival (HR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.23-1.56) than SLNB-positive patients.This nationwide retrospective study shows that young patients found positive by UGLNB have less favorable disease characteristics and a worse prognosis compared to patients with a positive SLNB. Selection by ultrasound plays an important role when axillary treatment strategies are considered. Hence, the conclusions of the Z0011 trial cannot unconditionally be applied to patients with a positive UGLNB.

TI  - Applying the change vector analysis technique to assess the desertification risk in the south-west of Romania in the period 1984-2011
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The desertification risk affects around 40% of the agricultural land in various regions of Romania. The purpose of this study is to analyse the risk of desertification in the south-west of Romania in the period 19842011 using the change vector analysis (CVA) technique and Landsat thematic mapper (TM) satellite images. CVA was applied to combinations of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)-albedo, NDVI-bare soil index (BI) and tasselled cap greenness (TCG)-tasselled cap brightness (TCB). The combination NDVI-albedo proved to be the best in assessing the desertification risk, with an overall accuracy of 87.67%, identifying a desertification risk on 25.16% of the studied period. The classification of the maps was performed for the following classes: desertification risk, re-growing and persistence. Four degrees of desertification risk and regrowing were used: low, medium, high and extreme. Using the combination NDVI-albedo, 0.53% of the analysed surface was assessed as having an extreme degree of desertification risk, 3.93% a high degree, 8.72% a medium degree and 11.98% a low degree. The driving forces behind the risk of desertification are both anthropogenic and climatic causes. The anthropogenic causes include the destruction of the irrigation system, deforestation, the destruction of the forest shelterbelts, the fragmentation of agricultural land and its inefficient management. Climatic causes refer to increase of temperatures, frequent and prolonged droughts and decline of the amount of precipitation.

CP  - Conference on Small Area Estimation (SAE)
CL  - Paris, FRANCE
AB  - For the estimation of spruce timber reserves in individual forest districts of the German federal state Rhineland-Palatinate, small area methods are applied. A model using stock values of the state forest inventory and a canopy height model derived by airborne laser scanning is used to provide adequate estimates. Since the interaction between the variables is non-linear and must fulfil further constraints, a new spline-based small area estimation method is proposed, formulated as a quadratic programming problem. This method enables providing realistic estimates via including specialized constraints which are especially important in practice as well as more stable estimates. The applicability of the new method and the related mean-squared-error estimators is shown in a simulation study. Further, spruce timber reserves in Rhineland-Palatinate are estimated by using the new approach compared with already existing methods.

TI  - Aerosol pollution and its potential impacts on outdoor human thermal sensation: East Asian perspectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols affect the insolation at ground and thus the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD, a measure of aerosol pollution) plays an important role on the variation of the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) at locations with different aerosol climatology. The aerosol effects upon PET were studied for the first time at four East Asian cities by coupling a radiative transfer model and a human thermal comfort model which were previously well evaluated. Evident with the MODIS and AERONET AOD observations, the aerosol pollution at Beijing and Seoul was higher than at Chiayi (Taiwan) and Hong Kong. Based on the AERONET data, with background AOD levels the selected temperate cities had similar clear-sky PET values especially during summertime, due to their locations at similar latitudes. This also applied to the sub-tropical cities. Increase in the AOD level to the seasonal average one led to an increase in diffuse solar radiation and in turn an increase in PET for people living in all the cities. However, the heavy aerosol loading environment in Beijing and Seoul in summertime (AODs > 3.0 in episodic situations) reduced the total radiative flux and thus PET values in the cities. On the contrary, relatively lower episodic AOD levels in Chiayi and Hong Kong led to strong diffuse and still strong direct radiative fluxes and resulted in higher PET values, relative to those with seasonal averaged AOD levels. People tended to feel from "hot" to "very hot" during summertime when the AOD reached their average levels from the background level. This implies that in future aerosol effects add further burden to the thermal environment apart from the effects of greenhouse gas-induced global warming. Understanding the interaction between ambient aerosols and outdoor thermal environment is an important first step for effective mitigation measures such as urban greening to reduce the risk of human heat stress. It is also critical to make cities more attractive and enhancing to human well-being to achieve enhancing sustainable urbanization as one of the principal goals for the Nature-based Solutions.

TI  - Automatic Matching of Multi-Source Satellite Images: A Case Study on ZY-1-02C and ETM+
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever-growing number of applications for satellites is being compromised by their poor direct positioning precision. Existing orthoimages, such as enhanced thematic mapper (ETM+) orthoimages, can provide georeferences or improve the geo-referencing accuracy of satellite images, such ZY-1-02C images that have unsatisfactory positioning precision, thus enhancing their processing efficiency and application. In this paper, a feasible image matching approach using multi-source satellite images is proposed on the basis of an experiment carried out with ZY-1-02C Level 1 images and ETM+ orthoimages. The proposed approach overcame differences in rotation angle, scale, and translation between images. The rotation and scale variances were evaluated on the basis of rational polynomial coefficients. The translation vectors were generated after blocking the overall phase correlation. Then, normalized cross-correlation and least-squares matching were applied for matching. Finally, the gross errors of the corresponding points were eliminated by local statistic vectors in a TIN structure. Experimental results showed a matching precision of less than two pixels (root-mean-square error), and comparison results indicated that the proposed method outperforms Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), and Affine-Scale Invariant Feature Transform (A-SIFT) in terms of reliability and efficiency.

TI  - Fractional Snow Cover Mapping from FY-2 VISSR Imagery of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily fractional snow cover (FSC) products derived from optical sensors onboard low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are often discontinuous, primarily due to prevalent cloud cover. To map the daily cloud-reduced FSC over China, we utilized clear-sky multichannel observations from the first-generation Chinese geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites (namely, the FY-2 series) by taking advantage of their high temporal resolution. The method proposed in this study combines a newly developed binary snow cover detection algorithm designed for the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2F with a simple linear spectral mixture technique applied to the visible (VIS) band. This method relies upon full snow cover and snow-free end-members to estimate the daily FSC. The FY-2E/F VISSR FSC maps of China were compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FSC data based on the multiple end-member spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), and with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) FSC maps based on the SNOWMAP approach. The FY-2E/F VISSR FSC maps, which demonstrate a lower cloud coverage, exhibit the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 0.20/0.19 compared with the MODIS FSC data. When validated against the Landsat-8 OLI FSC data, the FY-2E/F VISSR FSC maps, which display overall accuracies that can reach 0.92, have an RMSE of 0.18-0.29 with R-2 values ranging from 0.46 to 0.80.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Aerosol Optical Depth Using an Airborne Polarimeter over North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The airborne Atmosphere Multi-angle Polarization Radiometer (AMPR) was employed to perform airborne measurements over North China between 2012 and 2016. Seven flights and synchronous ground-based observations were acquired. These data were used to test the sensor's measurements and associated aerosol retrieval algorithm. According to the AMPR measurements, a successive surface-atmosphere decoupling based algorithm was developed to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD). It works via an iteration method, and the lookup table was employed in the aerosol inversion. Throughout the results of the AMPR retrievals, the surface polarized reflectances derived from air- and ground-based instruments were well matched; the measured and simulated reflectances at the aircraft level, which were simulated based on in situ sun photometer observed aerosol properties, were in good agreement; and the AOD measurements were validated against the automatic sun-photometer (CE318) at the nearest time and location. The AOD results were close; the average deviation was less than 0.03. The MODIS AODs were also employed to test the AMPR retrievals, and they showed the same trend. These results illustrate that (i) the successive surface-atmosphere decoupling method in the retrieved program completed its mission and (ii) the aerosol retrieval method has its rationality and potential ability in the regionally accurate remote sensing of aerosol.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Data Based Artificial Neural Network Approach for Predicting Climate-Sensitive Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Case Study of Human Brucellosis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technologies can accurately capture environmental characteristics, and together with environmental modeling approaches, help to predict climate-sensitive infectious disease outbreaks. Brucellosis remains rampant worldwide in both domesticated animals and humans. This study used human brucellosis (HB) as a test case to identify important environmental determinants of the disease and predict its outbreaks. A novel artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed, using annual county-level numbers of HB cases and data on 37 environmental variables, potentially associated with HB in Inner Mongolia, China. Data from 2006 to 2008 were used to train, validate and test the model, while data for 2009-2010 were used to assess the model's performance. The Enhanced Vegetation Index was identified as the most important predictor of HB incidence, followed by land surface temperature and other temperature- and precipitation-related variables. The suitable ecological niche of HB was modeled based on these predictors. Model estimates were found to be in good agreement with reported numbers of HB cases in both the model development and assessment phases. The study suggests that HB outbreaks may be predicted, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, using the ANN model and environmental variables obtained from satellite data. The study deepened the understanding of environmental determinants of HB and advanced the methodology for prediction of climate-sensitive infectious disease outbreaks.

TI  - A Rigorously-Weighted Spatiotemporal Fusion Model with Uncertainty Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest has been growing with regard to the use of remote sensing data characterized by a fine spatial resolution and frequent coverage for the monitoring of land surface dynamics. However, current satellite sensors are fundamentally limited by a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolutions. Spatiotemporal fusion thus provides a feasible solution to overcome this limitation, and many blending algorithms have been developed. Among them, the popular spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is based on a weighted function; however, it uses an ad hoc approach to estimate the weights of surrounding similar pixels. Additionally, an uncertainty analysis of the predicted result is not provided in the STARFM or any other fusion algorithm. This paper proposes a rigorously-weighted spatiotemporal fusion model (RWSTFM) based on geostatistics to blend the surface reflectances of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The RWSTFM, which is based on ordinary kriging, derives the weights in terms of a fitted semivariance-distance relationship and calculates the estimation variance, which is a measure of the prediction uncertainty. The RWSTFM was tested using three datasets and compared with two commonly-used spatiotemporal reflectance fusion algorithms: the STARFM and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method. The fusion results show that the proposed RWSTFM consistently outperformed the other algorithms both visually and quantitatively. Additionally, more than 70% of the squared error was accounted for by the estimation variance of the RWSTFM for all three of the datasets.

TI  - Assessment of the NOAA S-NPP VIIRS Geolocation Reprocessing Improvements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term time series analysis requires consistent data records from satellites. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar orbiting Partner (S-NPP) satellite launched in 2011 requires a major effort to produce consistently calibrated sensor data records (SDR). Accurate VIIRS geolocation products are critical to other VIIRS products and products from other instruments on the S-NPP satellite. This paper presents methods for assessing major improvements to the VIIRS geolocation products in the ongoing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) reprocessing that incorporates all corrections in calibration parameters and SDR algorithms since launch to present. In this study, we analyzed the history of VIIRS geometric calibration parameter updates to identify optimal parameters to account for geolocation errors in the early days of the mission. A sample area located in North Western Africa was selected for validation purposes after analyzing global VIIRS and Landsat control point matching results. Geolocation products over the study region were reprocessed and I-bands/M-bands geolocation improvements were characterized by comparing geolocation errors before and after the reprocessing. Our results indicate that all short-term geolocation anomalies before the latest operational geometric calibration parameter update on 22 August 2013 were effectively minimized after reprocessing, with geolocation errors reduced from -47.1 +/- 83.8 m to -23.3 +/- 51.1 m (along scan) and from -15.6 +/- 43.6 m to -5.9 +/- 37.7 m (along track). Terrain correction for the VIIRS Day-Night-Band (DNB) was not implemented in the NOAA operational processing until 22 May 2015. In the reprocessing, it will be implemented to the entire DNB geolocation data record. DNB reprocessing improvement due to this implementation was evaluated using nighttime observations over point sources at sea level and over high altitude. Our results show that the implementation of terrain correction will reduce DNB geolocation errors at off-nadir high elevation locations from up to 9 km to similar to 0.5 pixel (0.375 km), comparable to those at sea level site. The reprocessed geolocation dataset will be distributed online for end-users to access.

TI  - Detection of Bivalve Beds on Exposed Intertidal Flats Using Polarimetric SAR Indicators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose new indicators for bivalve (oyster and mussel) beds on exposed intertidal flats, derived from dual-copolarization (HH + VV) TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2, and ALOS-2 images of the German North Sea coast. Our analyses are based upon the Kennaugh element framework, and we show that different targets on exposed intertidal flats exhibit different radar backscattering characteristics, which manifest in different magnitudes of the Kennaugh elements. Namely, the inter-channel correlation's real (K-3) and imaginary (K-7) part can be used to distinguish bivalve beds from surrounding sandy sediments, and together with the polarimetric coefficient (i.e., the normalized differential polarization ratio, K-0/K-4) they can be used as indicators for bivalve beds using multi-frequency dual-copolarization SAR data. Our results show that continuous bivalve bed monitoring is possible using dual-copolarimetric SAR acquisitions at all radar wavelengths.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Rice Disease Using Near Infrared Spectra Technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rice disease is one of the most serious injurious factors that cause major loss of rice production and subsequent economy in agricultural industry. This study explored a new method for obtaining information of the rice disease in a short term through model regression methods. The spectrum characteristics of rice leaves under different disease damage were firstly analyzed for its relationship with rice disease level. The sensitive bands of the spectrum for accurately supervising rice diseases were selected with principal component analysis (PCA). The stepwise regression method and BP neural network were both used to establish the spectrum-based models for recognizing rice diseases. Results showed that five major characteristic bands were determined by PCA (990, 1850, 660, 1921, and 1933 nm) for monitoring foliar rice diseases, among which the edge area for red light had the best correlation with rice disease level was also selected as the parameter to establish the model. Specifically, the composite reflectivity of wavelengths between 990 and 1933 nm was negatively related to rice brown spot diseases stress, which was then used to establish the model. Parameters of the red edge area and the ranged reflectivity between 660 and 990 nm were used to establish models for monitoring rice sheath blight diseases. Totally, there were 60 samples employed to build models for identifying the two diseases by the stepwise regression method and the BP neural network method, and the rest 41 ones were used for further model verification. Compared with the stepwise regression analysis, BP neural network was evaluated to perform better with characteristic bands at 660, 990, and 1933 nm. In conclusion, the establishment of the function model in our study can be implemented to monitor rice diseases, which provided a theoretical basis for indirect and rapid monitoring rice diseases.

TI  - Estimating Fractional Vegetation Cover From Landsat-7 ETM+ Reflectance Data Based on a Coupled Radiative Transfer and Crop Growth Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important parameter for earth surface process simulations, climate modeling, and global change studies. Currently, several FVC products have been generated from coarse resolution (similar to 1 km) remote sensing data, and have been widely used. However, coarse resolution FVC products are not appropriate for precise land surface monitoring at regional scales, and finer spatial resolution FVC products are needed. Time-series coarse spatial resolution FVC products at high temporal resolutions contain vegetation growth information. Incorporating such information into the finer spatial resolution FVC estimation may improve the accuracy of FVC estimation. Therefore, a method for estimating finer spatial resolution FVC from coarse resolution FVC products and finer spatial resolution satellite reflectance data is proposed in this paper. This method relies on the coupled PROSAIL radiative transfer model and a statistical crop growth model built from the coarse resolution FVC product. The performance of the proposed method is investigated using the time-series Global LAnd Surface Satellite FVC product and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus reflectance data in a cropland area of the Heihe River Basin. The direct validation of the FVC estimated using the proposed method with the ground measured FVC data (R-2 = 0.6942, RMSE = 0.0884), compared with the widely used dimidiate pixel model (R-2 = 0.7034, RMSE = 0.1575), shows that the proposed method is feasible for estimating finer spatial resolution FVC with satisfactory accuracy, and it has the potential to be applied at a large scale.

TI  - Cytogenetics with flow cytometry in lymph node/extranodal tissue biopsies is sensitive to assist the early diagnosis of suspected lymphomas
T2  - ANNALS OF HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have examined the value of cytogenetic studies with flow cytometry (FC) in lymph node/extranodal tissue biopsies with suspected lymphoma. To evaluate this, G-banded karyotyping and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with FC immunophenotyping were performed on 185 lymph node or extranodal tissue biopsy specimens with suspected lymphoma. Complete cytogenetic analysis of lymph node/extranodal tissue was successful in 174 cases (94.1%) and 57.5% demonstrated chromosomal abnormalities. In 116 malignant lymphoma cases, 83.8% showed abnormalities. In 74 B cell lymphomas (B-NHL), abnormalities were more frequent in lymph node/extranodal tissues than in bone marrow by conventional cytogenetics (CC, 97.2 vs 26.1%), FISH (70.6 vs 17.6%), and FC (98.6 vs 28.4%). Three B-NHL diagnoses were confirmed by re-biopsy of lymph nodes due to the presence of abnormalities in the first biopsy, but no evidence of malignancy in pathological, FC, or IgH/TCR gene rearrangement analyses. In 29 T cell lymphomas (T-NHL), abnormalities were more frequent in lymph nodes than in bone marrow by CC (67.9 vs 21.4%) and FC (75.9 vs 27.6%) analyses. As expected, in 13 Hodgkin lymphoma cases, abnormalities were more frequent in lymph nodes than bone marrow by CC (41.7 vs 16.7%) and FC (30.8 vs 7.7%) analyses. In 56 reactive lymphoid hyperplasias (RLH), 7.1% had conventional clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. Two of these patients died of disease progression and two had their pathological diagnosis revised after the second review. These findings indicate that cytogenetic analysis combined with FC in lymph node/extranodal tissue biopsies can provide critical information in the auxiliary diagnosis of lymphoma.

TI  - Monitoring the trends of aeolian desertified lands based on time-series remote sensing data in the Horqin Sandy Land, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian desertification is one of the most significant environmental and socio-economic problems, represents a major component of land degradation, and seriously harms the ecological environment, leading to adverse impacts on human society. Monitoring aeolian desertification and identifying the driving factors behind it are crucial for developing prevention and management strategies to combat this issue. The objectives of this study were to monitor the trends of aeolian desertification in Horqin Sandy Land by using time-series MODIS-NDVI remote sensing data for the period of 2000-2013. A dimidiate pixel model was chosen to calculate the Vegetation Coverage Index (VCI), while a unary linear regression analysis was used for a temporal trend analysis of the Aeolian Desertification Index (ADI) and selected climate factors. The Sen's slope estimator and the Mann Kendall statistical test were used to analyze the spatial trends of the ADI. (1) The temporal trend of ADI showed three stages: reversion during the period of 2000-2005 and 2009-2013, and development during the period of 2005-2009. For the five classes of ADI, the areas of non-aeolian desertified lands (N) showed an increasing trend and the slight (SL), moderate (M), serious (S), and very serious aeolian desertified lands (VS) showed decreasing trends, with the decline in areas of SL and M contributing to the reversion of aeolian desertification. (2) The spatial distribution showed that the VS was mainly distributed in the southwestern portion, and the S was mainly distributed around the VS portion. The SL and M formed a straight line from the southwest to the northeast, bisecting the two areas of S. The N was mainly distributed in the northwestern portion and the eastern edges of the study area. (3) The spatial trends showed that areas of decreasing and significantly decreasing ADI trends occupied 78.44%, while areas with increasing and significantly increasing ADI trends only occupied 21.56% of the study area over the period of 2000-2013, indicating that aeolian desertification in Horqin Sandy Land is decreasing overall and advancing in certain portions. (4) The driving factors of aeolian desertification were analyzed from the perspectives of two groups: climate and anthropogenic factors. We found that the desertification control measures and favorable climate condition have played key roles in the process of desertification reversion; and climate fluctuations, reclamation and livestock pressure have led to the desertification development. The results can provide meaningful information for the prevention and control of aeolian desertification in Horqin Sandy Land.

TI  - Investigating spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture content in an arid mining area using an improved thermal inertia model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining operations can usually lead to environmental deteriorations. Underground mining activities could cause an extensive decrease in groundwater level and thus a dramatic variation in soil moisture content (SMC). In this study, the spatial and temporal variations of SMC from 2001 to 2015 at two spatial scales (i.e., the Shendong coal mining area and the Daliuta Coal Mine) were analyzed using an improved thermal inertia model with a long-term series of Landsat TM/OLI (TM=Thematic Mapper and OLI=Operational Land Imager) data. Our results show that at large spatial scale (the Shendong coal mining area), underground mining activities had insignificant negative impacts on SMC and that at small spatial scale (the Daliuta Coal Mine), underground mining activities had significant negative impacts on SMC. Trend analysis of SMC demonstrated that areas with decreasing trend of SMC were mainly distributed in the mined area, indicating that underground mining is a primary cause for the drying trend in the mining region in this arid environment.

TI  - Application of the Support Vector Regression Method for Turbidity Assessment with MODIS on a Shallow Coral Reef Lagoon (Voh-Kone-Pouembout, New Caledonia)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle transport by erosion from ultramafic lands in pristine tropical lagoons is a crucial problem, especially for the benthic and pelagic biodiversity associated with coral reefs. Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledoniathe second longest continuous coral reef in the worldwhich is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014-2015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parametersbathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model's capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate. This SVR model is applicable to the whole shallow lagoon waters from the Western Coast of New Caledonia and it is now ready to be tested over other oligotrophic shallow lagoon waters worldwide.

TI  - Predictions of Surface Solar Radiation on Tilted Solar Panels using Machine Learning Models: A Case Study of Tainan City, Taiwan
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, forecasting models were constructed to estimate surface solar radiation on an hourly basis and the solar irradiance received by solar panels at different tilt angles, to enhance the capability of photovoltaic systems by estimating the amount of electricity they generate, thereby improving the reliability of the power they supply. The study site was Tainan in southern Taiwan, which receives abundant sunlight because of its location at a latitude of approximately 23 degrees. Four forecasting models of surface solar irradiance were constructed, using the multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and linear regression (LR), algorithms, respectively. The forecast horizon ranged from 1 to 12 h. The findings are as follows: first, solar irradiance was effectively estimated when a combination of ground weather data and solar position data was applied. Second, the mean absolute error was higher in MLP than in RF and kNN, and LR had the worst predictive performance. Third, the observed total solar irradiance was 1.562 million w/m(2) per year when the solar-panel tilt angle was 0 degrees (i.e., the non-tilted position) and peaked at 1.655 million w/m(2) per year when the angle was 20-22 degrees. The level of the irradiance was almost the same when the solar-panel tilt angle was 0 degrees as when the angle was 41 degrees. In summary, the optimal solar-panel tilt angle in Tainan was 20-22 degrees.

TI  - Factors Controlling Temporal Stability of Surface Soil Moisture: A Watershed-Scale Modeling Study
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variability of soil moisture makes it difficult to represent watershed-scale soil moisture using traditional point-scale soil moisture sensors. In the temporal stability method, the spatial pattern of soil moisture is assumed to persist with time. Hence, measurements at a representative point can be used to represent the mean soil moisture. We investigated the factors that determine temporal stability and attempted to locate these representative points. Long-term simulated high-resolution soil moisture data, at a watershed scale, were used. Results showed that locations with a dominant vegetation cover and a low topographic wetness index (TI) can provide reasonable mean soil moisture estimates. Using vegetation cover and TI information, we minimized the number of the sampling locations needed for identifying the best estimate of the true watershed-scale mean. The sampling period duration is also a key factor. Using random combination tests, the minimum number of required sampling points and shortest sampling time were estimated. When 10 sampling points were used, a sampling period of 10 mo was required for accurately determining the representative point. Our study results will help apply the temporal stability method to the estimation of areal soil moisture and the calibration and validation of remote sensing data.

TI  - APPLICATION OF A SIMPLE SURVEILLANCE METHOD FOR DETECTING THE PREVALENCE AND IMPACT OF OVERUSE INJURIES IN PROFESSIONAL MEN'S BASKETBALL
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to use the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Overuse Injury Questionnaire to record overuse injuries over a single season for a men's professional basketball team to (a) assess the prevalence and severity of overuse injuries and (b) determine the efficacy of this method in identifying overuse injuries in comparison with the team physiotherapist's detection of these injuries. Thirteen athletes from a men's professional basketball team participated in this study. The self-reported, OSTRC injury questionnaire was used to record overuse conditions of the ankle, knee, and lower back over an entire 24-week season. Standard time-loss injury registration methods were also used to record overuse conditions by the physiotherapist. Overuse injury rates per 1,000 hours of athlete exposure and average weekly prevalence of overuse injuries were calculated using the results of the questionnaire. A total of 183 overuse conditions were identified by the questionnaire, whereas only 28 overuse conditions were identified by the physiotherapist. The team's average weekly prevalence of all overuse conditions was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60-66), with the highest prevalence of injury affecting the lower back (25.9% [95% CI: 19.7-32.1]). The overuse injury rate per 1,000 hours of athlete exposure was 6.4. The OSTRC overuse injury questionnaire captures many more overuse injuries in basketball than standard time-loss methods. The prevalence of lower back injuries is higher than that previously reported in basketball. This additional method of overuse injury surveillance may more accu-rately quantify the overuse injury problem in basketball and aid earlier intervention and management of these conditions.

TI  - 3D Monitoring of Buildings Using TerraSAR-X InSAR, DInSAR and PolSAR Capacities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of cities increases the need of urban remote sensing for a large scale monitoring. This paper provides greater understanding of how TerraSAR-X (TSX) high-resolution abilities enable to reach the spatial precision required to monitor individual buildings, through the use of a 4 year temporal stack of 100 images over Paris (France). Three different SAR modes are investigated for this purpose. First a method involving a whole time-series is proposed to measure realistic heights of buildings. Then, we show that the small wavelength of TSX makes the interferometric products very sensitive to the ordinary building-deformation, and that daily deformation can be measured over the entire building with a centimetric accuracy, and without any a priori on the deformation evolution, even when neglecting the impact of the atmosphere. Deformations up to 4 cm were estimated for the Eiffel Tower and up to 1 cm for other lower buildings. These deformations were analyzed and validated with weather and in situ local data. Finally, four TSX polarimetric images were used to investigate geometric and dielectric properties of buildings under the deterministic framework. Despite of the resolution loss of this mode, the possibility to estimate the structural elements of a building orientations and their relative complexity in the spatial organization are demonstrated.

TI  - Investigation of Lunar Spinels at Sinus Aestuum
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinus Aestuum is the only known location on the Moon where orbital data have detected Fe-and/or Cr-spinel. We analyzed Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M-3) visible to near-infrared data of the largest and strongest spinel signatures and determined that these locations always correspond to impact craters. M-3 spectra show that at least three types of spinels may be present, all of which exhibit a strong and broad absorption at similar to 2100 nm, and also one of the following: (1) a narrow 700-750 nm absorption, (2) a broad 600-900 nm absorption, or (3) both a weaker 700 nm and stronger 1000 nm absorption. All the spinel detections occur on either larger highland massifs that make up Sinus Aestuum east and west or smaller highland kipukas and buried highlands within the mare. Almost all of the spinel signatures occur within the mapped pyroclastic dark mantle deposit (DMD). The strong correlation between spinel and DMD distribution on the highlands at Sinus Aestuum is best explained if the spinels were emplaced during the same explosive eruption(s) that deposited the pyroclastics in the Sinus Aestuum DMD. Our observations are most consistent with models of melt-rock reactions in the anorthositic lunar crust that produce contaminated (high-Al) regions within a volcanic dike or magmatic reservoir that was capable of erupting pyroclastic glass beads containing pleonaste spinel [Mg, Fe] Al2O4. Over billions of years, this surface layer of spinels and pyroclastics became heterogeneously mixed into and partially buried within the highland regolith where younger impact craters may sometimes expose it.Plain Language Summary In this study, we analyzed several remote sensing data sets of the Moon to understand the distribution of the mineral spinel at a region called Sinus Aestuum. The type of spinel we identified is thus far only found at this one location on the Moon so this region appears unique and could provide important insights into the volcanic and thermal history of the Moon. The spinels likely formed within the same magma chamber that produced small volcanic glass beads during an explosive volcanic eruption a few billion years ago.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Tumor Cell Dissemination to the Sentinel Lymph Nodes and to the Bone Marrow in Patients With Nonmetastasized Colon Cancer A Prospective Multicenter Study
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Small nodal tumor infiltrates (SNTI; isolated tumor cells and micrometastases) in sentinel lymph nodes and bone marrow micrometastases (BMM) were independently described as prognostic factors in patients with colon cancer.OBJECTIVE To examine the association between the occurrence of SNTI and BMM as well as their prognostic relevance.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective studywas conducted at 3 university-affiliated institutions in Switzerland between May 2000 and December 2006. Statistical analyses were performed in October 2016. A total of 122 patients with stage I to III colon cancer were included. Follow-up time exceeded 6 years, with no patients lost to follow-up.INTERVENTIONS Bone marrow aspiration from the iliac crests and in vivo sentinel lymph node mapping were performed during open standard oncological resection. Bone marrow aspirates were stained with the pancytokeratin marker A45-B/B3. All sentinel lymph nodes underwent multilevel sectioning and were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the pancytokeratin marker AE1/AE3.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Association of SNTI in sentinel lymph nodes andBMMin patients with stage I to III colon cancer and the prognostic effect on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS Of the 122 patients, 63 (51.6%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 71.2 (11.7) years. Small nodal tumor infiltrates and BMM were found in a total of 21 patients (17.2%) and 46 patients (37.7%), respectively. The occurrence of BMM was not associated with the presence of SNTI by standard correlation (k,-0.07; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.14; P =.49) nor by univariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.22-1.67; P =.37) or multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.34-3.28; P =.88). The presence of SNTI was an independent negative prognostic factor for DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.24-6.93; P =.02) and OS (HR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.56-10.45; P =.005), as was BMM (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.06-4.06; P =.04; and HR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.26-5.70; P =.01; respectively). The combined detection of BMM and SNTI demonstrated the poorest DFS (HR, 6.73; 95% CI, 2.29-19.76; P =.006) and OS (HR, 5.96; 95% CI, 1.66-21.49; P =.03).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study demonstrates no association between the occurrence of SNTI and BMM in patients with stage I to III colon cancer. However, both SNTI and BMM are independent negative prognostic factors regarding DFS and OS, and the occurrence of both is associated with significantly worse prognosis compared with either one of them.

TI  - Predicting Nodal Positivity in Women 70 Years of Age and Older with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer to Aid Incorporation of a Society of Surgical Oncology Choosing Wisely Guideline into Clinical Practice
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. One of the Society of Surgical Oncology Choosing Wisely guidelines recommends avoiding routine sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery in clinically node-negative women >= 70 years of age with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. We sought to assess the impact of tumor stage and grade on nodal positivity, and to develop a model to identify patients at low-risk of nodal positivity to aid adoption of the guideline.Methods. We identified women >= 70 years of age with HR+ cN0 invasive breast cancer in the National Cancer Database (NCDB; 2010-2013) and examined the impact of tumor stage and grade on nodal positivity to identify low-risk combinations. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to incorporate additional factors. The area under the curve (AUC) and relative risks (RR) were used to assess performance.Results. Among 71,834 cases, the pathologic nodal positivity (pN+) rate was 15.3%. We identified low-risk criteria as grade 1, cT1mi-T1c (<= 2.0 cm), or grade 2, cT1mi-T1b (<= 1.0 cm), with pN+ rates of 7.8% compared with 22.3% in patients not meeting these criteria (RR 2.86, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with pN+ status included clinical T stage, grade, and histology (each p < 0.001). The resulting model had AUC 0.70 and identified women with low predicted probability (<10%) of positive nodes, of whom 6.3% were pN+, versus 21.2% in those with predicted probability >= 10% (RR 3.34, p < 0.001).Conclusion. The simple clinical rule (grade 1, cT1mi-T1c, or grade 2, cT1mi-T1b), as well as the predictive model, both identify women at low risk of nodal positivity where SLN surgery can be omitted.

TI  - Quantifying downed coarse woody material and residual forest basal area following retention harvesting in northeastern Minnesota using Landsat sensor data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Retention harvesting shows great promise for restoring and maintaining forest structural and compositional diversity. However, economical, comprehensive monitoring is needed to advance understanding of the effectiveness of these management strategies through time. We investigate multitemporal winter Landsat sensor data (capturing snow ground cover at 7.6 cm and 106.7 cm depths) as a tool for discriminating between and providing regional estimates of both residual forest basal area (BA) and downed coarse woody material (DCWM) volume following retention harvesting in Minnesota, USA. Measurements from 34 ground plots were used with Landsat predictor variables to estimate these two biophysical forest parameters. According to similar studies, results for DCWM volume estimation are considered adequate, with an R-adj(2) = 0.54 and absolute RMSE (RMSEa) = 19.02 m(3).ha(-1). Residual forest BA estimates were similar: total BA R-adj(2) = 0.55 (RMSEa = 1.85 m(2).ha(-1)), hardwood BA R-adj(2) = 0.67 (RMSEa = 1.23 m(2).ha(-1)), and conifer BA R-adj(2) = 0.52 (RMSEa = 0.94 m(2).ha(-1)). Use of winter Landsat imagery was key to quantifying these important forest biophysical parameters-a tool that carries the potential to transform our understanding of the impact of human and natural disturbance regimes on northern forest ecosystems.

TI  - Male and female parental care in the Golden-rumped Euphonia (Euphonia cyanocephala).
T2  - Ornitologia Colombiana
M3  - Article
AB  - A single nest of the Golden-rumped Euphonia (Euphonic cyanocephala) was filmed for 72 hours near the Yanayacu Biological Station in Ecuador located in tropical montane forest. Recording was between 15-21 February 2014. We report the first observations of incubation and feeding behavior by individual parents. We use the collected observations collected during the six day period after hatching to analyze visit frequency, duration, time, and activity patterns during visits. Both male and female visited at similar rates (mean male = 20.2 [plus or minus] 1.8, mean female = 21.0 [plus or minus] 1.3 visits/day) with an alternation of visits by members of the pair the typical pattern. Only the female was observed brooding and both sexes were observed feeding two nestlings. Males were documented performing flybys, although limited observations suggest females may also display a variation of this behavior. One member of the pair would often act as a sentinel while the other was visiting the nest. Behaviors observed were consistent with other members of the Euphonia.

TI  - Formation and variation of the atmospheric heat source over the Tibetan Plateau and its climate effects
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - To cherish the memory of the late Professor Duzheng YE on what would have been his 100th birthday, and to celebrate his great accomplishment in opening a new era of Tibetan Plateau (TP) meteorology, this review paper provides an assessment of the atmospheric heat source (AHS) over the TP from different data resources, including observations from local meteorological stations, satellite remote sensing data, and various reanalysis datasets. The uncertainty and applicability of these heat source data are evaluated. Analysis regarding the formation of the AHS over the TP demonstrates that it is not only the cause of the atmospheric circulation, but is also a result of that circulation. Based on numerical experiments, the review further demonstrates that land-sea thermal contrast is only one part of the monsoon story. The thermal forcing of the Tibetan-Iranian Plateau plays a significant role in generating the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), i.e., in addition to pumping water vapor from sea to land and from the lower to the upper troposphere, it also generates a subtropical monsoon-type meridional circulation subject to the angular momentum conservation, providing an ascending-air large-scale background for the development of the ASM.

TI  - Design and implementation of a Cube satellite mission for Antarctic glacier and sea ice observation
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The research for global climate changes calls for high quality satellite data and imageries regarding the Polar Regions. In recent years, the emerging Earth-Observation micro/nano satellite technology provides new data sources for polar region observations. The STU-2A, also named TW-1A, is such a nano satellite designed for polar region observation activities. It is a 3U CubeSat of 2.9 kg with a size of 30 x 10 x 10 cm carrying an Earth observation camera, launched into a Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) at 481 km with an inclination of 97.3, on September 25, 2015. During the Antarctic summer of 2015/16, it has acquired visible-light true color images with a resolution of 94 m, covering different sea and coastal regions including Amundsen Sea, Ross Sea and Vincennes Bay. These images were used to analyze the change of glacier and sea ice, compared and calibrated with reference to the publically available MODIS images with a resolution of 250 m. As the camera was specially designed for the Polar regions which have an environment of low solar elevation angle and high surface reflectance, it eliminates the oversaturation problem of the MODIS sensors and can provide high quality images. Based on data analysis and assessment, it is confirmed that this satellite data can meet the demand of glacier and sea ice observation. This paper presents the Cubesat system design and configuration, the payload camera design, and its application in Antarctic glacier and sea ice observation.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties over China from RAMS-CMAQ Model Compared with CALIOP Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The horizontal and vertical distributions of aerosol optical properties over China in 2013-2015 were investigated using RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System)-CMAQ (Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality) simulations and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations. To better understand the performance of the RAMS-CMAQ model over China, comparisons with the ground-based Sun photometers AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers) data and the on-board Lidar CALIOP were used for comprehensive evaluations, which could characterize the abilities of the model to simulate the spatial and vertical distributions of the AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) as well as the optical properties for four seasons. Several high value areas (e.g., the Sichuan Basin, Taklamakan Desert, North China Plain, and Yangtze River Delta) were found over China during the study period, with the maximum mean AOD (CALIOP: similar to 0.7; RAMS-CMAQ: >1) in the Sichuan district. Compared with AODs of AERONET, both the CALIOP and RAMS-CMAQ AODs were underestimated, but the RAMS-CMAQ data show a better correlation with AERONET (AERONET vs. RAMS-CMAQ R: 0.69, AERONET vs. CALIOP R: 0.5). The correlation coefficients between RAMS-CMAQ and CALIOP are approximately 0.6 for all four seasons. The AEC (Aerosol Extinction Coefficient) vertical profiles over major cities and their cross sections exhibit two typical features: (1) most of the AEC peaks occurred in the lowest similar to 0.5 km, decreasing with increasing altitude; and (2) the RAMS-CMAQ AEC underestimated the region with high AODs in the northwest of China and overestimated the region with high AODs in the east-central plain and the central basin regions. The major difference in the AEC values of RAMS-CMAQ and CALIOP is mainly caused by the level of relative humidity and the hygroscopic growth effects of water-soluble aerosols, especially, in the Sichuan district. In general, both the column and vertical RAMS-CMAQ aerosol optical properties could be supplemented efficiently when satellite observations are not available or invalid over China in the applications of climate change and air pollution.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation cover in Chongqing between 2001 and 2010 using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we applied asymmetric Gaussian function fitting to reconstruct a high-qualityMODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset. Following this, we retrieved vegetation cover data from the Chongqing area between 2001 and 2010 using this dataset, applying a dimidiate pixel method. We then used several analytical indices to analyze spatial and temporal changes and trends related to these changes. We determined that a reconstruction of the MODIS NDVI dataset using asymmetric Gaussian fitting in conjunction with a data quality weight coefficient improved data quality and created a foundation for accurate estimations of vegetation cover. We also determined that vegetation cover in the Chongqing area decreased gradually from east to west. During the 10-year study period, vegetation cover in the Chongqing area generally increased, changing from low to high coverage. This increase in vegetation cover was mainly the result of ecological protection policies and improving climate conditions. We also found that changes in vegetation cover were mainly the result of urban construction and afforestation initiatives, but vegetation cover improved overall.

TI  - High-Resolution Satellite Observations of a New Hazard of Golden Tides Caused by Floating Sargassum in Winter in the Yellow Sea
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new marine hazard of golden tides caused by floating brown macroalgae-Sargassum occurred in the Yellow Sea in December 2016. An economic loss of 0.5 billion CNY (about U.S. $73 million) was estimated due to the damaged seaweed aquaculture in the Jiangsu Shoal, China. In this letter, images from the new Chinese satellite of Gaofen (GF) with high-resolution optical cameras are used to retrieve the drifting path of floating Sargassum and its origin. A southward drifting path of floating Sargassum in the western Yellow Sea is identified for the first time, and the initial site of bloom occurrence is near the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, China, implying the origin of this hazard of floating Sargassum. The scale of this Sargassum bloom event in the Jiangsu Shoal is also evaluated using a linear-mixing model suitable for high-resolution images. The result shows that the total area of Sargassum-containing pixels in the GF-1 wide-field-of-view images on December 31, 2016 was more than 46 km(2), and according to the estimation by the linear-mixing model, the total area of sea surface completely covered by Sargassum was above 8.8 km(2). The approach and the results presented in this letter should contribute to the future study and management of golden tides in Chinese coastal waters.

TI  - Nominal 30-m Cropland Extent Map of Continental Africa by Integrating Pixel-Based and Object-Based Algorithms Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite-derived cropland extent map at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) is a must for food and water security analysis. Precise and accurate global cropland extent maps, indicating cropland and non-cropland areas, are starting points to develop higher-level products such as crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), cropping intensities (e.g., single, double, or continuous cropping), crop types, cropland fallows, as well as for assessment of cropland productivity (productivity per unit of land), and crop water productivity (productivity per unit of water). Uncertainties associated with the cropland extent map have cascading effects on all higher-level cropland products. However, precise and accurate cropland extent maps at high spatial resolution over large areas (e.g., continents or the globe) are challenging to produce due to the small-holder dominant agricultural systems like those found in most of Africa and Asia. Cloud-based geospatial computing platforms and multi-date, multi-sensor satellite image inventories on Google Earth Engine offer opportunities for mapping croplands with precision and accuracy over large areas that satisfy the requirements of broad range of applications. Such maps are expected to provide highly significant improvements compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser in resolution, and often fail to capture fragmented small-holder farms especially in regions with high dynamic change within and across years. To overcome these limitations, in this research we present an approach for cropland extent mapping at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) using the 10-day, 10 to 20-m, Sentinel-2 data in combination with 16-day, 30-m, Landsat-8 data on Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, nominal 30-m resolution satellite imagery composites were created from 36,924 scenes of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images for the entire African continent in 2015-2016. These composites were generated using a median-mosaic of five bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, NDVI) during each of the two periods (period 1: January-June 2016 and period 2: July-December 2015) plus a 30-m slope layer derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation dataset. Second, we selected Cropland/Non-cropland training samples (sample size = 9791) from various sources in GEE to create pixel-based classifications. As supervised classification algorithm, Random Forest (RF) was used as the primary classifier because of its efficiency, and when over-fitting issues of RF happened due to the noise of input training data, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to compensate for such defects in specific areas. Third, the Recursive Hierarchical Segmentation (RHSeg) algorithm was employed to generate an object-oriented segmentation layer based on spectral and spatial properties from the same input data. This layer was merged with the pixel-based classification to improve segmentation accuracy. Accuracies of the merged 30-m crop extent product were computed using an error matrix approach in which 1754 independent validation samples were used. In addition, a comparison was performed with other available cropland maps as well as with LULC maps to show spatial similarity. Finally, the cropland area results derived from the map were compared with UN FAO statistics. The independent accuracy assessment showed a weighted overall accuracy of 94%, with a producer's accuracy of 85.9% (or omission error of 14.1%), and user's accuracy of 68.5% (commission error of 31.5%) for the cropland class.The total net cropland area (TNCA) of Africa was estimated as 313 Mha for the nominal year 2015. The online product, referred to as the Global Food Security-support Analysis Data @ 30-m for the African Continent, Cropland Extent product (GFSAD30AFCE) is distributed through the NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) as (available for download by 10 November 2017 or earlier): https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30AFCE.001 and can be viewed at https://croplands.org/app/map. Causes of uncertainty and limitations within the crop extent product are discussed in detail.

TI  - Warming effect of dust aerosols modulated by overlapping clouds below
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the substantial warming effect of dust aerosols overlying clouds and its poor representation in climate models, it is imperative to accurately quantify the direct radiative forcing (DRF) of above-cloud dust aerosols. When absorbing aerosol layers are located above clouds, the warming effect of aerosols strongly depends on the cloud macro- and micro-physical properties underneath, such as cloud optical depth and cloud fraction at visible wavelength. A larger aerosol-cloud overlap is believed to cause a larger warming effect of absorbing aerosols, but the influence of overlapping cloud fraction and cloud optical. depth remains to be explored. In this study, the impact of overlapping cloud properties on the shortwave all-sky DRF due to springtime above-cloud dust aerosols is quantified over northern Pacific Ocean based on 10-year satellite measurements. On average, the DRF is roughly 0.62 Wm(-2). Furthermore, the warming effect of dust aerosols linearly increases with both overlapping cloud fraction and cloud optical depth. An increase of 1% in overlapping cloud fraction will amplify this warming effect by 1.11 Wm(-2)tau(-1). For the springtime northern Pacific Ocean, top-of-atmosphere cooling by dust aerosols turns into warming when overlapping cloud fraction is beyond 0.20. The variation of critical cloud optical depth beyond which dust aerosols switch from exerting a net cooling to a net warming effect depends on the concurrent overlapping cloud fraction. When the overlapping cloud coverage range increases from 0.2 to -0.4 to 0.6-0.8, the corresponding critical cloud optical depth reduces from 6.92 to 1.16. Our results demonstrate the importance of overlapping cloud properties for determining the springtime warming effect of dust aerosols. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Data Synergy between Altimetry and L-Band Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for the Retrieval of Sea Ice Parameters-A Theoretical Study of Methodology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the sea ice parameters, including the thickness and the snow depth over sea ice, are key to both climate change studies and operational forecast in polar regions. The estimation of these parameters mainly relies on satellite based remote sensing, and current retrieval algorithms usually focus on the retrieval of a single parameter under simple assumptions over the other. In this article, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth through the data synergy two types of concurrent observations of the sea ice cover: the active altimetry and the L-band passive remote sensing. The data synergy is based on two physical constrains: (1) L-band (1.4 GHz) radiation model for the sea ice cover, and (2) the hydrostatic equilibrium as used in satellite altimetry. Two schemes of data synergy are proposed: (1) the synergy between L-band brightness temperature (TB) from passive microwave remote sensing and sea ice freeboard (FBice) as measured by radar altimetry, and (2) the synergy between L-band TB and snow freeboard (FBsnow) as measured by laser altimetry. Based on retrievability studies, we show that both parameters can be retrieved using the two sets of data. Specifically, we show that there is potential problem of ill-posedness for the synergy between L-band TB and FBsnow, with two possible retrieval solutions for a small portion of the solution space. On the other hand, the synergy between L-band TB and FBice is always well-posed. In terms of sensitivity, lower uncertainty is witnessed for thin ice for the retrieval with FBice, while the retrieval with FBsnow shows advantage for thick ice. Besides the input parameters of TB, FBice and FBsnow, the uncertainty associated with certain model parameters such as snow and ice densities is not negligible for the uncertainty estimation of the retrieved parameters. Verification is carried out with observational data from Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns and SMOS satellite, showing that both sea ice thickness and snow depth can be attained by the proposed retrieval algorithms. These algorithms serve as the basis for large-scale retrieval with satellite remote sensing data, including concurrent observation of the Arctic Ocean by independent satellite campaigns such as SMOS, CryoSat-2 and ICESat.

TI  - Impacts of park landscape structure on thermal environment using QuickBird and Landsat images
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks composed mostly of vegetation and water bodies can effectively mitigate the urban heat island effect. Many studies have investigated the cooling effects of urban parks; however, little attention has been given to park landscape structure. Based on landscape metrics, this study has explored the influences of the park landscape structure on its inner thermal environment, taking heavily urbanized Beijing Municipality in China as the study area. Three indices, including the percentage of landscape (PLAND), landscape shape index (LSI) and aggregation index (AI), were used to measure the composition and configuration characteristics of the landscape components inside the parks. The indices were calculated for five landscape types being interpreted from Quickbird images. Urban thermal conditions were measured using the land surface temperature (LST) derived from Landsat TM images. The results showed that the park LST had a negative relationship with the park size, but no significant relationship was found with park shape. For the park's interior landscape, however, the configuration and composition characteristics of the landscape components inside the park explained 70% of the park LST variance. The area percentage of water bodies and the aggregation index of woodland were identified as the key influencing characteristics. In addition, when the composition and configuration characteristics of the park landscape components were separately considered, the configuration characteristics (LSI and AI) explained approximately 54% of the variance in park LST, which was comparable with that explained by the composition characteristics (PLAND). Thus, this study suggested that an effective and practical way for urban cooling park design is the optimization of spatial configuration of landscape components inside the park.

TI  - A Novel Diffuse Fraction-Based Two-Leaf Light Use Efficiency Model: An Application Quantifying Photosynthetic Seasonality Across 20 AmeriFlux Flux Tower Sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diffuse radiation can increase canopy light use efficiency (LUE). This creates the need to differentiate the effects of direct and diffuse radiation when simulating terrestrial gross primary production (GPP). Here, we present a novel GPP model, the diffuse-fraction-based two-leaf model (DTEC), which includes the leaf response to direct and diffuse radiation, and treats maximum LUE for shaded leaves (epsilon(msh) defined as a power function of the diffuse fraction (D-f)) and sunlit leaves (epsilon(msu) defined as a constant) separately. An Amazonian rainforest site (KM67) was used to calibrate the model by simulating the linear relationship between monthly canopy LUE and Df. This showed a positive response of forest GPP to atmospheric diffuse radiation, and suggested that diffuse radiation was more limiting than global radiation and water availability for Amazon rainforest GPP on a monthly scale. Further evaluation at 20 independent AmeriFlux sites showed that the DTEC model, when driven by monthly meteorological data and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) products, explained 70% of the variability observed in monthly flux tower GPP. This exceeded the 51% accounted for by the MODIS 17A2 big-leaf GPP product. The DTEC model's explicit accounting for the impacts of diffuse radiation and soil water stress along with its parameterization for C4 and C3 plants was responsible for this difference. The evaluation of DTEC at Amazon rainforest sites demonstrated its potential to capture the unique seasonality of higher GPP during the diffuse radiation-dominated wet season. Our results highlight the importance of diffuse radiation in seasonal GPP simulation.

TI  - The Cooling Effect of Urban Parks and Its Monthly Variations in a Snow Climate City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks have been shown to form park cool islands (PCIs), which can effectively alleviate the negative influences of urban heat islands (UHI). However, few studies have examined the detailed characteristics of PCIs, the effect of urban park features on their individual temperatures, and monthly variation in PCIs. Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from Landsat 8 TIR images between May and October were used to represent the thermal environment. Urban park characteristics were extracted from high-resolution GF-2 images. Using these datasets, the relationships between urban park characteristics and PCIs were explored in this study using Changchun, which has a snow climate, as a case study. The results showed the following: (1) the urban parks exhibited a cooling island effect, and the PCIs showed significant monthly variations with the highest intensities in the hot months; (2) the effects of composition (e.g., park size and the percentage of water area) on LSTs and PCIs showed significant monthly variability and were stronger than the configuration effects. Furthermore, an unexpected, negative correlation between PCIs and the area of park grass was also found; and (3) larger parks tended to have stronger PCI intensities and extents of influence. For parks larger than 30 ha, the cooling effects extended approximately 480 m from the park edge between June and August. For all of parks during the study duration, the rate of temperature increase was highest within 60 m from the park edge. The PCI we employ specifically in this study is characterized by LST.

TI  - Nonlinear Variations of Net Primary Productivity and Its Relationship with Climate and Vegetation Phenology, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. In this study, NPP was estimated based on two models and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spaectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The spatiotemporal patterns of NPP and the correlations with climate factors and vegetation phenology were then analyzed. Our results showed that NPP derived from MODIS performed well in China. Spatially, NPP decreased from the southeast toward the northwest. Temporally, NPP showed a nonlinear increasing trend at a national scale, but the magnitude became slow after 2004. At a regional scale, NPP in Northern China and the Tibetan Plateau showed a nonlinear increasing trend, while the NPP decreased in most areas of Southern China. The decreases in NPP were more than offset by the increases. At the biome level, all vegetation types displayed an increasing trend, except for shrub and evergreen broad forests (EBF). Moreover, a turning point year occurred for all vegetation types, except for EBF. Generally, climatic factors and Length of Season were all positively correlated with the NPP, while the relationships were much more diverse at a regional level. The direct effect of solar radiation on the NPP was larger (0.31) than precipitation (0.25) and temperature (0.07). Our results indicated that China could mitigate climate warming at a regional and/or global scale to some extent during the time period of 2001-2014.

TI  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal changes of terrestrial water storage using GRACE data in the Tarim River basin between 2002 and 2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the threat of water shortages intensifying, the need to identify the terrestrial water storage (TWS) variation in the Tarim River Basin (TRB) becomes very significant for managing its water resource. Due to the lack of large-scale hydrological data, this study employed the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) to monitor TWS variation in the TRB during the period of 2002-2015, cooperating with two statistical techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Results indicated that (1) the Tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data can be applied well in the TRB; (2) the EOF result showed that both the time series of TRMM precipitation and GRACE-derived TWS in the TRB between 2002 and 2015 were dominated by the annual signals, which were followed by the semiannual signals; (3) the linear trend for the spatially averaged GRACE-derived TWS changes exhibited an decrease of 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm/a, and the EOF result indicated a significant decrease of 4.1 +/- 1.5 mm/a in the north of TRB; (4) while the precipitation variations was the major driver for the TWS changes, the GLDAS-derived TWS (i.e., soil moisture) decrease and ground water decrease played the major role in the TWS decrease in the north of TRB for the significant correlation (P < 0.05). The changes of TWS might be linked to excessive exploitation of water resources, increased population, and shrinking water supplies, which would impact on the water level of the lakes or reservoir.

TI  - Estimation of high-resolution terrestrial evapotranspiration from Landsat data using a simple Taylor skill fusion method
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of high-resolution terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) from Landsat data is important in many climatic, hydrologic, and agricultural applications, as it can help bridging the gap between existing coarse-resolution ET products and point-based field measurements. However, there is large uncertainty among existing ET products from Landsat that limit their application. This study presents a simple Taylor skill fusion (STS) method that merges five Landsat-based ET products and directly measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) to improve the global estimation of terrestrial ET. The STS method uses a weighted average of the individual ET products and weights are determined by their Taylor skill scores (S). The validation with site-scale measurements at 206 EC flux towers showed large differences and uncertainties among the five ET products. The merged ET product exhibited the best performance with a decrease in the averaged root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 2-5 W/m(2) when compared to the individual products. To evaluate the reliability of the STS method at the regional scale, the weights of the STS method for these five ET products were determined using EC ground-measurements. An example of regional ET mapping demonstrates that the STS-merged ET can effectively integrate the individual Landsat ET products. Our proposed method provides an improved high-resolution ET product for identifying agricultural crop water consumption and providing a diagnostic assessment for global land surface models.

TI  - Viral pathogens among elderly people with acute respiratory infections in Shanghai, China: Preliminary results from a laboratory-based surveillance, 2012-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), with viral pathogens as the major contributors, are the most common illnesses worldwide, and increase the morbidity and mortality among the elderly population. The clinical and pathological features of elderly people with ARIs need to be identified for disease intervention. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, respiratory specimens from patients above 60 years old with ARIs were collected from the outpatient and inpatient settings of six sentinel hospitals in Pudong New Area. Each specimen was tested via multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for eight target viral etiologies including influenza, human rhinovirus (HRV), human para-influenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoVs), and human bocavirus (hBoV). A total of 967 elderly patients with ARIs were enrolled, including 589 (60.91%) males, and the median age was 73 years old. 306 (31.64%) patients were tested positive for any one of the eight viruses, including 276 single infections and 30 coinfections. Influenza was the predominant virus (14.17%, 137/967), detected from 21.35% (76/356) of the outpatients and 9.98% (61/611) of the inpatients. Influenza infections presented two annual seasonal peaks during winter and summer. Compared with non-influenza patients, those with influenza were more likely to have fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. This study identified influenza as the leading viral pathogen among elderly with ARIs, and two seasonal epidemic peaks were observed in Shanghai. An influenza vaccination strategy needs to be advocated for the elderly population.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Estimate From Chinese Gaofen-5 Satellite Data Using Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite, the only satellite that provides the thermal infrared (TIR) sensor in the national high-resolution earth observation project of China, will observe earth surface at a spatial resolution of 40 m in four TIR channels. This paper aims at developing a new nonlinear, four-channel split-window (SW) algorithm to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from GF-5 image. In the SW algorithm, its coefficients were obtained based on several subranges of atmospheric column water vapors (CWV) under various land surface conditions, in order to remove the atmospheric effect and improve the retrieval accuracy. Results showed that the new algorithm can obtain LST with root-mean-square errors of less than 1 K. Compared with previous two-and three-channel SW algorithms, the four-channel SW algorithm obtained better results in estimating LST, especially under moist atmospheres. Methods of estimating CWV and pixel emissivity were also conducted. The sensitive analysis of LST retrieval to instrument noise and uncertainty of pixel emissivity and water vapor demonstrated the good performance of the proposed algorithm. At last, the new SW algorithm was validated using ground-measured data at six sites, and some simulated images from airborne hyperspectral TIR data.

TI  - Assessment of DDT contamination in house rat as a possible bioindicator in DDT-sprayed areas from Ethiopia and South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia and South Africa are among the few countries to still implement indoor residual spraying with dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) for malaria vector control. In this study, we investigated the levels and ecological risks of DDT and its metabolites in liver tissues of house rat, as a sentinel animal, for providing an early warning system for public health and wildlife intervention from Ethiopia and South Africa. The results showed that Sigma DDT concentration ranged from 127 to 9155 mu g/kg wet weight, and the distribution order of DDT and its metabolites in the analyzed liver samples was p,p'-DDD > p,p'-DDE >> p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, and o,p'-DDD. The risk assessment indicated a potential adverse impact on humans, especially for pregnant women and children, because they spend majority of their time in a DDT-sprayed house. The ecological assessment also showed a concern for birds of prey and amphibians like frogs. This study is the first report on DDT contamination in liver tissues of house rats from Ethiopia and South Africa, and henceforth, the data will serve as a reference data for future studies.

TI  - Applications of Satellite-Based Rainfall Estimates in Flood Inundation Modeling-A Case Study in Mundeni Aru River Basin, Sri Lanka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of Satellite Rainfall Estimate (SRE) products applied to flood inundation modelling was tested for the Mundeni Aru River Basin in eastern Sri Lanka. Three SREs (PERSIANN, TRMM, and GSMaP) were tested, with the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model used as the flood inundation model. All the SREs were found to be suitable for applying to the RRI model. The simulations created by applying the SREs were generally accurate, although there were some discrepancies in discharge due to differing precipitation volumes. The volumes of precipitation of the SREs tended to be smaller than those of the gauged data, but using a scale factor to correct this improved the simulations. In particular, the SRE, i.e., the GSMaP yielding the best simulation that correlated most closely with the flood inundation extent from the satellite data, was considered the most appropriate to apply to the model calculation. The application procedures and suggestions shown in this study could help authorities to make better-informed decisions when giving early flood warnings and making rapid flood forecasts, especially in areas where in-situ observations are limited.

TI  - Shear-wave elastography in breast ultrasonography: the state of the art
T2  - ULTRASONOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Shear-wave elastography (SWE) is a recently developed ultrasound technique that can visualize and measure tissue elasticity. In breast ultrasonography, SWE has been shown to be useful for differentiating benign breast lesions from malignant breast lesions, and it has been suggested that SWE enhances the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography, potentially improving the specificity of conventional ultrasonography using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria. More recently, not only has SWE been proven useful for the diagnosis of breast cancer, but has also been shown to provide valuable information that can be used as a preoperative predictor of the prognosis or response to chemotherapy.

TI  - Analysis of land cover and landscape change patterns in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve, China from 1972 to 2013
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For effective monitoring and protection, researchers need to analyze the trends and causes of landscape pattern change in wetlands. The present study used Geographic Information System and remote sensing technology to analyze temporal and spatial dynamics of landscape pattern and related driving forces in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in China. We used Landsat images from 1972, 1998, 2007 and 2013, and classified the landscape into six types of land cover: water body, wetland, vegetation, salinized land, desert, and other objects (i.e., Gobi and Mountain). Landscape transition matrices and change pattern analysis were used understand wetland dynamics. Our results showed that land cover had changed dramatically during 1972-2013. The spatial extent of much of the wetland areas in the ELWNNR had reduced gradually from 1972 to 2007, and wetland loss occurred more rapidly after 2007. From 1972 to 2013, 415.8 km(2) of wetland area had been lost and only 250.1 km(2) wetland area had expanded, which represents a 22% decrease in wetland area in the ELWNNR. At the same time, the landscape pattern experienced diverse changes in the Nature Reserve. The high-density human population of the region has an intensive effect on the region. Wetlands in the nature reserve have also changed with recent rapid development in the region. This study may provide scientific information for developing effective and sustainable conservation plans for the ELWNNR.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Disturbance in Lesser Khingan Mountains Using MODIS and Landsat TM Time Series from 2000 to 2011
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread changes in forest cover caused by climatological and anthropogenic factors can influence the forest ecosystem and climate system to a great extent. With the increasing availability of remote sensing data, monitoring of forest changes at high temporal resolution and on various scales is becoming more realistic. Though several methods based on time series data have been used to detect forest disturbance, there are few studies paying attention to boreal areas where the forest is significant in regulating the global carbon cycle and biogeophysical processes. In this paper, we present a robust method of Breaks Detection Based On Polynomial Model (BDPM) to track boreal (e.g. Lesser Khingan Mountains) deforestation and forest fires based on the MODIS and Landsat TM time series data. Compared with the previous methods, the BDPM offers the following advantages: (1) Fitting of the polynomial model using the seasonal variation of forests in the whole region instead of a single pixel to avoid error accumulation; (2) to avoid confusion between vegetation change due to climate changes and abrupt forest disturbances, we segmented the long-time NDVI series data into 12 seasonal cycles and simulated the temporal variations in each seasonal cycle.

TI  - Using Satellite Data for the Characterization of Local Animal Reservoir Populations of Hantaan Virus on the Weihe Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) are the main host for the Hantaan virus (HTNV), the cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in central China. It has been shown that host population density is associated with pathogen dynamics and disease risk. Thus, a higher population density of A. agrarius in an area might indicate a higher risk for an HFRS outbreak. Here, we surveyed the A. agrarius population density between 2005 and 2012 on the Weihe Plain, Shaanxi Province, China, and used this monitoring data to examine the relationships between the dynamics of A. agrarius populations and environmental conditions of crop-land, represented by remote sensing based indicators. These included the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation, net photosynthesis (PsnNet), gross primary productivity, and land surface temperature. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to detect the possible causal relationship between PsnNet, A. agrarius population density and HFRS risk. The results showed that A. agrarius was the most frequently captured species with a capture rate of 0.9 individuals per hundred trap-nights, during 96 months of trapping in the study area. The risk of HFRS was highly associated with the abundance of A. agrarius, with a 1-5-month lag. The breeding season of A. agrarius was also found to coincide with agricultural activity and seasons with high PsnNet. The SEM indicated that PsnNet had an indirect positive effect on HFRS incidence via rodents. In conclusion, the remote sensing-based environmental indicator, PsnNet, was highly correlated with HTNV reservoir population dynamics with a 3-month lag (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), and may serve as a predictor of potential HFRS outbreaks.

TI  - Molecular Cloning, Recombinant Expression and Antifungal Activity of BnCPI, a Cystatin in Ramie (<i>Boehmeria nivea</i> L.)
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytocystatins play multiple roles in plant growth, development and resistance to pests and other environmental stresses. A ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.) phytocystatin gene, designated as BnCPI, was isolated from a ramie cDNA library and its full-length cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA sequence (691 bp) consisted of a 303 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 100 amino acids with deduced molecular mass of 11.06 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 6.0. The alignment of genome DNA (accession No. MF153097) and cDNA sequences of BnCPI showed that an intron (similar to 104 bp) exists in the coding region. The BnCPI protein contains most of the highly conserved blocks including Gly(5)-Gly(6) at the N-terminal, the reactive site motif QxVxG (Q(49)V(50)V(51)S(52)G(53)), the L-79-W-80 block and the [LVI]-[AGT]-[RKE]-[FY]-[AS]-[VI]-x-[EDQV]-[HYFQ]-N (L(22)G(23)R(24) F(25)A(26)V(27) (DDH30)-D-28-H-29 N-31) block that is common among plant cystatins. BLAST analysis indicated that BnCPI is similar to cystatins from Glycine max (77%), Glycine soja (76%), Hevea brasiliensis (75%) and Ricinus communis (75%). The BnCPI was subcloned into expression vector pSmart-I and then overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as a His-tagged recombinant protein. The purified reBnCPI has a molecular mass of 11.4 kDa determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Purified reBnCPI can efficiently inhibit the protease activity of papain and ficin toward BANA (N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine-2-naphthyamide), as well as the mycelium growth of some important plant pathogenic fungi. The data further contribute to our understanding of the molecular functions of BnCPI.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of the surface albedo and other factors influencing Urumqi Glacier No. 1 in Tien Shan, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier albedo controls the surface energy budget, the variability of which affects the glacier surface melt rate and, in turn, impacts the mass balance of the glacier. During 2013 and 2014, spatial and temporal variations of albedo were investigated using 18 Landsat images of Urumqi Glacier No. 1. Factors influencing these spatiotemporal profiles were analyzed. An established retrieval process, including geolocation, radiometric calibration, atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropic correction and narrow-to broadband conversion, was applied for the first time to Landsat-8 images. Differences between Landsat image derived albedo values and albedo values measured using a handheld spectroradiometer ranged from -0.024 to 0.049. Spatial and temporal variations of surface albedo were significant, especially in the ablation area. The variability of the values of ice albedo ranged from 0.06 to 0.44 due to topographic effects and light-absorbing impurities. The results suggest that this retrieval method can be used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of surface albedo from Landsat-8 images on mountain glaciers. Moreover, as constant albedo values for ice and snow cannot be assumed, the distribution of albedo was not completely dependent on altitude under conditions of more intense ablation, and by reason of light-absorbing impurities during the melt season.

TI  - Reconstruction of cropland spatial patterns and its spatiotemporal changes over the 20th century on the Songnen Plain, Northeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We initially estimated the cropland area at county level using local historical documents for the Songnen Plain (SNP) in the 1910s and 1930s. We then allocated this cropland area to grid cells with a size of 1 km x 1 km, using a range of cultivation possibilities from high to low; this was based on topography and minimum distances to rivers, settlements, and traffic lines. Cropland areas for the 1950s were obtained from the Land Use Map of Northeast China, and map vectorization was performed with ArcGIS technology. Cropland areas for the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s were retrieved from Landsat images. We found that the cropland areas were 4.92 x 10(4) km(2) and 7.60 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for 22.8% and 35.2% of the total area of the SNP in the 1910s and 1930s, respectively, which increased to 13.14 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for 60.9% in the 2010s. The cropland increased at a rate of 1.18 x 10(4) km(2) per decade from the 1910s to 1970s while it was merely 0.285 x 10(4) km(2) per decade from the 1970s to 2010s. From the 1910s to 1930s, new cultivation mainly occurred in the central SNP while, from the 1930s to 1970s, it was mainly over the western and northern parts. This spatially explicit reconstruction could be offered as primary data for studying the effects of changes in human-induced land cover based on climate change over the last century.

AB  - For an optical satellite link, the error sources that influence the pointing accuracy of the terminals include the attitude estimation error, ephemeris accuracy, and the boresight alignment error. It means an uncertainty cone (UC) exists for the spatial acquisition process. The acquisition process is a continuous adjustment for the visual axis of the two communication terminals, to enable them to detect the light signal from the other end, and finally realize the light closed loop. Beaconless acquisition algorithm and the corresponding acquisition process, modeling for spiral scan pattern and the simulation results of staring-scanning mode are presented. The UC scan range is 5 mrad, through the overlap with a spot divergence angle of 80 mu rad, the total acquisition time is 98 s. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties and Direct Radiative Effects over Central China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Central China is important for aerosols and climate because it is among the worst regions for air pollution in China. However, it is understudied due to a lag in establishing an atmospheric monitoring network. So we did a comprehensive analysis using multiple techniques to improve the understanding of aerosol optical properties and their radiative effect in this region. The results showed that high aerosol optical depth (AOD) was generally found in the northern and central parts, whereas low values were observed in the southern and western parts. Most regions were predominantly loaded with small aerosol particles and a significant influence of long-distance transported dust was found in springtime. A strong and significantly decreasing trend was observed with a maximum decrease rate of -0.08 per year in the northern and western parts, related to the decreasing emission of aerosols and increasing rainfall. Aerosol optical properties and radiative effects were compared between an urban site, Wuhan, and a rural site, Dengfeng. The seasonal variations of AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE) are similar for Wuhan and Dengfeng, but both values are larger in Wuhan than in Dengfeng. A greater dominance of coarse-mode and absorbing aerosols was found over Dengfeng. Annual averaged aerosol radiative effect (ARE) in shortwave spectrum (ARE(SW)) and its efficiency (REE) are -48.01 W/m(2) and -51.38 W/m(2), respectively, in Wuhan, -40.02 W/m(2) and -53.26 W/m(2), respectively, in Dengfeng. The dependence of REE on aerosol absorptive and size properties was studied; the results showed that REE was strongly influenced by the aerosol absorptivity and size of fine-mode particles, but there was not a strong correlation between REE and AE. The percentage of ARE in visible spectrum (ARE(VIS)) in ARE(SW) in Wuhan was 3% lower than in Dengfeng. The ARE(VIS) percentage depended largely on aerosol particle size, but was less influenced by aerosol absorptivity.

AB  - Aimed to evaluate the effects of sandy coast regulation, satellite remote sensing images of GF-1 and Spot 5 were employed to monitor landscape pattern of Yueliangwan before and after coastal regulation. Some evaluation indices such as beach index, bathing region index, dominant index, landscape biodiversity index and landscape change index were established to evaluate effects of sandy coast regulation. The results showed that the beach area increased after protecting- shoal project and the beach index was 2.44. The bathing and recreation water area shows small increase with suitable bathing region index 1.10. The functional region was divided into YueliangLake park, gulf recreation sub -region, Shanhai square sub-region, agricultural eco tourism resort and coastal leisure sub -region, and their dominant index added obviously after coastal spatial arrangement. The landscape pattern changed and landscape biodiversity enhanced after coastal landscaped, companying with the landscape index of 1.13 and landscape change index of 0.30.

TI  - Surface Water Extraction From Landsat 8 OLI Imagery Using the LBV Transformation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water extraction from remote sensing images is crucial for monitoring water resources and studying global environmental change. This study introduced amethod for surface water extraction based on the LBV transformation (WE-LBV) from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. To avoid inadequate or redundant utilization of remote sensing data, input band combinations were selected using the band index method, and the LBV transformation equations for OLI images were subsequently derived. Characteristics of water and nonwater pixels were investigated after the LBV transformation. The established extraction rule stated that pixels should be classified as water if the B value is larger than the V value. For validation, the WE-LBV was used to extract water pixels from OLI images covering different water types and outside conditions and compared with other water indices on the global scale. Results showed that the producer accuracy (95.75%) and user accuracy (99.15%) of the WE-LBV were more stable and its overall accuracy (98.02%) and Kappa coefficient (0.9582) were higher than those of other methods. The WE-LBV classified shallow water and shadow pixels accurately, whereas other methods had problems. Water pixels with different colors and mixed pixels with water percentage higher than 80% could be extracted by the WE-LBV effectively. The WE-LBV did not require manually selected threshold, thus avoiding the effect of subjective human factors. Therefore, the WE-LBV is proposed as an accurate, simple, and robust method for surface water extraction, especially in situations when surface water needs to be identified in bulk automatically and accurately.

TI  - Detecting Historical Vegetation Changes in the Dunhuang Oasis Protected Area Using Landsat Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given its proximity to an artificial oasis, the Donghu Nature Reserve in the Dunhuang Oasis has faced environmental pressure and vegetation disturbances in recent decades. Satellite vegetation indices (VIs) can be used to detect such changes in vegetation if the satellite images are calibrated to surface reflectance (SR) values. The aim of this study was to select a suitable VI based on the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) products and the absolute radiation-corrected results of Landsat L1T images to detect the spatio-temporal changes in vegetation for the Donghu Reserve during 1986-2015. The results showed that the VI difference (VI) images effectively reduced the changes in the source images. Compared with the other VIs, the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) displayed greater robustness to atmospheric effects in the two types of SR images and was more responsive to vegetation changes caused by human factors. From 1986 to 2015, the positive changes in vegetation dominated the overall change trend, with changes in vegetation in the reserve decreasing during 1990-1995, increasing until 2005-2010, and then decreasing again. The vegetation changes were mainly distributed at the edge of the artificial oasis outside the reserve. The detected changes in vegetation in the reserve highlight the increased human pressure on the reserve.

TI  - Mapping mangrove forests using multi-tidal remotely-sensed data and a decision-tree-based procedure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests grow in intertidal zones in tropical and subtropical regions and have suffered a dramatic decline globally over the past few decades. Remote sensing data, collected at various spatial resolutions, provide an effective way to map the spatial distribution of mangrove forests over time. However, the spectral signatures of mangrove forests are significantly affected by tide levels. Therefore, mangrove forests may not be accurately mapped with remote sensing data collected during a single-tidal event, especially if not acquired at low tide. This research reports how a decision-tree based procedure was developed to map mangrove forests using multi tidal Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Three indices, including the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NEVILNDMIH (the multiplication of NDVIL by NDMIH, L: low tide level, H: high tide level) were used in this algorithm to differentiate mangrove forests from other land-cover and land-use types in Fangchenggang City, China. Additionally, the recent Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data were selected to validate the results and compare if the methodology is reliable. The results demonstrate that short-term multi-tidal remotely sensed data better represent the unique nearshore coastal wetland habitats of mangrove forests than single-tidal data. Furthermore, multi-tidal remotely-sensed data has led to improved accuracies using two classification approaches: i.e. decision trees and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Since mangrove forests are typically found at low elevations, the inclusion of elevation data in the two classification procedures was tested. Given the decision-tree method does not assume strict data distribution parameters, it was able to optimize the application of multi-tidal and elevation data, resulting in higher classification accuracies of mangrove forests. When using multi-source data of differing types and distributions to map mangrove forests, a decision-tree method appears to be superior to traditional statistical classifiers.

TI  - Development of an Evapotranspiration Data Assimilation Technique for Streamflow Estimates: A Case Study in a Semi-Arid Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow estimates are substantially important as fresh water shortages increase in arid and semi-arid regions where evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant contribution to the water balance. In this regard, evapotranspiration data can be assimilated into a distributed hydrological model (SWAT, Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for improving streamflow estimates. The SWAT model has been widely used for streamflow estimations, but the applications combining SWAT and ET products were rare. Thus, this study aims to develop a SWAT-based evapotranspiration data assimilation system. In particular, SWAT is gridded at Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU) level to incorporate gridded ET products acquired from the remote sensing-based ETMonitor model. In the modeling case, Gridded SWAT (GSWAT) shows a good agreement of streamflow modeling with the original SWAT. Such a scant margin between them is due to the modeling domain mismatch caused by different HRU delineations. In the ET assimilation case, we carry out a synthetic data experiment to illustrate the state augmentation Direct Insertion (DI) method and a real data experiment for the upper Heihe River Basin. The results demonstrate the benefits of the ET assimilation for improving hydrologic processes representations. In the future, more remotely sensed data can be assimilated into the data assimilation system to provide more reliable hydrological predictions.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation Analysis of Snow Cover Using MODIS over Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during 2003-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) snow cover information acquisition of the high precision spatial and temporal characteristics is of great significance for the research on its land surface atmosphere coupled system and global climate change effects. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1) have been widely used in long time series of spatial and temporal variation analysis, but they are limited to be used because of high cloud cover ratio. In this paper, a 7-day rolling combination algorithm was presented to eliminate cloud obscuration, and the whole cloud amount falls below 7 %. The ground station in situ measurements verify that the overall precision is more than 90 %. The presented algorithm guaranteed the same spatial resolution and temporal resolution, and has higher precision than products MOD10A1 and MYD10A1. The MODIS 7-day rolling combination snow cover datasets products were obtained between 2003 and 2014 in the QTP, and the snow cover area of spatial and temporal variation was analyzed. The change characteristics of snow cover duration was also studied combining with the Digital Elevation Model data. Results show that the snow cover area of the whole QTP has a slowly decreased trend, but increases in autumn. Thus, the snow cover proportion of annual periodic and unstable in different elevations has the highest correlation with area of the elevation.

TI  - A Modified Multi-Source Parallel Model for Estimating Urban Surface Evapotranspiration Based on ASTER Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, little attention has been given to remote sensing-based algorithms for inferring urban surface evapotranspiration. A multi-source parallel model based on ASTER data was one of the first examples, but its accuracy can be improved. We therefore present a modified multi-source parallel model in this study, which has made improvements in parameterization and model accuracy. The new features of our modified model are: (1) a characterization of spectrally heterogeneous urban impervious surfaces using two endmembers (high- and low-albedo urban impervious surface), instead of a single endmember, in linear spectral mixture analysis; (2) inclusion of an algorithm for deriving roughness length for each land surface component in order to better approximate to the actual land surface characteristic; and (3) a novel algorithm for calculating the component net radiant flux with a full consideration of the fraction and the characteristics of each land surface component. HJ-1 and ASTER data from the Chinese city of Hefei were used to test our model's result with the China-ASEAN ET product. The sensitivity of the model to vegetation and soil fractions was analyzed and the applicability of the model was tested in another built-up area in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. We conclude that our modified model outperforms the initial multi-source parallel model in accuracy. It can obtain the highest accuracy when applied to vegetation-dominated (vegetation proportion > 50%) areas. Sensitivity analysis shows that vegetation and soil fractions are two important parameters that can affect the ET estimation. Our model is applicable to estimate evapotranspiration in other urban areas.

TI  - A Simplified Method for Retrieving Aerosol Optical Thickness Using Visibility Data Between 1980 and 2014, A Case Study in China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of long-term variations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is essential to understand the climate change and earth radiation budget. A simplified method was developed in this study to derive the AOT using more than thirty-year surface visibility and aerosol vertical distribution from LiDAR climatology of vertical aerosol structure for space-based LiDAR simulation studies data. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) TERRA and AQUA daily measurements were used to evaluate the performance of the inferred AOT. Results show that the correlations of monthly AOT between MODIS measurements and inferred data are higher than 0.59 and the annual AOT values have stronger correlations (r > 0.82) than monthly data. The inferred AOT can capture the general spatial distribution similar to satellite images with long-term scale. The correlation of seasonal variation between two datasets is also higher than 0.77. The root mean squared error of inferred AOT relative to MODIS AOT is about 0.22 and 0.11 for monthly and yearly data, respectively. Analysis using singular value decomposition shows that the inferred AOT is consistent with MODIS measurements during 2002-2014 spatially and temporally. The average annual AOT in over 200 stations in China between 1980 and 2014 shows generally upward trends. Results from this paper can be used for further analysis of the aerosol effects on climate change in a regional scale.

TI  - Surveillance imaging following treatment of head and neck cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Post-treatment surveillance is an important component in the treatment of head and neck cancers, especially as the proportion of human papilloma virus-positive cancers increases. Early detection of recurrences or second malignancies can increase success and minimize the toxicity of salvage treatment. Unfortunately, there are no consensus guidelines on the frequency and modality of post-treatment imaging. Computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) all have unique advantages and disadvantages when used as surveillance imaging. There is evidence that PET-CT may be the most sensitive of these modalities, but further research is needed to show an improvement in patient outcomes. Institutions will benefit most from a surveillance plan that is consistent and tailored to the individualized needs of their patients. This review focuses on the available evidence for different imaging modalities and general guidelines for developing an institution-specific practice pattern. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mapping Fine Spatial Resolution Precipitation from TRMM Precipitation Datasets Using an Ensemble Learning Method and MODIS Optical Products in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation data are important for the fields of hydrology and meteorology, and are fundamental for ecosystem monitoring and climate change research. Satellite-based precipitation products are already able to provide high temporal resolution precipitation information at a global level. However, the coarse spatial resolution has restricted their use in regional level studies. In this study, monthly fine spatial resolution land precipitation data in China was obtained by downscaling the TRMM 3B43 V7 monthly precipitation products. The downscaling model was constructed based on the ensemble learning method called random forest (RF). In addition to the RF model, the classification and regression tree (CART) model was also used to downscale the precipitation data for the purpose of comparison. The results were validated with in situ measurements. Results showed that the RF model outperformed the CART model. The downscaled precipitation data were strongly correlated with the in situ measurements. The downscaling method was applied to mapping fine spatial resolution precipitation over all of China, and is valuable for developing high spatial resolution precipitation products for studies on hydrology, meteorology, and climate science.

TI  - A method for alpine wetland delineation and features of border: Zoig Plateau, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate wetland delineation is the basis of wetland definition and mapping, and is of great importance for wetland management and research. The Zoig Plateau on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was used as a research site for research on alpine wetland delineation. Several studies have analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern and dynamics of these alpine wetlands, but none have addressed the issues of wetland boundaries. The objective of this work was to discriminate the upper boundaries of alpine wetlands by coupling ecological methods and satellite observations. The combination of Landsat 8 images and supervised classification was an effective method for rapid identification of alpine wetlands in the Zoig Plateau. Wet meadow was relatively stable compared with hydric soils and wetland hydrology and could be used as a primary indicator for discriminating the upper boundaries of alpine wetlands. A slope of less than 4.5A degrees could be used as the threshold value for wetland delineation. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 434 field sites showed that a threshold value of 0.3 could distinguish grasslands from emergent marsh and wet meadow in September. The median normalized difference water index (NDWI) of emergent marsh remained more stable than that of wet meadow and grasslands during the period from September until July of the following year. The index of mean density in wet meadow zones was higher than the emergent and upland zones. Over twice the number of species occurred in the wet meadow zone compared with the emergent zone, and close to the value of upland zone. Alpine wetlands in the three reserves in 2014 covered 1175.19 km(2) with a classification accuracy of 75.6%. The combination of ecological methods and remote sensing technology will play an important role in wetland delineation at medium and small scales. The correct differentiation between wet meadow and grasslands is the key to improving the accuracy of future wetland delineation.

TI  - Wuhan Surface Subsidence Analysis in 2015-2016 Based on Sentinel-1A Data by SBAS-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) acquisition mode of Sentinel-1A provides a wide coverage per acquisition and features a repeat cycle of 12 days, making this acquisition mode attractive for surface subsidence monitoring. A few studies have analyzed wide-coverage surface subsidence of Wuhan based on Sentinel-1A data. In this study, we investigated wide-area surface subsidence characteristics in Wuhan using 15 Sentinel-1A TOPS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 11 April 2015 to 29 April 2016 with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS InSAR) technique. The Sentinel-1A SBAS InSAR results were validated by 110 leveling points at an accuracy of 6 mm/year. Based on the verified SBAS InSAR results, prominent uneven subsidence patterns were identified in Wuhan. Specifically, annual average subsidence rates ranged from -82 mm/year to 18 mm/year in Wuhan, and maximum subsidence rate was detected in Houhu areas. Surface subsidence time series presented nonlinear subsidence with pronounced seasonal variations. Comparative analysis of surface subsidence and influencing factors (i.e., urban construction, precipitation, industrial development, carbonate karstification and water level changes in Yangtze River) indicated a relatively high spatial correlation between locations of subsidence bowl and those of engineering construction and industrial areas. Seasonal variations in subsidence were correlated with water level changes and precipitation. Surface subsidence in Wuhan was mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities, compressibility of soil layer, carbonate karstification, and groundwater overexploitation. Finally, the spatial-temporal characteristics of wide-area surface subsidence and the relationship between surface subsidence and influencing factors in Wuhan were determined.

TI  - Effects of Urban Expansion on Forest Loss and Fragmentation in Six Megaregions, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion has significant effects on forest loss and fragmentation. Previous studies mostly focused on how the amount of developed land affected forest loss and fragmentation, but neglected the impacts of its spatial pattern. This paper examines the effects of both the amount and spatial pattern of urban expansion on forest loss and fragmentation. We conducted a comparison study in the six largest urban megaregions in China-Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), Wuhan (WH), Chengdu-Chongqing (CY), and Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZT) urban megaregions. We first quantified both the magnitude and speed of urban expansion, and forest loss and fragmentation from 2000 to 2010. We then examined the relationships between urban expansion and forest loss and fragmentation by Pearson correlation and partial correlation analysis using the prefecture city as the analytical unit. We found: (1) urban expansion was a major driver of forest loss in the CZT, PRD, and CY megaregions, with 34.05%, 22.58%, and 19.65% of newly-developed land converted from forests. (2) Both the proportional cover of developed land and its spatial pattern (e.g., patch density) had significant impacts on forest fragmentation at the city level. (3) Proportional cover of developed land was the major factor for forest fragmentation at the city level for the PRD and YRD megaregions, but the impact of the spatial pattern of developed land was more important for the BTH and WH megaregions.

TI  - Integrating Cellular Automata with the Deep Belief Network for Simulating Urban Growth
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable urban development is a focus of regional policy makers; therefore, how to measure and understand urban growth is an important research topic. This paper quantified the amount of urban growth on land use maps that were derived from multi-temporal Landsat images of Jiaxing City as a rapidly-growing city in Zhejiang Province from 2000-2015. Furthermore, a new approach coupled the heuristic bat algorithm (BA) and deep belief network (DBN) with the cellular automata (CA) model (DBN-CA), which was developed to simulate the urban expansion in 2015 and forecast the distribution of urban areas of Jiaxing City in 2024. The BA was proposed to obtain the best structure of the DBN, while the optimized DBN model considered the nonlinear spatial-temporal relationship of driving forces in urban expansion. Comparisons between the DBN-CA and the conventional artificial neural network-based CA (ANN-CA) model were also performed. This study demonstrates that the proposed model is more stable and accurate than the ANN-CA model, since the minimum and maximum values of the kappa coefficient of the DBN-CA were 77.109% and 78.366%, while the ANN-CA's values were 63.460% and 76.151% over the 200 experiments, respectively. Therefore, the DBN-CA model is a potentially effective new approach to survey land use change and urban expansion and allows sustainability research to study the health of urban growth trends.

TI  - Monitoring Recent Fluctuations of the Southern Pool of Lake Chad Using Multiple Remote Sensing Data: Implications for Water Balance Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The drought episodes in the second half of the 20th century have profoundly modified the state of Lake Chad and investigation of its variations is necessary under the new circumstances. Multiple remote sensing observations were used in this paper to study its variation in the recent 25 years. Unlike previous studies, only the southern pool of Lake Chad (SPLC) was selected as our study area, because it is the only permanent open water area after the serious lake recession in 1973-1975. Four satellite altimetry products were used for water level retrieval and 904 Landsat TM/ETM+ images were used for lake surface area extraction. Based on the water level (L) and surface area (A) retrieved (with coinciding dates), linear regression method was used to retrieve the SPLC's L-A curve, which was then integrated to estimate water volume variations (DV). The results show that the SPLC has been in a relatively stable phase, with a slight increasing trend from 1992 to 2016. On annual average scale, the increase rate of water level, surface area and water volume is 0.5 cm year(-1), 0.14 km(2) year(-1) and 0.007 km(3) year(-1), respectively. As for the intra-annual variations of the SPLC, the seasonal variation amplitude of water level, lake area and water volume is 1.38 m, 38.08 km(2) and 2.00 km(3), respectively. The scatterplots between precipitation and D V indicate that there is a time lag of about one to two months in the response of water volume variations to precipitation, which makes it possible for us to predict D V. The water balance of the SPLC is significantly different from that of the entire Lake Chad. While evaporation accounts for 96% of the lake's total water losses, only 16% of the SPLC's losses are consumed by evaporation, with the other 84% offset by outflow.

TI  - A time domain solution of the Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) for continuous soil moisture monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents indexes developed from remote sensing observations for continuous soil surface moisture monitoring. The Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) proposed in our earlier work is developed using a time domain solution method rather than the traditional spatial domain solution method, because of limitations arising from a traditional temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method. In the procedure herein proposed, the MTVDI parameterization scheme is transformed from regional scale to pixel scale, and the boundary conditions defining maximum water stress are determined pixel by pixel using the surface energy balance principle. All the parameters required for the retrieval of MTVDI are pixel specific, thereby avoiding the limitations of the traditional spatial domain solution method. Previous studies demonstrate the applicability of the TVX method with data from only a few days of clear sky conditions. In contrast, our proposed MTVDI is demonstrated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the course of a full year, and the soil moisture status over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region is monitored continuously. Finally, the volumetric surface soil water content (theta(nu)) is estimated using a calibration procedure from the MTVDI retrievals. The results show that the accuracy of both MTVDI retrievals and theta(nu) estimates obtained in this work has reached a level comparable with those produced in previous studies. Across all sites, the correlation coefficient (r) between the MTVDI and theta(nu) measurements is 0.60. The values of r, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for theta(nu) estimates are 0.75, 0.019 m(3) M-3 and 0.025 m(3) m(-3), respectively.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of river hydrology on riparian vegetation spatial structure: Case study in the lower basin of the Tarim River, China
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River hydrology largely determines the species composition and spatial distribution of riparian vegetation. However, it is difficult to determine the riparian vegetation spatial pattern that is only influenced by river hydrology due to the complex impacts of other influencing factors in field environments. We investigated the spatial structure of riparian vegetation in the lower basin of the Tarim River in hyper-arid western China, where distinct geomorphic and climatic features exclude the influences of factors other than river hydrological factors on the spatial structure of riparian vegetation. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager remotely sensed data were used to identify the different vegetation types and obtain the vegetation leaf area index (LAI) in the study area. Our results showed that the overall vegetation LAI exhibited a negative exponential declining trend with distance from the river, but this relationship was different for the different vegetation types, exhibiting a negative exponential relationship for the Populus woodlands and a Gaussian-type relationship for the Tamarix shrublands. The average width of the riparian vegetation decreased along the river by a negative power function. The average vegetation LAI decreased linearly along the river. The quantitative data we obtained regarding the river-induced variation in the riparian vegetation cover with the distance from the river channel would particularly be useful for modelling riparian vegetation dynamics and distributions.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of WorldView-2 Red-Edge Band-Based Vegetation Indices for Estimation of Mangrove Leaf Area Index with Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately estimate leaf area index (LAI) in mangrove areas, the selection of appropriate models and predictor variables is critical. However, there is a major challenge in quantifying and mapping LAI using multi-spectral sensors due to the saturation effects of traditional vegetation indices (VIs) for mangrove forests. WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery has proven to be effective to estimate LAI of grasslands and forests, but the sensitivity of its vegetation indices (VIs) has been uncertain for mangrove forests. Furthermore, the single model may exhibit certain randomness and instability in model calibration and estimation accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the sensitivity of WV2 VIs for estimating mangrove LAI by comparing artificial neural network regression (ANNR), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR). The results suggest that the RFR algorithm yields the best results (RMSE = 0.45, 14.55% of the average LAI), followed by ANNR (RMSE = 0.49, 16.04% of the average LAI), and then SVR (RMSE = 0.51, 16.56% of the average LAI) algorithms using 5-fold cross validation (CV) using all VIs. Quantification of the variable importance shows that the VIs derived from the red-edge band consistently remain the most important contributor to LAI estimation. When the red-edge band-derived VIs are removed from the models, estimation accuracies measured in relative RMSE (RMSEr) decrease by 3.79%, 2.70% and 4.47% for ANNR, SVR and RFR models respectively. VIs derived from red-edge band also yield better accuracy compared with other traditional bands of WV2, such as near-infrared-1 and near-infrared-2 band. Furthermore, the estimated LAI values vary significantly across different mangrove species. The study demonstrates the utility of VIs of WV2 imagery and the selected machine-learning algorithms in developing LAI models in mangrove forests. The results indicate that the red-edge band of WV2 imagery can help alleviate the saturation problem and improve the accuracy of LAI estimation in a mangrove area.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Clusters Expansion in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, China, Using Time-Series Nighttime Light Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban clusters in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) in China include the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration, the Wuhan metropolitan area, and the Poyang Lake urban agglomeration. While previous studies of urban expansion in China focused mainly on the coastal regions, this study aimed to investigate urban expansion patterns and factors in the MRYR, which are crucial for urban development in Central China. A neighborhood statistics analysis (NSA) method and a local-optimized threshold method were used to detect urban changes during 1992-2011 from the time-series Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light (NTL) images. The evolution of urban expansion intensity and landscape metrics were analyzed at multiple spatial scales, including the whole region, urban agglomeration, and city scales. Finally, the expanded STochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model was built to explore the factors that controlled NTL intensity. The results revealed that urban areas extracted from the NTL data were consistent with those extracted from the Landsat Thematic Mapper data, with an overall accuracy of 81.74% and a Kappa of 0.40. A relatively slow urbanization pace was observed from 1992 to 2002 in the MRYR region, which then accelerated in the period of 2002 to 2007 and then slowed down between 2007 and 2011. Additionally, urban expansion exhibited a radial pattern. The results further indicated that major factors controlling NTL intensity were gross domestic product, followed by total investment in fixed assets, tertiary industry, urban construction area, non-agricultural population, and industrial output in the city clusters. The study provides important insights for further studies on the urbanization processes in the MRYR region.

TI  - Continued decrease of open surface water body area in Oklahoma during 1984-2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oklahoma contains the largest number of manmade lakes and reservoirs in the United States. Despite the importance of these open surface water bodies to public water supply, agriculture, thermoelectric power, tourism and recreation, it is unclear how these water bodies have responded to climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation in past decades. In this study, we used all available Landsat 5 and 7 images (16,000 scenes) from 1984 through 2015 and a water index-and pixel-based approach to analyze the spatial-temporal variability of open surface water bodies and its relationship with climate and water exploitation. Specifically, the areas and numbers of four water body extents (the maximum, year-long, seasonal, and average extents) were analyzed to capture variations in water body area and number. Statistically significant downward trends were found in the maximum, year-long, and annual average water body areas from 1984 through 2015. Furthermore, these decreases were mainly attributed to the continued shrinking of large water bodies (> 1 km(2)). There were also significant decreases in maximum and year-long water body numbers, which suggested that some of the water bodies were vanishing year by year. However, remarkable inter-annual variations of water body area and number were also found. Both water body area and number were positively related to precipitation, and negatively related to temperature. Surface water withdrawals mainly influenced the year-long water bodies. The smaller water bodies have a higher risk of drying under a drier climate, which suggests that small water bodies are more vulnerable under climate-warming senarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
